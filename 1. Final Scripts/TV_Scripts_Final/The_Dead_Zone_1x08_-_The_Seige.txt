  33EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

          It's a fine day, and people are out doing their business,
          among them JOHNNY, SARAH and LITTLE JOHNNY, who's running
          ahead as they walk along the sidewalk.  They find him
          waiting for them in front of the general store, next door
          to the bank, where there's a coin-operated race car ride.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                (re: the ride)
                        Mom, can I?

                                        SARAH
                        Not now, honey.  I have to stop
                        in the bank...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                          Puhleeeeze...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (pulling out a quarter)
                        Here.  It's on me.

          He smiles, holds out a quarter, but little Johnny's still
          awkward around big Johnny and hesitates, looking at his
          mother.  And it's a passing moment but an important one
          as Sarah wants so much for these two to bond and it isn't
          coming easily.

                                        SARAH
                        It's okay.

          The boy takes the quarter.

                                        SARAH
                        Say, "Thanks."

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                (mumbles)
                        Thanks.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE SIEGE - TEASER - 05/10/02 - GREEN       2.


    3CONTINUED:3

          Johnny helps him climb in the race car and starts it up
          to tinny MUSIC and LOUD ENGINE NOISES.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (ironic)
                        He's really starting to warm up
                        to me.

                                        SARAH
                        He will. 
                                (dry)
                        If you have enough quarters.

          She smiles encouragingly.

                                        SARAH
                        Think you can handle a few minutes
                        alone with him?  I've got to run
                        to the bank.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can always turn to my hand
                        animals if things start to get*
                        rough.

          He makes a dog shadow with his hand...

                                        SARAH
                                (to her son)
                        I'll be right back, Johnny.

          Little Johnny is not pleased to see her go but he's on
          his ride.  A beat after she leaves, the ride rocks him as
          he stares uncomfortably at the man his mother always hangs
          around with.  Johnny grins but feels just as uncomfortable.


  44INT. BANK - DAY

          Two tellers, KAREN HAYES (28) and TOM KELLY (23), are
          each with customers... There's a DING from the door as
          Sarah enters O.C.

                                        KAREN
                                (counting out money)
                        Ten, twenty, thirty, forty...

          As Tom finishes the transaction with his customer --

                                        TOM
                        Thank you.  Next in line please.

          The next customer, MELANIE ROMANO (35), approaches Tom's
          window.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE SIEGE - TEASER - 05/10/02 - GREEN       3.


    4CONTINUED:4

          ANGLE ON SARAH

          filling out a deposit slip... the camera wanders across
          the bank finding the GUARD (RUDY YOUNG, 55), sitting easily
          by the door... then to Vice-President and General Manager
          HENRY SPAHN (40) in the waiting area greeting an elderly
          couple MR. STRATTON and MRS. STRATTON (late 70's+).

                                        SPAHN
                        Mr. and Mrs. Stratton.  Come have
                        a seat in my office.

          As they move to his office --


          ANGLE OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE A PICKUP TRUCK

          that's seen better days pulling into the parking lot,
          going too fast over the speed bumps, HURLEY ELECTRICAL*
          CONTRACTING painted on its doors.  The truck parks in the*
          furthest space at the back of the lot.  The driver, CONRAD
          HURLEY (45), gets out.  He's wearing clean work clothes
          and carrying a big, long, heavy tool box.  He has the
          weary, self-pitying eyes, in a William Macy kind of way,
          of a man who has endured more than his share of bad luck
          and bad breaks.  He drinks but he's not drunk this morning.


          ANGLE ON TELLER WINDOWS

          As Karen's customer finishes and moves away --

                                        KAREN
                        Next please.

          Sarah smiles and walks to the counter.


          AT THE DOOR OF THE BANK

          The original two CUSTOMERS EXIT.  A moment later, Conrad
          comes in.

          DING from the door.  Security guard Rudy Young looks up
          as Conrad enters.

                                        GUARD
                          Morning, Conrad.

          Conrad pauses and looks over for an extra beat as though
          his life is flashing before his eyes and then just says
          with a certain resignation:

                                        CONRAD
                        Hey Rudy. 


          MOVING BY SARAH

          to catch just a snatch of conversation at the teller's
          booth with Karen Hayes...

                                        KAREN
                        ...to raise funds for the
                        library...

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe we could do a silent
                        auction...


          MOVING TOWARD SPAHN'S OFFICE

                                        SPAHN*
                                (to the Strattons)*
                        ...I've reviewed your Ira and*
                        Annuity accounts and you have*
                        nothing to worry about.*

          Conrad marches up to him.

                                        CONRAD
                          Henry...

          Spahn isn't happy to see Conrad but he remains
            professionally cordial.

                                        SPAHN
                        I'm busy right now, Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                          I really need to talk to you,
                        Henry.  
                                (to the Strattons)
                          Morning, Mrs. Stratton, Mr.
                          Stratton.

                        Conrad.

                        Heard from Arleta, Conrad?

          It's the kind of blunt curiosity that only old people get
          away with.  Mrs. Stratton gives her husband an embarrassed
          elbow to the side.  Mr. Stratton looks at her...

                                        CONRAD
                        No, no, I haven't heard from her,
                        Mr. Stratton.  Henry, if I could...

          Spahn grits his teeth...

                                        SPAHN
                                (to the couple)
                        I'll only be a second.

          He moves away from them...

                                        SPAHN
                        If this is about the contract,
                        there's nothing to talk about.

                                        CONRAD
                          Seventeen years I've worked in
                        this township, Henry; I... I'd
                        say I've done a pretty fair job
                        on all your electrical work,
                        haven't I...?  Henry?  Don't I
                        deserve at least the chance to...

                                        SPAHN
                        The Council voted and that's it. 
                        I'm sorry.  

          Spahn walks away from him back to the Strattons.  Conrad
          lets out a deep breath...

                                        CONRAD
                              (a sad smile)
                        Yeah.  Me too.

          He CLANGS his toolbox down on Spahn's desk.  Spahn and
          the Strattons jump and everyone else looks over.  Conrad
          opens the toolbox and takes out a short-barrel 12-gauge*
          pump action shotgun.  The Strattons' eyes go wide as Conrad*
          brandishes the gun... and although he is a man who knows*
          guns, he is no expert at bank robbery and he's scared to
          death...  

                                        CONRAD
                        Okay.  Okay.  All of you -- put
                        your hands on your heads and stand

          hands on their heads right away... others like Spahn who
          know Conrad hesitate thinking at first this isn't
          serious...

                        Rudy, come on over here with the
                        others.  And I'll need your gun. 
                        Don't try to be a hero, okay? 

                                        GUARD
                        You're calling the shots, Conrad.

          He follows the orders and crosses to Conrad with his hands
          raised but his eyes are alert and ready for an opportunity. 
          There is none.  Conrad takes the .38 revolver out of Rudy's*
          holster.

                        of you know me.  I don't want to
                        hurt anyone, okay?

                                  amazement)
                        Conrad, what are you doing?

                        What's it look like I'm doing,
                        Henry?  I'm robbing your bank.

                        Mrs. Stratton, I'm sorry but I
                        need you to put your hands on
                        your head.  If you'll all just
                        cooperate, this will be over

                        if you don't put that gun down.*

          Spahn starts to walk toward the door.  Conrad picks up*
          the gun he took from Rudy and fires it, barely missing*
          Spahn, who stops in his tracks and turns white...*

          Karen and Tom are emptying the contents of the teller

          Conrad crosses to the vault with the shotgun, watching
          Spahn open cabinets, one after another, each with its own
          key.

1111A JOHNNY FLASH - THE GUARD AND CONRAD - SLOW MOTION

          Rudy has made a move for the gun and they're struggling
          for it... it discharges... swish panning to Sarah who,
          still holding hands with Johnny on the floor, has caught
          the full force of the bullet in her chest and has fallen
            backwards...

          as Johnny sees the guard is moving back from the door...
          eyes already glancing toward Conrad whose attention is

                        Yessir.

          Conrad exchanges a suspicious glance with the guard who
          goes to sit and almost seems to guess what almost happened
          but moves back to business.  

                                        TOM
                        You want travellers checks, Conrad?

                          Travelers checks, cashiers
                          checks... the whole shebang.  And
                        if you're thinking about tracing
                        the numbers when I cash them,
                        Tom, I'll save you the trouble...
                        I'm going to Jamaica...

                                        KAREN
                        What are you gonna do in Jamaica,
                        Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                        What do you think I'm gonna do. 
                        I'm gonna sit in the sand and
                        drink co-co-no-nos.

                                        MELANIE
                        It's... it's beautiful this time
                        of year; my husband and I went on
                        our honeymoon...

          Just talking makes her lose control... she begins to shake
          and cry... Conrad sighs...

                                        CONRAD
                        Miss, miss, really, this, this
                        would be easier all around if...

                        She's scared.  Why don't you just
                        let her go.

                          please... you got an hysterical
                          customer here...

          There are four banker's boxes filled with negotiables and
            currency, and with the lids on you'd think they held
          nothing but records.  Now Spahn stacks them onto a small
          dolly and secures them with a bungee cord as Conrad slings
          the shotgun and takes the .38 from a shoulder holster*
          under his jacket.

                        You people are going to stay in
                        here and count to a thousand. 
                        Slowly.  Don't do anything stupid. 
                        It's not your money, understand?

                          Someone's coming with me...

          He scans their faces - just the eye contact with Melanie
          makes her whimper louder... he finally comes to Sarah...

                        ...you.  

          He motions for her to come forward but Johnny steps in
          front of her.

                        She's got a son.  Take me instead.

          He stands... Conrad studies him.  Unlike the others, Johnny
          doesn't seem scared -- he's not acting right.

                                        CONRAD
                        You just don't quit, do you?  Who

                        My name is Smith.  John Smith.  

          Conrad looks at him, something doesn't feel right about
          him, shakes his head, decides not to take him along...

          Conrad's shotgun blasts outside (O.S.) as a hail of bullets

          Spahn is mortally wounded...

                        I'll go with you, Conrad.

          Conrad ignores this and continues to stare at Johnny.

                        does a dumb thing like setting

                        in the truck, Henry goes free,

                        I have to tell you something

                        The Sheriff's outside.

          Conrad's whole face darkens.  Johnny is really unnerving
          him.  He shoves the gun hard into Spahn, propelling him
          forward toward the front door...

  1717AT THE FRONT WINDOW - CONRAD'S POV - EXT. BANK - DAY

          seeing squad cars and officers through the window... Walt
          is outside one of the cars, talking to Dana... little
          Johnny is led away by a female officer...

          reacts.  Now Walt and Roscoe are heading for the bank.

                        Rudy, kill the lights!


  1919MOVING WITH WALT AND ROSCOE

          as, walking, they see Spahn through the windows, lowering
          the blinds, with Conrad looking over his shoulder.  Walt
          frowns.  He knows both these men and this sure doesn't
          look right.


  2020CONRAD

          steps away from Spahn and goes to the door, letting Walt
          see the gun in his hand.


  2121EXT. BANK - DAY

          Walt and Roscoe stop walking.  Walt puts one hand on his
          weapon in its holster and the other on his radio.  With
          all the rest of the blinds drawn, Conrad turns the OPEN
          sign on the door to CLOSED and lowers the last shade. 
          Walt keys on the radio.

                        and Loan.  I need backup, now --
                        looks like he's taken hostages.

          The lights are now off.  Conrad is clearly spooked.  He*
          holsters the .38, unslings the shotgun and marches to*
          confront Johnny.

                        How'd you know the Sheriff was
                        out there?  Are you a cop?

          He points the weapon and expects an answer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                        Then how.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I called them.

                                        CONRAD
                        When?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Before I came in the bank.

                                        CONRAD
                        How could you call them before
                        you... 

          And then it all comes together in his mind.

                                        CONRAD
                        You're that guy.  The, the, the
                        one who... sees things.
                                (Johnny silently
                                  acknowledges)
                        ...And you're screwing up my bank
                          robbery.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to stop you from making
                        the biggest mistake of your life.

          Conrad shakes his head - can't believe this is happening

                        I don't believe in any of that
                          garbage.  You just stay clear of
                        me, Mister.  Just stay clear of
                        me.

          He walks two steps away as though to put an end to this
          bizarre chapter and then steps right back...

                                        CONRAD (CONT'D)
                          I suppose you've seen me getting
                        killed today or something.

          Johnny just looks evenly at him.

                        You think that scares me?  It
                          doesn't.  When I got up this
                          morning, I decided that this was
                        the day I was going to Jamaica or
                        the day I was going to hell.

          Outside, a SIREN approaches.  Conrad's mind's racing.  He
          goes to the window.

                                        CONRAD (CONT'D)
                        Believe me.  I'm fine with either.

  2323INT. BANK - DAY

          All the hostages seated together on the floor.  Conrad is
          scrambling up on a desk and, using the butt of the shotgun
          like a club, he knocks one of the surveillance cameras
          off its pedestal.  It SMASHES to the floor.  Sarah comforts
          Melanie as she shivers and whimpers with each smash.

          The phone rings.  Conrad feels himself being pulled in
          all directions.

          The phone continues to ring... Conrad brushes his hair
          back with his hand uncertainly...

                                        MRS. STRATTON
                        I'm not leaving the door open,
                        Conrad.

          She struggles to get to her feet and as Johnny and Sarah
          assist her... Johnny reacts to --


2424A JOHNNY FLASH 

          of Mr. Stratton, on his knees beside a supine and
          motionless Mrs. Stratton, shaking her desperately.

                                        MR. STRATTON IN THE VISION

                        up!


  2525RESUME

          With dread in his eyes, Johnny watches Mr. Stratton move
          with his wife toward the bathroom... then finds Sarah
          looking at him intently.

                                        SARAH
                                (low)
                        You saw something, didn't you?

          He looks to Sarah, acknowledging silently...


          MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          as, warily, he approaches Conrad... who is trying to ignore
          the ringing phone...

                                        JOHNNY

          Conrad can't believe it: here's Johnny, breaking his balls
          again.

                        Mrs. Stratton is about to have

  2626EXT. BANK - DAY

          Walt's standing by his car, talking on the car phone...
          Dana's near-by.  A crowd is begining to form outside the
          police perimeter.

                          I haven't been a 'junior' since
                        my daddy died when I was seven.

                        out and you and me can talk this
                          through, Conrad.  No harm, no
                        foul.

                        Can't do that, Sheriff.

                                        WALT

                        Okay, let's talk about Jamaica.

                                        CONRAD
                        Don't insult my intelligence,
                          Sheriff.  All you gonna do is
                        make me madder than I already am.

          He slams the phone down.

                                        MR. STRATTON
                        Help, somebody help me!

          And Conrad reacts, now what?  Johnny and Conrad move over
          to find Mrs. Stratton has collapsed just as Johnny had
          seen in his flash... Mr. Stratton is on his knees beside
          a supine and motionless Mrs. Stratton, shaking her
            desperately.


  2727CONRAD

          can't believe what he's seeing.  Is this a trick, something
          Johnny cooked up with Mrs. Stratton?


          FAVORING JOHNNY

          Johnny throws a searing look at Conrad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's not breathing --

          Sarah starts to work on Mrs. Stratton...

                                        MR. STRATTON
                        Wake up!  Edna -- please -- wake
                        up!

          Johnny gets to his feet and advances on Conrad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've got to let her out.

          The phone STARTS RINGING AGAIN.  Conrad shakes his head
          like he could make this all go away, and we think, maybe,
          he's starting to lose it.  Slowly PUSH IN on Conrad as he
          tries to get his mind around what's going on.  Mrs.
          Stratton's not responding to the CPR.  Conrad sees
          accusatory eyes, some angry, some frightened, all staring
          at him.  Tom and Mr. Stratton are bent over Mrs. Stratton,
          their efforts growing more frantic.  Mr. Stratton looks
          up at Conrad.

                                        MR. STRATTON
                        Damn you, Conrad, she's dying!

          Conrad's lips are moving, like he's talking to himself. 
          He scans the faces, all looking at him, and finds no
          comfort in any of them... except Johnny's.  At least, in
          his, there's something like compassion.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me tell them we need an
                        ambulance.

          Conrad just stares at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (not ungently)
                        If she dies in here, this won't
                        just be armed robbery and
                        kidnapping -- it'll be murder.

          Finally, Conrad nods assent, knowing he's losing control
          and unable to figure out how to stop it.  Johnny answers
          the ringing phone.

                                                                                INTERCUT

          HARLAN CASEY (mid-30's), leader of the Tactical Team, is
          looking at plans of the bank building, then at the building
          and the relative isolation of the lot.

                        ...Channel Four News has learned
                        that one of the hostages inside
                        the bank is Sarah Bannerman, wife
                        of Sheriff Walt Bannerman, who
                        happens to be in charge of the
                          situation here in Cleaves Mills

                        What choices do I have left?

          Johnny motions to the hostages...

                                        CONRAD
                        I got nothing if I let them go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've got nothing if you keep
                        them.  

                                        CONRAD
                        How do I know you're not bluffing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't.  But I'm not.  If you
                        keep the hostages, you're going
                        to die, Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                        That's not the worst thing that
                        could happen.

                        Not the best thing either.
                                (beat)
                        You won't be the only one who
                        dies, Conrad.  I know you didn't
                        come here today to hurt anybody.

                                        CONRAD
                        That's God's honest truth.

          Johnny picks up on 'God' and takes a calculated risk with
          this argument --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't speak to what you'll find
                        when you cross on to the other
                        side.  But you sure you want the
                        burden of somebody else's death
                        on your hands when you get there?

          And that seems to weigh on Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                        You a religious man, John?

                        I used to be.  

          Conrad studies him... then...

                        with her.  And as for you, it
                        goes without saying -- whatever
                        happens to me, happens to you.  

          Johnny frowns, frustrated.   But he backs off for the
          moment.  At the door --

                        know I've slipped a little lately.

          A long beat.  As they look at each other.  Finally, Johnny
          shrugs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's too late for that now.

                                        CONRAD
                        Good for you.  Move on with your
                        life.
                                (he laughs)
                        Listen to me.  I'm one to give
                        advice.

          He picks up the shotgun.  He works the action to EJECT
          all five shells from it, then puts it down.

                        I'm not gonna make it to Jamaica,
                        am I?

          And he drops the bullets into Johnny's hands.  Johnny's
          face goes blank for a moment.  This time, we don't see
          Johnny's vision (and for all we know, there may not even
          be a vision this time; he may be simply talking Conrad
          down)...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sadly)
                        Not that far.

                                        CONRAD
                        I guess I never was.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a good thing too.

                                        CONRAD
                        Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jamaica has an extradition treaty
                        with the U.S.

                                        CONRAD
                        It does?  Isn't that where that
                        Wall Street thief hid out in plain
                        site for years?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Believe that was Costa Rica.

                                        CONRAD
                        Costa Rica.  Right.  Costa Rica.

                        And even then he had to pay a
                        fortune to the local authorities
                        to leave him alone.

                                        CONRAD
                        I don't know anything about Costa
                        Rica.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hear it's nice.

                                        CONRAD
                        But I'm not going.

                        Where then?

          Johnny nods.

                        Am I gonna be okay with it...?

                        Yeah, Conrad, you're gonna be
                        okay with it.

                        Hey, John.  Let's say I am okay
                        with it.  A model prisoner.  And
                        I get out in a few years, you
                        know?  And I walk out the front
                        gate, is there someone waiting to
                        take me home? 

          Johnny looks at a bullet in his hand and then to Conrad a
          long beat...

                        What kind of partner would I be?

  6262EXT. BANK - DAY

          The door opens.  Conrad is the first one out, hands on
          his head.  Deputies move to handcuff and arrest him as 
          Johnny emerges, looking weary.  Crisis over, people start
          to come through the police line and into the parking lot,  
          Dana moves toward Johnny but by the time she reaches him,
          other reporters are with her...

                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No questions right now, Dana,
                        okay?  Maybe later.

          He's treating her just like any other reporter and it
            stings... she watches as he moves to Walt and Sarah...
          the Sheriff has his arm around his wife...

                        That jig-saw puzzle finally came
                          together.  Could have been a lot
                          different today.  Nice work.

                        No problem. 
                                (and he does this
                                  deliberately because
                                he wants to be alone

          Johnny nods, starts to move toward Roscoe...

                        Hey, John.

          Johnny turns, pauses...

                                (re: Sarah)
                        Thanks for bringing her back to
                        us.

          Johnny acknowledges and walks off alone toward Roscoe's
          car and as we pull back, we see Dana also alone, watching
          him... and the busy activity of the post siege begins to
          fill the screen as we...
