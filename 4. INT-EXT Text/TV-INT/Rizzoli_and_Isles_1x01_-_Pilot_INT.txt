      CLOSE ON: A CHINA TEACUP AND SAUCER.  It s wobbling on an 
      unstable surface, we can t tell what...  

      TIGHT ON a MAN'S EYES, TERRIFIED.  A few DROPS of BLOOD SEEP 
      from a gash on his cheek.  

      REVEAL the TEA CUP is balanced on his BOUND KNEES. Duct-taped 
      ankles, knees, wrists, mouth. He FIGHTS the urge to move. A 
      wedding band GLINTS on his left hand.

      SILHOUETTE OF ANOTHER MAN is BACKLIT by an enormous stained 
      glass window. He FORCES a crying WOMAN to take off her 
      nightgown. We can t make out his features but we can tell 
      that he s grinning. He RAISES his hand. He HOLDS a KNIFE. She 
      SCREAMS. It MORPHS into another sound as we --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      TWANG! a basketball BANGS into a backyard hoop. Misses.


      Jane uses a faded rooster towel to wipe blood from her nose 
      as ANGELA RIZZOLI, 55, enters.   The kitchen, like Angela, 
      was new in the 70 s. Both are held together by pride and hard 
      work. She snatches the towel from Jane, hands her paper ones.

                                  ANGELA
                    On the nice towels? What happened?

      Angela scrubs the towel as Jane stops the bleeding. She MIMES 
      wiping blood over Angela s back. Frankie Jr. LAUGHS. 

                                  ANGELA (CONT'D)
                    What re you two doing back there?

      They laugh like little kids.

                                  FRANK SR. (O.S.)
                    What s so funny?

      FRANK RIZZOLI, SR. 55, and MIKE  MIKEY  RIZZOLI, 32, Jane s 
      oldest brother, CARRY groceries and a cake.

                                  MIKEY
                    Wow, you look great, Sis.

                                  JANE
                    Blood is the new black.

      She pretends to hug him, he BACKS AWAY, WINKS at Frankie Jr.

                                  MIKEY
                    You do that?RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 3



                                  JANE
                    I needed a nose job. Don t worry.

                                  MIKEY
                    You re a screw-up, Dude.

      He CUFFS him playfully, but Frankie Jr. looks STUNG. 

                                  JANE
                    I ran into his elbow. C mon, Mikey.

      Jane s cell rings: POP version of DRAGNET THEME SONG.  She 
      hunts for it. 

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh, someone named Bird Something 
                    keeps calling.

      Jane and Frankie Jr. trade a knowing LOOK.

                                  JANE
                    Detective Crowe? You answered my 
                    phone, Ma? Why didn t you tell me?

                                  JANE (CONT'D)

                    Rizzoli.


      DET. DARREN CROWE, 30 s, on his cellphone. He has a frat-
      boy s insouciance combined with an aging ballplayer s good 
      looks.  He stands on the lawn of a mansion as CRIME SCENE 
      UNIT (CSU) TECHS and BOSTON P.D. UNIFORMS SWARM in and out of 
      an expensively renovated mansion.

                                  CROWE
                    Bad things on Beacon Hill, and 
                    you re up. 

                                  JANE 
                    Let me talk to Frost.

      ANGLE: DET. BARRY FROST, 28, buff African American cop, PUKES 
      into bushes. Crowe taunts him with a SALUTE. Frost pukes 
      again. 

                                  CROWE
                    He s busy.

                                  JANE
                    On my way.

      Jane hangs up, tosses bloody paper towels into the trash. Her 
      nose has stopped bleeding but Angela hands her an icepack. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 4



                                  ANGELA
                    It won t be attractive if your nose 
                    swells. Never know who you might 
                    run into.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Ma --

      Jane takes the ice, throws Frankie Jr. a grateful look.

                                  JANE
                    I meet so many great guys at work. 
                    Too bad they re all dead. 

      She grabs her stuff, starts to exit. Angela FROWNS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I told you I was on-call --

                                  ANGELA
                    It s Frankie Jr. s birthday!

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Go. It s fine. 
                          (wishes he was going)
                    Murder?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah. You ll get there, Frankie.

      She HANDS him a gift.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    If you hate it, gift receipt s 
                    inside.

      She gives him a quick KISS on his cheek. Jane pecks her 
      mother then her father on the cheek --

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I ll call you, Ma. Bye, Pop. See at 
                    the salt mines, Frankie. Your ass 
                    is getting big, Mikey.


      Jane gets into her state issue Ford. It s parked next to a 
      van that reads: RIZZOLI & SONS PLUMBING. Boston s Best Since 
      1954.

      JANE S POV: THRU WINDSHIELD INTO KITCHEN

      Angela and Frank laugh and fuss over Mikey and Frankie Jr.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 5



      CLOSE ON: Jane s hands. WE SEE two nasty and identical HEALED 
      RED SCARS on her palms. She RUBS them absently as she stares 
      at her family. SHOVES her car into reverse and takes off.


      As she drives, Jane reaches for clean clothes from the back 
      seat. She PULLS UP to a stoplight, wriggles out of her pants.  
      A truck driver SMILES. She SMILES back. 

      His smile grows into a LEER. She REACHES UNDER HER SEAT, 
      while she gives him a shy smile. Grabs something and THROWS 
      it on top of her car: police CHEERY LIGHT. LIGHTS and SIRENS 
      through the red stoplight, enjoying his terrified reaction in 
      her rearview mirror.


      DR. MAURA ISLES, late 30 s, behind the wheel of an SL-500 
      Mercedes.  Sleek, like her car, in form-fitting black. She s 
      strikingly pale with a slash of red lipstick, blunt-cut raven 
      hair.

      BEEP! Maura SEES a car in her rearview mirror trying to PASS 
      her on the right.  She slows down. Driver FLIES past her. 
      Dirt and sand from the shoulder WHIP up around her car. 

                                  MAURA
                    Go ahead, asshole. I see plenty 
                    like you on cold slabs all day 
                    long.


      She pulls the SL-500 into a long driveway, parks next to a 
      coroner s van with black letters: Commonwealth of 
      Massachusetts, Office of the Medical Examiner. TWO MORGUE 
      ATTENDANTS wave from the front seat. She waves back. 

      REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS work the taped-off crime-scene, 
      hovering as close as COPS will let them. She gets out.

      ANGLE ON: REPORTER KITTY VANSEN, 31, TV-pretty as she SPIES 
      Maura. She PUSHES her beleaguered CAMERAMAN toward Maura. He 
      perks up: SCHWING. Dr. Maura Isles may be a cold pathologist, 
      but she s also a smokin  hot woman.

                                  KITTY
                    Go, go. It s Queen of the Dead. Get 
                    her and stay close.

      Maura, with her medical case, deftly moves away from Kitty as 
      Kitty and the cameraman run. Kitty shoves a mic at Maura. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 6



                                  KITTY (CONT'D)
                    Dr. Isles -- What can you tell us 
                    about the murders? 

                                  MAURA
                    I ll have a statement for you later 
                    tonight, Kitty.

                                  KITTY
                    C mon, please, something for the 
                      11 o clock? This leads.

      Maura starts up STEPS as Crowe puts out a hand to stop Kitty 
      from going any further. She backs away.

                                  KITTY (CONT'D)
                    Bet if I was a corpse, she d talk 
                    to me.

      Maura enters the mansion. Crowe casually applies chapstick 
      and smooths his Ken-doll hair then turns back to Kitty. 

                                  CROWE
                    I ll give you a soundbite.

      ANGLE ON Jane as she POWERS toward them, steps between Crowe 
      and Kitty, BLOCKING the shot. Cameraman lowers his camera.

                                  JANE 
                    Where s Frost?

                                  CROWE
                    Where else?

      Crowe points at Frost, nearby and partially concealed by 
      bushes. He s stopped puking, but he doesn t look good. 

                                  FROST
                          (calls to her)
                    Bad fish sticks.

      Crowe SNORTS as Frost CROSSES to join Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Least he s not trying to get his 
                    mug on-camera. 

      Jane pulls a small tin of Vick s VapoRub from a pocket, hands 
      it to Frost. He rubs it under his nose. They walk up the 
      front steps. 

      Jane REACHES for the door. She pulls her hand back and rubs 
      her palms together. She catches Frost s concerned look.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    It s going to rain. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 7



                                  FROST
                    Hands hurt?

                                  JANE
                    Not that bad.


      Jane and Frost stand in a marble entry, stare at a vast home. 
      Polished, old wood, cathedral-height ceilings. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Not in South Boston anymore, 
                    Dorothy. 

      DET. VINCE KORSAK, 50 s, doughy in his shirt sleeves and 
      breathing hard, appears from another part of the house. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Korsak?

      Korsak EYES Frost, not happy to see him.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    You know my new partner.

                                  FROST
                    Good to see you. Thought you were 
                    on vacation.

                                  KORSAK
                    Cut it short.

      He looks intently at Jane, his old partner. She senses 
      something more than just antipathy toward Frost.

                                  JANE
                    That bad?

                                  DET. KORSAK 
                    Worse.


      CLOSE ON the body of a MAN: the bound man we saw earlier. No 
      sign of the woman. His throat has been SLIT, and he s seated, 
      propped against a wall under a comet s tail of dried BLOOD. 

      Jane, Frost and Korsak, all gloved, process the crime scene 
      as Maura SLIDES a tongue depressor into the deep neck wound. 
      It goes almost all the way in. Frost turns away.

                                  MAURA
                    Almost 5 centimeters. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 8



                                  FROST
                    If you got this, I can start 
                      processing the rest of the house. 

      Jane nods sympathetically. Frost exits. Korsak smirks.

                                  MAURA
                    Carotid artery and jugular have 
                    been transected. What s odd is how 
                    precise it is - almost surgical. 

                                  JANE
                    You think our perp might have some 
                    medical training?

      Maura nods, looks up and studies Jane s broken nose.

                                  MAURA
                    Hairline fracture of the nasal bone 
                    above the lateral nasal cartilage. 
                    Not disfiguring.

      Korsak looks at the corpse, confused.

                                  KORSAK 
                    Looks pretty disfiguring to me.

                                  JANE
                    Can you pop it out?

      Maura pulls off her gloves. Korsak watches, baffled.

                                  MAURA
                    Can t you do something safe like 
                    yoga? Might hurt a little --

      Maura POPS Jane s nose into place.  An audible CRACK!

                                  JANE
                    Ow! A  little ? 

                                  MAURA
                    Put ice on it for the next 24 hours 
                    so you don t look like Mike Tyson. 

      Jane turns to Korsak.

                                  JANE 
                    Who is he?

                                  KORSAK 
                    Dr. Richard Yeager, 36, 
                      pediatrician. Housekeeper found 
                    him. He s a newlywed. Wife Gail is 
                    missing.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 9



      Jane SCANS photos of a beautiful bride and groom arranged on 
      a baby grand. She absent-mindedly touches the piano, so 
      familiar with the instrument, she TAPS KEYS like they re an 
      extension of her body. PLAYS a few notes of the haunting 
      Falling Slowly. 

                                  JANE
                    Needs tuning. Nobody plays.

      Jane sees a shot of the bride showing off a big diamond ring.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Diamond was too small so she 
                    whacked him and walked out?

                                  KORSAK
                    No. We got signs of forced entry. 

      Jane looks carefully at Dr. Yeager s body. Her face takes on 
      a haunted look as she finds something. She LIFTS pieces of a 
      broken china cup and saucer from next to the body.

                                  JANE
                      Well-to-do couple. The man bound 
                    and posed. The woman missing. And a 
                    teacup...

      QUICK POP: SCALPEL glints in a man s hand as he DRIVES IT 
      through something to SKEWER it to a dirt floor. It s so quick 
      and so dark, it s hard to tell what the  something  is -- but 
      it looks like a WOMAN S HAND.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Jane squeezes her hands into fists. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Is he out? Is the Surgeon out?

                                  MAURA
                    Oh my God. Korsak, did you know 
                    this?

                                  KORSAK
                    No, no. He s not out. It s his M.O. 
                    that s all. 

                                  MAURA
                    Why didn t you warn us? Warn Jane 
                    at least.

                                  KORSAK
                    I m sorry. I wanted your unbiased 
                      assessment.

      Maura moves to Jane.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 10



                                  JANE
                    We put that son of a bitch behind 
                    bars. How is this possible?

                                  KORSAK
                    Listen to me: It s not him, it s 
                    not the Surgeon. I checked with 
                    prison authorities: he s in 
                    lockdown at Souza-Baranowski. 

      Jane reflexively rubs her palms together. 

                                  MAURA
                    Let s make sure.

      Jane nods, DIALS her cell.

                                  JANE
                          (to phone)
                    Frost, call I.P.S. at Souza-
                      Baronowski. I want a visual on 
                    Warren Hoyt...yes, now. And tell 
                     em I want video confirmation.

      She hangs up, TRADES a LOOK with Maura. Walks to the victim.

      CLOSE ON red circular marks on the corpses s skin. She GASPS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    He s been Tasered. Like Hoyt did...

                                  KORSAK 
                    Any sick perp could do this if he 
                    watched TV news or read a paper. 
                    We ve got a copycat. 

                                  JANE
                    No -- you said it was worse. It is. 
                    We didn t release this detail.

      She turns her face so only Maura can see her fear.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hoyt s trained an Apprentice. 


      A MAN in silhouette works a heavy set of barbells as he 
      watches local news on a small TV. There s a strange tattoo 
      that encircles his elbow: 68W HCS. We realize it s the MAN 
      who terrorized the Yeager s. 

      CLOSE ON TV as Jane s face POPS up --

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 11




      Jane s face. PULL-BACK to REVEAL PRISONERS watching footage 
      of her in a local crime story. 

      FIND WARREN HOYT, 40 s, watching. Good-looking, a guy who 
      might drive a Volvo and listen to talk radio. And then we see 
      his eyes: inhuman evil is embedded there. He SMILES and 
      FINGERS something in his pocket. He BLOCKS TV SCREEN. 

                                  HOYT
                    Hello, Jane. So good to see you.

      A pissed and BURLY Chicano prisoner, MIGUEL, 20 s, PUSHES 
      Hoyt from behind.

                                  MIGUEL
                    Hey, Hoyt, vendejo! Move!

      With sudden, manic intensity, Hoyt pulls a homemade SHIV he 
      had concealed in his pocket. He DRIVES it neatly between the 
      man s ribs. Catches the man as he FALLS FORWARD.

                                  PRISONER (O.S.)
                    Miguel!

                                  HOYT
                    Through the pericardium, into the 
                    aortic chamber. I m grateful you 
                      volunteered to help, Miguel. This 
                    will be over in seconds.

      Hoyt LAYS his hands in the STREAM OF BLOOD pumping from the 
      dying man s chest. He has the look of someone at the height 
      of sexual pleasure. PRISONERS YELL as GUARDS RUN in, clubs 
      out. GUARD 1 YANKS Hoyt to his feet.

                                  GUARD 2
                    Back! Everyone get back!

      Hoyt is serene as he s cuffed and led past hardened criminals 
      who step away from the deadliest one in their midst. Hoyt 
      SMILES up at the TV as footage of Jane still plays.

                                  HOYT
                    It s time, Jane.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                            ACT TWO


      Maura MAKES notes as Jane and Korsak set up equipment. As two 
      MORGUE ATTENDANTS try to force Dr. Yeager s rigor-mortis 
      stiffened body into a body bag -- 

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    He s not gonna bend.

                                  MAURA
                    Watch the head. It s attached by 
                    fascia. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 13



      They TIP the body onto a stretcher. Jane moves to where the 
      body was propped. She bends down, looks out at the room.

      REVERSE ANGLE: coffee table in the center. 

                                  JANE
                    Our perp went to a lot of trouble 
                    with that teacup. He wanted to know 
                    if Yeager moved. Why? What was he 
                    doing? And why force Yeager to 
                    watch? Let s move the table.

      Korsak moves it as FBI SPECIAL AGENT GABRIEL DEAN, 35, 
      enters. GQ-handsome and completely unaware of how hot he is. 
      He BADGES Jane.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Special Agent Gabriel Dean. You 
                    must be Det. Rizzoli.

      He turns solicitously to Maura, admiring her. 

                                  AGENT DEAN (CONT'D)
                    And you must be Dr. Maura Isles.

      Maura smiles unexpectedly, removes her latex gloves to shake 
      his hand. The chemistry between them isn t lost on Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    What s the FBI doing here? 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Saw the homicide advisory. And 
                    possible kidnapping. We have an APB 
                    out on Gail Yeager.

                                  JANE
                    So do we. You get a lot of routine 
                      advisories. What makes this one 
                    special?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Hey, we re on the same side.

                                  JANE
                    Are we? You Fed Boys like to show 
                    up to take the bat and ball. I ll 
                    call you if I need you -- Boston 
                    Bureau?

      Morgue Attendants carry the body out. As Maura leaves --

                                  MAURA
                    Jane, I ll do the autopsy in the 
                    morning. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 14


                          (to Dean)
                    Come if you like.

      Dean smiles. Jane shoots Maura a look that could kill: thanks 
      a lot. Maura shrugs innocently and exits.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I m just here to observe. 

                                  JANE
                    Let s do luminescence where the 
                    table was. 

                                  KORSAK
                    This baby is 400 watts. Picks up 
                      everything.

      Jane HITS the lights. The Crimescope makes their faces GLOW 
      GREEN as a PATCH of carpet that was under the table LIGHTS UP 
      a bright white. Jane FLIPS the lights ON. She looks grim. 

                                  JANE
                    Semen. He made her husband watch 
                    while he raped her. Just like Hoyt.


      Dr. O Donnell sips tea from a Mid-Century Modern set. Jane 
      and Frost don t touch theirs. Her living room is like her: 
      expensive and calculated -- perfect for a Vanity Fair spread. 

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    I m a forensic psychiatrist. My 
                    work advances our understanding of 
                    these troubled men. I m not sure 
                    how I can help you.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 16



                                  JANE
                    You visit him. Could he have 
                    trained some perp he met inside, 
                    someone as deranged as he is?

      Dr. O Donnell gets up, pulls a file from a cabinet, rifles 
      through it and holds up a photo of a second grade boy.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    You can only see the end result. 
                    This is Warren at seven. 

                                  JANE
                    He s called the Surgeon because he 
                    enjoys cutting women and their 
                    partners up with a scalpel. Seven 
                    at last count. I have a hard time 
                    worrying about his sad childhood.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    You think of violent acts as 
                      manifestations of evil. As though 
                    Warren has control over his 
                    behavior. Like many others, he 
                    doesn t know why he kills.

                                  JANE
                    That s why I ll always have a job.

      As she s talking, Jane subtly plays with a few strands of her 
      hair. Not girly, just distracted.

                                  DR. O DONNELL
                    Did you know hair twirling is often 
                    a sign of sexual frustration?

                                  JANE
                    That right? I always wondered. 
                    Better get on with my night then.

      Jane smiles politely, STANDS. Frost follows her lead.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for your time.


      Jane and Frost face Warren Hoyt. His hands are shackled but 
      he s as comfortable as a man chatting at Starbucks.

                                  HOYT
                    You re different, not like the 
                    others. I feel your anger, absorb 
                    your rage, just by your scent.

      He takes a deep inhale, smiles. She fights to stay steady.

                                  JANE
                    See one. Do one. Teach one. That s 
                    what they taught you in medical 
                    school. Who did you teach, Hoyt?

                                  HOYT
                    I dropped out, Jane. You know that.
                    I like your neck. It s very white. 
                    And your breasts. Very firm.

                                  JANE
                    You think you re Hannibal Lector? 
                    Don t flatter yourself. You think I 
                    can t make your life more miserable  
                    than it is? 

      Hoyt smiles, turns to Frost.

                                  HOYT
                    I like an audience. I prefer it 
                    when they re tied up, but silence 
                    works, too.

                                  JANE
                    Who did you sic on the world? Gimme 
                    me a name.

                                  HOYT 
                    All my life I have been meticulous 
                    about finishing what I start. This 
                    disturbs me. That I haven t 
                    finished what I started with you. 

                                  JANE
                    And you won t, you sick scumbag.

                                  HOYT
                    Very good, Jane. You ve learned how 
                    to irritate me. You know, my mother 
                    smelled of Chanel #5 and mink when 
                    she pinched my skin. She liked to 
                    grab me here -- RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 18



      He lifts his shackled hands to indicate his throat as a GUARD 
      reacts. Hoyt lowers his hands. Guard steps back.

                                  HOYT (CONT'D)
                    Perhaps that s why I m partial to 
                    the throat. Do you dream about me? 
                    I dream about you.

                                  JANE
                    I don t think about you. But I ll 
                    visit every goddamn day if you tell 
                    me who your friend is. Who killed 
                    Dr. Yeager and where s his wife?

      Hoyt MOTIONS for the PRISON GUARD. 

                                  HOYT
                          (like a therapist)
                    I see our time is up.

      He stands, not bothered that his ankles are shackled. Like a 
      caged but still powerful lion, he deftly shuffles to the 
      door. He stops, looks at Jane. A parting volley --

                                  HOYT (CONT'D)
                    You re right -- my friend is out 
                    there. Enjoy him. He ll enjoy you.

      She watches him leave, FIGHTS to maintain her composure. 

                                  JANE
                    Swell.

      Her cell RINGS. She JUMPS. Exhales hard, calmly answers.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                      Rizzoli...we re on the way.

      She hangs up, looks at Frost.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    They found Gail Yeager.


      Jane pulls in, stops. She rubs her jaw, LOOKS through the 
      windshield. Agent Dean STEPS from the woods to join Korsak 
      and Crowe. Frost gets out.

                                  JANE
                    I ll catch up.

      Jane DUMPS out her purse: gum, balled-up tissue, Boston Red 
      Sox water bottle, Vick s VapoRub, a touch-screen Sudoku

      Puts her hand between the seats. SMILES as she holds up a 
      tube of old lipstick: Eureka.


      BODIES of Dr. Yeager and Gail Yeager are on separate metal 
      tables. Maura WORKS on Gail s body. Korsak has on a large 
      O.R. gown and bouffant paper cap. He EATS a cheese Danish. 
      Jane enters. He offers her one from a box.

                          (re: dead bodies)
                    Maybe they do.

                                  KORSAK
                    Nope. Not hungry. Where s Frost?

                                  JANE
                    Uh, bathroom.

      Maura smiles. Korsak nods, a little smug. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Prison was a bust. Hoyt has no 
                    contact with any prisoners. Email, 
                      correspondence, all a dead end. 

                                  KORSAK
                    So how d he train an Apprentice?

                                  JANE
                    Someone he knew before prison?  Med

                    Did you do a wet prep yet?

      Jane WHIRLS around, startled by Dean s sudden appearance. She 
      and Maura exchange a LOOK.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 21



                                  MAURA
                    I hadn t planned to but I can.

      Maura takes a scraping from Gail Yeager s vagina (we don t 
      see this), puts it on a slide, LOOKS through a microscope.

                                  MAURA (CONT'D)
                    Sperm is motile.

                                  KORSAK
                    You mean like it s moving?

                                  MAURA
                    That s what motile means.

      Jane turns on Dean. 

                                  JANE
                    How did you know?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                          (evasive)
                    I didn t.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, you did. 

                                  MAURA
                    (siding with Jane)
                    It s not standard procedure to 
                    check to see if the perp is also a 
                      necropheliac.

      Dean s cell rings. He walks out to take the call.

                                  JANE 
                    FBI s hands are all over this case. 

                                  MAURA
                      Something s not right.

                    It just got weirder.


      Jane, Frost and Korsak are in Maura s tricked-out lab. Maura 
      lets Jane look through a MICROSCOPE. She does.

                                  JANE
                    It s a strand of hair.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 22



                                  MAURA
                    Technical name is  Zombie Hair.  

                                  JANE
                    It s Gail Yeager s?

      She shakes her head,  no. 

                                  FROST
                    It was transferred from the perp to 
                    Gail Yeager s body?

                                  MAURA
                    Had to be. I found blue carpet 
                    fibers, too, And look at the root. 
                    Notice anything strange?

      POV THRU MICROSCOPE: the hair looks like the end of a broom.

                                  JANE
                    It looks ragged, almost like a 
                    brush.

      Korsak pushes her aside to get a look. Frost looks irritated.

                                  KORSAK
                    There s a black band near the root. 

      Korsak hogs the microscope as Frost clears his throat.

                                  MAURA
                    Distal banding and brushlike root 
                    ends are postmortem changes. 
                    Whoever we re looking for had close 
                    contact with a corpse. 

                                  KORSAK
                    Wait -- so our Apprentice had sex 
                    with Gail Yeager after she, uh, 
                    expired. And sex with --
                          (points at hair)
                    -- a different woman who was, uh, 
                    also expired and decaying. 

      He shakes his head, unnerved by this thought. Frost 
      inadvertently GAGS. The two men unexpectedly share a LOOK as 
      their faces register the same thing: Ick. Korsak looks away.

                                  JANE
                    We ve got another victim or our 
                      Apprentice works with dead bodies. 

                                  FROST
                    What about someone in a funeral 
                    home? Gail Yeager buried her mother 
                    two weeks ago.  RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 23



      As Frost and Jane start to leave, Korsak follows. 

                                  FROST (CONT'D)
                    We got this. 

      Jane TOSSES Korsak an apologetic shrug.


      JOEY VALENTINE, 30 s, is dressed like an artist: cool specs 
      and shirt. Takes his exterior-decorating of the dead very 
      seriously. He looks at a photo of Gail Yeager as Jane and 
      Frost watch him.

                                  JOEY
                    Sure, I remember her. Had to 
                    convince her to let me use Mac Glam 
                    and a curling iron on Mom. She 
                    turned out beautifully. Features 
                    really popped.

      Joey masterfully dusts the dead woman with a blush brush.

                                  JANE
                    You don t have an embalmers  
                    license.

                                  JOEY
                    Haven t gotten around to it.

                                  FROST
                    Because you have a criminal record.

      Joey freezes, holding out the make-up brush.

                                  JOEY
                    You re not gonna tell my boss?

                                  JANE
                    Only if you killed Gail Yeager. 
                    Where were you Wednesday night?

                                  JOEY
                    Here. Look, everybody told me what 
                    a good job I did, how alive Mom 
                    looked, so why would I kill Gail?

      Jane shows him a search warrant.

                                  JANE
                    We ll need to search the premises 
                    and your car.

      Frost starts to exit. Jane hangs back, makes sure he can t 
      hear her. She puts a hand to her healing nose.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 24



                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Um...can you recommend something to 
                    cover bruises?


      FOOTSTEPS can be heard as GUARDS approach down a long 
      corridor. Hoyt reaches under his thin mattress, pulls out a 
      crumpled tissue. Inside is a BLUE PILL. He dry swallows it, 
      lies back. Guard RAPS on the bars. 

                                  GUARD 2
                    Let s go, Hoyt. You got your one 
                    hour on the yard. 

      They open his cell, but Hoyt clutches his abdomen and MOANS. 
      They PULL him up, try to get him on his feet. But he PITCHES 
      forward, his eyes ROLLING back in his head. He COLLAPSES.

                                  GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
                    He s faking. Be careful.

      Guard 2 KNEES Hoyt in the balls. He doesn t react.

                                  GUARD 1
                    He ain t faking.

      Guard 1 grabs his Walkie-Talkie.

                                  GUARD 2
                    I need Medical on Cell Block 4-

      Jane and Frost are working. She stands, stretches then 
      studies a Boston map with colored PUSH PINS. 

                                  JANE
                    Hoyt hit here, here and--

                    Here. My apartment. The Apprentice

                    within Boston city limits.

      A heavy beat as she realizes what Frost means --

                    You should eat something. I ordered 
                    a pizza.

      Frost exits. Jane goes back to work. Doesn t see or hear a 
      MAN silently approach her in the SHADOWS.

      CLOSE ON: MAN S BLACK LEATHER SHOE.

                    Sorry.

      He s miserable. He holds out a graded exam. She looks at it. 
      It s bad. She puts her arm around her bigger little brother.

                    You can take it again. You ll pass.

      He LOOKS at her, as close to tears as a strappy, athletic 
      tough guy can get. He SHAKES his head.

                                    FRANKIE JR.
                    Jane, this was the third time. You

      Within seconds, he s used it TO KILL all three people.

                    Doesn t explain how he got out of 
                    here.

                    We ve looked at all the security 
                    tape, tracked everyone s movements. 
                    We had a food delivery, the 
                    coroner s office picked up a body, 
                    and three prisoners were 
                      transferred. They ve all been 
                    cleared. 

                                  JANE
                    Could he still be inside?

      Jane turns back to the monitor which has continued to play.

      CLOSE ON: Hoyt as he LOOKS DELIBERATELY INTO THE SECURITY 
      CAMERA. He SMILES as he RAISES his left hand.  Holds a 
      scalpel to it, THEN PRICKS HIS PALM. It trickles BLOOD.

                                  WARDEN (CONT'D)
                    What s he doing?

      Jane folds her hands together to HIDE her scars. Jane trades 
      a look with Dean. He s watching her intently.

                                  JANE 
                    It s a message for me.


      Jane looks exhausted. She finishes unloading her dishwasher. 
      Then mixes water and orchid food in a glass pitcher. A NOISE 
      STARTLES her. She grabs her gun, points it at -- the ice-
      maker as it makes another batch of ice.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 29



                                  JANE
                      God-damnit.

      She grabs the pitcher, carries it to --

      LIVING ROOM

      She waters orchids that float out of Italian pottery. Her 
      apartment is warm and inviting. She checks the deadbolt, 
      moves to a window, lifts a curtain. 

      JANE S POV: a Crown Vic with Frankie Jr. and Frost sits 
      across the street. Frankie Jr. gives her a  you okay  look. 
      She nods, DROPS the curtain. Looks around at her impeccably 
      neat apartment. PULLS out a vacuum, starts to vacuum.


      Jane s interrupted by a loud RAP at her door. She turns off 
      the vacuum, looks out her peephole. Opens the door to AVERY 
      MCMILLAN, 20 s, pretty and a night owl holding a law book. 

                                  JANE
                    Oh, god, Avery. I m sorry. Did the 
                    vacuum wake you up?

                                  AVERY
                    No, I was up studying.

                                  JANE
                    How s law school?

                                  AVERY
                    Awful. Remind me again why I 
                    thought I wanted to be a lawyer?

                                  JANE
                    I know the feeling:  Where the hell 
                    was I on Career Day? 

      They smile at each other.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    You want to come in?

                                  AVERY
                    Two hundred pages of Torts to go.
                    Just making sure you re okay.

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, why would you ask that?

                                  AVERY

                                  JANE
                    Better than drinking. Sorry. I ll 
                    stop making so much noise.  Night.

      Jane closes the door, looks around at her silent apartment.


      It s as beautiful and tasteful as its owner. Jane RUBS her 
      jaw. Maura looks concerned.

                    Your molars look like you re 102 
                    from grinding.

                                  JANE
                    That s the nicest thing anyone s 
                    said to me all day.

                                  MAURA
                    Under any stress, Detective?

                                  JANE
                    You mean, other than the fact that 
                    an escaped serial killer lune is 
                    trying to kill me again? No.

                                  MAURA
                    I ll show you some exercises to 
                    relieve the jaw pain.

                                  JANE
                    What if you just help me kill Hoyt?

      Maura smiles.


      Jane fingers the bedspread in a HOUSE BEAUTIFUL room. It 
      looks like the tags have just been removed.  She smiles.

                                  JANE
                    Will it bother you to have a live 
                    person in your house?

                                  MAURA
                    Only a little.

                                  JANE
                    I m glad I m not the only one who 
                    doesn t have time for a love life --

      She s interrupted by a KNOCK on the front door. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Or not. God, I m sorry. You were 
                    expecting someone. I m gonna go --

                                  MAURA
                    He s dropping something off. Stay.

      Maura exits. Jane hears VOICES, cracks open the door. It s 
      Dean. 

      ON DEAN 

      As he hands Maura a 9 x 11 envelope. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 32

                    Jane s here.

                                  MAURA
                    I don t feel right about not 
                    telling her.

                                  DEAN
                    You can t.

      ON JANE, like a 7th grade girl who s seen her best friend 
      with the boy she likes. She CLOSES DOOR, lays on the bed. 
      Maura KNOCKS.

                                  JANE
                    Go away. I m asleep.

      Maura walks in, lays on the bed next to Jane.  They both 
      STARE at the ceiling.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Are we having a sleepover or is 
                    this your way of telling me you re 
                    attracted to me?

      They both GIGGLE at this thought.

                                  MAURA
                    I m not seeing him.

                                  JANE
                    Yet.

                                  MAURA
                    Somebody should, don t you think?

                                  JANE
                    Yup.

                                  MAURA
                    Should we draw straws?

                                  JANE
                    What if we just show him our tits, 
                    let him pick?

      Maura HITS her with a pillow.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    What d he want?

                    Fine. Go sleep in your own room.

                                  MAURA
                    Jane --

                                  JANE
                    Did you ever like the same guy as 
                    your best friend?

                                  MAURA
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    Did you ever have a best friend?

                                  MAURA
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    You d tell me if you were a Cyborg, 
                    right?

                                  MAURA
                    No, I don t think I would.

      They both laugh. It s quiet for a beat. Then, like little 
      girls at a sleepover --

                                  JANE
                    Dean is really hot.

                                  MAURA
                    Shut up. I won t be able to sleep.


      Jane wakes, looks around, confused. Remembers where she is, 
      grabs her things and tiptoes out.


      Jane drives. Her cell rings: a disturbing SCI-FI tone.

                                  JANE

      Jane s working with Frost, going through Hoyt s MURDER BOOK.

                                  JANE
                    Did Dean say anything  -- why he 
                    was visiting Dr. Isles at 3 a.m.?

                                  FROST
                    He was surprised to see us. Said he 
                    was dropping something off.  Asked 
                    why you were there.

                                  JANE

                                  FROST
                    Yeah. That s exactly what I said.

      Maura walks in with two big lattes, holds one out to Jane.

      Jane opens the lid.

      Jane sighs. Her cell rings again: DRAGNET ring.

                    We ve got another body.


      CLOSE ON: DEAD MAN.

      He s SLUMPED against a wall, bound and bloody and very dead. 
      Dean looks on as Jane studies a photo Korsak shows her of a 
      YOUNG COUPLE. MAN in the photo is their victim.

                                  KORSAK
                    Alexander Ghent. His wife, Karenna.

                    Let me guess: she s missing.
                          (off his nod)
                    No sign of a teacup this time. You 
                    know what that means.

                    The Apprentice didn t need a 
                    warning device because he had a 
                    pal: Hoyt.

                    Why are you here before us?

      Jane is on her computer. Korsak sits next to her.

                                  JANE
                    It s an anagram for Theodore  Ted  
                    Bundy. Bundy was fascinated by

      Frost enters on this.

                                  FROST
                    Clever. He paid with a one-off

      Jane GOOGLES Bundy, finds what she s looking for, reads it --

                     The grounds where you kill them or 
                    leave them become sacred to you, 
                    and you will always be drawn back.   
                    Bundy said that. Sacred Ground.

                    Gail Yeager. He didn t bury her so 
                    he could visit --

                                  JANE
                    --any time he wanted. But we took 
                    Gail s body, so he needed a 
                      replacement: Karenna Ghent. The 
                    grounds where you leave them become 
                    sacred. Maybe he ll go back.

                                  KORSAK
                    Be kind of stupid.

                                  JANE
                    Let s stake it out. What else do we 
                    have?

                                  KORSAK 
                    What if it s a trap?

                                  JANE
                    It s Hoyt -- we assume it s a trap. 


      Korsak drives. He s happy. Jane rides shotgun. She sniffs.

                                  JANE
                    What is that smell?

      A HUGE tabby cat emerges from between the seats. MEOW.  

                                  KORSAK 
                    It s just Barney Miller.

      Jane turns away from Korsak, PINCHES the septum of her broken 
      nose to trigger a sneeze. It works: she SNEEZES.

                                  KORSAK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you sneezed. 

                                  JANE
                    I told you, I m allergic. It s him 
                    or me.

      Korsak SUDDENLY WRENCHES the wheel, PULLS over and STOPS. He 
      GRABS a cat carrier from the trunk of the car, PUTS Barnie 
      Miller inside. WOOF! Jane LOOKS at the cat. WOOF!

      A DOG BARKS nearby. Korsak MARCHES toward the sound.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Korsak --


      Barney Miller HISSES from the carrier at the Maltese, now on 
      Korsak s lap. Jane DRIVES.

                    What should we call her?

                    Lacey got adopted by this nice 
                    lady. Wanted Crocket and Tubbs to 
                    stay together, but they got good

                    Okay, okay. We re supposed to be on 
                      a stake-out. 


      Jane and Korsak sit in the car, hidden in trees and brush. 
      Barney Miller, in his carrier, is on Korsak s lap.

                                  JANE
                          (to radio)

                    Negative.

      Jo Friday JUMPS UP and LICKS Korsak s face. He pushes her 
      off. Makes a KISSING SOUND at the cat. Cat HISSES.

                                  JANE
                    Why do we always want the ones who 
                    don t want us? 

      Rizzoli points to Jo Friday, who s waging her tail.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Jo Friday loves you.

                    Got to be kidding me.

                                  KORSAK
                    You want me to do it here?

                                  JANE
                    I ll cover for you.


      Jane paces in a corridor as Maura WALKS up. 

                                  MAURA
                    How s he doing?

                                  JANE
                    Still in surgery. 

                                  MAURA
                    And the victim?

      Dean walks toward them from the other end of the hallway. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Sedated. We re waiting to talk to 
                    her.

                                  JANE
                    I m waiting to talk to her. Far as 
                    I m concerned, you re a suspect. 

      Maura puts a hand on Jane, MOVES her away from Dean.

                                  MAURA
                    Jane, he d be covered with blood if 
                    he d stabbed Korsak. 

                                  JANE
                    Maybe.

      ON DEAN, right behind them.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Oh, come on. Let s get coffee.

                    The hell with coffee. Let s go 
                    drink.

      Jane GRINS.


      They split a bottle of nice red wine at a tall table by 
      themselves. Jane pours it into Maura s glass.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    We played every day. Usually at her 
                    house because her parents were 
                    divorced and her mother worked. We 
                    got away with murder. 

                                  MAURA
                    What did you do? 

                                  JANE
                    Tried on her mother s clothes. 
                    Clunked around in her shoes. We had 
                    this game: we d steal eggs and toss 
                    them back and forth. And we baked 
                    mud pies -- I mean, in the oven. 
                    Couldn t get away with that stuff 
                    at my house.

                                  MAURA
                    So what happened, Susan cheated on 
                    you?

                    How d you know? Threw me over for

                                  MAURA 
                    I didn t have girlfriends.

                                  JANE
                    None? You were a Boys  Girl?

                                  MAURA
                    No. I was so weird, I was happy 
                    with books and my chemistry set.

                    Yes, I am. That s why you love me.

      Jane NOTICES TWO MEN, staring at them. Jane thinks they re 
      just staring at Maura.

                                  JANE
                    When did you realize you had power

      Maura POINTS at the men. They WAVE at Jane and Maura.

                    It s all Susan s fault.

                    Want to stay at my house, just 
                    until this is over? 

      Jane lays down money, grabs her purse. LOOKS at Maura.

                                  JANE
                    What if it s never over? 

      She stares at Maura, stricken. 


      Jane sits on her couch, STARES into space. She holds her 
      handgun. Jo Friday, freshly bathed, is at her feet, dog-
      smiling at her. Jane shows the little dog her gun --

      A NOISE. The dog BARKS. Jane looks through her peephole. 
      UNLOCKS her door, holds up the gun with both hands. Dean 
      stands there. Jane points the gun at his chest.

                                  AGENT DEAN

      Jo Friday jumps happily on Dean. He leans down and pets her. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Hey, buddy, what s your name?

      He looks at her until she lowers her gun. Then comes inside.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Why did Hoyt go after you?

      She FIRES UP an espresso machine. Dean looks around.

                                  JANE
                    Hoyt is good at setting traps.

      FLASHBACK: A WOMAN SCREAMS as Jane, gun out, FLIES down 
      rickety stairs into a darkened basement. 

      A DEAD MAN and UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN on a cot. Jane RIPS the tape 
      off her mouth as it hits her -- WOMAN didn t scream. She SEES 
      a boombox just as WHAM! - Warren Hoyt SLAMS her to the ground 
      with a PIPE. He stands over her, SKEWERS her hand to the 
      ground with a scalpel. 

      Korsak APPEARS, GUN OUT.  BAM! Hoyt drops.

      BACK TO SCENE:

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I keep taking the bait. Just like 
                    he knows I will. 

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    So Korsak saved you. That s why you 
                    requested a new partner?

                                  JANE
                    No. Look, I m not Hoyt s victim. 
                    I m the one who caught him, helped 
                    save that woman.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Not without a great deal of damage 
                    to you.

                                  JANE
                    So I m damaged.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 47



                                  AGENT DEAN
                    That s not what I said. 

      She sits on the couch. Jo Friday sits next to her.

                                  JANE
                    You re not wrong.

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    Why do you feel the need to outdo 
                    every man?

                                  JANE
                    I have to work harder just to be 
                    treated like everybody else.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You re not everybody else. 

      She looks away. He wills her to look at him. She does. 

                                  AGENT DEAN (CONT'D)
                    You think a gun and an attitude 
                    will keep you alive?

                                  JANE
                    Yup. That and two patrol officers 
                    outside.

      He SITS very close to her. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I could stay...

      She FREEZES, desperately wanting him to stay. Not sure if 
      that s a good idea.

                                  JANE
                    I can t put you at risk.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Of what?

      She looks at him. He looks at her. RAW SEXUAL ENERGY gyrates 
      between them. She stands, completely unnerved by him.

                                  JANE
                    You have to go, uh, now.

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                    Okay. Good-bye, then. 

      She waves good-bye. He walks out. She watches him go.RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 48




      She works on her computer. No one else is in yet. Her cell 
      rings the Sci-Fi Mom tone. She just looks at it.

                                  JANE
                    It s 6 a.m., Ma. Give it a rest.

      It stops. Starts again. Jane pretends to answer it.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hello, Mother...You re worried 
                    about me? That s so sweet...no, I m 
                    fine. 

      Maura enters with two cups of coffee. Jane doesn t see her.  

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Why, yes, I am in charge of a big 
                      case...You read about me in The 
                    Globe?  Oh, Mom, I love you, too. 
                    It s so great to finally hear you 
                    say something nice --

      Maura tries to tiptoe away. Jane hears her, FLUSHES RED.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, I feel silly. You re early.

                                  MAURA
                    Sorry. Thought you were talking to 
                    someone.

                                  JANE
                    My fantasy mother. I never once had 
                      a conversation with her when she 
                    wasn t doing something: peeling 
                    potatoes, washing dishes, sweeping, 
                    telling me what to do.

      Maura hands her a latte, sits near her.

                                  MAURA
                    They have a button for  light 
                    foam. 

                                  JANE
                    That is the best news. Can t sleep. 
                    My place has never been cleaner. I 
                    can t stop thinking about...him.

                                  MAURA
                    There d be something wrong with you 
                    if you weren t terrified.

                    What s my ring tone?

      Jane BLUSHES. Then PLAYS POP Version of FUNERAL DIRGE.

                                  MAURA (CONT'D)
                    Nice and upbeat. You tell your mom 
                    Hoyt s out? 

                                  JANE
                    Good idea. She ll have me sleeping 
                    under my pink canopy bed.

                                  MAURA
                    I always wanted a pink canopy. 

      Jane LOOKS at Maura, SMILES.

                                  JANE 
                    I wanted a horse. You think I 
                    wanted to be a cop because I knew 
                    it would bug my mother?

                                  MAURA
                    No. I think you wanted to be a 
                      superhero.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, but I am, Doctor. Please don t 
                    tell me you ve always wanted to 
                    dissect dead people.

                                  MAURA 
                    Okay, I won t.

      Jane starts to dial her phone. STOPS. Looks at Maura.

                                  JANE 
                    Is it too early to call Agent Dean?

                                  MAURA 
                          (this is hard to say)
                    He went back to D.C. 

                                  JANE
                    What? What do you mean,  back to 
                    D.C. ? Isn t he out of Boston?

      Maura looks uncomfortable. Shakes her head  no. 

                                  MAURA
                    This is a lot bigger and a lot more

                                  JANE
                    Talk to me. I saw him three hours 
                    ago. When did you talk to him?

                                  MAURA
                    Um, after that.

                                  JANE
                    Oh. Okay, this is awkward.

      Heavy silence DROPS between them like a drape.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Why did he come to your house the 
                    night I was there?

                                  MAURA
                    He had some questions. About 
                    another case.

                                  JANE
                    I saw him give you an envelope, 
                    with photos. What case?

                                  MAURA
                    It involves national security.

      Jane puts the coffee down, STARES at Maura as though she s 
        reevaluating their entire relationship. 

                                  JANE
                    Are you kidding me?

      Maura looks miserable. Jane picks up her stuff.

                                  MAURA
                    Where are you going?

      Jane says nothing. Just walks away.


      Jane holds dog food and a bed. At her feet, Jo Friday waits 
      patiently. Avery OPENS her door and SCOOPS up the dog.

                    Positive. She can help me study 
                      Contracts, right Jo? 

      Jo Friday BARKS happily as Jane hurries away.


      Jane walks up to a UNIFORMED GUARD.

                                  JANE
                    I m here to see Special Agent 
                    Gabriel Dean.


      Jane is fuming as Dean comes toward her.

                                  AGENT DEAN 
                          (to Guard)
                    It s all right.

                                  JANE
                    You sure? Maybe you should set up a 
                    perimeter around the White House --

      Dean steers her away from the Security Guard, leads her by 
      the arm to the street exit. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I m not leaving.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    You bring your gun?

                                  JANE
                    At the hotel. I decided not to 
                    shoot you. But that was awhile ago.

      Jane and Dean sit facing SENATOR SAM CONWAY, 50 s. He takes a 
      file from a locked drawer, hands it to Jane. She opens it.

      CLOSE ON: photo of a bearded man in a Shalwar Kammez: a long 
      shirt reaching his knees. He s slumped against the wall, 
      bloody and bound just like Dr. Yeager and Alexander Ghent.

                                  JANE
                    Where is this?

      Senator Conway and Dean trade a look. 

                                    SENATOR CONWAY
                    Kabul, Afghanistan. 

                                  JANE
                    It looks like Hoyt s work.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Operation Enduring Freedom. Four 
                    thousand ground troops, a hundred 
                      casualties a day, fifty of them 
                      civilians.

      Dean hands her a bigger file.  Jane looks at similar crime 
      scenes over and over: dead men. Naked, bloodied women.

                                  JANE
                    A war zone: it s a serial killer s 
                    paradise. Nobody notices if a few 
                    more die. That s why you kept me in 
                    the dark: our killer is a soldier, 
                    isn t he?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Yes.

                    He must ve finished his tour. Came 
                    to Boston to meet up with Hoyt. But 
                    Hoyt was behind bars.

                    We started investigating the

                    They did. We couldn t find a 
                      connection. Until the bulletin for 
                    the Yeager killings came across my 
                    desk.

                                  JANE
                    We have the Apprentice s DNA, his 
                    prints. If he s a soldier, he has 
                    be in a military database. And he s 
                    not. We checked.

      The two men look at each other. Dean sighs.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Have you ever heard of  sheep 
                    dipping ?

      She shakes her head  no. 

                                  AGENT DEAN (CONT'D)
                    It s when the C.I.A. borrows a 
                    soldier for a Black Ops mission. 

                                    SENATOR CONWAY
                    Green Berets were sheep-dipped so 
                    they could secretly train the 
                      Mujahideen in Afghanistan. Their 
                      identities were wiped from all 
                      databases.

                                  JANE
                    So they couldn t be identified as 
                    American military. You think our 
                      Apprentice was a green beret, 
                    working for the C.I.A.?

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    Hoyt was always crazy. But our 
                      Apprentice was an elite soldier. 
                    Maybe he stopped being able to tell 
                    the difference. We train our best 
                    men to be killers, and we re 
                    surprised when they are. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I hate that he s a soldier.

                                  JANE
                    Me, too. Wait, that s the 
                      connection. What if he had other 
                    training? Hoyt enrolled at Ft. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 54

      Dean pulls to a stop in front of Jane s hotel. 

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    If you get hungry, Washington Grill 
                    makes great steaks.

      Jane hesitates: is he asking her out? She doesn t want to 
        misinterpret him. She waits. He doesn t say anything. She 
      gets out, hides her disappointment: back to Jane The Cop. 

                                  JANE 
                    See you in the morning.


      Jane flops on the bed. KNOCK, KNOCK. She straightens up, 
      looks through the peephole: it s Dean. She can t help 
      herself: she SMILES as she opens the door.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    I was asking you out, okay?

                                  JANE
                     Out  out? 
                          (off his nod)
                    Didn t want to be presumptuous.

                                  AGENT DEAN
                    So?

                                  JANE
                    So, yes. Just gimme a minute.

      He smiles as he leaves her room.


      Jane looks beautiful with a little make-up and a fresh shirt. 
      Her cellphone rings: POP version of FUNERAL DIRGE. She 
      answers it.

      Maura is in Jane s apartment while UNIFORMS SWARM. It s 
      destroyed: couch is reduced to knife slits and stuffing. 
      Everything in smashed. 

                                  MAURA
                    I m in your apartment.

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                  MAURA
                    They got in, Jane. I m just glad 
                    you weren t here.

                                  JANE
                    Is anything missing?

                                  MAURA
                    I can t really tell.

                                  JANE 
                    I ll catch the next plane.

                                  MAURA
                    I have to go to my office. I ll 
                    have a uniform stay until you get 
                    here. Jane --

                                  JANE
                    What?

                                  MAURA
                    Be careful.

      Jane HANGS up. Throws clothes and her gun into her suitcase, 
      starts out the door. Dean is there, mid-knock.

                                  JANE 
                    I have to go. He was in my 
                      apartment.

      She hurries past him without a  good-bye.

                                          ACT FIVE


      A taxi pulls PAST a parked Boston PD patrol car. CORONER S 
      VAN BLOCKS the sidewalk and ENTRANCE to Jane s building.  
      Jane JUMPS out of the cab, grabs her suitcase. She tries to 
      SQUEEZE past the van. Morgue Attendant 1, who was at the 
      first crime scene, stops her.

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    Uh, Detective Rizzoli, can you I.D. 
                    the body before you go in? 

                                  JANE
                    What body?

      Morgue Attendant shrugs, baffled, points to the van.

                                  MORGE ATTENDANT 1
                    Sorry, thought you knew. Doctor 
                    Isles said it s your neighbor, uh -- 

      As he looks through paperwork --

                                  MORGUE ATTENDANT 1
                    It s a young female, 20 s maybe --

                                  JANE
                    Oh god -- Avery? Is it Avery?

      Jane JUMPS into the back of the van. She SHAKES as she UNZIPS 
      the black body bag. INSIDE IS WARREN HOYT. 

                                  HOYT
                    Nice to see you Jane.

      Jane SCREAMS. The Morgue Attendant gets in behind her, locks 
      the doors. Hoyt HOLDS UP a Taser Gun. 

      ZZZZT! He STUNS her. Jane DROPS to the floor, WRITHES in 
      pain. Hoyt climbs into the driver s seat, PULLS AWAY as 
      Morgue Attendant Tasers Jane again. She blacks out as we --

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      FADE UP FROM BLACK:


      Jane opens her eyes. She s tightly duct-taped: hands bound in 
      front at her waist. Ankles and knees TAPED. She SQUIRMS like 
      a caught fish. Van VEERS suddenly, PITCHES her into her 
      suitcase. She FIGHTS to move her hands enough to reach it. RIZZOLI by Janet Tamaro   PILOT -- NETWORK DRAFT     8-27-09   pg. 57




      Jane s facedown. She BLINKS as the doors are THROWN OPEN. 
      Hoyt SMILES like he s off to a ballgame. He and The 
      Apprentice drag Jane to the lip of the van. Hoyt lowers his 
      head so he and Jane are nose-to-nose. He RUNS THE SCALPEL 
      along her cheek.

                                  HOYT
                    I am so happy to finish what we 
                    started.

      The SCALPEL BITES into her cheek, draws blood. IN ONE FAST 
      MOVE, she head-butts Hoyt then FLIPS to face him. In her 
      TAPED HANDS, she CLUTCHES the gun from her suitcase. BOOM! 

      He goes down. The Apprentice LUNGES. BOOM! He FALLS. Jane 
      GRABS the scalpel, saws off the duct tape, JUMPS OUT. She 
      stands over Hoyt, raises her gun. He smiles. She FIRES twice.

      ANGLE ON: Hoyt, smiling as he holds out his bloody palms. 

                                  HOYT (CONT'D)
                    We match.

      COP CARS FLY IN. LIGHTS AND SIRENS. The cavalry has arrived. 
      But Jane doesn t need them. Our girl has rescued herself. 
      Maura PULLS right up to Jane, WHEELS SCREECHING. Jumps out.

                                  MAURA
                    Jane!

      Jane and Maura EMBRACE. 

                                  MAURA (CONT'D)
                    Are you okay?

                                  JANE
                    Um...it was kind of a weird day.

      Agent Dean WATCHES them in the b.g.

                                  MAURA 
                    Dean was really worried.

                                  JANE 
                    Oh, so you were hoping I was out of 
                    the picture, weren t you?

      They JUMP in, PEEL off like Thelma and Louise. Dean watches 
      them. Now he s confused. They LAUGH like 7th grade girls as 
      they drive away.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
