  A flash of daylight as the front door opens, briefly letting 
  sunlight into the dank surroundings. HOTCH steps in. He sizes up 
  the dive and walks toward --


  A booth. SAM COOPER sits drinking coffee and reading from a 
  batch of files. He s 50, intense, quiet and dressed like he 
  belongs in the place. His head is in a file as he HEARS --

                              HOTCH
                You never were one for offices. 

  Cooper looks up to see Hotch. They shake. 

                                COOPER
                Thanks for coming. 

                              HOTCH
                I don t have long. I m leaving on a 
                case. 

                                COOPER
                I know. San Francisco. 
                          (off Hotch)
                I hear things. 

  Hotch sits. 

                              HOTCH
                What s going on?

                                COOPER
                How much do you know about the case 
                you re working?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  4.

    CONTINUED:

                              HOTCH
                I m on my way in to look at the 
                files. 

                                COOPER
                Let me give you a preview. 

  And Hotch now realizes these files are all his case. Odd. Cooper 
  opens one. He flips through CRIME SCENE PHOTOS as --

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                Two years ago a male body turned up 
                in Golden Gate Park. Massive amount 
                of blunt force trauma, defensive 
                wounds, single gunshot to the back 
                of the head. Over the next three 
                days, three more bodies, same M.O. 
                After that, nothing. Until ...
                          (opens second file)
                Exactly one year later. Dead male, 
                badly beaten, shot execution style 
                followed by three more vics over 
                the next three days. 

                              HOTCH
                Until last night. 

                                COOPER
                One year later. 

                              HOTCH
                Which means we have three days to 
                crack this thing before the trail 
                goes cold again. 

  Cooper nods. Takes a sip of coffee. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                So, why all the interest?

                                COOPER
                San Francisco PD sent us the file a 
                year ago after the trail went cold. 
                  I consulted on the phone.  

                              HOTCH
                And?

                                COOPER
                I have a theory. It might be 
                nothing. 

  A beat. Cooper waves over a WAITRESS. She pours coffee. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  5.

    CONTINUED: (2)

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                You want coffee?

                              HOTCH
                How is it?

                                COOPER
                When was the last time you had a 
                tetanus shot?

                              HOTCH
                          (to waitress)
                I m good, thanks. 

  She walks away. Cooper opens a third file. CSPs of --

                                COOPER
                Two years ago, the day after the 
                murders stopped, a single dad and 
                his fifteen-year-old brunette 
                daughter were found dead in their 
                car. He d been badly beaten and had 
                  defensive wounds. They were both 
                shot multiple times. 

  And, file number four. We see photos of --

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                Last year, again one day after the 
                dead males stopped showing up, 
                another father and his brunette 
                  daughter. This one was fourteen. 
                Same wounds on the dad. They were 
                found in their home. Unsub killed 
                the wife as well. All were shot 
                multiple times. 

                              HOTCH
                You think it s all connected?

                                COOPER
                I think it s a hell of a 
                  coincidence. 

                              HOTCH
                The police disagreed?

                                COOPER
                  Ballistics didn t match. Neither 
                set was dumped like the male 
                victims. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  6.

    CONTINUED: (3)

                              HOTCH
                Which is why my team caught the 
                case this year instead of yours. 
                San Francisco PD wants a team with 
                no preconceptions. 

  Cooper nods. But --

                                COOPER
                The fathers and daughters? Turns 
                out both sets had been awol for 
                days before they turned up dead but 
                no one ever reported them missing. 
                  Something s not right. 

                              HOTCH
                  I promise we ll check it out. 

                                COOPER
                That s not what I m saying. You 
                only have three days. You don t 
                have time to go chasing this.

                              HOTCH
                Then, what?

                                COOPER
                Bring my team in. You work the 
                bodies in Golden Gate Park. We ll 
                test my theory about the fathers 
                and daughters. If I m right, each 
                half of the case helps solve the 
                other. 

                              HOTCH
                I ll call the Director. Tell her 
                you re working the case with us.

  He puts out his hand to shake but ... nothing. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                You already asked her...

                                COOPER
                She s not what I d call strong at 
                thinking outside the box. 

                              HOTCH
                What d she say?






                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  7.

    CONTINUED: (4)

                                COOPER
                  Something about not authorizing an 
                  investigation when we don t even 
                know if there s a father and 
                daughter missing. 

  A beat. 

                              HOTCH
                If you ignore her order, it s your 
                career on the line. 

                                COOPER
                Won t be the last time. 

                              HOTCH
                I m serious. 

                                COOPER
                So am I. 

  A beat. Hotch considers. 

                                COOPER (CONT D) (cont d)
                I m telling you. Right now, there s 
                a father and daughter missing in 
                San Francisco and, for whatever 
                reason, no one s looking for them.

                              HOTCH
                Don t bring your whole team. It ll 
                be harder for her to know you re 
                defying orders if you leave a 
                couple behind. Can you set up shop 
                on your own?

                                COOPER
                Are you kidding me?

                              HOTCH
                I ll see you in San Francisco. 

  They shake. Hotch exits. Cooper picks up the files. As he looks 
  at one of the CSPs of the father-daughter murders --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  It s cold, dark, wet. Ben and Jane are each chained separately 
  to metal pipes. Ben thrashes against his chains. With every 
  strain you sense Jane s anxiety growing. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  8.

    CONTINUED:

                              JANE
                Stop. 

                              BEN
                If I can snap the chain... 

                              JANE
                You re just gonna hurt yourself. 

  But Ben thrashes against the chains more. Until Jane YELLS --

                              JANE (CONT D) (cont d)
                Stop it... Please... Just stop.

  And Ben stops, exhausted. The door opens. The UNSUB enters. 

                              UNSUB
                Are you okay?

                              BEN
                Get away from her. 

                              UNSUB
                I heard screaming. 

                              BEN
                I said get away from her. 

  The Unsub just stares down Ben. Ben is powerless. 

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                What the hell do you want?

                              UNSUB
                It s simple. You give her to me, 
                you both live. 

                              BEN
                Go to hell. 

  The Unsub stares at Jane. A beat. 

                              UNSUB
                If that s your answer. 

  He exits. As Ben and Jane watch the door slam behind him.

                                        ACT ONE

  FADE IN:


  Hotch with ROSSI, PRENTISS, MORGAN and REID. Files out. JJ steps 
  in, closing her phone. 

                              JENNIFER
                San Francisco police already have a 
                war room set up for us. They know 
                we only have a three-day window. 

                              ROSSI
                What do we know about the past 
                years  victims?

                              REID
                The Tenderloin District has a high 
                  concentration of drug addicts and 
                homeless people. The victims were 
                all transients from the area. 

  They look at the CSPs of past victims. 

                                MORGAN
                So, the Unsub s choosing easy 
                targets that won t be missed. That 
                tells me he s not concerned with 
                the challenge of the hunt. The 
                victims are part of a larger plan. 

                              PRENTISS
                Which he executes on the same few 
                days every year.

                              HOTCH
                Have we found any significance to 
                the dates?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  10.

    CONTINUED:

                              REID
                Nothing historically. It must be 
                personal for the Unsub. 

                              JENNIFER
                I ll have Garcia run the last ten 
                years of crime records for the days 
                in question. Maybe it s some kind 
                of anniversary. 

  Hotch nods. Good. And --

                              HOTCH
                You and Reid get set up in the 
                police station. Dave and Morgan, 
                head to the coroner s office. 
                Prentiss and I will go to the dump 
                site. I don t think any of us 
                should plan on getting much sleep 
                the next three days. 

                              ROSSI
                What about Cooper s team? You said 
                he had a theory. 

                              HOTCH
                They ll work it themselves. If they 
                get a lead, they ll bring it to us.

                                MORGAN
                Why not come along for the ride? 

                              HOTCH
                They re working off the clock. 

  The others share a look. That s weird. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                They ve got their own way of doing 
                things. I m sure you ve heard the 
                stories. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, they won t be at the police 
                station?

                              HOTCH

  A small travel agency. We move past a pair of WOMEN, quietly 
  going about their business until we reach --


  A dark, dusty back room. Cooper drags a chalk board as MICK 
  FLEMING and PROPHET carry in an evidence board. Mick is 30, 
  British. He s scruffy and charming. He also knows it. Prophet is 
  in his 30s. His edge is street smart but he has a layer of calm.

                              MICK
                When we finish setting up, remind 
                me to tell the ladies out front the 
                travel agency business is dead. 

  A light comes on. Reveal GINA LaSALLE on a ladder. She s hooked 
  a makeshift light up with an extension cord. She s 28, equally 
  tough, pretty and smart in the same no-nonsense way. 

                              GINA
                Leave them alone. 

  Gina descends and begins dragging a table across the floor. 

                              MICK
                Turns out there s this thing called 
                the internet. You can actually book 
                tickets on your own now. 

                              GINA
                Don t think I won t hurt you. 

                              MICK
                Don t think I won t like it. 

  She picks a pile of laptops and extension cords off the ground.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  12.

                              GINA
                Make yourself useful. 

  She hands him the pile. Mick shoots a look to Cooper. 

                                COOPER
                Don t look at me. She s the one who 
                told me to drag the chalk board. 

                              PROPHET
                 Least we re blessed with a nice 
                setup. 

  The others nod. And now we get a good look. It s a shithole. 

                              PROPHET (cont d)
                How d you hook it up?

                                COOPER
                You know how it goes. I know a guy 
                who knows a guy who knows a 
                  slumlord. 

                              GINA
                So, what now?

                              MICK
                You pack a crystal ball? 

                              GINA
                Don t be a smartass. 

                              MICK
                  Seriously. How are we supposed to 
                conjure potential victims of a 
                crime that might not have been 
                  committed out of thin air in a 
                major American city?

  Cooper takes chalks and writes: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3.

                                COOPER
                Start with the girl. San Francisco 
                has a population of 800,000. Only 
                  forty-five percent is white. What 
                does that leave?

                              PROPHET
                Three hundred and sixty thousand. 

                                COOPER
                Half those are male. That gets us 
                to 180,000. Check school absences.

                If he hadn t been shot, he probably 
                would have died eventually from

  Rossi lifts up the man s hands. Each are bruised and swollen.

                              ROSSI
                He definitely landed a few shots of 
                his own.

                There s powder residue against his

  Ben walks. Once he s past the Unsub and Jane, the Unsub falls in

    A warehouse-style space. A square area seems to have been taped 
  off, on the ground. Across the way, Ben sees --

  A MAN, shirtless, chained to a pole. His body is covered in 
  welts. Behind the man, Ben can just make out TWO other MEN, 
  locked in separate rooms. The Unsub keeps the gun on Ben. 

                              UNSUB
                Unchain him. 

  Ben walks to the other man and unlocks him. The moment he does -- 
  bam -- the other man punches Ben. He drops to a knee.

  Ben looks at the other man, waiting to fight. Ben nods and the 
  Unsub steps back, giving way to --

  The other man. He lunges. Ben manages to sidestep but the man 
  kicks at Ben. The pain seems to awaken Ben to the reality. The

  bleeds. Ben grabs his own hand. Landing the punch was painful. 

  The other man lands a shot to the body. Ben winces but head-
  butts the other man. He reels then takes a swing. Blood pours 
  from the cut. As they stand, trading blows --

  Jane, watches through the half-open cell door. Off her.

                So, we re looking for an Unsub 
                whose preferential targets are 
                  thirty-year-old junkies, forty-year-
                old fathers and fourteen-year-old 
                girls. 

                                COOPER
                I know it sounds crazy. 

                              PROPHET
                Crazy and stupid are two different 
                things. 

                              GINA
                The victims have to be part of some 
                larger agenda. He s too meticulous 
                for any of this to be random. 

                              PROPHET
                We just need to find the father and 
                  daughter. 

  Gina stands and walks to a printer. She collects pages.

                                COOPER
                Are those today s absences?

                              GINA
                Some. We re talking over two 
                hundred middle schools and high 
                schools, an outbreak of swine flu 
                paranoia and about half the offices 
                were already closed before we 
                started making calls. 

                                COOPER
                Right. 

  A beat. Is it a lost cause? But the others offer --

                              MICK
                I m running names against yearbook 
                photos to narrow down brunettes. 

                              PROPHET
                We work bios of the dads tonight. 
                When school opens in the morning, 
                we make the rest of the calls. 

  Cooper assesses his team. A beat. He gives an appreciative nod. 

                                                                              CUT TO:    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  21.



  Jane watches the fight. She can t see everything but it s clear 
  from this POV that each man is exhausted. They trade blows. 
  Scratch and claw. Jane winces with the punches as we --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Ben and the other men. Each is badly beaten. Blood and sweat and 
  saliva fly. The Unsub stands watching, gun in hand. 

  Ben grabs the other man s hair. He scratches at Ben s eyes. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Jane. She sees the two men fall. Her POV --

  The Unsub circles, blocking her view. One man rolls on top of 
  the other but we can t make out who is who. An arm wails -- the 
  man on top beating the man on the bottom. 

  The Unsub yanks the man on top off and pushes him away but Jane 
  is blocked. She HEARS --

                              UNSUB
                Can you stand? ... Answer me.

  He glances back toward Jane then points the gun directly into 
  the back of the fighter on the ground s head. 

                              UNSUB (CONT D) (cont d)
                Last chance. Stand up. 

  ON JANE as we hear a SHOT --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Cooper crosses out Day 1. Circles Day 2. Everyone is exhausted. 
  Coffee cups abound. It s clearly been an all-nighter. Find --

                              PROPHET
                You re sure? Both days? Yes, ma am. 
                Thank you. 

  Gina and Mick take notice. As Prophet hangs up his phone --




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  22.

                Now, our God, we give you thanks 
                and praise your glorious name. 

  Which really gets Gina and Mick s attention. She yells --

                              GINA
                Cooper. 

                                COOPER
                Whatta we got?

  Prophet holds up a print-out of a yearbook photo of Jane. 

                              PROPHET
                This is Jane Marks. She s fourteen. 
                She didn t show up for school 
                  yesterday or this morning. 

                                COOPER
                And the dad?

  He picks up another printout. It s Ben s DMV photo. 

                              PROPHET
                Ben. He hasn t been at his 
                  contracting company for the last 
                two days. 

                              MICK
                Damn. 

  Cooper takes out his phone. Dials --

                                COOPER
                Hotch. Cooper. I think we found em.

  Leslie closes the door. Hotch and Cooper watch. 

                                COOPER
                We re trying to determine whether 
                your husband and daughter are 
                missing. 

                                LESLIE
                Oh, god. 

                              HOTCH
                Mrs. Marks?

  She looks through the window, to the street. 

                                LESLIE
                The man who called said he was 
                watching me. 

                                COOPER
                So, someone has abducted them?

                                LESLIE
                He said if he saw anyone from the 
                police or FBI step foot in my 
                house, he d kill Ben and Jane. 

  A beat. Hotch and Cooper process as Leslie says --

                                LESLIE (CONT D) (cont d)
                You just got my family murdered. 

  Off Hotch and Cooper. 


                                  END OF ACT ONE    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  24.


                                        ACT TWO

  FADE IN:


  A grainy video tape. A badly beaten man kneels against a plain 
  white wall. His feet and hands are bound. The Unsub, approaches, 
  his faces covered by a ski mask. He puts a gun to the back of 
  the man s head. Fires. He falls. 

  Leslie watches, shaken, along with Hotch and Cooper. 

                              HOTCH
                That s the victim from the park. 

                                LESLIE
                The man on the phone told me he had 
                Ben and Jane and he d kill them if 
                  I brought in the police. He said if 
                I needed proof, I should check my 
                front porch. When I opened the 
                door, this tape was there. 

                                COOPER
                He s careful. There s nothing to 
                  distinguish him or his location. 

                              HOTCH
                Did he give any other instructions?

                                LESLIE
                He said he d call with more. 

                                COOPER
                I ll have the tape analyzed. We ll 
                also need access to your phone 
                records to see if we can determine 
                where he called from. 

                                LESLIE
                Do you think he s watching? Is he 
                going to kill them?

                              HOTCH
                This video was shot from a tripod 
                which means he probably doesn t 
                have a partner. It would be almost 
                  impossible to hold your family 
                prisoner and do surveillance on you 
                  simultaneously. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  25.

    CONTINUED:

                                LESLIE
                And he s done this before? Why 
                didn t someone come forward later 
                to say what happened?

                                COOPER
                The first time was a single father 
                and his daughter. The second time, 
                he brought them home and also 
                killed the wife. He doesn t leave 
                anyone with knowledge alive. 

  A beat as Leslie processes this. 

                              HOTCH
                Where were your husband and 
                daughter before they were taken?

                                LESLIE
                On Tuesdays, Jane always goes to a 
                friend s after school then meets 
                Ben at his office to drive home.

                                COOPER
                Who else knows that routine?

                                LESLIE
                I don t know. No one. A few 
                friends, maybe?

                                COOPER
                We re gonna need you to write down 
                names of anyone who might even 
                possibly know. Can you do that?

                              HOTCH
                We ll post agents here with you, to 
                keep you safe. 

  She nods. Hotch moves, guiding Cooper away as he says --

                              HOTCH (cont d)
                Can you excuse me a moment. 


  Hotch and Cooper enter the living room. A private conversation.

                              HOTCH
                Your theory was right. Now, let us 
                work it. If you get back to D.C. 
                now, the Director will never know 
                you ignored her orders. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  26.

    CONTINUED:

  A beat. Cooper takes a photo of a young BOY from his wallet. 

                                COOPER
                Do you know who this is?

                              HOTCH
                No. 

                                COOPER
                Wanna know why? ... Cuz no one 
                knows the name of a dead kid from 
                some case we didn t actually work.

  A beat. Hotch waits him out. Cooper looks at the photo.

                                COOPER (cont d)
                There s no chance I m gonna leave 
                until we know if Ben Marks and his 
                daughter are safe. If anyone has a 
                problem with that they can go to 
                hell. 

  Hotch considers this. A beat.

                              HOTCH
                We can pair up your team with mine. 
                Anything we investigate will have 
                to be documented. So, we ll have my 
                people on the record and use yours 
                to double the manpower. 

  Cooper nods. Thank you. Hotch s phone rings. He answers.

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                  Hotchner... Where? ... Are we sure 
                it s our Unsub? ... Okay. Yeah. 

  Leslie enters. She s caught the end of the Hotch s conversation. 

                              HOTCH (CONT D) (cont d)
                They found another body.

                                LESLIE
                Is it my husband?

                              HOTCH
                I m afraid we don t know yet. 

                                                                              CUT TO:    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  27.



  Hotch on the phone. Cooper tries to guide Leslie away. She holds 
  a piece of paper. 

                                COOPER
                Mrs. Marks, please. 

                              HOTCH
                Are you certain? Okay. Thanks.

  -- And Morgan and Gina enter from the opposite direction. Leslie 
  looks at Cooper. Her world is spinning. 

                                COOPER
                Don t worry. They parked on a side 
                road and entered through the back. 

  As Hotch hangs up. Leslie turns. 

                              HOTCH
                The body in Golden Gate Park is not 
                your husband. 

                                LESLIE
                You re sure?

                              HOTCH
                One of the agents there has your 
                  husband s license photo. He s sure. 

  And the weight of this hits Leslie. They give her a moment. 

                                COOPER
                These are Agents LaSalle and 
                Morgan. They re going to stay here 
                with you and make sure you re safe. 

                                LESLIE
                Thank you. 

  As Hotch and Cooper exit, Gina pulls Cooper to the side. 

                              GINA
                I won t be any use here.

  A beat. He exits, toward Hotch. Gina walks to Morgan and Leslie. 
  Gina s conversation has been private but Morgan has noticed. 
  Leslie hands over the piece of paper. 

                                LESLIE
                This is everyone who might know Ben 
                and Jane s routine. 

                                MORGAN
                Good. We re going to set up a trap 
                and trace on your phone in case the 
                man who took your husband and 
                daughter calls again. 

                              GINA
                We also need to ask you some 
                  questions. Do you feel up to that?
                          (she nods)
                Is there anyone you can think of 
                that might want to harm your 
                  daughter?

                                LESLIE
                I don t know. Honestly, lately 
                she s felt like a stranger.

  Ben is badly beaten. Across the cell, Jane sits huddled, not 
  speaking. You get the sense it s been like this for hours. 

                              BEN
                I need you to listen to me because 
                it might be the last time I ever 
                get to talk to you.

  We see Jane, not facing him but listening.

                  I haven t been a good enough 
                father. You re fourteen and you 
                have no idea how terrifying that 
                is. And, instead of listening to 
                you or remembering my own fights 
                with my dad, I ve tried to control 
                what you do and who you see because 
                I wanted to keep you safe and I 
                wanted you to go off to school and 
                get a good job and maybe some day 
                fall in love and ask me to walk you 
                down the aisle. But I never 
                bothered to ask you if that s what 
                you want and I m so sorry. I m 
                still your dad, it s my job to look 
                out for you, but I should have been 
                a better listener too. 

  A beat. Ben pauses. Jane listens. 

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                I know you can hear me. I m not 
                asking you to say anything. I just 
                want you to know that I understand 
                I can t control everything. But I 
                also need the last words you hear 
                me say be that I love you.

  Off Jane, listening.

                              HOTCH
                We think the Unsub most likely 
                spent time in prison. If he s 
                local, that means San Quentin. With 
                his level of organization and his 
                  obsession with these specific 
                dates, there s a chance someone 
                who s still inside might recognize 
                him from the profile.

  A GUARD leads Rossi and Prophet to a table where TRE BROOKS,

                The Prophet returns. 

  They shake. Prophet says to Rossi --

                              PROPHET
                This is Tre Brooks. Me and him know

  Hotch and Reid address Cotton, Gilmore and a room full of cops. 

                              HOTCH
                The Unsub we re looking for very 
                likely has a prison record. 

                              REID
                He s white and, judging by the age 
                of the men he abducts, probably in 
                his thirties. 

                              HOTCH
                  Considering the terrain in which he 
                dumps the bodies, we believe he s 
                  physically imposing or, at the very 
                least, extremely fit. 

                              REID
                He also has access to a space 
                that s large enough to house and 
                control a number of prisoners 
                without disturbing any neighbors. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

                for controlling the prisoners, 
                  especially in the yard.

                                LESLIE
                I don t understand what any of this 
                has to do with Ben and Jane. 

                              GINA
                We think the man who took them has 
                  a daughter of his own. She s most 
                likely a brunette, like Jane. 

                                MORGAN
                The dates he chooses probably 
                  correspond to an event involving 
                his daughter. We just have to 
                figure out what that is. 

                                LESLIE
                And you think he s making these men 
                fight each other?

                                MORGAN
                Our guess is he lost his own 
                daughter in some way and it s 
                symbolic of him not fighting for 
                her in the first place. 

                                LESLIE
                I don t understand. 

                              GINA
                A lot of times, killers choose 
                victims that are surrogates for 
                someone else, like a wife or 
                mother. In this case, we think his 
                own guilt is making him choose 
                  surrogates that represent himself. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  37.

                If you re going to be in my house, 
                I need the truth from you.

                                LESLIE
                I d like to lie down. 

                              GINA
                Of course. 

  Leslie walks away. When she does, Gina paces, like she doesn t 
  know where to be. She walks to the mantel. Picks up a picture of 
  Jane. Off Gina, looking from the photo to Leslie, walking away.

                  prisoners, he could be out there 
                right now, looking for his next 
                victim. 

                              PRENTISS
                He s right.

  She addresses Hotch and Cooper. 

                              PRENTISS (CONT D) (cont d)
                It s worth a shot. It can t hurt 
                having extra eyes to look for 
                possible abductions on the street.

  A beat. Cooper says to Hotch --

                                COOPER
                The kid s the best sniper I ve ever 
                seen. He could view a lot of ground 
                from a rooftop vantage.

  Mick gives a pleased smile to Prentiss as Hotch asks her --

                              HOTCH
                Are you comfortable on the ground 
                solo?

                              PRENTISS
                  Absolutely. 

                              HOTCH
                Get mic d up. Make sure you re in 
                constant communication. 

  As Prentiss and Mick hurry off.

                streets while you sit on your butt 
                on some roof. 

                              MICK
                You heard the man. Are you really 
                gonna make me expound on my own 
                prowess? It s undignified. 

  And now it s time for Prentiss to smile. A beat. 

                              PRENTISS
                You see anything?

                              MICK
                From up here -- nothing but 
                  potential victims. No Unsubs. 

  Prentiss looks around. She agrees. And as she scans the faces of 
  the men walking the streets, we --

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  One of the men taken from the streets. He stares at the Unsub. 
  He slides the keys to the chained man as we --

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  Ben and Jane. As the door opens and the Unsub enters. 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  Another open door. Gina stares at Leslie as she sleeps. 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  41.



  Ben and the other man, fighting. Each are shirtless. Bloody. As 
  they trade punches, we --

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


  Bam. Ben lands a hard punch. And suddenly everything is loud, 
  fast, ugly. Bam. Ben lands another shot. 

  The other man scratches at Ben s face but Ben lands another 
  shot. The man falls and Ben drops, immediately, onto the man s 
  chest. One. Two. Three. He hammers him with punches until --

  Ben tilts sideways and staggers off. The other man is defeated. 
  The Unsub immediately points a gun at Ben. 

                              UNSUB
                To the death. 

  Ben pauses. His POV --

  Jane watches the scene through the door to their cell. 

                              UNSUB (CONT D) (cont d)
                To the death or your daughter dies. 

  Another beat. Finally, Ben drops back on the man. He glances 
  once toward his daughter but then raises his hand and punches 
  the other man. Again. And again until --

  Cooper and Prophet. Cooper crosses off Day 2 and circles Day 3 
  as Rossi, Hotch, Reid and JJ enter. 

                                COOPER
                Did your analyst get you the data?

                              JENNIFER
                I can lay it out for you. 

                                COOPER
                Good. We need to cross-reference it 
                against the potential suspect pool. 

  JJ walks to a table and begins laying out folders. As she does, 
  Prophet s phone RINGS. He answers. 

                              PROPHET
                Hello... Yeah. We can be there. Out 
                the door now. 

  He hangs up. Turns to Rossi --

                You up for a ride to San Quentin?

                              ROSSI

  They exit, passing Prentiss and Mick, who walk toward where the 
  others begin going through four stacks of papers.

                The profile tells us he s been in 
                prison and probably lost a teenage 
                daughter in some way that 
                  corresponds to the dates he abducts 
                and kills his victims. 

                              REID
                We have the dates in question 
                divided into four subsets. This 
                pile is teenage girls ages thirteen 
                to sixteen who were removed from 
                their father s care. These are 
                deaths of girls the same age. The 
                last two are men arrested for 
                violent crimes or who began serving 
                prison sentences during the same 
                window.

                I m calling to check on the status 
                of your case.

                Not at the moment, no. 

                              GRIFFITH

                We re following a second line of 
                  investigation ...

  Before the conversation goes any further, Cooper reaches out to 
  take the phone from Hotch. A beat, then --

                You should know, Agent Hotchner had 
                nothing to do with this. 

                              GRIFFITH
                We have to be invited in by the 
                locals. You weren t. You just 
                  jeopardized our relationship with 
                police on every case that comes 
                after this. 

                                COOPER
                You do realize my theory was right.

                              GRIFFITH
                I want you back today. 

                                COOPER
                I can t do that.

                Tell Agent Hotchner I ll deal with 
                both of you when you get back. 

  They each hang up. Stay with Cooper. As the others look to see 
  the effects of the conversation, he says simply --

                So, where were we?

                I get it. You work deep cover, you 
                lose yourself, you lose 
                  relationships, you lose time. So, 
                when you finally come out, you feel 
                like you gotta keep moving a 
                million miles an hour to make up 
                for it all. 

  A beat. Gina suddenly looks at the diary. 

                              GINA
                Until you figure out how to process 
                it all and move forward.

  She hurries out to --


  The hall. Gina catches up to Leslie. Morgan steps out.

                Jane s diary only goes back nine 
                months. What made her start keeping 
                it?

                                LESLIE
                We were having problems with her. 
                It was causing tension between me 
                and Ben. We went to see a family 
                  counselor. She suggested Jane keep 
                  a journal.

                Exactly. And the place also did 
                  evaluations for social services. We 
                profiled that the Unsub might have 
                had his daughter taken away from 
                him.

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                Jane.... Janey ....

  And they disappear out the door, leaving Ben chained alone.

                                        ACT FOUR

  FADE IN:


  The agents and Swat members fan out. We see the blood-stained 
  floor. They silently share looks. Track with --

  Hotch and JJ. They open a door to --


  An office. A cot rests against a wall. Food wrappers everywhere. 
  This is where the Unsub sleeps. As Hotch and JJ clear the room --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Prentiss and Reid, outside a door. He nods. She opens the door 
  and Reid enters to reveal --


  A MAN, chained to pole. He instinctively cowers. 

                              REID
                It s okay. You re safe. 

                              PRENTISS
                Where s the man who did this to 
                you?

                              MAN
                I don t know. 

                                                                              CUT TO:    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  56.



  Cooper and Mick, outside another door. Cooper nods. Mick flings 
  open the door and Cooper steps in, gun drawn. We see --


  Ben, chained, beaten. Mick enters. Cooper makes sure the room is 
  clear. Mick takes out his phone. 

                              MICK
                This is FBI Special Agent Mick 
                Fleming. I need paramedics 
                  immediately to 743 Turk Street. 

  As Cooper kneels next to Ben. 

                                COOPER
                Where s Jane?

                              BEN
                He took her. 

                                COOPER
                How long ago?

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Hotch and JJ approach Cooper s open doorway. As they get there --

                              JENNIFER
                The place is clear. 

                                COOPER
                He s on the street. He has the 
                girl. 

  Hotch takes out his cell. 

                              HOTCH
                Garcia. I need vehicle information 
                for John Vincent Keel. Tell police 
                we need an APB.

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Morgan on the phone. Gina and Leslie watch. He hangs up. 

                                MORGAN
                We have your husband. He s alive. 

                                LESLIE
                And Jane?

                                MORGAN
                She s still missing but we think 
                she hasn t been harmed. 

                                LESLIE
                What does that mean?

                                MORGAN
                We believe the Unsub left with Jane 
                on foot. 

                                LESLIE
                Oh, god. 

                                MORGAN
                We have police all over the area. 

                              GINA
                Is there a neighbor you can stay 
                with?

                                LESLIE
                Nick and Linda.  

                              GINA
                Good. We ll take you there and call 
                a squad car to stay with you... I m 
                gonna be there when we find Jane.  

  Leslie nods. A beat. She looks at Gina. 






                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  58.

    CONTINUED:

                                LESLIE
                If something happens to her, can 
                you... I can t hear that from a 
                  stranger. 

                              GINA
                Let s just get her home safe. 

                                LESLIE
                Please. Promise me. 

  A beat. 

                              GINA
                  I promise. 

  Leslie nods. As Gina guides her toward the door. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Gina drives like a bat out of hell. Morgan is shotgun. 

                              GINA
                Hold on. 

  And she turns --


  Morgan looks at Gina. Damn. They re flying. 

                              GINA
                What? You think I just read 
                diaries?

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Mick runs up a stairwell, lugging a pack on his back. He reaches 
  a door and steps out onto --


  Above the city. Cooper rides shotgun. 

                                COOPER
                Shine it there. Don t sweep. I want 
                  concentrated looks. Twenty seconds 
                at a time. 

  As the floodlights illuminate the streets below --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Cooper. We watch the scene from above until --

                                COOPER
                Wait. There. 

  And the spotlight illuminates --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Cooper. 

                                COOPER
                Keep it on them. Make sure you 
                don t blind our agents. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Beers on ice out on a table. Both teams assembled. Prentiss 
  grabs two beers and walks to where Mick stands with Morgan, Reid 
  and JJ. She hands a beer to Mick. 

                              PRENTISS
                Thank you. 

  Mick smiles then glances toward the others. 

                              MICK
                Look out for her. She s gonna have 
                a hard time getting over me. 

                              PRENTISS
                Like trying to kick a virus. 

                              MICK
                You know, I could have just missed 
                him. 

                              PRENTISS
                With your ego? No chance.  

  He smiles. They drink. Rossi and Prophet approach. Grab beers. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  65.

    CONTINUED:

                              ROSSI
                I think San Quentin was actually 
                nicer.  

  Mick and Prophet share a look. 

                              REID
                What?

                              PROPHET
                We re used to a whole lot worse. 

  JJ glances at Gina, across the room alone, staring at something.

                              JENNIFER
                Is she okay?

                                MORGAN
                She will be. 

  And we angle on --

  Gina, staring intently at the paper in her hand. She stands and 
  walks across the room to Cooper. She hands the object over. 

                              GINA
                I asked her mom for it. I think you 
                should have it. 

  And Cooper looks at what he s been given. It s a photo of Jane. 

                              GINA (cont d)
                It s about time you had a reminder 
                to trust your gut that had a happy 
                ending. 

  He nods, appreciative. Gina walks toward the others. Stay with --

  Cooper, staring at the photo. He puts it in his wallet, on top 
  of the photo of the boy he couldn t save. His phone RINGS. 

                                COOPER
                So, you re calling me directly now. 

                                                                    INTER-CUT WITH:


  Director Griffith. 






                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  66.

    CONTINUED:

                              GRIFFITH
                Don t get insolent. I still plan on 
                reading you and Agent Hotchner the 
                riot act when you get back. 

                                COOPER
                Well, that s something to look 
                forward to. 

                              GRIFFITH
                You did good work. Now, don t be an 
                idiot. Get on the jet with his team 
                and get home. 

                                COOPER
                          (goodbye)
                Ma am. 

  Stay with Cooper, as Hotch approaches with beers. 

                              HOTCH
                Was that the Director?

                                COOPER
                She wants to buy us a steak dinner 
                when we get back. 

  A beat. They look at their team members, unwinding together. 
  They each take a drink of their beers.  

                                COOPER (cont d)
                I was thinking about catching a 
                ride home with you. 

                              HOTCH
                Good. 

                                COOPER
                You sure there s room for another 
                team?

                              HOTCH
                  Positive. 

  Off them, watching their two teams.
