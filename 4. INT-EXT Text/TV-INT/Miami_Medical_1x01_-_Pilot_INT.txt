...where the collision has triggered a FIRE. 

KITCHEN STAFF fight to put out the flames, A TWENTY-SOMETHING 
INDIAN SOUS-CHEF being dragged from the flames. 

As the Sous-Chef is placed on the floor, the CAMERA SMASHES 
THROUGH A WALL, doing a 180 PIVOT to reveal...


...where the CAMERA PUSHES IN on a MID-FORTIES PASSENGER, his 
arm trapped under a fallen chandelier. 

As the Passenger stares, becoming aware of the blood pooling 
near his wrist, the CAMERA CRANES UP, passing through the 
ceiling and ascending into the sky for a bird s eye view of...

TWO SHIPS, BOTH TAKING ON WATER, A MILE OFF SHORE
...with injuries abounding and the clock ticking. 

In the next 199 episodes of the show, this ll be the end of 
the tease, but being a pilot we have some characters to meet

bulging saline bladders trail primed coils of IV tubing... a 
row of 'trauma shears' lie near a translucent fishing tackle 
box marked 'PARALYTICS and PAIN'.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft4.



Now Dr. Warren comes into view, stepping off her skateboard, 
and depositing it on a shelf, before crossing through...


A DRY-ERASE BOARD
...lists trauma teams ALPHA through GAMMA, the doctor symbol 
(the staff with a serpent coiled around it) being placed to 
indicate BRAVO TEAM is coming  on call . 

Warren pulls out two sets of boxed laryngoscope blade-handles, 
which she had lodged in the back of her scrubs...

DR. WARREN
(proud of herself)
We re low, so I robbed the ER. 

...and plops them on a gurney, in front of...

HEAD NURSE TUCK BRODY (47) 
...who is perched in the yoga position of Ardha Padmasana.

DR. WARREN
Man, that place is uncivilized. Kids 
puking. Guys, 15 years too old to be 
playing basketball, with multiple 
fingers out-of-joint.
(a shake of the head)
I don t understand why anyone goes 
into emergency medicine.

(old school New York accent)
 Only a fool in love can expect to 
understand the mind of another. 

DR. WARREN

TUCK
(shake of the head)
Elvis Costello.

Tuck rises (humming some Elvis Costello), revealing his 6-foot-
plus frame, marked with a scar on his cheek... a burn-mark on 
his forearm... a badly mangled pinky finger on one hand.

DR. WARREN
Is Dr. Rayner in yet?

TUCK
Not yet.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft5.



DR. WARREN
What happened to,  On time is 
2 hours early ?

TUCK
(he s noticed too)
3rd shift in a row.

FROM OFF, a MANIC CHUCKLE elicits a smile between Warren an Tuck.

TUCK
Oh, that s not a good sound.

CUT TO:

VIDEO OF A CUBAN WOMAN
...in an off-the-shoulder black dress, giving a speech to 
some charity function. The woman is clearly as nervous about 
public speaking as she is unused to her formal attire.

CUBAN WOMAN
I know you were expecting (cough) 
Dr. Rayner, but-- uh-- please 
accept me as your-- uh-- pinch-
trauma-surgeon for the evening.

More CHUCKLING as the Cuban Woman is PAUSED, CAMERA REVEALING...


...where THE CHUCKLER, DR. CHRISTOPHER DELEO (DR. C., 38), 
stands amidst a half-dozen nurses, watching the Cuban Woman on 
a TV mounted on a video cart and entertaining the troops.

And when Dr. C. speaks, he s got the slow, distinctive drawl *
of a man born and bred in the sticks of the Florida panhandle.*

DR. C.
On this morning agenda...
(pointing at himself)
...Dr. C. s cautionary tale of 
 Asymptomatic Meltdownus Stagefloppium . 

Behind Dr. C., Dr. Warren appears in the doorway with...

TUCK
Is that our girl Marisol?

DR. WARREN
Who knew Dr. Zambrano had HOT in her.

DR. C.
Who knew she even had shoulders.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft6.



Now Dr. C. presses PLAY on the remote and ON SCREEN...

DR. ZAMBRANO (ON SCREEN)
We at Ryder Medical (cough) 
practice what's known as 'team 
trauma (dry throat swallow). 

Now Dr. C. jumps on the video cart, pretending to give  Video 
Zambrano  life saving treatment.

DR. C.
See here, diaphoretic, just below 
the sweat line, slightly pale...

DR. ZAMBRANO (ON SCREEN)
 Team trauma , originally perfected 
in M*A*S*H units (cough) consists of 
dedicated units of doctors, (deep 
nervous breath) working together...

DR. C.

kicking in... pressure spiking...

The staff is eating this up.

DR. ZAMBRANO (ON SCREEN)
...to provide highly effective care 
during what s known as the  golden hour  
that defines trauma care (cough).

DR. C.
...ooh, ooh... now dropping... pulse-
thready...  V-TACH!!!!

DR. ZAMBRANO (ON SCREEN)
See, if you re in our unit (throat clear) 
that means you ve suffered an injury that 
gives you less than 60 minutes to live 
and it is our duty to treat that injury 
so that you might live (drink of water). 

On screen,  Video Zambrano  goes to flip note cards, only to 
lose her grip and have the stack tumble all over the dais, 
which is when Dr. C. makes the FLAT-LINING SOUND, hitting PAUSE 
in order to catch Zambrano in an awkward expression.

DR. C.
(big, toothy smile)
100 bucks to anyone who turns this 
into a life-sized cut-out I can 
post in the surgeon s locker room.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft7.



FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
I don't know where you got that 
video, but before you get too smug, 
ask yourself: Why did Rayner trust 
ME over YOU to fill in for him.

All turn to see... the real DR. MARISOL ZAMBRANO (36) standing 
in the doorway. Unlike on screen, she looks totally at home in 
her scrubs, her hair pulled back. 

Zambrano whispers something in SPANISH to a few of the nurses 
and everyone within earshot cracks up.

DR. C.
You know the rule, Marisol. No foreign 
languages on the trauma floor.

DR. ZAMBRANO
Take a Berlitz class, Chris, its South 
Beach. ENGLISH is the foreign language.

Laughter from the room, and then with concern in her voice...

DR. ZAMBRANO
Hey, has anyone seen Rayner?

...which is the cue for HEAD OF BRAVO TEAM, WILLIAM RAYNER (53)...

DR. RAYNER
(faux-gruff)
I have and he looks like crap. 
Don't you people have medical-
type things to do? 
(then)
Bravo Team only, please.

As the room empties to just our five: Rayner, Zambrano, Dr. 
C., Warren and Tuck, Dr. Rayner turns to Dr. C....

DR. RAYNER
Chris, when I m done with the briefing, 
I d love 5 minutes of your time.

As Dr. C. nods, sharing a quick look with Zambrano...

DR. RAYNER
(pouring a cup of coffee)
Alright, couple of agenda items 
before our shift starts.
(from his notes)
I'm hoping for a slow morning so we 
can catch up on the  Joint 
Commission  stuff. Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft8.

DR. RAYNER (CONT'D)
Also, FYI, the Army will be sending 
over field surgeons to observe next 
Tuesday. As always, give them 
whatever they need, so long as their 
presence doesn t impede patient care.

Rayner sips his coffee and when he lowers the mug he notices a 
SPOT OF COFFEE ON HIS SHOE, which he stares at a moment too long. 
The room notices, Zambrano about to say something, when...

DR. RAYNER
(this is important)
Oh, and Dr. Zambrano...

Rayner takes a meaningful breath, then...

DR. RAYNER
I m going to require you to wear that 
black dress at least 1 shift a week.

A warm smile from Rayner elicits a chuckle from the room, 
which is interrupted by Rayner's beeper going off... followed 
by Dr. C.'s and Zambrano's... then Tuck s and Warren s... and 
then, from out in the bullpen, A DOZEN MORE BEEPERS.

DR. RAYNER
So much for that slow morning.

QUICK CUTS,  HOW IT STARTS :
ECU on Tuck's eyes, as he races down a hallway... fingers flick 
the flashing 'ANSWER' toggle in a high tech 'Communications 
Room'... a hand reaches into a cooler to snag blood bags... a 
white sheet is fitted to a gurney. And over all of the above:

VOICE OVER THE RADIO (V.O.)
...we got a burn victim... Indian, 
male... 26, 3rd degree over 70%... 
then a pregnant female, mid-30 s, 
multiple lacerations... then, open 
fracture/dislocation right leg, near 
amputation of right hand... 

CUT TO:


...now in its natural working state, which is tightly 
controlled chaos. What was silent when we saw it last is now 
a cacophony of machines whirring and beeping and humming.

Dr. Rayner stands at the foot of the gurney (in the command 
trauma position), directing Dr. C. and Zambrano as they cut 
DEEPESH S (the Sous-Chef from the fire) clothes off; some of 
it melted and peeling away like plastic wrap. Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft9.



DR. C.
Don t mind us, buddy, we re just 
turning these into rip-away pants 
in case the 80 s come back.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(all business)
3rd degree bilateral lower legs.

Meanwhile Dr. Warren tentatively searches for unburned skin, 
trying to separate the charred from the bubbled...

DR. WARREN
I-- I think we ve got full thickness.

DR. C.
(his best Yoda, critical)
 There is no think, only  know . 

But Rayner pulls them back to the ABCs...

DR. RAYNER
Basics here. This guy is an airway 
disaster waiting to happen.
(then, off Deepesh s chart)
Lets say 25 minutes to first 
contact... 15 minutes with 
triage... 7 minute flight... 
(doing the math in his head)
Come on, people. The clock is 
ticking away fast.

We see that Rayner is one part orchestra conductor...

DR. RAYNER
Place a Cordis on the left, Chris...
(one part sports coach)
...come on, guys, we've done this 
better a 100 times before...
(one part historian)
...employ the exact technique we 
used in the Ocala fires.

...the mood in his Trauma suite is urgent, yet efficient and 
as hard as Zambrano and Dr. C. were on each other in the break 
room, they re cohesive here, where it counts. 

DR. ZAMBRANO
Will you...

DR. C.
(just knows what she needs)
...yeah, yeah, got it.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft10.

DR. C. (CONT'D)
(leaning in, to Deepesh)
We re working to relieve your pain.

DR. WARREN
I don t think-- 
(stopping herself)
I know Deepesh doesn t speak English.

And all Deepesh can manage is ONE PHRASE muttered in Indian.

DR. WARREN
He s been saying the same thing 
over and over since he came in.

DEEPESH
(whispered, low)
Meraa peelaa fooel.

DR. RAYNER
Are we getting that translated?

DR. WARREN
(nodding)
I sent an intern to call the Mint Leaf.

DR. C.*
God, I love Indian food.*
(without missing a beat)*
Scalpel.*

As Zambrano shakes her head, smiling, Tuck slips through the 
thermal doors...

TUCK
6 more incoming, but only 2 are 
critical red bands.

DR. ZAMBRANO
We re getting a pregnant woman?

TUCK
32 weeks. Multiple lacerations. She s 
on the next bird. 4 minutes.

Rayner takes an instant to process that...

DR. RAYNER
Chris and Marisol scrub out and be 
ready for the incoming. 
(back to Tuck)
You got the nurses assigned?Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft11.



TUCK
And the BOA cart is ready in case 
we re birthin  some babies.

And that's when Deepesh s ALARMS START TO SCREAM.

TUCK
Pressure dropping. 60 systolic.

DR. C.
What just--? Did a lung go down?

DR. WARREN
Not possible. My line was good.

DR. ZAMBRANO
Well, he's crashing!

Rayner runs the team through the possible culprits...

DR. RAYNER
Bleeding...  pericardial tamponade... 
tension pneumothorax...

...while Dr. Warren and Dr. C. frantically searching 
Deepesh s chest for a puncture wound...

DR. WARREN
No way. Lungs are working fine.

...but something has to be done because the ALARMS ARE BLARING. 

QUICK CUTS,  THE CHAOS OF THE MOMENT :
...Zambrano breaking out a chest tube kit... Dr. C. splashing 
betadine over the heart... ECU on the lips of an overwhelmed 
Warren mumbling the steps of thoracotomy to remind herself. 

And that's when Rayner steps in...

DR. RAYNER
Little room, please.

...PLUNGING A NEEDLE THROUGH DEEPESH S SKIN AND STRAIGHT INTO 
HIS HEART, pulling back on the plunger, the syringe drawing a 
GUSHER OF STRAW COLORED FLUID into its barrel.

TUCK
(this is all good)
Pressure is coming back up and... 
the pericardial fluid is gone!

Now Dr. C. puts the ultrasound next to the needle and...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft12.



DR. C.
Hot damn on a pogo-stick you saved him!

But despite the relief on his team s face, Rayner seems tortured 
by something, unable to move, speak or take his eyes off...

A SPOT OF BLOOD NEXT TO THE COFFEE SPOT ON HIS SHOE.

DR. C.
Dr. Rayner?

QUICK CUTS,  MELTDOWN :
...ECU: Rayner s eyes jumping to more blood... on his 
scrubs... on his mask and gloves... on his surgical cap.

TUCK (O.S.)
Dr. Rayner, everything alright?

BACK ON THE TRAUMA ROOM AS A WHOLE
...where Rayner still isn t moving.

DR. ZAMBRANO
William?

But Rayner doesn't respond, instead taking Dr. C's hand and 
passing off the syringe, still in Deepesh s heart before Rayner 
turns and simply... WALKS OUT OF THE TRAUMA SUITE.

BULLPEN, P.O.V. FROM BRAVO TEAM IN TRAUMA #5
...where Rayner can be seen walking in a haze and stopping in 
front of the nurses  desk. 

There he starts to strip off his latex gloves, his cap, his 
scrubs top and the T-shirt under it. 

Anywhere there s blood must come off.

CLOSE UPS: DR. C., ZAMBRANO, WARREN, TUCK
...all in shock as...

DR. WARREN
Where s he going?

BULLPEN, P.O.V. FROM BRAVO TEAM IN TRAUMA #5

bottoms, then in a frustrated, impatient moment, his pants 
and his underwear all at once, leaving...

BACK ON BRAVO TEAM
...their eyes bouncing between the bullpen, Deepesh on the 
table in front of them and each other...

DR. C.
Well... that was... interesting.

And then they hear it... first SIRENS, APPROACHING FAST, then, 
HELICOPTER, BLADES ABOVE THEM and we see Bravo Team snap from 
 processing the surreal  to  there are lives to be saved .

DR. ZAMBRANO
(as much to herself as anyone else)
Shake it off, guys. 

DR. C.
(his adrenaline rising)
Time to rock and roll.

Now CAMERA FLIES UPWARD, slamming through 6 floors and 
ceilings before CRASHING through the roof and RACING through 
the sky to meet a COAST GUARD HELICOPTER. 

As the helicopter tips and turns, the window revealing Anna 
with an EVACUATION TECH fighting to keep her alive...

ACT ONE


...where elevator doors open to reveal Dr. Zambrano leading...

DR. WARREN 
(wide eyed and WOW)
...naked. Buck naked. Stark raving, 
fleshy, birthday-suit...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(still reeling)
...I was there, Serena...

DR. WARREN
...first day on my trauma rotation at 
Hopkins the attending said that, like, 
60% of trauma doctors wash out...

DR. ZAMBRANO
...in the first 5 years.

DR. WARREN
One guy... he started speaking in 
tongues during a multiple gunshot 
victim. Totally freaky.
(can t stop going over it)
But Rayner? He s been around since 
before trauma was housed in its own 
building, right? I mean, he s run 
Bravo since the beginning?

DR. ZAMBRANO
(changing subjects)
Hit the door.

Dr. Warren, nods, hitting a SQUARE BUTTON, triggering 
automatic doors that open up onto the...


ANNA
The baby-- Is the baby--

DR. ZAMBRANO
We ll find that out soon as we 
can, but I need you to stay as 
still as possible.

DR. WARREN
(whispered, to Zambrano)
Her pain s got to be high. You want 
to give her 50 of Fent?

DR. ZAMBRANO
(whispered, looking at the 
chart, shake of the head)
BP s too low.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft16.

DR. ZAMBRANO (CONT'D)
(then to Anna)
Can you tell me where you are, Anna?

ANNA
Ber-- Bermuda?

And that wrong answer prompts Dr. Zambrano to lift up the 
blanket to get her first look at...

ANNA S BODY
...which is riddled with dozens of glass-filled lacerations, 
all discharging blood in drips and rivulets. She might as 
well be the victim of grenade attack in a war zone.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(brave face, back to Anna)
You re doing really great, Anna.

...and now they re onto the...


...where Warren shucks and jives, sliding UNDER THE GURNEY to 
be able to assist...

DR. ZAMBRANO*
Let s run the ABC s...*

DR. WARREN
Airway. Clear. Breathing, stressed 
but within acceptable limits...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(re: the chart on the gurney)
...write it down. First Rule of 
Rayner. ABD. Always Be Documenting.

DR. WARREN
(grabbing the chart, writing)
Circulation, low, 80 over 40.
(then, whispered)
You want me to get a portable *
doppler? Check on the baby.*

DR. ZAMBRANO*
( all in due time )*
Best way to save the baby is to *
save the mother.*

But just then, a bandage covering one of Anna s abdomen 
lacerations comes loose, causing blood to GEYSER.

DR. WARREN
Oh-- We got-- There s a bleeder--Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft17.



Warren, tries to reach it, across Anna s belly, but when she 
can t, Zambrano hoists herself onto the gurney, straddling 
Anna and applying pressure on the vessel with her thumb.

DR. WARREN
Flexible.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(no big deal)
Krav Maga.*
(then)
Reposition and take this from me.

Dr. Warren does, putting them side-by-side.

DR. WARREN
I hate to ask, but, with Rayner gone... 
who calls this trauma?

DR. ZAMBRANO*
Its straight seniority and I *
predate Chris by 3 months. So... *
technically... I m in charge.*

But the moment elevator doors open, revealing...


DR. C.
All eyes on me, people! 

...who clearly has other ideas about the chain of command.

DR. C.
I know we ve had some chaos this 
morning, but here s what we re doing 
now: I m taking,  Pregnant Multiple 
Lacerations  into Trauma One, but I 
want an update every 10 minutes on 
the  3rd degree Burn Guy  in Trauma 
Five and a 5 minute heads-up before 
our  Amputation  hits the roof.

Dr. C. takes one scan of Warren and Zambrano s meticulous 
chart, handing it off to Nurse Carol (fuck the first rule of 
Rayner), then choosing instead to chicken scrawl directly on 
Anna s white gurney sheet with a black marker.

DR. C.
I want 25 of Fent in her, like, 
Speedy Gonzales fast...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft18.



There s an almost imperceptible hiccup, where Zambrano 
exchanges a look with...

DR. WARREN
Guess Chris has forgotten about 
those 3 months.

...and then the three of them are pushing Anna into...


...where Dr. C., Zambrano and Warren take the exact same 
positions as in the tease, first looking to... 

ANNA
...who has finally passed out...

DR. WARREN
(utterly overwhelmed)
Where do we start?

...and then all three take a reflexive peek at...

THE EMPTY TRAUMA  COMMAND POSITION 
...which has been occupied by Dr. Rayner for the last 15 years.

TUCK
(stepping through the thermal doors)
Rayner s not walking through that door.

Silence between the four of them, then

DR. WARREN
What makes a guy like Dr. Rayner--?

DR. ZAMBRANO
Doesn t matter. 
(this is the moment SHE finally 
starts to shake it off)
Doesn t matter what happened or why. 
All that matters is the 2 patients on 
this ward and the 1 about to arrive.

Now Dr. Zambrano turns to...

DR. C.
OK, we re removing glass, then 
pressing and stitching. If we don t 
stop her from bleeding out, nothing 
else matters.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft19.



As Dr. C. and Zambrano reach toward Anna s riddled body, 
BEHIND THEM, SEEN THROUGH THE GLASS THERMAL DOORS, Marc 
(Anna s Husband) can be seen entering the...


...and Marc s NECK IS BANDAGED in the spot where he pulled out 
the glass shard. Marc now crosses the bullpen, approaching...

SECURITY GUARD
You here for treatment?

MARC
No. I was told over in the Emergency 
Room that my wife is here.

SECURITY GUARD
Come with me.

As The Security Guard leads Marc to the Nurses  station, we 
pass back in front of...


...where already there s progress on Anna.

DR. C.
Look at us go, kidlings.

As, across Anna s body, Dr. Zambrano pulls a stitch tight 
asking Dr. Warren to...

DR. ZAMBRANO
...cut, please...

...we see that though Zambrano is fast, she can t keep up 
with the completely autonomous...

DR. C.
(off key, Queen)
Another one bites the dust. Da-Da. 
Another one bites the dust.

Warren sees something, about to reach in to help him. 

DR. C.
(blocking her)
Just sponge and learn. These are 
some old-school, Redneck, 
Panhandle, Mad-Skillz at work.

A frustrated look from Warren to...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft20.



DR. ZAMBRANO
In Cuba they call those  juevos .

DR. C.
(waiting for the other shoe)
Juevos?

DR. ZAMBRANO
Balls. You got some balls.

DR. C.
Well, I know Dr. Rayner was your 
mentor and I figured you might be 
shaken up by what he did.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(sarcasm, with the lightest touch)
Thanks for thinking of me, Chris.

As Tuck and Warren suppress smiles...

TUCK*
I m going to get another 10 A neg.*

So Tuck disengages, crossing back into the...


...where Tuck is grabbed by a...

NURSE CAROL
Will you talk to the husband of the 
laceration patient? He s here and 
he s asking about his wife.

TUCK
(nodding, yes)
Bring 10 A neg to Trauma 5...

...then crosses to...

MARC
Can you tell me where my wife is?

TUCK
(noticing the bandage)
Has your neck been looked at, sir?

MARC
Yeah. In the E.R. 

TUCK
And they discharged you?Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft21.



MARC
(all he cares about)
My wife? Anna.

TUCK
She s being cared for, Mr. Tischer. 
While that happens, why don t I 
take one more look at--

And that s when Marc eyes lock on...

MARC
Anna!


...just as Anna regains consciousness.

QUICK CUTS,  ANNA'S POV : 
ECU on Anna's eyes, flitting between Marc's terrified face... 
a LARYNGOSCOPE blade FLASHING inches from her face... Dr. C., 
Warren and Zambrano s faces over her naked, injured, belly.

BACK IN THE TRAUMA SUITE
...Anna starts thrashing anew, having regained some strength 
due to the work the team has already done....

ANNA
Where-- Where am I?
(then looking around)
Marc! What s happening?!?

DR. ZAMBRANO
Stay calm, Anna. You need to--

ANNA

DR. C.
...she s tearing her sutures and we 
still have half the glass to remove--

DR. ZAMBRANO
Anna? Are you listening to me?

ANNA
(still fighting them, not 
listening at all)
The baby s dead, isn t he?

DR. ZAMBRANO
No, the baby s not--

Now Dr. C. grabs the Doppler (a portable speaker with a probe 
for hearing the baby's heart) and tries to get a heartbeat...

DR. C.
...hold her still...

DR. WARREN
...I m trying...

DR. C.
...well try harder...

DR. ZAMBRANO
Anna? Listen to me, Anna.

Nothing on the Doppler... still nothing... and the ALARMS are 
starting to blare... blood everywhere.

DR. C.
(fuck it, to Warren)
Pressure is better... gimme 100 of 
fent to knock her down a bit.

Warren grabs a needle, but Zambrano stops her.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(whispered, urgent)
No. Can t. It s already too much 
sedative for the fetus...

DR. C.
(whispered, urgent)
...well, no mother, no fetus. And 
without the fent she s going to 
open everything back up again...

And that s when Zambrano snatches the Doppler and puts it on 
her OWN WRIST, catching her OWN heartbeat. Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft23.



DR. ZAMBRANO
(close to Anna)
Hear that, Anna?

Its too slow for the baby, but Anna hears what she needs... HOPE.

Dude has survived burning and 
drowning, the hell if he's going to

As Dr. C. splashes the neck with antiseptic, taking a

AN INCREDIBLY HOT, SIX-FOOT-PLUS BLONDE 
...pacing in front of the nurse s desk, pissed.

DR. C.
(re: the blonde)
The SISTER of the cheerleader.

NURSE CAROL
Well, the sister of cheerleader isn t 
leaving until she talks to you.

DR. C.
Freaky and a little nuts.

As Nurse Carol rolls her eyes, Tuck enters...

TUCK
Last of the critical red-bands is 
coming in right now. Hand 
amputation with the broken fibia.

DR. C.
(nodding, then to Warren)
Alright, finish stripping him and 
then debride what you can.

As an overwhelmed Warren continues, Dr. C. crosses to...*


...where the doors open revealing the PASSENGER FROM THE 
BALLROOM being administered care by a FORTY-SOMETHING MAN IN A 
PHISH T-SHIRT, who identifies his patient as...

MR. PHISH T-SHIRT
I ve got Martin Goldwin. Open fracture 
dislocation right leg, near amputation 
of right hand. Airway is fine, but 
we've got massive blood loss.
(then to the room)
Where am I headed, folks, because this 
guy needs three bags AB neg and fast!

As Dr. C. stares blankly, watching The Guy In The Phish T-
Shirt guiding Martin into Trauma Suite #2...

DR. C.
Um... OK... 
(yelling to anyone within earshot)
...who the hell is that guy?


END OF ACT ONEMiami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft27.


ACT TWO


...where Dr. Zambrano exits Trauma 5 to find Dr. C., still 
confused, staring at something OFF CAMERA...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(re: Anna, totally focused)
I think we ve got a handle on 
Anna s internal bleeding.
(then)
What happened with Deepesh?

DR. C.
(distracted)
Established a surgical airway and 
sent a tox screen to the lab.

Dr. Zambrano nods, becoming aware of:

THROUGH THE GLASS OF TRAUMA
...Martin s hand is being worked on.

DR. ZAMBRANO (O.S.)
(nodding, then surprised)
Is that our hand amputation?

BACK ON DR. C. AND...

DR. ZAMBRANO
If he s in there, what are you 
doing out here?

Now she cocks her head, finally noticing MR. PHISH T-SHIRT.

DR. ZAMBRANO
Who s THAT?

DR. C.
The 64 million dollar question.

Now Zambrano follows Dr. C., who enters...


...where Dr. C. and Zambrano enter to find Mr. Phish T-Shirt 
elbow-deep in Martin's femoral artery, sewing like a virtuoso.

MR. PHISH T-SHIRT
...if you re impressed by this, I 
also hem pants and darn socks.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft28.



NURSE CAROL
But can you knit a sweater?

MR. PHISH T-SHIRT*
Garter rib or mock cable, Karen?*

NURSE CAROL*
(a smile, mock annoyed)*
Carol... and I ll overlook your *
mistake just this one time.*

MR. PHISH T-SHIRT*
Tough crowd around here.*

As Carol and other nurses laugh, Zambrano shares a look with...*

DR. C.
Um, not to be formal, but we re 
going to assume for insurance 
purposes you re a...

MR. PHISH T-SHIRT
...doctor, yes. Thomas Proctor.
(quickly, the formalities)
I just moved down after closing a knee 
and hip practice up in Maryland. 

DR. ZAMBRANO
(wait, this guy is only...)
Knee and hip...

DR. PROCTOR
(knew this was coming)
...AFTER 2 tours of trauma in Gulf 
One and 3 years at the military 
hospital in Landshtuhl.
(back to the present)
I was supposed to start next week 
with Charlie Team, but I was 
upstairs filling out I-9 s when I 
heard you were short a doctor, so I 
came down to see if I could lend a-- 

Dr. Proctor stops, seeing Martin's mashed fingers, wrapped in 
white gauze soaked through with bright red. 

DR. PROCTOR
In recognition of Mr. Goldwin's 
predicament, I'm going to choose 
not to finish that sentence.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft29.



MARTIN
(weirdly relaxed, but disoriented 
from blood loss and pain meds)
There was a little girl under the 
chandelier. When I saw it coming down 
I pushed her out of the way. I really 
hope she s alright--
(registering his injury for the first *
time, drugged to the pain and fear)*
Is that my hand? Cool!

DR. PROCTOR
Cool, he says.
(to the rest of the room)
Given our patients positive attitude, 
lets make sure he can enjoy a life of 
ambidextrous masturbation, shall we?
(then to Dr. C. and Zambrano)
Hey, which one of you is  calling  
these traumas?

And awkward pause in which neither Dr. C or Zambrano answer 
is broken up when Tuck pops his head in...

TUCK
Dr. C. can I see you about the burn victim?

...so Dr. C. disengages, exiting and leaving...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(to Proctor)
I ll scrub up and step in.

DR. PROCTOR
(without confrontation)
Not necessary, I m all good.

Off Zambrano s furrowed brow... well this is interesting... 
the CAMERA PIVOTS, PUSHING PAST Zambrano to catch up with...

TUCK
We re trying to prep Deepesh for a 
fasciotomy, but he s in a lot of 
pain and we ve already given him 
60 cc s of fent.

DR. C.
(incredulous)
Enough to sedate a Rhino.

...as they arrive outside...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft30.



TRAUMA SUITE #5
...where Deepesh can be seen staring, eyes dull, at the ceiling.

TUCK (O.S.)
The tox screen is backed up; maybe 
an hour before we get results.

BACK ON DR. C AND...

TUCK
(who is staring at SOMETHING 
on Deepesh s chart)
If you can spare me for 15 minutes 
I bet I can save you 45.

DR. C.
If you save this guy 10 minutes of 
pain, I ll buy you a pony.

...Tuck exits the suite, passing through the...


...and then out into the...


...where Dr. C. looks up to see...

TUCK
(re-entering)
He s a heroin addict.

DR. C.
No wonder his tolerance is so high. Lets 
induce and finish. 20 of etomidate.
(then, about to leave)
Nice call.

As Tuck starts "etomidate" to put Deepesh to sleep...

TUCK
(to Deepesh, whispered)
Hang in there, friend.

CUT TO:


...where Warren and Zambrano accompany a semi-conscious 
Anna, her hand held by her husband Marc...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft33.



DR. ZAMBRANO
Anna s doing much better. We got 
all the major lacerations, but 
she s still bleeding internally...

MARC
(that sounds bad)
...bleeding internally...

DR. ZAMBRANO*
It s probably a bleeder from a *
joint fracture, so we re taking *
her to angiography to plug it *
under a real-time X-Ray.*

MARC
But she s and the baby are going to 
be alright?

DR. ZAMBRANO
We re well on our way, Mr. Tischer.

Now they all round a corner, arriving at...


...where Marc has to be informed...

DR. WARREN
We re going to have to ask you to 
go back the waiting area now.

Marc nods, looking down at...

ANNA
Can I have a kiss?

DR. ZAMBRANO
(giving Marc permission)
If you don t... I will.

So Marc kisses Anna, as Tuck rushes up, handing Zambrano...

TUCK
Portable ultrasound you asked for.

And they leave Marc behind, loading Anna onto the ELEVATOR...

DR. C. (O.C.)
(also climbing aboard)
Hold the door.

Now buttons are pushed and...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft34.



DR. C.
(clearly he s chewing on this)
Why does a guy leave a cushy, 
private practice for 4, 12-hour 
trauma shifts a week?

NURSE CAROL
I ve got a friend in H.R who 
overheard him... on his cell phone... 
seemed like marital issues.

DR. WARREN
(oooh, gossip)
An affair?

NURSE CAROL
 Marital issues,  was the phrase.

TUCK
I heard he was hired for Charlie Team...

DR. C.
...but with Rayner washing out, I d 
bet my...
(for Zambrano s consumption)
...Juevos he ll end up with US.

DR. WARREN
Us? Bravo? Like the new Rayner?

Which is when Zambrano, who has been silent... chuckles.

DR. WARREN
What? 

Big smile from Zambrano.

DR. C.
What do you know, Marisol?

And now Zambrano taps the portable ultrasound machine...*

DR. ZAMBRANO
I know the baby is alive.

A moment... all silent... taking in the...

SWOOSH, SWOOSH, SWOOSH 
...of the ultrasound on Anna s belly... but the moment is 
broken by the BING of the doors opening to revealing...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft35.



AN INTERN
(looking overwhelmed)
Did anyone here approve of the new 
dude doing his OWN replant?

Off a raised eyebrow from Dr. C...

CUT TO:


...where Dr. C. enters to find Proctor still bent over 
blissed-out Martin's hand.

DR. C.
Dr. Proctor...

DR. PROCTOR
(to Dr. C., re: a silver bowl)
Grab that, will ya?

As Dr. C. grabs the bowl...

DR. PROCTOR
(to an intern)
Iris shears please.
(to Martin)
What I m about to do next may seem *
drastic, Martin, but the cleaner *
the edge the easier it ll be to *
debride and reattach.*

SNIP Proctor cuts the hand and THUNK it falls into the bowl. *

MARTIN*
(a drugged chuckle)*
This... is so... weird.*

DR. PROCTOR
(back to Dr. C.)
Hey I d like to take the resident... 
Warren... to help with my replant. 

DR. C.
Dr. Warren? For your replant?

DR. PROCTOR
This is a teaching hospital, right?

DR. C.
I understand that, but we typically 
bring in a micro-surgeon to...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft36.



DR. PROCTOR
...I did a hand fellowship at Landshtuhl.

DR. C.
(never losing his smile)
I realize you may be used to 
working alone but, we have a way of 
doing things here, Dr. Proctor.

DR. PROCTOR
(just as cool, bigger smile)
I m sure you do.
(then)
Alright, Martin: and away we go...*

As Proctor and team wheel Martin past Dr. C...*

DISSOLVE TO:*


...where Proctor and Warren struggle with the hand replant...

DR. PROCTOR
Try to avoid pulling the anastamosis 
up like a  purse string. 

DR. WARREN
What if my line doesn t hold?

DR. PROCTOR
It will.
(then)
How long have you been in residency here?

DR. WARREN
Since April, so... 7 months.

DR. PROCTOR
(all the more impressed)
You re doing just fine.

UNDER THE MICROSURGERY MICROSCOPE
...Proctor leads her through the reattachment of a tiny artery.

DR. WARREN (O.S.)
(re: Martin)
I don t think I d be as calm as he 
was if MY hand were sitting in a 
silver bowl.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft37.



BACK IN THE ROOM:

DR. PROCTOR
He won t be calm when he comes out of 
surgery. Seeing your hand detached is 
surreal, UNREAL. Feeling a numb ache at 
the end of your wrist and knowing the 
limb might die attached to your body... 
that s real... real terrifying.

DR. WARREN
Is it true he pushed a little girl out of 
the way of a falling chandelier?

DR. PROCTOR
He saved a life, now we can save 
his hand... and the world, it goes 
round and round and round.

Outside the doors we can see Dr. C. Pass by on his way to...


...where Zambrano is walking behind Nurse Carol who wheels 
Anna out of Angio...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(to Dr. C.)
I embolized the last two bleeders 
and everything else looks good...
(smiling down to Anna)
...so now we can stop pushing you 
around like an apple cart and get you 
to a room where you can recover.

Anna weakly returns the smile as they head toward the elevator. 

DR. C.
He took Warren into his replant.

As Nurse Carol hits the button, Zambrano and Dr. C. hang back.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(she knows exactly...)
He who?

DR. C.
Dr. Sunshine, that s who.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(laughing)
It s so fun to see someone FINALLY 
get under your skin, Chris.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft38.



DR. C.
This is funny to you?

DR. ZAMBRANO
This is hysterical.

DR. C.
You fought for, what, 2 years to work 
HERE at Ryder... I turned down an offer 
in New York, another in London, because 
I wanted to do trauma one HERE.

Now BING doors open, allowing them to climb aboard...


...where Nurse Carol positions Anna as...

DR. C.
If the board brings this guy in over 
us, where he could stay for another 20 
years, what does that mean?
(with meaning)
We re  stucked , THAT S what it means.

DR. ZAMBRANO
Its been four hours and we re already 
picking over Rayner s carcass?

DR. C.
Vultures are pragmatists, Marisol. 
Something dead is only useful as 
sustenance for the community.

Just then ANNA starts to moan, the...

NURSE CAROL
We have a problem here.

Now Dr. C. And Zambrano turn to look at...

ANNA
My right ear. I can t-- 
(increasingly upset)
I can t hear anything in that ear.

And now Dr. C. and Zambrano step around the gurney to see...

DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...
...blood trickling out of Anna s ear and staining the white 
sheet on the gurney. And just then...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft39.



DR. ZAMBRANO
(alarmed)
Um... Chris...

ANNA S NOSTRIL
...also starts to dribble. DRIP... DRIP... DRIP. 

Anna... is LEAKING.

And as the droplets begin to pool...

DR. C.*
(under his breath,  oh, fuck )*
This does not make me happy.*


END OF ACT TWOMiami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft40.


ACT THREE


...where Nurse Carol and Dr. C. try their best to stem the 
bleeding, while listening to...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(in Anna s ear with a otoscope)
One of the blast wound lacerations 
has opened back up again.

DR. C.
(grabbing the otoscope)
Not possible. I closed the Eustachian 
wound myself and it was solid.

As Dr. C. peers into Anna s ear, another sutured laceration, 
this one on the side of Anna s neck, begins to bleed.

ANNA
What s happening to me--?

DR. ZAMBRANO
We don t know yet, but just try and 
stay as calm as you can.

NURSE CAROL
B.P. is way up. 160 over 95.

DR. C.
(doesn t make sense)
Wait. No. If she s opening, her 
pressure should be going DOWN.

CLOSE ON: Dr. Zambrano, eyes jumping and then...

DR. ZAMBRANO
The baby.

ANNA
What about the baby--??

DR. ZAMBRANO
The baby is fine, Anna, but it may 
be putting a strain on your system.
(then to Dr. C.)
Check for contractions...

DR. C.
(moving toward Anna s lower half)
...which could send her B.P. through 
the roof and cause the wounds to leak.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft41.

DR. C. (CONT'D)
(then he feels them)
Yep. We ve got contractions.

ANNA
Ohh... Ohhh, God... Marc!

DR. ZAMBRANO
We take her over to OB, fill her with 
Terbutaline to stop the contractions...

But Dr. C. isn t listening, turning to Nurse Carol...

DR. C.
...do you have a...

...getting a key, which he jams into a slot in the elevator 
panel, sending the car back up to...

DR. ZAMBRANO
Wait, wait. OB is DOWN!

DR. C.
OB is 3 buildings away.
(definitive)
We re delivering this baby ourselves.*

Now the elevator doors open up on...


...where Dr. C. and Zambrano tell Anna...

DR. ZAMBRANO
...everything s going to be alright.
(then, to Dr. C.)
She s only 32 weeks. The contractions 
are probably just Braxton Hicks.

DR. C.
(to Dr. Zambrano, whispered)
Doesn t matter WHAT they are. She 
needs as few stresses on her system.

DR. ZAMBRANO
As long as the baby is viable.

As Dr. C. nods,  of course , the CAMERA DUCKS DOWN under the 
gurney to catch the CLATTERING WHEELS ROUNDING A CORNER before 
SURGING AHEAD and FLIPPING to catch the INVERTED AND INSISTENT...

DR. ZAMBRANO
(upside down, as Anna sees her)
Eyes on me, Anna.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft42.



DR. C.*
Where did you close the joint *
fracture bleeder again?*

DR. ZAMBRANO*
OR #1.*

DR. C.*
OK, let s get back there before the *
nurses start to turn the room over.*

One more turn as Zambrano and Dr. C. enter...


...but they re too late and the SCRUB NURSES are already 
turning the room over, the bed wet with disinfectant.

SCRUB NURSE
(in Spanish, waving them off)
No, no.

DR. ZAMBRANO
(in Spanish)
How long...?

SCRUB NURSE
(in Spanish)
...15 minutes.

And now Dr. C. looks down to see MORE BLOOD FROM ANNA S NOSE.

DR. C.*
We don t have however many *
 minutos  that was.*

Then from the doorway...

LAB TECH
OR #2 was prepping for a broken leg 
left over from Alpha shift, but I 
don t think they ve started.

DR. C.*
Call them off for us.*

And Dr. C. changes courses, as they then careen back into the...*


...where they arrive at Operating Room #2 only to find ORTHO 
SURGEONS, the  broken leg  already in progress.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft43.



DR. C.
Damnit!
(one last 180)
An operating room in transition is 
better than a hallway!

As Anna's bleeding intensifies...

CUT TO:


...where Marc's conversation with Tuck continues as Dr. C. 
and Zambrano cut into Anna, opening her up anew...

MARC (V.O.)
We re going to name him Cole...

CUT BACK TO:


...where Dr. Zambrano pulls aside fat and tissue...

MARC (V.O.)
Now, if I ever speak to Anna again... 

...giving Dr. C. Access to Anna s womb...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft44.



MARC (V.O.) 
If I get to meet my son... guess 
that's in your hands, huh?

Dr. C. pulls the baby out, handing off to Zambrano, but the *
baby is BLUE and LIFELESS.*

So Zambrano digs around with her fingers trying to clear the *
airway passage, but... nothing... just nothing.*

DR. ZAMBRANO*
Come on... come on...*

NOTHING AT ALL. *

DR. ZAMBRANO*
(never giving up)*
Breathe... please...*

STILL NOTHING. The baby is dea--, but then a twitch... a *
little feet squiggle... a weak cry. *

Baby Cole is alive.*

As Zambrano and Dr. C. finally exhale themselves...*

CUT BACK TO:


...where Warren enters to find Proctor sifting through the 
lost and found looking for a replacement for his sweat and 
blood covered Phish t-shirt.

Dr. Proctor locates a shirt, about to take his shirt off, when 
something causes the room to spin and he's forced to sit.

DR. PROCTOR
I m  trauma  rusty.
(he laughs)
I don t know why I thought I could 
just step right back in, but 
Kuwait... I was in my 20 s back then.

DR. WARREN
This feels like Kuwait to you?

DR. PROCTOR
Like M*A*S*H in paradise.
(long, deep breath)
You did good work in there.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft45.



DR. WARREN
I created scar tissue and cost time.

DR. PROCTOR
You were trying not to make 
mistakes. You can t do that. This 
isn t a  safe  arena...
(self-deprecating laugh)
...like, knees and ankles. 3 
surgeries a week and the rest is 
consults and golf.
(then, with meaning)
Than again... safety is overrated.

DR. WARREN
(what s really bothering her)
At least with safe, you don t... snap.

DR. PROCTOR
Rayner, right.
(then)
Look, any doctor can come up against a 
moment that pushes them to the brink. 
Most of us never see it coming.

And that s when he takes off his shirt, revealing...

A REALLY NASTY LOOKING 11  SCAR
...going from the middle of his belly to his collarbone. 

As Warren takes in the scar, Proctor tosses on a new shirt, 
heading for the door...

CUT TO:


...where a cleaned up Dr. C. enters to find...

DEEPESH ON A VENTILATOR ASSIST, IN A HYPERBARIC OXYGEN CHAMBER: 
...his brother Hemendra (in scrubs and a mask) standing in 
front of him talking quietly.

TUCK (O.C.)
His lungs are filled with fluid.

DR. C. (O.C.)
And his kidneys?

BACK ON DR. C. AND...

TUCK
Shut down, on dialysis.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft46.



Hemendra exits the oxygen chamber, crossing to Dr. C and Tuck.

HEMENDRA
My brother is having a hard time 
getting comfortable in there.

Tuck and Dr. C. share another look, then...

DR. C.
He s in multi-organ failure, what we 
call  third spacing . The fluid we re 
giving him to keep his blood pressure 
up has ended up in his lungs.

HEMENDRA
I don t understand.

DR. C.
Your brother is dying.

Silence. 

HEMENDRA
Does this-- have anything to with-- 
y know-- his issue?

TUCK
This is caused completely by his burns.

HEMENDRA
How long?

DR. C.
An hour, maybe two or three.

HEMENDRA
His wife... Nishta... my family was 
trying to put her on a plane, so he 
could at least see her face.

Tuck and Dr. C. Share a look, then...

TUCK
I ve got my...

DR. C.
(knowing where Tuck is going)
...yep, lets do that.

TUCK
If you ll help Dr. Deleo talk to 
your brother, I ll see what I can 
do about his wife in Mumbai.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft47.



As Hemendra nods, Tuck exiting the burn ward...

...where Dr. Proctor is consulting with Martin and MARTIN S 
WIFE, Dr. Warren hovering in the background. 

DR. PROCTOR

the tendons, then reconnected the 
vascular supply. No guarantees, but 
there s an 80% survival rate for

All that... and you re a hero to boot.

all he can do is stare, horrified, at his bandaged limb...

MARTIN
(a flash of dark emotion, as 
predicted by Proctor)
What does that matter if there s still 
a 20% chance I lose the hand? I-- I 
can t lose my hand. What do I get,

I don t know if this is a good time, 
but there s someone here to see you.

DR. WARREN
Angelica. The girl you pushed out 
of the way of the chandelier.

Angelica's mother steps up, overwhelmed.

ANGELA S MOTHER
WE wanted to say,  Thank you. 

As Martin's face lights up, some of his horror ebbing, 
Proctor turns to Warren with a smile that reads,  Nice call.

TUCK
Anyone see Mr. Tischer? Husband of 
the pregnant blast victim?

SECURITY GUARD
Men s bathroom, I think.

As Tuck nods, changing directions and entering....


TUCK
Mr. Tischer? Mark? I ve got good news!

...but its empty, so Tuck decides to go to use a urinal, but 
as he goes to unzip his pants he notices...

A RIVULET OF BLOOD

the SOUND OF SUFFOCATION and STRUGGLE. 

Tuck moves to the stall and bangs door open to discover...

Tuck holds Marc's head steady, trying to keep his airway open

Big hematoma... massive bleeding... 
extends past the sternal notch.
(frustration mounting)
Lets go with a right sided thoracotomy...

As Dr. C. slices into the right chest, enter Warren and...

DR. WARREN*
Is this the father?*

TUCK*
(nodding, yes)*
Pressure is down to 60.*

DR. ZAMBRANO*
Any idea how long he s been out?*

TUCK
No.

But then...

DR. WARREN
It s about 45 minutes.

And that s when they all look to see Warren holding up Marc s 
wrist, his watch broken/stopped when he fell in the bathroom.

DR. C.
(overwhelmed)
So, we re down to the Golden 15 Minutes.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft52.

DR. C. (CONT'D)
(utter disbelief, under his breath)
This guy is going to die.

And now Proctor enters as well...

DR. PROCTOR
Where do you need me?

DR. ZAMBRANO
Where DON T we need you?

DR. C.
Grab a sponge stick and help get 
distal control of the IC.

A nod from Proctor, who goes to work... the whole of Bravo 
team here now, but Marc is still in DEEP trouble.

Dr.  C. is really struggling now...

DR. C.
I can t find the bleed!

And... ALARMS GO OFF.

TUCK
Tachy 120, he s bleeding out.

MORE ALARMS!

DR. PROCTOR
6 more units of packed cells, get 
the FFP, Cryo and platelets ready.

And soon Dr. C. is nearly at the base of the skull, which is 
when Dr. Zambrano goes on a hunch...

DR. ZAMBRANO*
What if the bleed is in his SKULL, *
Chris? From his initial fall. You *
could work forever and not find it. *
From here I could occlude it and *
tie it off, but you re going to *
need to let me step in.*

DR. WARREN*
You're want to go above?*

DR. ZAMBRANO*
I want to try.*

DR. C.*
And if you re WRONG?*Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft53.



Close on Zambrano, her unsure face speaking volumes. *

DR. WARREN*
This guy s going to bleed out in *
another half-minute...*

TUCK
...but if he won t clot, it won t 
matter anyway.

Stalemate, which means all eyes turn to...

DR. PROCTOR
Let me guess, this is where Dr. 
Rayner would have made the call?

Zambrano and Dr. C. share a look. Proctor is right. 

They can let him be the new sheriff or call it themselves.

The moment hangs... 
...and the alarms are screaming... 
...they speak when the doctors don't.

DR. ZAMBRANO*
(and she makes the call)*
I m stepping in, Chris.*
(to Tuck)*
Give me a #3 balloon tip catheter. *

And Dr. C. falls in line, doing as instructed...*

DR. C.*
Here you go.*

...and handing off to Zambrano, who advances it past the injury. *

DR. ZAMBRANO
Let s advance it... and saline...

ALARM which means more uncontrolled bleeding.

DR. ZAMBRANO 
Inflate the balloon.

TUCK
Still bleeding.

DR. PROCTOR
Nice and easy.

But Tuck is getting more and more worried...Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft54.



TUCK
STILL BLEEDING.

Now Zambrano takes the catheter down, advancing again, but 
there s blood everywhere and all Marc s monitors are going 
off like Vegas slot machine paying out millions.

DR. ZAMBRANO 
(doubt creeping in)
Still oozing. I can t--

DR. WARREN 
ITS STOPPED! BLEEDING HAS STOPPED.

DR. PROCTOR
(whispered, keeping 
Zambrano cool)
OK. Crimp, fold and tie it off.

Zambrano does and backs away from the gurney, holding her breath 
along with the others as they wait... wait... wait...

DR. WARREN
You got it.

DR. ZAMBRANO
We got it?

DR. PROCTOR
She s got it.

TUCK
(confirming)
Yes. Bleeding has stopped.

A series of deep breaths and then...*

DR. ZAMBRANO
Now that he's not dying, who says 
we make this guy better?

A smile from the team, even Dr. C. who has noticed SOMETHING.

DR. C.*
(impressed)*
Well done there, Dr. 3 Months.*

What s the something Dr. C noticed? In backing away, Zambrano 
is inadvertently standing in Rayner s Command Trauma Position.

CUT TO:Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft55.




...where we PAN PAST a more hopeful Martin showing his Wife very 
minor (perceived or real) movement in his pinky to find... 

MARC
...waking, confused, to find HE'S the one lying in a bed.
He tries to sit up, but...

DR. C. (O.C.)
I wouldn t make any sudden moves.

So Marc readjusts his position to see...

DR. C., ZAMBRANO AND WARREN
...standing around his bed.

DR. C.
You had a carotid tear that became a 
big dissection. We stopped the bleeding 
but you re not out of the woods, yet.

Marc opens his mouth to say something, but...

DR. ZAMBRANO
And you can t talk because we had 
to bypass the clot with a breathing 
tube, but we ll fix that once 
you re more stable.

Marc stares, gesturing to indicate he d like a pen and paper, 
which Warren has handy, allowing him to scribble A-N-N-A, but 
by the time he finishes and looks up...

ANNA
...has already been wheeled to the side of his bed.

The two stare at each other a relieved second, until Marc s 
eyes settle on Anna s abdomen. 

Marc reaches for the pen, but before he can write anything...

ANNA
Marc?

And now she points at...

TUCK WHO HAS WHEELED LITTLE COLE S INCUBATOR
...to the other side of the glass.

ANNA (O.C.)
Cole is fine. I m fine.Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft56.



BACK ON THE ROOM:

ANNA
But OK, you were right: maybe we 
shouldn t have taken the cruise.

As that finally elicits a smile from Marc, his expression *
racing between joy and relief and utter overwhelm...*

CUT TO:*


...where Zambrano enters, noticing Dr. Proctor trying to get *
his newly made key into his newly assigned locker.*

DR. ZAMBRANO
Have to use a hip with those things.

Zambrano takes the key and throws her body into Proctor s 
locker, turning the key and... presto... it opens.

DR. PROCTOR
Woman of many talents.

Dr. Zambrano hands back the key, about to walk away, then...

DR. ZAMBRANO
If I hadn t of stepped in... if you 
had to make the decision...

DR. PROCTOR
...I d have sided with Dr. Deleo.
(then)
Which makes your work all the more 
impressive, Dr. Zambrano.

Now Warren pokes her head in...

DR. WARREN
I don t know what you two are 
doing, but Chris, Tuck and I are 
headed to the Crab Shack for 
Oysters and beer.

DR. PROCTOR
Shellfish, alcohol and the beach? 
(he s in)
 Toto, we re not in metropolitan 
Maryland any more. 

DR. WARREN
Marisol?Miami Trauma, CBS 2nd Draft57.



DR. ZAMBRANO
I think I ll probably hang around 
and keep and eye on the family.

With that Zambrano smiles at them both, exiting.

DR. ZAMBRANO (O.S.)
Night then.

Warren watches her go, then...

DR. WARREN
None of us has ever seen her 
actually LEAVE the hospital.

Proctor thinks a moment, then...

DR. PROCTOR
Let me guess... doctor s daughter?

DR. WARREN
Father and grandfather. I think both 
practiced back in Cuba, but had to 
stop when they came to America...

DR. PROCTOR
...so she carries the mantle of M.D. 
for the family and won t leave the 
hospital, partly because she can't 
take a chance her patients will die, 
but mostly because she s terrified 
she'll miss something really cool.

DR. WARREN*
How d you know that?*

DR. PROCTOR
I ve been around.

As Proctor stands, heading for the door...
