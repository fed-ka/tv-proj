A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here
but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the
houses neat and well tended.
Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's
afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.
3
4
A street of
small row houses. Clean, well tended.
Luther walks
toward one. Later in the afternoon. He
carries half
a dozen small shopping bags, from the
market, the
hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.
3.

5
A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.
Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,
bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front
door.
6
10
In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.
But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and
power.
We're in rolling hill country.
The mansion is dark.
Totally deserted. Silence.
Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO
VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The
lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides
to a stop. Again, silence...
HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.
There
is a small field between the car and the estate.
Now --
11
11
A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --
-- it's Luther, and he's been a
professional thief his
entire life. He's a three-time
loser, but his last
sentence was so long ago and his
skills are now so vast,
so refined, that it is unlikely
he will ever get caught
again.
12
12
The grounds as Luther glides through it.
He wears a
backpack.
The night is cool.
He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is
a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't
gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.
One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,
in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.
He makes no sound at all.
13
13
Thick wood with reinforced steel.
Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens
it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer
of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a
key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the
instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:
5.
14
78
It's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond
outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway.
Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is
last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he
follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly --
it makes a loud, solid sound.
79
80
Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the
cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell
free to open the back door.
Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it,
moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the
road.
The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries
to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond
comfortably stretched out on the back seat.
81
84
The cars are still there. Burton is visible helping
Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the
door. He and Burton move to the front doors.
85
86
Collin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton
and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond
lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat.
Russell --
-- a moment of relief. She breathes deep.
And as
Russell starts to open her purse --
87
87
as it snakes down the brick mansion -- it reaches the
ground.
88
91
*
Gloria Russell, as every nightmare she has ever had comes
true -- the fucking letter opener isn't in her purse and
as she screams again --
92
92
Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the
window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the
rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he
is in serious trouble and...
93
93
The Towncar doors bursting open as Burton and Collin come
barrelling out.
94
94
Luther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again,
starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him.
95
95
Burton and Collin tearing into the house, Collin in the
lead.
96
96
Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear
COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster --
-- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s
and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten,
so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly
flying.
27.
97
97
Russell, standing by the Towncar, staring in at the house
and from the look on her face, you know she thinks her
life might be over.
98
99
Luther, halfway down.
100
101
Luther, ten feet off the ground now.
102
103
Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the
rest of the way, hits the ground running.
104
105
Luther, at the end of the house, turning a corner.
106
107
Luther, crashing through the field.
He is in wonderful
shape --
-- for a man his age.
And he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough?
108
108
The Towncar as Collin yanks something out of the glove
compartment, and then he is racing off into the night
after Burton who is a few steps ahead.
109
109
*
Russell staring after them -- in the back seat, Richmond
is in a half-slumber.
110
110
Luther, bursting out of the underbrush --
-- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him --
-- one hundred yards of open field.
He runs on.
111
111
as Collin catches up to the other man, tosses what he
took from the glove compartment.
Thermal goggles.
They put them on, on the fly and...
29.
112
THERMAL POV
112
The world ahead of them as they see it: their FIELD OF
VISION now resembles a rough computer game. THERMAL
IMAGES register in red, everything else is dark green.
113
113
Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through
the open field and...
Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but
they are moving faster --
-- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight --
-- but Collin can fly.
And he begins to leave Burton behind.
Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that
spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and
his breath coming in gasps and...
Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just
ahead is the open field and as he starts into it --
114
THERMAL POV
114
What Collin sees: a THERMAL figure; a man running out of
the open and then disappearing into the woods.
115
115
The sight of the figure is enough to kick Collin into
overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses
the open area.
116
116
Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM
now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances
back --
-- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it
rocks him, drops him to his knees --
117
117
Collin and he could be jet propelled.
30.
118
118
Luther, forcing himself back to his feet and running
again, giving it everything he has left and he's dodging
through the trees now.
119
119
Burton, behind Collin, but he draws his gun anyway --
Collin, in the woods, and his gun's drawn too --
Luther, out of the woods and now his car is visible --
Collin, in the woods but they're coming to an end.
120
THERMAL POV
120
The figure up ahead is approaching a car.
121
121
Luther, throwing the car door open, ripping off his
backpack, tossing it inside, jumping in behind the wheel.
122
122
Burton.
Pulling up, gasping terribly.
He sinks to one
knee.
Collin, out of the woods! -- Still amazingly without the
least sign of tiring --
-- and now there is a sound:
a CAR MOTOR STARTING.
123
123
Luther in his car, wheels spinning.
124
124
Collin has his pistol ready but it's impossible to hit
anything when you're running like this.
125
125
Luther, in the car, GUNNING AWAY.
31.
126
126
Collin.
Slowing.
127
127
The car.
A swirl of dust.
The dust clears.
The car rounds a corner, is gone.
128
128
Collin.
He stands there, rips off his thermal goggles --
-- and surprisingly, he smiles.
Burton, getting to his feet, his breath still not steady.
He takes his goggles off too as Collin approaches.
COLLIN
(still the smile)
I got his license number.
Now on that --
129
134
A YOUNG WOMAN parking her car -- a high rocky area above
the Potomac. Below, a jogging path is visible, full of
runners.
The Young Woman gets out, locks her car, starts down a
narrow walk toward the joggers.
She's in her mid-thirties. A good face.
And there's
something familiar about her.
135
135
Luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path,
studying the runners. Now he registers something:
and
smiles.
The Woman in her mid-thirties as she comes jogging along.
She runs well.
Luther.
An imperceptible straightening of his clothes.
The jogger.
We realize who she is: the little girl in
the photo on
Luther's dining room table. All grown up.
Now her face
registers something: his presence. Her
eyes go down
to the path, she increases her speed.
Luther.
Waving, calling out.
LUTHER
Kate.
(as she runs on)
Kate.
She slows, hesitates, stops.
Kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge
of the path as he approaches. The river flows behind
them. Runners pass by.
Beat.
LUTHER
Probably too late for me to take
it up.
She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.
LUTHER
The jogging.
KATE (YOUNG WOMAN)
Ahh.
(CONTINUED)
35.
135
CONTINUED:
135
Beat.
LUTHER
Dumb way to start this, I guess.
Beat.
LUTHER
Wanted to talk to you.
KATE
About?
LUTHER
Believe it or not, the weather.
(as she waits)
Nights are starting to get cold.
KATE
That happens this time of year.
Luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.
LUTHER
I was thinking of maybe
relocating. Someplace with a
kinder climate.
(nothing shows on
her face)
I just wanted to check it out with
you first...
(still nothing)
... you're the only family I've
got.
And on that --
Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.
KATE
Luther, you don't have me.
The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you
can't tell from his face.
LUTHER
Kate --
KATE
-- you know what it's like being
the only kid in show and tell who
got to talk about visiting day?

LUTHER
This move -- I'm talking
permanent, you understand.
KATE
We don't see each other anyway --
we haven't seen each other since
Mom died and that's a year.
(a step toward him)
Look, you chose your life. You
had that right. You were never
around for me. Fine. But I have
no plans to be around for you.
And now she stops, turns away toward the path --
-- Luther can say nothing, watches her --
-- then she spins back --
KATE
(louder now)
-- wait a minute -- you're lying
about something, aren't you? --
LUTHER
-- no --
KATE
-- are you active again? -- is
that why you're here now?
LUTHER
-- no --
Kate moves in close now --
KATE
-- I don't believe you --
(big)
-- Christ, Father, what have you
done?
And on those words --
136
139
A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than
we've seen thus far. Afternoon now.
An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's
slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears
a battered hat. As he goes inside --
140
147
A gorgeous SHOT of a very famous place.
The sun is
setting. It all looks magical.

153
*
Burton is alone in his car, exiting the gate and driving
*
home. He turns onto the main road.
154
154
He picks up speed.
Glances around -- no cars are
following.
Burton reaches into his pocket, takes out a MICRO-
CASSETTE RECORDER, flicks it ON.
RICHMOND (V.O.)
What happened to my right to
privacy?
(beat)
I think she nicked a tendon.
Burton clicks the cassette off, puts it back into his
pocket. Drives into the night...

(EARLY AFTERNOON)
Kids riding bicycles.
Very Norman Rockwell.

Burton waits by his car as Seth walks up.
BURTON

BURTON
You know how close he and Sullivan

(as Seth nods)
The minute anything breaks, if
you'd call me, I'd tell the
President. That way, he'd be the
first to alert Mr. Sullivan -- it
would mean a lot to him. And any
red tape you want cut -- done.
(as he takes out
card)
Here are my numbers.
He turns, opens his front car door.
BURTON

Leads?
SETH
Still trying to figure out what
might have happened --
BURTON
-- I loved playing Sherlock
Holmes.
SETH
(surprised)
You Secret Service guys do that?
BURTON
I was State Trooper here ten years
ago before the Government got me.
Seth.
It just pops out.

You're that Bill Burton.

Embarrassed.

Repairman leans out. He has a dazzling smile. He and
Burton wave to each other...

174
10 A.M. A white-brick, weather-beaten building, Old
Glory fighting the breeze.
RICHMOND (V.O.)
I am having this press conference
here because...
Richmond, speaking on a podium. The press corps stands
in front of him, TV crews of all kinds, CNN the most
noticeable.
RICHMOND
... it is here, at this courthouse,
*
that Christine Sullivan's killer
will be tried for his crime.
Burton and Collin, in the b.g., scanning the crowd.
Gloria Russell stands behind them.
175
176
Richmond at his press conference.
He speaks without
notes and he speaks beautifully.
RICHMOND
As you know, I came from an
impoverished family in an
impoverished town -- but we lived
with our doors unlocked.
Russell watching, listening; she loves hearing him talk.
RICHMOND (O.S.)
We all lock our doors now, but
that is not what concerns me...
Burton and Collin, scanning the crowd.
RICHMOND (O.S.)
... we are also locking our
hearts... that is the sadness,
that is the loss.
Richmond, and suddenly he's like a Southern minister.
RICHMOND
We are locking our hearts to the
cries of the weary, we are locking
our hearts to the poor and their
pain...
An old man, standing behind Russell.
We realize it's
Walter Sullivan.
RICHMOND (O.S.)
... Sisters and brothers, we are
locking our hearts to ourselves.
177
178
The press corps.
Subdued, saddened.
Richmond and Walter. They turn, face the cameras. The
president's arm is still around the old man; they both
blink back tears and now --
-- here it comes ! --
179
179
Tears of rage in his eyes.
A rage so deep it shocks
him --
LUTHER
You -- heartless -- prick --

The Bartender, surprised, turning toward Luther. He
starts to say something, stops; something tells him to
shut up and he does.

Richmond, wiping away tears, alone on camera.

Burton, yawning, blowing into a steaming paper cup of
coffee. Collin, wide awake, moves alongside. Collin is
carrying a rifle.
-- we are at a government firing range.
Collin squints into the morning sun.
Burton, putting down the coffee cup, picking up a pair of
binoculars.
Burton and Collin staring out --

281
283
Luther in the night.
Silence.
He is moving across the rooftop of a home. He carries a
briefcase -- Luther's making business calls.
Ahead is an attic window -- as he slides it open --
103.
284
291
A bunch of commuters and businessmen are buying papers.
The newspapers. Washington, New York, Philadelphia --
and they're all different front pages, of course, but one
photo in all of them is the same --
-- every one of them is running the mug shot of Luther.
And the sense of the stories is the same too:
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
CUT TO:

COMMUTERS

crowded around, making their purchases. Some of them are
young, some of them are half asleep. One of them is in
his 60's and very wide awake --
-- it's Luther --
-- as he buys a paper, looks at the headline --
fascinated.
105.
292A
301
Kate, leaving her building, going toward her car, getting
in.
Down the block is a police car. Two surveillance cops
inside. Kate starts to drive -- and so do they.
Kate turns a corner --
-- and so do they --
-- and as they do, they pass Luther, parked on the
corner. Watching. Satisfied, he drives off in another
direction.
302
302
Luther, heading out of the city.
The sun is higher in
the sky.
303
303
Several cars. Traffic is moving slowly.
Luther
continues to drive.
304
304
Kate, coming out of her office building, hurrying along
the sidewalk. Lunch hour.
*
She goes past some brownstones -- the two cops walk
*
behind --
-- the window of one of the brownstones is open, shadowy
movement from inside --
-- Kate hurries past, not paying attention... Cops don't
either.
305
305
Now a figure begins to appear in the window --
The figure holds something long and thin, like a rifle
barrel --
-- it's a large woman with a long mop -- as she shakes
it --
Afternoon and the sun is strong.
109.
306
306
Sunlight, streaming in an open bedroom window.
Whose
bedroom, though?
Two maids are cleaning it --
-- and now we realize where we are: Walter Sullivan's
bedroom, but it's all been changed, different rug,
different fabrics, different furnishings.
The maids work silently and well. A final sweep of a
dust rag here, a last tug at the bedspread there.
Done.
They go to the door, take a last look around.
Perfect.
They go.
HOLD ON the empty room.
Keep HOLDING.
Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps
out, clicker in hand.
The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it
back inside --
-- the door starts to close --
-- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he
took the night of the robbery.
And as he moves silently toward the door.
307
307
The outskirts of Washington.
Mid-afternoon now.
Luther's at a pay phone.
308
309
Luther.
Fast.
LUTHER
I'm not staying on long enough for
you to track this, just answer me.
310
311
The telephone swinging back and forth --
-- and in the b.g., a car MOTOR ROARING away.
312
312A
Luther, driving like crazy through the city.
312B
312B
Kate, getting into her car in front of her building,
driving off -- no one is behind her.
312C
312C
Luther, HONKING his HORN as he barrels around a corner,
scattering traffic.

Kate drives into the park past a sign reading:
*
"PARKING LOT."
*
312E
312E
Luther, gunning along -- up ahead the park is visible
now.
312F
312F
Kate, following an arrow that leads to the parking lot.
Luther, in the park, now, suddenly shouting "Shit" as
we --
312G
312G
A "DETOUR" sign.
Kate, entering the parking lot.
312H
312H
Luther, out of his car now, running like crazy through
the park. Ahead is a sign saying: "JOGGING PATH."
313
313
Not many other cars so she gets a space in front,
overlooking the river, and as she stops, takes out her
keys --
314
BURTON AND COLLIN
314
Collin at the wheel, ROARING in behind her, rear-ending
her hard.
-- there is a SCREECH of BRAKES and a SCREAM --
314A
314A
Luther as he hears the terrible sound, keeps running.
315
315
Kate in her car as it teeters at the edge and then starts
its long fall to the jogging path far below.

Luther, running INTO VIEW, stopping dead, helpless now,
staring at the worst thing in the world --

Kate's car, careening against a rocky ledge, then cart
wheeling the rest of the way down, landing horribly,
spinning, finally coming to rest upside down and --

*
Luther running to the car; hands shaking, he manages to
*
pull front door open and reach inside --
-- now there are cries as other joggers stop and stare
and --
Kate, as Luther pulls her body out of the wreckage.
LUTHER
(terrified)
... Kate...?
-- no response -- it's impossible to tell if she's
alive --
-- in the distance now, the sound of an AMBULANCE.
320
320
The AMBULANCE, SIREN SCREAMING.
PULL BACK to reveal --
Early evening now, getting dark, and the ambulance
braking in front of the emergency room of a large city
hospital --
-- as doctors and attendants with gurneys come pouring
out --
113.
321
327
A dumpster outside --
-- the gurney is there --
-- the figure isn't --
-- the sound of a CAR GUNNING into the night and we --
328
329
Walter Sullivan, getting into his limousine in front of a
Georgetown mansion. Later in the evening. The car
starts to move. Walter looks frail and very old now.
And somehow smaller.
330
330
Walter huddled in the back seat, as the street lights
illuminate him. He might even be ill. In any case, a
sad figure.
331
331
The limousine, turning a corner.
332
333
The CAR.
A SCREAMING TURN.
334
335
-- and we're at the rear of the White House.

122.
336
337
Luther has gotten out too. They stand close to each
other. They nod. Then Walter starts away.
WALTER SULLIVAN
(turns -- quiet now,
at peace)
I did love her, you know.
And he walks away.
A White House SECURITY GUARD as Walter approaches.
WALTER SULLIVAN
Is he working late? I haven't an
appointment but I'd like to see
him if I might.
GUARD
You don't need an appointment, Mr.
Sullivan.
And as he waves him through --
Luther, standing there, watching the old man.
Walter, a final turn back, a nod of the head.
Luther.
He nods back, returns to the car, gets in --
-- and now we begin a BLIZZARD OF CUTS.
338
338
Luther driving through the night.
339
339
Walter entering the White House proper.
340
341
Luther.
Driving faster.
342
346
Luther pulling up into the parking lot of the hospital,
getting out, passing the parking lot attendant who is
listening transfixed to a small radio.
