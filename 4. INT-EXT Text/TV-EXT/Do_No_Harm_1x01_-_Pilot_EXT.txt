Jeffrey stands in front of the insanely beautiful OLD SOUTH 
CHURCH.  He makes his way towards the imposing Cathedral. 



The CAB pulls off the highway into the parking lot of a 
secluded motel.  Kohl gets out.  Looks at his watch. 

CLOSE ON WATCH:  0:14 minutes and counting.  

He can feel IAN COMING.  The NEON LIGHTS become OVERWHELMING.  
The HIGHWAY SOUNDS DEAFENING. 22.



The MOTEL DOOR opens onto LENA.  Standing outside.  Worried.

REVEAL Ian holding a BROKEN SHARD of the MIRROR behind his 
back.  Gripping it like a BLADE.  

LENA
Jeffrey?  Are you okay?

He looks her up and down like a lion would his prey.

Ian comes out of it.  He's thrilled someone Jeffrey cares 
about is within his grasp.  To corrupt.  To make his own.

Lena can t help but smile.  At the absurdity of the question.

He unbuttons a third button.  Her blouse falls off one 
shoulder.  Ian delicately removes her blouse from the other 
shoulder.  She s fully exposed.  Vulnerable.  They lock eyes. 

LENA
... Now what?

SMASH CUT TO:




The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Kohl gets 
off the train.  Looks around for the Mysterious Man.  But 
 see him.doesn t

As the PASSENGERS disperse he sees a woman staring off into 
the distance.  This is OLIVIA CASE (30s).  Unruly blond hair 
that falls onto her pale skin.  Delicate features.  Fragile 
by nature.  She chews a fingernail.  Which makes Jeffrey 
smile.  Then she sees him.   A mix of love and regret and 
pain.  Kohl tentatively walks up to her.  They look at each 
other for a charged moment.  

OLIVIA

Kohl s as raw as we ve ever seen him.34.

Ian could have the day.  And I 
could spend the whole night with 
you.

Olivia is relieved it s Jeffrey.  But also full of sorrow and 
hurt.

OLIVIA
We never did.  Did we?

KOHL
... no.

But Olivia has to stop herself from indulging in the past.  
For fear it might threaten her resolve.

Off Kohl... torn between the past and present.

Kohl walks up to a small suburban house.  He RINGS the 
doorbell.  Hands SHAKING.  He looks at his watch.  

CLOSE ON WATCH:  0:02 minutes and counting.  45.

Then the door opens.  It's Sienna's husband, the POLICEMAN.  
He recognizes Dr. Kohl.  

POLICEMAN
What are you doing here?

Kohl looks him dead in the eye.  

KOHL
Listen to me.  Very.  Very.  
Carefully.  You have two minutes to 
call your station and turn yourself 
in.

The Policeman tenses.  

POLICEMAN
... Or what?

KOHL
Or you will see a side of me that s 
not as accommodating.
(then)
Now you have one minute.

POLICEMAN
Get the hell off my property.

The Policeman tries to close the door but Kohl puts his foot 
in the doorjamb.  

KOHL
Make the call.  For your sake.

POLICEMAN
I warned you.

KOHL

The Policeman PUNCHES KOHL in the gut.  Pulls him inside the 
house.


OVERHEAD SHOT:  A LONE CAR in an empty parking lot.


Lena walks out of the building.  Kohl watches her from afar.

KOHL (V.O.) (CONT D)
Ian Price and I are bound together.  
But there is a line I will not let 
him cross.  I ll have no choice but 
to end his life.  And by

Lena turns to see Kohl.  She immediately starts walking in 
the other direction.  He gently stops her.  She avoids making 
eye contact with him.

KOHL (CONT D)
Please.  I'm not asking for your 
forgiveness.  
(then)
I don't deserve that.  

LENA
Then what do you want?

The sun peeking up above the harbor.


The CAMERA TRACKS down a row of suburban houses.  Landing 
on...


Where OLIVIA, in pajamas, walks out of her house.  She picks 
up the newspaper in the front yard.  Looks at the front page.  
Starts to walk back to the house when... she stops.  Has a 
creepy feeling.  Like she's being watched.  She looks around 
the neighborhood.  

Sees a few NEIGHBORS.  But that's all.  Nothing suspicious.  

What she doesn't see is IAN PRICE.  Hiding in plain sight.  
Watching her every move.  Hungry for her.

Just then a LITTLE BOY walks out of the house.  This is COLE, 
four-years-old.  He's in his pajamas and carries two little 
monkey lovies.  He looks like Jeffrey Kohl.  And Ian Price.  

Olivia picks him up in her arms and kisses him.  She gives 
the neighborhood one last look then walks back inside.  
 lovies falls to the Unbeknownst to them, one of Cole s
ground.

BACK ON IAN.  His curiosity more than piqued.  He walks out 
of the shadows and into Olivia's front yard.  He picks up the 
little monkey.

Just then the door opens.  And Cole walks out.  Cole stops 
when he sees Ian.  They both look at each other.  

IAN
Is this your monkey?

Cole nods.60.


IAN (CONT D)
Do you want him back?

Cole nods.

IAN (CONT D)

COLE
... Cole.

IAN
Cute.  

Ian smiles.  A whole new world has just opened up.

IAN (CONT D)
Here you go, Cole.

Ian offers Cole the Monkey.  Cole reaches for it but Ian 
pulls it away. 

IAN (CONT D)
Be careful. 

Ian gets closer.  

IAN (CONT D)
Monkey's have been known to eat 
their young.
