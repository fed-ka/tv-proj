  Batiatus startles awake, alone in his bed. Face battered, 
  but now a week into healing. A moment of panic, quickly 
  passing as he gains his bearings. Just another torturous 
  nightmare of his humiliation.

  BATIATUS PAINFULLY RISES

  Naked. Body still dappled with ugly bruises and cuts. He 
  grimaces, gathering his robes with some difficulty.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  She spots Batiatus, freezes in disapproving surprise.

  Batiatus waves them off, flaring as he dresses himself.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am not a babe newly dropped from 
                        fucking womb.

                        Yes, Domina.

  Diona and Naevia exit. Gaia, sensing Batiatus' prickly mood, 
  makes excuse to leave.

                        intent in Capua to drink us dry?

  Lucretia falters slightly under the weight of her recent 
  sexual indiscretions with Gaia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She has been of great comfort.

                        And seeks the word for herself.

  He winces. Lucretia gently helps him with his robes. He 
  reluctantly accepts it.

                        bloodied and broken? His life in 
                        question?

  Fresh tears well in her eyes. He takes her hand, softening.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I live. And have thoughts towards 
                        continuing so. I would not have my 
                        injuries wound you as well.

  He gently kisses her. She draws strength from his touch.

                      It is a balm, to see you upon your

  broaches the subject.

                        You must be dulled by it, to 
                        consider the beating I gave you 
                        victory.

  The cell door opens, revealing Melitta escorted by a GUARD.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Finally, someone who can hold their 
                        wine!

  He pours her a cup. Melitta hits Oenomaus with a questioning 
  smile.

                                          MELITTA
                        I did not realize we were for

  Oenomaus shoots Gannicus a look.

                        After we see the jug emptied! The 
                        last of my spoils, to be shared 
                        with dearest friends.

                        I embrace the pain. It is the only 
                        way.

  He shares a warm smile with Melitta. Gannicus laughs, 
  swilling from his jug.

  Melitta takes them in, worry tugging the corner of her lips.

                        What would really happen? If you

  Gannicus turns serious.

                        I would give your husband a

  Gannicus laughs, breaking the moment. Oenomaus chuckles. 
  Melitta does not share their mirth.

  Gannicus cracks up. Oenomaus suppresses a smile.

                        Then I suppose I will have to fuck 
                      my way out of it.

  Gannicus laughs, exits. OFF Melitta, not caring for the 
  exchange...



  Gannicus passes Barca's cell. Pigeons COO in their wooden 
  cages as Barca and Auctus kiss. Auctus grins in pleasure, 
  Barca's hand moving rhythmically BELOW FRAME as he jerks his 
  lover off. Gannicus laughs, but there's a sadness to it.

                                        GANNICUS

  Gannicus WHIRLS around and pins Crixus with a forearm to the

  Gannicus gauges him, removes his arm.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Heed Oenomaus' instruction and you 
                        will earn your brand. Till then,

                      It is not the brand that concerns 
                        me. It is becoming champion.

  Gannicus eyes him, laughs. The kid's got balls.

                                        GANNICUS
                        There is only one way to become 
                        champion, little man. Never fucking 
                        lose.

  Gannicus exits, leaving Crixus to ponder the weight of his 
  advice. MOVE OFF CRIXUS, rising into the rafters as we

  RISING UP FROM THE FLOOR, night shifting to morning. Naevia, 
  Diona, and other SLAVES bustle about, preparing the villa.

  Doctore reins himself back in, nods in deference. Batiatus 
  considers Doctore, wheels turning.

  Doctore exits, satisfied. Lucretia passes him as she enters

                        Atticus! Yes! A withered specimen.

  Lucretia rises to meet Batiatus as he enters. Batiatus acts 
  surprised to find Varus.

  Varus eyes Batiatus' battered face with concern. Batiatus 
  laughs in embarrassment.

  She takes his arm, tossing Batiatus and Lucretia a wry smile 
  as she leads him out, WIPING US TO:



  Doctore trails in Batiatus' agitated wake.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Doctore, his world disintegrating...



  Smoke from braziers of HEMP SEEDS waft through the 
  triclinium. Diaphanous curtains have been drawn to trap it. 
  A den of sensual decadence. Melitta attends Lucretia and 
  Gaia. Varus is fanned by his Slaves. Naevia and Diona are 
  not present.

  Varus sips the opium wine, passes the bowl to Lucretia.

  Gannicus shoots Melitta a worried look. Varus chuckles, the 
  opium beginning to take affect.

                        breast, tears turned to blood.

                                        VARUS
                        I am not impressed by inflated 
                        tales. My interests are grounded... 
                      By what I can see... What I can 
                        touch...

  Varus slips his hand down into Gannicus' subligaria. 
  Gannicus' jaw clenches. Varus smiles.

                                          VARUS(cont'd)
                        Now that... is impressive. Are you 
                      as skilled in its use as you are 
                        with a sword?

  Gannicus looks to Batiatus. Batiatus glares a warning.

                                        GANNICUS
                                to Varus, soft)(
                        Yes, Dominus.

                                        VARUS
                                  removing his hand)(
                        I would have demonstration.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man is yours. We will lend 
                        privacy.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.
  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus motions for Gaia and Lucretia to exit. Varus 
  laughs.

                                        VARUS
                        You mistake intent. I have had too 
                        much wine and other pleasures for 
                        such rough exertion. No, I would 
                        prefer a feast of the eyes.
                                  indicating Melitta)(
                        Have him fuck this one, and I shall 
                        watch.

  Melitta reacts, shocked. Gannicus shares it. Lucretia 
  stammers.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Apologies...

                                        VARUS
                        For what? Is she not a slave?

                                        BATIATUS
                        She is. And will do as commanded.

  Batiatus nods to Melitta, his eyes flashing a warning. OFF 
  Melitta, realizing she has no choice but to betray her 
  husband...



  Melitta stands frozen as Gannicus approaches her. She 
  glances to Lucretia, who is sympathetic, but offers no 
  solution. Varus sits eating a bowl of cherries.

                                        VARUS
                        Remove her dress.

  Gannicus hesitates. Batiatus glares. Gannicus reluctantly 
  complies, slipping Melitta's dress off. Her eyes well with 
  tears as it hits the floor, TRANSITIONING US TO --



  Gannicus lays Melitta down, his face wracked by guilt and 
  regret.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                        Melitta --

                                  whispers)(
                        See it done.

  A tear crests her cheek. Gannicus enters her. She gasps. He 
  begins moving inside her. Slowly at first, but with building 
  intensity.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Gannicus thrusts with increasing purpose. Despite the 
    circumstance, he begins losing himself in the moment.

  VARUS

  watches, delighted and aroused. He slips a hand into his 
  robes BELOW FRAME and begins to masturbate. Gaia eyes him, 
  reaches over BELOW FRAME -- and retrieves a cherry. She 
  bites into the fruit with a satisfied smile.

  MELITTA

  begins to react to Gannicus, a mixture of guilt and passion 
  swirling across her face. She groans, inching towards 
  unexpected climax.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Melitta cries out as she climaxes. A frozen moment as she 
  locks eyes with Gannicus in the aftermath, guilt and shame 
  seizing her heart.



  Batiatus stands removed from the curtained-off area of the 
  triclinium, speaking in a hushed whisper to a bloodied 
  Oenomaus. Two GUARDS have escorted him in.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man is dead?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I did not want it. He forced me to 
                        fight. I do not know the cause of 
                        his anger towards me.

  Batiatus nervously glances at the shadows moving on the 
  other side of the triclinium curtains, moves so Oenomaus' 
  back is towards them.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The reason falls to my own tongue. 
                        Earlier I revealed intent of 
                        raising you to position of Doctore.

  Oenomaus wrestles with the shock of that.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I am not to return to the arena?

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are beyond such things now, 
                        proven by your training of Crixus.

                        Let us put the past behind us, and 
                        look to future glories.

  He nods to the Guards to remove him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      My wife.

  Batiatus tenses.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        I know it is not our time, but I 
                        would ask to see her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I will send her to you. When she 
                        has finished her duties.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gratitude.

  He moves off with the Guards, the recent events weighing 
  heavy. Batiatus watches him go, his face unreadable.



  Gannicus and Melitta can't look at each other as they dress. 
  Their friendship marred forever. Batiatus reenters with a 
  smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies. The demands of a lanista 
                        seldom offer respite.

  Varus smiles lazily, the effects of the opium lingering.

                                        VARUS
                        None required. This night has been 
                        filled with unexpected joys.

  He kisses Gaia on the cheek.

                                          VARUS(cont'd)
                        You remain in Capua?

                                        GAIA
                        Until more adventurous opportunity 
                        presents itself.

                                        VARUS
                        I will take my leave, then. With 
                        promise of further discourse.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

  He starts to exit, pauses.

                                          VARUS(cont'd)
                                to Batiatus)(
                        Your man. Gannicus. I would see him 
                        perform again. In the primus of my 
                        games.

  Batiatus barely contains himself. Gannicus reacts, 
  excitement competing with the guilt of how this was 
  achieved.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And you shall have him.

                                        VARUS
                        Terms to be discussed.
                                to everyone)(
                        Gratitude for your hospitality. It 
                        will not soon be forgotten

  He drifts out, followed by his Slaves.

                        The primus!

                        Did I not tell you I knew the man?

                                        BATIATUS
                        May the gods strike me for 
                        entertaining doubt.

  Batiatus turns his attention to Gannicus and Melitta.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You have elevated this house. Yet 
                        speak of how we came by such honor, 
                        and see brotherhood shattered.
                                to Melitta)(
                        And a husband lost.

  Gannicus and Melitta feel the full weight of the warning. 
  MUSIC FADES UP, carrying us through the following scenes:



  SLOW MOTION. A shell-shocked Melitta sits alone in the bath, 
  absently washing herself. She breaks down, tears of shame 
  coursing down her cheeks.

  HEMP SMOKE

  swirls across the tragic scene, TRANSITIONING US TO:



  SLOW MOTION. Hemp smoke swirls. Batiatus drinks from the 
  opium laced bowl, wine spilling as he laughs in triumph. He 
  grabs Lucretia, kissing her hungrily. She responds in an 
  opium haze.

  GAIA

  joins them, her hands exploring. Lucretia looks to Batiatus, 
  unsure of his reaction. He hesitates, kisses Gaia as well. 
  Batiatus and Lucretia's hands move across Gaia's body, 
  undressing her. Her gown falls away, WIPING US TO:



  SLOW MOTION: LOW ON THE CELL DOOR as it opens and Melitta 
  enters. She moves to Oenomaus, who sits on the floor before 
  the lit candles of Melitta's altar. Doctore's blood- 
  splattered chestplate is in his hands.

  OENOMAUS

  turns to look up at Melitta, ending the SLOW MOTION.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  a whisper)(
                        I have done a terrible thing.

  Tears cloud his eyes. Melitta bites back her own, remorse 
  for what happened with Gannicus barely concealed.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

  She takes him into her arms, trying to ease his guilt. And 
  her own...
