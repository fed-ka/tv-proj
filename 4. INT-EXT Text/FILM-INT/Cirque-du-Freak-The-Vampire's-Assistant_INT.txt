Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed
blinds streaking the floor where:
Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with
VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack
from his backpack, spreads them out as well.
DARREN
I don't get it.
STEVE
Vampires. I've been studying them.
Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.
DARREN
Right. You're failing half your
classes at school, but you're
studying vampires.
STEVE
They been around 1000's of years.
Two tribes. They even fight wars.
6.
DARREN
What? When?
STEVE
Okay, sometimes, when humans fight?
They fight at the same time. And
no one knows it. Like at the
Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
the same time the Russians and
Germans were fighting.
Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.
STEVE
Some people know about it. There
have even been books written.
He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.
DARREN
That's your proof? It smells.
Steve's really trying to convince him now.
STEVE
It's everywhere if you look. On
the internet, in blogs, newspapers,
weird places. But you can find it.
The room starts to tighten a notch around them.
STEVE
I chatted online with one of them.
DARREN
Come on.
STEVE
Serious.
We become aware of...
A SINISTER POV
Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.
DARREN
What was his name? Mr. Dracula?
Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th
Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet
print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe...
7.
STEVE
Here he is in 1923. And here 1855.
Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.
Would that make you believe?
As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.
Suddenly Darren spins...
And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She
SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.
ANNIE
How'd you know?
DARREN
Saw your shadow on the floor.
Gotta try harder, knucklehead.
Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.
STEVE
I'm gonna get a soda.
DARREN
Get me one, too.
Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.
CUT TO:
Steve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.
At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in
through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door
open, two sneakered feet behind it.
MOM
I know you want to fight global
warming, Darren, but that's not the
way to do it.
Steve leans back to show his face.
STEVE
Sorry, Mrs. Shan.
MOM
Oh hi, Steve. I thought you were,
Darren.
8.
STEVE
I wish I was.
(RE: FRIDGE)
You guys got everything in here.
MOM
Help yourself.
She sets her PURSE down on the counter.
MOM
How's your mother?
STEVE
She's okay... She's been working a
lot lately.
A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something
about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.
MOM
(POINTS)
Glasses are up there.
STEVE
I know.
Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to
pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...
The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take
him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.
A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off
three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!
A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,
frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --
Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her
celiphone, so...
MOM
(INTO PHONE)
Hello?
.it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not
listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses
and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and
guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse...
CUT TO:
9.
Steve comes up off the stairs. He sets the glasses on a hall
table, continues into...
DARREN'S ROOM
Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve
reaches past, starts packing it up.
STEVE
I gotta go. See ya tonight.
DARREN
Huh? Tonight where?
He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder.
STEVE
Cirque du Freak.
DARREN
I got no money right now.
STEVE
Don't sweat it. I got money. Meet
me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion
Theater.
DARREN
That place is supposed to be
haunted.
Steve rolls his eyes, starts out...
DARREN
What am I going to tell my parents?
STEVE
Tell them you're sleeping over. We
can meet early, walk over together.
DARREN
I don't know, man...
STEVE
D, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna
hear about it Monday? Or see it
tonight?
Steve lets his point sink in, then goes.
CUT TO:
10.
Darren and Annie and his mom and DAD eat dinner. Annie
chatters away.
ANNIE
And that's why we need a dog.
She waits for an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look.
DAD
We'll have to think about it.
ANNIE
How do you guys decide who's going
to say no when you look at each
other.
DAD
Whoever's eyes are the widest. And
I didn't say no. Yet.
As she tries to think through a new approach...
DARREN
Mom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's
tonight? Okay?
MOM
(emphatic; no hesitation)
No.
DARREN
What? Why not?
MOM
Because I said so, Darren.
DARREN
I'm fourteen. I shouldn't even
have to ask stuff like this.
MOM
The answer is no. And I'm not sure
I want you hanging around with
Steve anymore.
DARREN
I've known him since I was five
years old!
11.
MOM
People change and I don't like the
way Steve's changing.
DARREN
But -- That's not fair!
DAD
Stop arguing with her, Darren.
Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As
Annie wonders if she should ask what's up...
CUT TO:
Paint peeling. The walls scribbled on. Most of all - it's
dark. Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from...
A HALLWAY
They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a
darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve...
DARREN
The balcony. Where he fell...
VOICE
May I help you?
They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL.
Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.
STEVE
We're here to see the show.
He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.
MR. TALL
Ticket.
Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren.
MR. TALL
Do you have your ticket? Darren.
Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his
name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it.
MR. TALL
This way. We're about to begin.
Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:
DARREN
(LOW)
He knew my name.
STEVE
Maybe he heard me say it.
13.
Mr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But...
AROUND CORNER
When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a
threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side.
The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...
THE ZEITERION THEATER
Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those
that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.
No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of
the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a
TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.
Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second
stage light goes out.
And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,
the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the
trumpets and all is silent.
Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it
was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.
There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.
A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage
in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..
The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!
Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body
covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the
bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain
hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.
Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are
amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.
Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.
MR. TALL
Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to
the Cirque du Freak. We are an
ancient circus. We have toured for
five hundred years...
14.
Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.
MR. TALL
.Bringing the remarkable and
grotesque to generations. Our
freaks are not people in masks.
They are not harmless misfits.
What you see tonight is real. Each
performer unique. None harmless.
To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-
reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.
A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin
Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.
Even the Wolfman takes notice.
MR. TALL
Beauty and the beast.
Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper
body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.
Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,
step out and start to push the cage off stage.
Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same
languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.
Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.
Some in the audience recoil.
Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...
From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE
& SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back
with their ankles cinched behind there necks.
As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like
Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each
other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like
pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.
As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.
After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The
light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.
15.
RHAMUS
My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And
I do have two.
He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in
the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus
stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's
practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.
More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and
lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.
Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it
and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can
grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.
Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows
them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the
sound of metal shifting inside.
The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out
BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on
stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.
He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.
With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.
Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience.
As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An
enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out
to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises
itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly
transfixed by the light. But in reality...
The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)
down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged
with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists
over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.
Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.
The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body
SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!
He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the
snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides
forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.
Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.
16.
DARREN & STEVE
DARREN
He's as old as us.
STAGE
Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake
begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back
to look him in the eye. And then...
Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like
he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.
More applause from the audience.
Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...
Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's
nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --
LARTEN CREPSLEY!
Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from
his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.
DARREN & STEVE
Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the
print-out from his pocket, compares.
DARREN
It's him...
STAGE
Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just
as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the
footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.
CREPSLEY
It's not true. That all tarantulas
are poisonous. Though some can
kill a man. With one bite.
Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA
the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out
individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.
DARREN
Reacts. A spider!
17.
STAGE
Crepsley makes the introduction.
CREPSLEY
Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that
she never learns yours.
Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the
stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley
starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.
Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The
spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.
Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.
Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.
CREPSLEY
No...? Shall it be life?
Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They
release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.
Crepsley faces the audience.
CREPSLEY
I wonder if you would be as shocked
to see the same fate for me?
Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.
DARREN & STEVE
Have a million questions, but right now the performance has
their full edge-of-their-seat attention.
STAGE
Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.
CREPSLEY
Though we have been together such a
long time, she is no pet. I think
she would quite enjoy killing me.
Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN
WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.
18.
CREPSLEY
For her bite there is no cure.
Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence
about to be directed at her master.
Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
to play, as simple as it is evocative.
Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,
starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She
gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.
She sways; she's dancing!
Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley
keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about
18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.
Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She
sails up high over Crepsley's head.
He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She
lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.
Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her
hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage
is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.
A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing
happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the
gloom. It's too dark.
The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light
comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.
MR. TALL
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
That is the end of our show.
AUDIENCE MAN
But... What happened to him?!
MR. TALL
Don't you know? What happens to us
all, can happen to any of us.
That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion
seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.
19.
The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the
audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.
Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.
DARREN
Let's get outta here.
STEVE
No, you go. I'm staying.
Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.
DARREN
Wait. What're you doing?
Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is
mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.
As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.
Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.
STEVE
This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.
Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands
in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.
STEVE
That car today. It was a sign.
Sending me here. I was told
there'd be a sign.
Too friggin' weird.
DARREN
Told by who? The guy in the chat
room? The internet guy?
STEVE
I'll tell you later. If I can.
Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.
Darren stands, whispers into the dark.
DARREN
Steve...
Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.
CUT TO:
20.
Darren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts
sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops
short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR
IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.
DARREN
Steve...?
No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.
CUT TO:
STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA
He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he
heads further into the dark.
DARREN
Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.
DARREN
Steve...
CUT TO:
STEVE
Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a
costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.
The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a
corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.
DARREN
Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his
left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...
STEVE
He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside
pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.
DARREN
Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of
her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches
behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...
21.
STEVE
Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be
filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside.
CREPSLEY'S VOICE
Are you looking for me?
Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!
Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.
DARREN
Rooted to the spot. Watching...
STEVE & CREPSLEY
Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact.
STEVE
I -- I know who you are.
CREPSLEY
Tell me, boy. Who am I?
STEVE
You're a vampire.
CREPSLEY
Too broad a definition. Do you
introduce yourself as a human? Who
I am is Larten Crepsley.
DARREN
Moving slightly to get a clearer view.
STEVE & CREPSLEY
Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve
jumps, twists around. Unnerved.
CREPSLEY
Who sent you and what do they want?
STEVE
Nothing. No one.
Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.
CREPSLEY
Then what do you want?
22.
STEVE
I want to join you.
CREPSLEY
Join me? I don't understand.
STEVE
I want you to make me a vampire.
Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there
trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.
CREPSLEY
Is it because you want to live
forever? Because we don't.
STEVE
I don't care about living forever.
But you do seem to live a long
time.
CREPSLEY
A long time alone. Do you want to
live alone?
STEVE
I already do.
CREPSLEY
Are you an orphan?
STEVE
My father's gone; my mother doesn't
care about me.
CREPSLEY
Nor mine. You're friendless also?
STEVE
I have a friend, but he doesn't
understand. He's got too much to
know what it's like to be alone.
As Darren reacts to this...
STEVE
When you're alone you feel weak.
Useless. But I know there must be
something strong about it, too. I
want to feel the power of being
alone. I want to be a vampire.
23.
CREPSLEY
The power of being alone will never
be greater than the weakness of it.
STEVE
I don't care.
Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a
dismissive hand.
CREPSLEY
It makes no matter. We do not
blood children. I'm sorry.
Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-
inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.
CREPSLEY
Do you intend to use that on me?
And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own
palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.
STEVE
Do it. Make me a vampire.
CREPSLEY
Do not tempt me.
DARREN
Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly
get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's
blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's
wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.
CREPSLEY
Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.
STEVE
What's wrong?
CREPSLEY
You have bad blood.
STEVE
What do you mean?
24.
CREPSLEY
I can taste the menace in your
blood. You can never be a vampire.
You're evil.
Steve scrambles to his feet.
STEVE
That's a lie. You take that back!
Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.
CREPSLEY
Go home.
Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.
CREPSLEY
GO!
Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we
can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.
DARREN
Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds
his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over
and kicks the fridge door closed.
And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.
Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.
That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage
and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.
CUT TO:
Darren stands across from his Dad.
DAD
A freak show? Are you kidding me?
DARREN
It was down at the old Zeiterion
Theater. Look, dad, I'm sorry.
It's just, I couldn't resist. I --
DAD
You told me the other day you were
broke. You were looking for a job
to do around the house this
weekend.
DARREN
Yeah? So?
DAD
Where'd you get money for the show?
DARREN
Steve had money.
Darren's Dad's suspicion is confirmed.
26.
DAD
Steve... We weren't going to tell
you, but we think Steve stole money
from your Mom's purse yesterday.
DARREN
He wouldn't do that.
DAD
Mom's pretty sure about it.
DARREN
Man, what is this? You don't want
me hanging around with him. Now
you say you think he stole money?
Do you know for sure?
DAD
No.
DARREN
Steve's had some bad times lately.
I'm trying to be a good friend.
DAD
Being a good friend and sneaking
out are two different things.
DARREN
I have to sneak out! You treat me
like a kid!
A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room.
DAD
Then act like an adult if that's
how you want to be treated. This
world is crossed by fences --
Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times.
DARKEN
I know, I know. And you gotta
decide which side you stand on.
And you can't sit on it either.
His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him.
He starts for the door, looks back before exiting.
DAD
A freak show. What do they do, put
people in cages for everyone to
laugh at?
27.
Darren feels bad, like a kid. He looks down at the floor.
DARREN
It wasn't like that.
A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs.
He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look
outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear.
CUT TO:
Darren sets the cage on a shelf, shuts the door. Black.
CUT TO:
Darren's Mom making omelettes. Darren's DAD helping, dicing
up some ham. Annie sits at the table awaiting the results.
ANNIE
Is he in a lot of trouble?
DAD
Nothing a few years in prison won't
take care of.
ANNIE
I don't see what the big deal is...
DAD
(TO MOM)
Did you talk to Steve's mom yet?
MOM
Get this. She said she couldn't
comment because she didn't make it
home last night herself.
ANNIE
Where was she?
MOM
Go tell Darren it's breakfast.
CUT TO:
MADAM OCTA - VIDEO VIEW
Seen through the bars of her cage. FREEZE FRAME.
28.
DARREN'S ROOM
Darren's just snapped her photo with his DIGITAL CAMERA.
As the door bursts open and Annie enters... Darren scrambles
to block the cage from view.
DARREN
Annie, you gotta learn to knock.
ANNIE
Mom said to come eat. What's that?
As Annie tries to look, Darren stays in front of her.
DARREN
Out.
Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the cage in the closet.
CUT TO:
Darren arrives, sits as everyone pretends not to notice. His
mom slides his omelette off the pan into his plate. Annie
watches everyone's every move. Darren eats a bite.
DARREN
Mom, this is the best omelette I
ever had.
His Dad can't help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased,
but knows she's being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh,
Darren shoots her a look.
A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door
to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie.
STEVE
Hey, midget, where's the idiot?
Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone
else. He recovers, does his best Eddie Haskell...
STEVE
Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It's nice
to see ya.
As Steve gets several less than welcoming looks...
CUT TO:
29.
Darren and Steve enter his bedroom.
STEVE
What was that? Everyone acting
like they don't know me. Did I
walk in on something?
Darren closes the door. Gets to the point.
DARREN
What happened last night?
STEVE
Nothing. I hung out in the theater
for awhile, but no one was around.
The lie hangs in the air a moment.
STEVE
Sorry about the way I acted. I'm
sorry I pushed you.
DARREN
Don't worry. There's, you know, no
bad blood or anything like that.
STEVE
What?
DARREN
I said don't worry.
STEVE
You said bad blood. I never heard
you say something like that before.
DARREN
What are you, the word police?
Steve gives him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren
glances at the bandage on Steve's palm, changes the topic.
DARREN
Wanna see that new game I got?
STEVE
Sure...
Darren steps over, starts his computer up. While waiting,
Steve sees the digital camera on the dresser, picks it up.
30.
STEVE
I gotta get one of these.
Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late...
DARREN
Let me see that --
On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around
to keep the camera out of Darren's reach.
STEVE
It's Madam Octa.
DARREN
I took it at the show.
STEVE
Liar. Look at the background.
This got taken right on your desk.
Darren's caught. As they just stare at each other.
CUT TO:
MADAM OCTA
In her cage, on the desk. Darren and Steve looking her over.
STEVE
How'd you do it?
DARREN
They were loading a van outside.
I, I just took her.
STEVE
Just like that...
(after a look)
You stole from a vampire you know?
DARREN
Just because he had a coffin
doesn't mean he's really a...
Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the coffin.
STEVE
You were there, weren't you?
(NO ANSWER)
You heard what he said to me? That
I was evil?
31.
DARREN
I didn't believe it.
Steve studies Darren, hopes that's true.
DARREN
I heard what you said to him, too.
That you wanted to be a vampire.
Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa.
STEVE
How do you think he made her do
what he wanted?
Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.
DARREN
I wish I knew how to play it.
STEVE
I think that was just for show. I
think he used something else. Some
kind of mind control.
DARREN
You mean telepathy?
STEVE
I bet anyone with a brain could do
it. Which leaves you out.
Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The
tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.
ANNIE'S VOICE
Can I come in?
Darren goes to the door. Opens it a few inches.
DARREN
I swear to God, Annie...
ANNIE
What? I knocked.
As they talk, Steve opens the cage door. Madam Octa sets her
arms on the edge, pulls herself out.
LEAPS --
Lands on Steve's shoulder. Her fangs, wet with poison, glint
just before she sinks them into Steve's throat. She BITES!
32.
Steve surges upward, his shout dying in his throat. He
stiffens, eyes snapped wide, and then crumples to the floor.
Darren and Annie react as --
Madam Octa scurries off, disappears behind the curtain.
DARREN
(TO ANNIE)
Don't move.
Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in
the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it.
Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood
cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too
quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window!
Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to Steve, turns him
over. Steve's skin is already a deathly pale.
DARREN
Steve...
Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand.
ANNIE
Darren, he's freezing.
DARREN
Get dad. Go.
CUT TO:
Hospital doors BANG OPEN as a gurney bearing Steve is rushed
through. Darren and his Dad follow with a DOCTOR.
DOCTOR
What kind of spider was it?
DARREN
I think some kind of a tarantula.
DOCTOR
Where is it?
DARREN
It got away.
Darren's Dad holds up the camera.
33.
DAD
We have a picture of it.
The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney.
DOCTOR
Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor
Lund. And we need to download a
photo to poison control.
This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in,
surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see
of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out.
PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that
his world has only just started to crash down around him.
CUT TO:
DR. LUND - HOSPITAL CORRIDOR
Tough, no nonsense. Marching along, carrying a print-out,
coming to a stop where Darren sits on a plastic chair. He
sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of Madam Octa.
DR. LUND
How did you make this and why would
you make this?
Darren's Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor.
DR. LUND
Poison control couldn't ID it. In
fact, the department of Entomology
at Harvard couldn't find it in
their data base. So either it's a
new species or it's a fake photo.
DAD
If my son said he took that photo,
then that's the truth.
Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then:
WOMAN'S VOICE
What have you done to him?!
STEVE'S MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled,
cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet.
She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder.
STEVE'S MOM
Did you hurt Stevie?! Did you?!
34.
She shakes Darren hard. Darren's Dad gets between them. She
breaks down, sobbing. Darren's mom tries to soothe her as
she moans about what a bad mother she is.
DR. LUND
Your friend's going to die unless
we find out what's in him.
On Darren. He looks down to where light spills out from
Steve's room. His friend is going to die in there.
MATCH CUT TO:
Darren as he lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. His clock
switches to 2:58 AM. Deciding, Darren gets out of bed.
CUT TO:
Darren's by the credenza where he hid. The coffin is gone.
DARREN
Hello?
CUT TO:
MOVE WITH DARREN who comes up from below and crosses. Stay
with him as he parts the curtains and comes out on the...
ZEITERION STAGE
Where he stops short, sees in the center of the stage --
Crepsley's COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He grips the
lid, starts sliding it back. He looks inside to see --
35.
Madam Octa perched on the side, staring back at him!
Darren stumbles back. The coffin lid SLAMS to the stage as
Darren loses his footing, lands on his butt. And then --
APPLAUSE. One pair of hands create a hollow echo.
Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping.
And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a
hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet. A beat.
CREPSLEY
What have you come for this time?
Darren pulls out a CRUCIFIX, holds it in Crepsley's face.
The vampire takes it, looks it over. It has no effect.
DARREN
Crosses don't hurt you?
CREPSLEY
Why should they?
DARREN
Because... you're evil.
CREPSLEY
Am I? Are vampire bats evil when
they drink the blood of cows?
DARREN
That's different. Bats are animals.
CREPSLEY
So am I. So are you. Our
appetites don't make us evil.
(as Darren ponders...)
Why are you here?
DARREN
Your spider bit my friend Steve.
Crepsley shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix.
DARREN
He's dying.
CREPSLEY
Yes, well, boys who play with
things they do not understand can
hardly complain if --
36.
DARREN
You have to help him!
CREPSLEY
The antidote to her poison is rare.
Expensive. Why should someone as
evil as I am waste it on Steve?
DARREN
I'll pay you back. If it takes 50
years. Whatever it costs.
CREPSLEY
Money doesn't interest me.
DARREN
There's something you want. That's
why you're here waiting for me.
Right?
Crepsley's surprised and pleased by Darren's intuitiveness.
CREPSLEY
The night Steve came below to speak
to me, you were there. Did you
hear what we talked about?
DARREN
He wanted to... become like you.
CREPSLEY
You don't just 'become' a vampire.
The change is too extreme. And if
the shock didn't kill you, your
inexperience would. So you become
one in stages. A half-vampire at
first. With greater strength than
a human, but still able to go out
in sunlight. You learn from a full
vampire. Do you understand?
DARREN
I think so...
CREPSLEY
But your friend has bad blood.
He's no good. There's no telling
what he'll become as he matures.
DARREN
I don't believe that someone can
have bad blood.
37.
CREPSLEY
And yesterday you didn't believe in
vampires. Regardless, I've left
the Cirque. Left my protection. I
need someone to protect me while I
sleep. I need an apprentice.
DARREN
(SUDDENLY REALIZES)
Me?
Crepsley nods.
DARREN
You're crazy. There's no way.
CREPSLEY
Then your friend will die.
The words hang in the air. Crepsley smiles.
CREPSLEY
You hardly have a choice. It's
your destiny.
DARREN
Destiny? That doesn't make sense.
CREPSLEY
Try this then. You're reckless
enough to steal, responsible enough
to come back for a friend. That's
enough for me.
DARREN
Not for me.
CREPSLEY
Yes, well, destiny can't be
explained. It must be lived. Now,
you're wasting my time.
DARREN
There's gotta be another way.
CREPSLEY
There isn't.
DARREN
Please... He's my friend.
38.
CREPSLEY
And he slips away while we argue.
Life or death? Yes or no?
DARREN
You'd never be able to trust me.
If I got a chance for payback I'd
take it.
CREPSLEY
Yes or no?
Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.
Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially
long, but they look thick and sharp.
Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws
blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.
CREPSLEY
You have good blood.
Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of
his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.
Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.
CREPSLEY
Lift your hands.
Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into
all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.
CREPSLEY
Get used to pain. More lies ahead.
He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.
Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.
As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation.
CREPSLEY
The blood flows into your left arm
and out of your right. Do you feel
it? Getting near your heart?
Darren nods, shivers.
CREPSLEY
Almost there.
A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down.
39.
Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his
fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering.
Tries to block out any sympathy he feels.
CREPSLEY
The world will start to slow down.
You'll become a witness of time.
(snaps out of it)
Your friend's time is running out.
He pulls Darren to his feet.
CUT TO:
Tubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored.
40.
Crepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids.
Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye.
CREPSLEY
We're in time. He still has a few
minutes left.
Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks
a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork.
He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a
drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls
murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm.
A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
twitching. Is he dying?
DARREN
What's happening?
CREPSLEY
He was near death. The journey
back is not pleasant. What do you
know about him, this boy with bad
blood?
DARREN
He's my friend.
CREPSLEY
Hmm... Who's his father?
DARREN
Never met him. I don't think Steve
ever did either. Why do you want
to know?
And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on
Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.
STEVE
Darren?
And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing
deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay.
CREPSLEY
Will you come with me now or do you
have things to set in order first?
That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every-
thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking,
Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley.
41.
CREPSLEY
I see...
Darren's almost to the door. Crepsley stays where he is.
CREPSLEY
Run if you want. It won't help.
You're a creature of the night now,
Darren Shan.
Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone. Chuckling,
the vampire tucks Steve's covers up under his chin.
CUT TO:
Darren asleep in his bed. The door opens and his mom enters.
MOM
Darren... Wake up, honey.
Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake.
As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in.
MOM
I just got off the phone. Great
news. Steve's going to be okay.
DARREN
What?
MOM
The hospital says it's a miracle.
Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip
of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS.
Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's
overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back.
MOM
Yeah, it's great news. I know how
you feel.
CUT TO:
42.
Darren walking along, feeling isolated as he moves past the
other students. Everything seems weird, off.
A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then
a COUPLE more coming the other way.
KID
Hey, Shan, you gotta see this.
They duck into the classroom. Darren follows.
SCIENCE LAB
TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor
tank. Steve holds court.
STEVE
.Doctor said it was a miracle.
They say I'm unique --
Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back.
STEVE
Hey, Darren. I've been looking for
you. We got a lot to talk about.
43.
DARREN
Yeah?
STEVE
But first...
Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through
an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren
looks from the mouse to the snake...
Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries
to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy.
STEVE
Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What
happens to us all can happen to any
of us. If you watch, it's by your
own free will. Say farewell...
HEFTS MOUSE
.to Crepsley the mouse.
Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the
terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent.
DARREN
STOP --
Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front.
DARREN
It's cruel.
STEVE
It's nature. Anyhow don't watch.
(TO KIDS)
And don't blink; you might miss it.
Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium.
The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner
away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its
head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself.
ZAP! The snake STRIKES...
And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below
its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible!
The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown
away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning.
The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class.
44.
Darren scoops up the mouse, drops the snake back in. As he
starts out, Steve cuts him off.
STEVE
What happened to the spider?
DARREN
I killed it.
Steve hesitates, processes, looks Darren over.
STEVE
I had a dream. You and Crepsley
were in my hospital room...
DARREN
Tell me about it later.
Darren starts away. Steve grabs him hard, spins him around.
STEVE
I'll tell you now.
Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand
and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the
ground, only his left toe touching.
DARREN
I said later.
Darren lets go, heads off. Steve watches, wonders.
CUT TO:
Darren at the kitchen table doing his math homework. His Mom
makes dinner, chopping vegetables at the sink.
MOM
How was school today?
DARREN
The usual. Sometimes it was
boring, sometimes really boring.
Darren's mom laughs. Then...
46.
MOM
Ouch!
She drops the knife on the cutting board. A thick drop of
BLOOD runs down her finger.
Darren flinches at the sight and in that moment we PUNCH INTO
his eyes. The PUPILS swirl red; the IRISES flatten and
narrow. A dark, ravenous look.
MOM - DARREN'S POV
Holding up her finger. Her skin tone receding back into
gray, the blood pulsing with red vibrancy. Alive. A target.
DARREN
Standing at the blood's seeming siren call. But as he
suddenly moves forward, she turns away.
Darren stops as she wraps her finger in a paper towel. She
looks back at him: misunderstands his hunger for concern.
MOM
It's okay, honey. I just need a
band-aid.
Darren looks at his mom's neck. His eyes zero in on a little
blue VEIN PULSING away. She leaves the room to get a band-
aid. As Darren's horror sinks in...
CUT TO:
Darren looks at his reflection in the MIRROR. Looking for
reassurance. He curls his lip, checks his teeth. They look
normal. He reaches out. Trying to reach himself.
His hand comes to a stop against the glass. His nails CLICK
hard against the surface. He scrapes the nail of his
forefinger along the glass. It leaves a deep scratch.
Darren starts to freak a little. His breath getting ragged.
He tries to get a hold of himself, looks back in the mirror.
DARREN
You're different...
CUT TO:
47.
Darren walks down an aisle, climbs up onto the empty stage.
Dark, but Darren moves calmly, like it was noon.
DARREN
Hello? Hey!
Crepsley appears. Darren turns, sees him. A beat. Crepsley
raises his hands to the gloom around them.
CREPSLEY
The darkness isn't so scary
anymore, is it?
DARREN
I'm starting to think it's me
that's scary.
Crepsley waits to hear more.
DARREN
It's only gonna get worse, isn't
it? There's no way back, is there?
No magic potion to make me human
again?
Crepsley shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands.
DARREN
We made a deal. I won't run away
again.
CREPSLEY
It's neither here nor there, but, I
do feel sorry for you.
Darren waves it off, doesn't want to hear it.
CREPSLEY
Are you ready then? The night is
young. We can make many miles.
DARREN
I can't just -- My family, I can't
let them think I just left them.
Or that something happened to me.
My mother would... She couldn't...
As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look sympathetic.
CREPSLEY
There's only one thing for it.
48.
DARREN
What?
CREPSLEY
We'll have to kill you.
CUT TO:
Annie asleep already. Darren enters, pulls his sister's
blanket up, tucks it under her chin. He whispers:
DARREN
Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can
ever help you, I will.
CUT TO:
49.
Darren enters to find Crepsley sitting at his desk. He holds
a small dark bottle between his fingers (different than the
one he gave to Steve). As Crepsley's about to speak...
DARREN
Shut up.
Off Crepsley's reaction...
DARREN
This is my home and I'm never gonna
see it again, so don't rush me.
Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he
stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look
around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser.
DARREN
Hold onto this for me, okay?
Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return.
Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell.
DARREN
You're sure it will work?
Crepsley opens the window.
CREPSLEY
Your heart will slow down so
drastically they won't find a
pulse. With the fall from the
window, they'll think you're dead.
DARREN
What if I break bones?
CREPSLEY
Even better. They'll mend in a few
days. Vampires don't stay broken
for long and it takes a very long
fall to kill one.
DARREN
And the funeral home? Won't they
embalm me or something?
CREPSLEY
Don't worry. I have ways of making
my thoughts become the thoughts of
others. They'll leave you alone.
50.
Crepsley gestures to the window. Knowing the plan, Darren
climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the
ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him.
DARREN
My dad's allergic to grass. It's
my job to cut the lawn.
CREPSLEY
You have a new job now. Drink.
Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.
DARREN
So this is destiny, huh? Tastes
like crap.
Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.
CREPSLEY
Your breathing is slowing, your
heart as well. Do you feel it?
Darren can't answer. He blinks his eyes 'yes' instead.
CREPSLEY
You may be aware of what's going on
around you. Remember, the grief
that you hear will be a release for
those who express it.
Darren's eyes drift shut. Crepsley lets him go.
CUT TO:
Darren's body on a stainless steel table. The MEDICAL
EXAMINER shakes his head sadly, looks to his ASSISTANT.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
Cause of death is trauma from the
impact of the fall. Poor kid.
ASSISTANT
Are we doing an autopsy?
A NEW ANGLE
Reveals Crepsley watching from around a darkened corner.
CREPSLEY
(WHISPERS)
Not on a child.
Immediately...
MEDICAL EXAMINER
I'm not going to cut open a kid.
Not when I don't have to.
CUT TO:
52.
Darren in his coffin, wearing a suit. Aware as...
Friends and family passing by. The sounds of people crying.
TWO CUTE GIRLS from school lean in.
GIRL ONE
He's still cute.
GIRL TWO
I always had a crush on him.
The Goalie from school soccer is next. He holds a little
SOCCER BALL in his hand. Tucks it into the coffin.
GOALIE
For the next life, Shan. Top right
corner every time.
Annie steps up, gently strokes her brother's cheek. Then
suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad's
chest. He leans in tenderly over his son. Choked up:
DAD
I love you, Darren. You said it
the other night; I didn't say it
back.
CUT TO:
Darren jams a rolled towel along the bottom of a closed door.
DARREN
How's that? Dark enough?
CREPLEY'S VOICE
(on the other side)
Better.
DARREN
It's sunrise.
CREPLEY'S VOICE
I know the time. I know more about
the sunrise than anyone alive.
57.
Crespley sounds irritated. Darren gets mischievous.
DARREN
Maybe I'll wait until noon and then
open every door and curtain in the
place.
A long tense silence as Darren awaits Crepsley's reply.
MOTEL BEDROOM
Crepsley is a shadow among the shadows. He climbs into bed.
CREPSLEY
Yes, sunlight would kill me. My
electrons are different than a
human's. But it would take several
hours of exposure. I'd have plenty
of time to kill you before I closed
the curtains and went back to bed.
Crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head.
MOTEL LIVING ROOM
As Darren considers this...
CUT TO:
DOORWAY - LATER
Darren doing pull-ups, a hand on either side of the top jamb.
DARREN
242... 243... 244...
It's almost effortless. Bored rather than tired, Darren
drops to his feet. (He still wears his burial suit.)
CUT TO:
A TV droning. Darren asleep. Bathed in a golden glow that
flickers out as the sun sets. The bedroom door opens.
Crepsley steps over, looks down at his snoozing assistant.
Crepsley CLAPS his hands together, nearly against Darren's
ear. Crepsley smiles as Darren jolts awake.
CUT TO:
The WAITRESS sets a juicy BURGER down across from Darren.
Crepsley sits across from him.
CREPSLEY
We still need to eat food, too. I
just don't need it tonight.
Darren just sits there. Silently as tears begin to run down
his cheeks. Crepsley is exasperated.
CREPSLEY
Now what?
63.
DARREN
The blood... I wanted it. I
wanted to drink it.
CREPSLEY
Of course you did! You're a
Crepsley catches himself. He is not without some compassion.
CREPSLEY
I'm sorry. It was wrong of me to
blood you. You're too young. But
it's done. Like the entire history
of the world up to this moment.
Darren quietly cries. Crepsley pulls two paper napkins from
the dispenser, hands them to him.
DARREN
Thank you.
Darren turns to face the window as he wipes his eyes, nose.
Then he sees it: parked across and down the street...
A black 1966 Lincoln Continental.
Darren looks back at Crepsley.
CREPSLEY
(RE: HAMBURGER)
Eat. Let's not waste anymore food
tonight.
DARREN
The car...
Crepsley follows the finger as Darren points.
DING DING! The bell over the diner door rings...
CLOSE ON DARREN
As he looks back over his shoulder at the door.
DARREN'S POV
MR. TINY comes through the front door pimpin'. Peter Lorre
on steroids. Scary, done up like a Las Vegas high roller.
TABLE
Darren knows trouble when he sees it. He looks back at
Crepsley, but the vampire is gone! Vanished.
64.
MR. TINY
(STEPPING UP)
Darren Shan, we meet at last.
Darren just looks up at him. The guy is practically leaking
nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to be.
MR. TINY
You're quite a boy. Sacrificed
everything to save a friend.
DARREN
Where'd you hear that?
MR. TINY
A little bat told me.
Mr. Tiny takes a french fry off Darren's plate, eats it.
Darren looks around. Where the hell did Crepsley go at a
time like this? Mr. Tiny knows what he's thinking.
MR. TINY
Oh, he's still here.
DARREN
Who is?
MR. TINY
Crepsley. Trying to stay alive.
It's so quiet around them Darren can hear a clock TICKING.
It's a heart shaped POCKET WATCH Mr. Tiny holds on a chain.
MR. TINY
Would you like to see?
DARREN
See what?
The air seems to buzz as something 'passes'.
MR. TINY
Why the fight of course. Boys like
to watch fights, don't they?
Mr. Tiny hefts his watch. It almost seems to melt into his
palm. As he pulls the winding knob out with a CLICK...
As Darren and Mr. Tiny blink out, disappear from the booth...
CUT TO:
65.
Darren and Mr. Tiny reappear in the booth, but the
restaurant's patrons are slowed to near motionlessness.A
battle royal going on. Crepsley fighting three VAMPANEZE.
All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin.
Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant.
Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows.
Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat.
Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives
the second one back into the third knocking both back.
A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting
to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his
nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat.
As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem
the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne.
CUT TO:
As leg whip 'unflits'. The patrons react to him soaring over
the counter, slamming into the wall --
CUT TO:
The patrons near frozen again. Leg whip sliding ever so
slowly down the wall. Crepsley and Sinewy One & Two FIGHTING
at full speed.
Sinewy One pulls Crepsley's arm up behind his back. Crepsley
HOWLING as we hear the bone BREAK.
Mr. Tiny grabs Darren by the wrist, pulls him toward the
door. Behind them...
Crepsley drives the back of his head into Sinewy One's face
at the same time as Sinewy Two swings in his open palm...
Sinewy One releases Crepsley who disappears as Sinewy Two
slices open Sinewy One's throat.
As Mr. Tiny pulls Darren out the door...
CUT TO:
66.
Crepsley appears. Leg Whip hits the floor. Blood splashes
the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees.
As Leg Whip stands, Crepsley charges, 'shoulders' him halfway
through the wall. Patrons SCREAM, react, scatter.
As Crepsley grabs a knife...
CUT TO:
Darren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind,
through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight.
Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid
swing with the knife in his head.
Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH.
Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin
albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing
veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style.
MURLOUGH
Smell the blood. The lovely blood.
His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
him to move to catch it.
Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
from his side.
Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,
lifts him off the ground.
Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.
Murlough staggers, lets go.
67.
Crepsley takes Darren's hand and they flit, disappearing.
CUT TO:
Darren and Crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing.
Murlough comes out of flit in the center.
WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from
the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough!
He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield.
As Darren and Murlough disappear again...
68.
The pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the
hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street.
A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No
Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he
wipes it, smearing it across his cheek...
PICK-UP DRIVER
(RUSHING OVER)
Hey, man, are you okay?!
He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough
stands, SWATS the driver aside.
The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough
climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away.
CUT TO:
Crepsley climbs down a few steps, closes the door behind him.
Barely any light, but some.
CREPSLEY
Find a blanket. A rug. Cover it.
CUT TO:
Darren drags a CARPET over the root cellar door in the floor.
ROOT CELLAR
It goes black except for a glint in Crepsley's eyes. He
sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out.
69.
DARREN'S VOICE
Are you okay?
CREPSLEY
My arm's broken. But it should be
fine in a day or two.
INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
Sunlight fills the kitchen. Darren sits, exhausted.
DARREN
Who were they? Vampires?
CREPSLEY
No. The one with the watch was Mr.
Tiny. Very dangerous.
DARREN
How dangerous can a man named Mr.
Tiny be?
CREPSLEY
Who said he was a man?
DARREN
Then what is he?
CREPSLEY
Mr. Tiny can't be explained. He
needs to be experienced.
DARREN
(FRUSTRATED)
And the purple guy. What was he?
CREPSLEY
A vampaneze.
DARREN
Yeah? Keep talking.
CREPSLEY
Long ago humans were looked upon as
animals by some vampires. Cattle
to be slaughtered. Laws were
passed to forbid needless killing.
It made it easier to pass unnoticed
among humans if we didn't murder
them. Most vampires obeyed...
DARREN
But some didn't?
70.
CREPSLEY
Seventy vampires broke away,
declared themselves a separate
race. The Vampaneze. Over time
their appearance changed, their
numbers grew. They believe it's
wrong to feed from a human without
killing it.
DARREN
What? That's crazy.
CREPSLEY
They believe those of us who feed
in small amounts live like leeches.
In shame. It led to war.
Crepsley touches the scar on his face, remembers.
CREPSLEY
The last one nearly destroyed us
all. There's been a truce for many
years now.
(A BEAT)
Will you be alright while I sleep?
Darren looks around at the dilapidated crap heap he's in. As
he tries to hold his heart together...
DARREN
Oh yeah... This is so much better
than where I used to be...
Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what's best
for both of them..
CREPSLEY
What do you think of rejoining the
Cirque du Freak? Until you get on
your vampire feet so to speak.
DARREN
Half vampire.
CREPSLEY
Yes, yes. Three-eighths if you
want. What do you think?
As Darren thinks...
CUT TO:
71.
An odd setting, but it works well. Stripped, ragged, weird.
Feels like a rave. The lighting dramatic, the concrete walls
ominous. PATRONS take their seat around a stage. A buzz in
the air.
DEBBIE & SAM
About the same age as Darren and Evra, they're here for the
show. Debbie is self-assured. Sam is sarcastic to cover his
insecurities. Right now it's hard to find a seat.
And here are Darren and Evra. Evra looking cool in his green
sharkskin, Darren still wearing his burial suit.
EVRA
Can we help you find a seat?
DEBBIE
Are there any left?
EVRA
Only the best seats in the house.
He leads them a few steps over toward a column.
DEBBIE
You guys are with the Cirque?
Darren nods. Sam's a little sarcastic and skeptical.
SAM
Cirque is French, right? Are you
guys French?
EVRA
Oui. Vous etes observateur. Nous
sommes les serpents frangais.
That slows Sam a beat. Evra points out a small platform
eight feet up the column. You have to climb a natural re-bar
ladder to get there. Sam looks dubious, but Debbie smiles.
DEBBIE
Cool... I'm Debbie, this is Sam.
EVRA
Evra Von.
She looks at Darren, waiting.
75.
DARREN
Oh, I'm Darren.
DEBBIE
Is the show great? Say yes. We
had to sneak out to see it.
DARREN
I snuck out to see it once, too.
And I'm still here.
An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious?
SAM
Good one, Darren. Hey. Debbie and
Darren. Like Bonnie and Clyde.
And their friend Evra Von what?
That breaks the moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar.
Sam looks Darren over a beat, picks a thread off his lapel.
SAM
Dude, it looks like the kind of
suit you'd wear to a funeral.
DARREN
You have no idea...
Evra smiles, sticks out his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra
sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries to smile, then starts
up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra laugh...
CUT TO:
Mr. Tall under a spotlight. Back in his red hat and gloves.
MR. TALL
Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
are an ancient circus. Bringing
the remarkable to generations...
BACK ROW
Darren and Evra watch from the back, whisper to each other.
DARREN
How long have you known Mr. Tall?
EVRA
Five years.
76.
DARREN
How do you meet someone like him?
EVRA
I was raised in a circus, but not a
nice one like this. The owner used
to beat me and keep me in a glass
cage. I felt like a useless freak.
One night I looked out of my cage
and saw Mr. Tall just standing
there. He watched me until the
owner came over and asked if he
could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed
him by the throat and strangled him
to death. Then he opened the cage
and said, "Let's go, Evra." He
named me that. I added the Von.
I've been with him ever since.
Darren looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.
CREPSLEY'S VOICE
Darren...
Darren turns. Crepsley's back there in the shadows.
CREPSLEY
How do you feel about show
business?
CUT TO:
The audience reacts as Crepsley 'appears' on the empty stage.
CREPSLEY
To be poisoned by a spider may be
my fate.
It's Darren's cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit,
he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length.
DEBBIE & SAM
As she realizes it's Darren. Cool.
STAGE
Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave. As he smiles...
CREPSLEY
Look glum... Miserable...
77.
Darren loses the grin. Crepsley opens the cage. Madam Octa
steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays.
Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she
attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to
Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances
across to the music, spinning a web as she goes.
Darren looks out, sees how much Debbie enjoys it.
CUT TO:
Where the show was the night before. Light streams down from
gaps in the decrepit roof. No sight of Debbie and Sam as
Darren and Evra make their way in.- They pause at a CREAKING
coming from somewhere overhead. As they move...
CUT TO:
Darren and Evra come off a rickety staircase, pass through a
half-rotted door. There are holes in the roof overhead and
huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through.
They see Sam, his back to them, staring out a smashed window.
EVRA
Let's scare the crap out of him...
They begin to creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam. But
as they get close, a SHAPE drops down behind them!
87.
SHAPE
ARRRGGGH!
Darren and Evra are the ones who jump. The shape is Debbie!
She almost falls over laughing. So does Sam.
DEBBIE
You should see the look on your
faces.
But Evra and Darren are not laughing.
EVRA
What're you doing here?
DEBBIE
We could ask you the same thing.
We come here all the time. My
grandfather used to work here.
DARREN
Must've been a long time ago.
DEBBIE
He says now it's like one of those
bombed out World War II cathedrals.
Empty of what is used to be.
An odd little moment till Sam breaks it.
SAM
Hey, we loved the show, man. It
was off the hook.
EVRA
(messing with him)
Off the hook, huh? I'll tell all
the freaks you said so.
SAM
Are you guys on your own? Just
traveling. No parents or nothing?
DARREN
No. No parents.
He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on.
SAM
School?
EVRA
No school either.
88.
SAM
You're the luckiest guys on earth.
Wanna switch places?
DARREN
You have to be different to be
here.
DEBBIE
Different how?
Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's
mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night.
EVRA
Everyone has a place they belong.
The Cirque du Freak is ours.
DEBBIE
I think your skin is beautiful.
That wins Evra over.
DEBBIE
Can I touch it?
Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it.
DEBBIE
Wow. Has it always been this way?
DARREN
He's a snake-boy.
DEBBIE
You shouldn't call him names
because he looks different.
EVRA
It's okay. I am a snake boy.
SAM
You could say you're
dermatologically challenged.
They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren.
DEBBIE
What about you, Darren? How are
you different?
89.
DARREN
I get scared easy.
Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped.
DARREN
How'd you get up there anyhow?
DEBBIE
You mean, how did a girl get up
there?
CUT TO:
Darren walks along, flashlight in hand. Going somewhere. He
suddenly stops, listens, not sure if he heard something. A
following FOOTSTEP?
MOVE WITH Darren as he continues. As he passes through a
doorway, he ducks around the corner. Waits a few beats.
Then he leaps out to see who's following. No one's there.
Shaking his head, he continues on.
CUT TO:
93.
Darren knocks on a door, waits a beat before it opens and
Crepsley emerges from his sleeping place.
CREPSLEY
Good morning, Darren.
DARREN
What's good about it?
Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees.
CUT TO:
People in their seats or taking them. Darren is back in his
role as usher. He seats two people, wipes at the sweat
beading on his forehead. He's getting sicker.
He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the
way. She smiles, waves. Darren forces a smile,, waves back.
Looking for more patrons, Darren nearly walks into... A
FIGURE. A hat pulled down obscures his face.
VOICE
An usher in the house of usher.
And I can't seem to find a seat.
Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle.
DARREN
This way.
Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure
looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny.
MR. TINY
Join me.
DARREN
I don't think so.
As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his
wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him.
96.
MR. TINY
It's time we had a few moments.
Folks involved in epic struggles
should get to know each other.
Darren doesn't answer.
MR. TINY
Has Crepsley told you about me?
Explained me?
DARREN
He said you can't be explained.
You need to be experienced.
MR. TINY
He gives me too much credit.
DEBBIE
Hey, Darren.
Darren looks up to see Debbie and Sam. Oh no...
DEBBIE
We're gonna sit on this side.
SAM
Cuz we miss you so much.
She digs Sam with her elbow. They sit just a row in front.
MR. TINY
(WHISPERS)
Choosing sides can only lead to
trouble. Never, ever choose sides
unless it's your own.
DARREN
You've chosen the vampaneze.
Mr. Tiny laughs, slaps his knee even.
MR. TINY
Is that really what you think? A
smart boy like you?
And the lights drop. A trumpet blasts and all is silent.
ON THE STAGE
The little people wheel out a CAGE. There's a gurgled GROWL.
The little people retreat. Several audience members lean in,
then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the cage.
97.
A white spot shines down on Mr. Tall.
MR. TALL
Ladies and Gentlemen...
DARREN & MR. TINY
MR. TINY
.subjugators and saps...
MR. TALL
Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We
are an ancient circus...
As Mr. Tall drones on...
MR. TINY
Oh, his speeches are impossible.
Mr. Tiny opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into
view from his palm. Time begins to speed up around them.
Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off
the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small
movements become rattles and shakes.
Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.
MR. TINY
I'm not so complicated, Darren.
During war there are those who
profit. A war between vampires and
vampaneze would have terrible
consequences. Therefore...
DARREN
Terrible profits.
MR. TINY
Excellent. I am a profiteer. I
exact fees and gains. I'm simple.
On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra 'keystones' through his
performance with his snake.
MR. TINY
Did Crepsley tell you of the
prophesy?
DARREN
What prophesy?
98.
MR. TINY
They say the final battle between
vampires and vampaneze will be
decided by a child. That's why the
vampires won't blood children. To
avoid the end of the world.
As these words are pondered by Darren...
MR. TINY
I think I underestimated you. I
think you could be wonderful.
DARREN
I think you're a creep. I think
you suck.
MR. TINY
Too bad.
Mr. Tiny closes his hand around the watch. Time returns to
normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed.
As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at Darren.
DEBBIE
He was great!
As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darren's other
side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a scarf. Murlough!
MURLOUGH
(low; re: Debbie)
Is it Dar-wren's girlfriend?
DARREN
Forget about her --
Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low:
MURLOUGH
She has plenty of lovely blood
inside. Inside, outside, hmmm?
Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close, HISSES in his
ear, flashing those filthy teeth.
MURLOUGH
I don't care about humans. I don't
care about you. But the vampire -
Larten Crepsley - him I care about.
(ALMOST SHY)
Murlough is a vampire killer.
99.
On stage: the spotlight hits Crepsley.
DARREN
You guys are in trouble. There's
more than one vampire now. Gavner
Purl is here.
Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it.
MURLOUGH
Have you seen Purl Gavner's face?
Young Murlough sliced it for him.
MR. TINY
Darren, you're a liar. He's a
thousand miles gone by now. And
master Crepsley is right there.
As he points at Crepsley...
CREPSLEY
Holding Madam Octa's cage. Aware something's 'in the air'.
MURLOUGH
Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears.
DARREN
Crepsley! Look out!
The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa.
Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's
hand around Darren's wrist.
STAGE
As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley.
Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks
Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his
back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show.
Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG
KNIFE in either hand.
Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE
'switches' to life in his hand...
DARREN & MR. TINY
As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back
of the boy's neck. That holds him.
100.
STAGE
CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives
pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt.
Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as
it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect.
From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It
catches Murlough hard across the chops.
OFF STAGE
Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do.
STAGE
Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in
Murlough's left hand with the one in his right.
Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade
dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.
Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over
heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall.
DARREN
Concentrating. Trying to flit.
STAGE
Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus
style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so
brutish after all. He matches the move --
Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley
reacts, frozen in shock.
DARREN & MR. TINY
The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of
the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife
to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.
And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.
DARREN (FLIT WORLD)
Speeding down to the stage. The dagger descends in slo-
motion, but it's only a centimeter or two from it's target.
101.
STAGE
Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough's back, knocks him off
target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left.
Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,
Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears.
ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well.
MR. TINY
Sighs. This is not how it's supposed to go. Sam and Debbie
leave their seats, head for the stage.
CUT TO:
Murlough with Darren in tow, looking high and low for
Crepsley. Moving past the barely moving Mr. Tall and Evra.
CREPSLEY (FLIT WORLD)
His back to a wall. Trying to hold it together. Frozen
PATRONS facing the exit beyond. As he'loses his flit power,
the patrons suddenly resume real speed for the exits.
CUT TO:
The old power plant. Pipes and catwalks. Murlough and
Darren here. A chain hangs from the ceiling. Murlough lifts
Darren, wraps it around his ankle. Hangs Darren upside down!
MURLOUGH
CREPSLEY!
CUT TO:
CREPSLEY
Reacting to Murlough's voice.
CUT TO:
BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
Murlough twists Darren's arm. Darren SCREAMS out in pain.
CUT TO:
102.
EVRA
Reacting as Debbie and Sam arrive. They move toward it.
CUT TO:
CREPSLEY
Listening as the scream fades off. Clutching his stomach,
Crepsley moves.
CUT TO:
BOILER ROOM - FACTORY
Murlough pulls Darren a little higher. They're face-to-face,
though Darren is upsidedown.
MURLOUGH
Crepsley will come for his
assistant.
DARREN
He doesn't care about me.
MURLOUGH
Murlough has an assistant, too. A
smart one, smarter than you.
As Murlough says this, Darren looks past as stepping up,
grinning, is Murlough's assistant.
DARREN
Steve?
Steve! Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE
SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets closer.
STEVE
Mr. Tiny made my dream come true.
Only better. I'm half vampaneze
instead of a stupid half vampire.
Mr. Tiny says I have a destiny. He
says he's gonna make sure of it.
DARREN
Is that who you talked to? Was
that the internet guy? Mr. Tiny?
STEVE
(LAUGHS)
Pretty funny, huh? He introduced
himself after you left town.
(MORE)
103.
STEVE (CONT'D)
But, I think I've known him a long
time in my head. In my bad, bad
blood.
Chilling. Maybe Steve is evil. He leans in even closer.
STEVE
He gave me back the dream you
stole.
Murlough motions Steve quiet, slaps a hand over Darren's
mouth. Listens. Smiles. Whispers.
MURLOUGH
Crepsley comes.
CUT TO:
Crepsley moving forward. Hurting. He slows, stops. As he
looks back over his shoulder. Something's behind him.
EVRA, DEBBIE & SAM
Freeze as Crepsley looks back in the direction from which
they follow. From their POV, Crepsley suddenly disappears.
SAM
Where'd he go?
They jump as Crepsley appears right in front of them.
CREPSLEY
Evra... Get them out of here.
EVRA
BUT --
Evra knows it's useless. As he nods, Crepsley turns and
strides back toward where he had been.
Sam and Debbie exchange a look. What the Hell?
EVRA
You guys better go back.
SAM
What are you gonna do?
EVRA
Darren's my friend.
104.
DEBBIE
Ours too.
Sam's not so sure, but he nods in agreement.
CUT TO:
Darren swings back and forth in long strokes like a pendulum,
a rag stuffed in his mouth to silence him.
DARREN'S POV
Sweeping the room. Wait! It fixes on a doorway. There's
Crepsley. Looking about, everywhere but at Darren.
BOILER ROOM
Crepsley speaks to 'the room'.
CREPSLEY
I can smell it. Why does it hide?
(STEPPING UP)
The vampire is here.
WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands ten feet in front
of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each other.
MURLOUGH
The vampire will die.
STEVE'S VOICE
(FROM ABOVE)
Let's get readyyyyy to rumble!
Crepsley looks up, reacts.
CREPSLEY
Even the creatures of the night
watch too much TV.
Darren swings past through the middle of it all.
Murlough charges.
Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher.
He leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks.
Murlough follows. They use the room steel as monkey bars as
they climb, clash. Violent, quick attacks. Crepsley gaining
a position, abandoning it as Murlough SLAMS in.
105.
DARREN
Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He
reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold,
lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain.
EVRA
Sam, unhook his legs.
As Sam struggles, Debbie pulls the rag from Darren's mouth.
DARREN
Are you guys nuts? Get outta here!
EVRA
It's against our code.
Suddenly unhooked, Darren hits the ground. He looks up at
Evra who grins down at him.
EVRA
Never leave a freak behind.
CUT TO:
CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives. Crepsley jumps
to the space he wants to defend, draws his own. Murlough
counters. Two very serious predators'-at work. The animal
kingdom at its killing best.
A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects
one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal
housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's
knife finds its way into Murlough's body. It enrages him,
but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment.
He's now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he
inadvertently backs his way into a corner.
But as quarters close in, Murlough's rage works to his
advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his lowered shoulder
sending Crepsley through the air and into...
And through a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still
raging, Murlough nearly falls through himself. Instead, he
slips, drops about twenty feet down inside the building!
CUT TO:
106.
As Evra pulls Darren along. Debbie and Sam riding shotgun.
EVRA
Come on!
DARREN
Evra. I think I'm dying.
He looks horrible.
DEBBIE
Let's carry him if we have to.
Evra and Sam support him on either side. They continue,
start across part of a darkened backstage area.
A dark rectangular shape looms ahead. We hear a GUTTURAL
GROWL, sees eyes glow in the gloom. They freeze.
EVRA
It's okay. It's the wolfman. He's
in his cage.
They move forward again, the cage becomes visible. But
another SHAPE beside it. Steve. He sets his hand on the
cage's heavy latch. He's going to open it.
EVRA
No don't!
STEVE
Ooops...
Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn't expect the force the
wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It's out.
Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying.
Sam can't hold Darren up by himself. He doesn't even see the
Wolfman leap over. As Darren sinks to the floor...
The wolfman tears into Sam...
107.
DEBBIE
Reacts in horror.
STEVE
He's more surprised than shocked. Until the wolfman looks
his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the
dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie.
She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman
HOWLS, then follows.
Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and
regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam.
Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His eyes flicker to
Darren's. He tries to say something, but can't.
DARREN
Oh Sam. Oh no...
Darren crawls over, takes Sam's bloody hand.
SAM
Go save Debbie, Darren...
Sam manages the smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut...
SAM
I think she loves you...
From above, we hear Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam's
blood, knows what he has to do. Leave his humanity behind
and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam's blood.
DARREN
Forgive me, Sam, but I need
strength. I need blood.
As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist...
DARREN
We're going to save her together.
CUT TO:
Debbie backing into a corner. The wolfman almost on her...
108.
Murlough arrives! Pure animal action as he tears into
wolfie, sends him retreating, licking his wounds into the
darkness. Murlough heaves for breath, pretty beat up
himself. And here comes Steve. Cautiously.
STEVE
Is Crepsley dead?
MURLOUGH
Who knows? Young Murlough lives,
but he's hurt.
STEVE
What can I do?
MURLOUGH
What can Dar-wren's girlfriend do?
We need to get the blood inside
outside. Don't we?
Then we hear it: a blood-curdling scream filters up. It's:
DARREN! - BACKSTAGE AREA
He's drunk Sam's blood. He rises. His sickness wicking off
him. Strength descending. Empowered. Furious. He screams
again, the sound taking shape into words.
DARREN
FORGIVE ME!!!
FACTORY STAGE SPACE
The audience who haven't left react as the chilling sound
reaches them.
BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY
Fully 1/2 vampire powered, he takes the stairs two at a time.
UPPER FLOOR
Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives.
DARREN
Let her go.
STEVE
Stop being a big shot. This isn't
like stopping some fight at school.
DARREN
Shut up, Steve.
109.
Murlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks.
Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over.
Knocked in a heap.
Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going
to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
pretty powerful himself.
Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings
his fist in a vicious arc.
Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right
through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
Murlough's getting tired of Darren.
MURLOUGH
You need to stand still so you can
die.
But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.
He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.
Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall
smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.
FACTORY SPACE
The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They
react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage.
UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY
Crepsley brings up his knife.
Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand.
With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him
hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We
can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.
But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He
drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!
Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at
Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,
falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking
Crepsley with him.
110.
FACTORY SPACE
SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in
mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the
center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead.
As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them.
UPPER FLOOR
But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie,
pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.
STEVE
Stay back! Or I'll throw her off!
I mean it!
It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.
She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.
Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.
But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.
Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she
deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.
Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:
rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping
station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale.
DARREN
It's over, Steve.
STEVE
Is it?
Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling
but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will
be their last. They separate, try to gain position.
STEVE
You wanna hear something funny?
After your funeral, I went to see
your parents.
They continue circling.
STEVE
And they were fine. They acted
like they barely remembered you.
DARREN
Liar.
Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the
head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling.
STEVE
(SMILES)
And your sister. She was moving
into your room. They had a yard
sale. I bought some of your stuff.
Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly:
DARREN
Did you steal money from my mom's
purse?
STEVE
What?
DARREN
Did you?
Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.
STEVE
Why do you ask? Is knowing that
gonna help you rest in peace?
DARREN
No. It's just practically the last
thing that ever happened between me
and my dad was I was arguing with
him.
STEVE
(FLIP)
Least you had a dad to argue with.
A fury building in Darren.
DARREN
I was telling him he was wrong
about you. That's the last time we
had together. Fighting about you.
STEVE
Hate to tell ya. Your dad was
right. How do you think we got the
money for the dumb tickets? I took
it. Just like I'm gonna take you.
Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs
on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,
no matter how many times Steve hits him.
112.
WHAM! Darren lets Steve have it.
DARREN
I miss him.
WHAM!
DARREN
Do you understand?
WHAM!
DARREN
I miss him so much.
WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.
But just as he pitches off the end rafter...
Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he
hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will
fall into the spikes below.
Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.
CREPSLEY
Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you
won't have to do it later.
Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.
DARREN
(SOFTLY; SADLY)
No. He used to be my friend.
Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety.
DARREN
Start running. Don't ever stop.
Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren
starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.
STEVE
Next time...
And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.
Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.
DEBBIE
Sam?
Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it.
113.
She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess.
DARREN
Are you gonna be okay?
CREPSLEY
I just need to catch my breath.
For a few days. Maybe a week.
DARREN
You think I made a mistake, don't
you?
CREPSLEY
No. I think that you proved
yourself human after all.
Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.
DARREN
Half human. What now?
CREPSLEY
What do you mean?
DARREN
There's a war on, isn't there?
Crepsley shrugs.
DARREN
This world is crossed by fences.
You have to decide which side you
stand on.
CREPSLEY
Yes, yes. Black and white fences
crossing very gray fields.
DARREN
It's not gray. I've met the bad
guys. They need to be stopped.
CREPSLEY
I'm not sure it's my fight.
DARREN
But you said it. There's no in
between. And the power of being
alone is never going to be greater
than the weakness. It's our fight.
CUT TO:
114.
