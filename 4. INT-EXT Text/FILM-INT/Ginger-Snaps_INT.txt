Gyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, BRIGITTE
FITZGERALD (15) straddles GINGER FITZGERALD (also 15 and in
underwear) on one of the twin single beds. Both girls have
cigarettes lolling on their lower lips. Both girls have
pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair. Brigitte
has blue nail polish on. Ginger has breasts.
GINGER
Brigitte. Quit dickin' around.
Jus' do it.
Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton
ball in rubbing alcohol.
Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her
own shirt up to expose her navel.
Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her
eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing.

BRIGITTE (V/O)
Ginger's ten months older than
me. we're seriously tight. Share
everything. Everything.
Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the
door. An attached full bath. The floors are thick with
paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of UFO's
and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with
Courtney Love has a place of honor. There's an old Polaroid
of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding
Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger is the wolf.
Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle. It glints. she
levels it at Ginger's navel, her hand shaking.
BR IG ITTE
Ready?
GINGER
(without looking up)
Uh-huh.
BRIGITTE
.I can't.
Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic.
Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the needle up again.
Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure. The needle
pierces Ginger's skin. Her stomach muscles flinch.
GINGER
OUCH!
BRIGITTE
You said it wouldn't hurt!
GINGER
Jus' hurry up!
The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin.
BRIGITTE
Uh-oh .
Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood wells up around it.
BRIGITTE
Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man.
There's blood...
Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle
half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up.
3
BRIGITTE
snot funny, Ginger!
Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug
from her end. The skin tugs with it, resisting.
BRIGITTE
Ali, gawd, gross.
Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves.
GINGER
I got it, I got it.
Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress.
GINGER
It's goin', it's goin'- gimme
the ring
Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but
knocks it to the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger
yanks the needle.
GINGER
Bee?! C'mon!
Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets
the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly
through.
BRIGITTE
Oh, groo-oo-o-ss!
The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to
close it. Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed. Brigitte
is taking deep, gulping breaths.
GINGER
Bee? Feeb. Y'okay?
BRIGITTE
Yeah. I think so.
GINGER
(TEASING)
Yeah, I think not.
BRIGITTE
If you din't say it hurt, I'd a
been fine!
Ginger beams at her new piercing.

GINGER
Pretty cool, unh?
The flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising. Brigitte
grins too.
BRIGITTE
very cool.
GINGER
Now I'll do you.
Brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
We do everything together. But,
at fifteen? A chick can change.
Ya know?
[3A! You got no idea.
The Fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art
class, just finishing the slide show from the credit
sequence. An empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto
the collapsible screen at the front of the room.
The homely ART TEACHER looks very concerned as she hits the
lights. The other STUDENTS -- all about fifteen, middle-class
and raging conformists -- sit in stunned silence. As Brigitte
and Ginger return to their side-by-side seats,
6
BRIGITTE (V/O)
We were always considered
freaks. For as long as I can
remember, there was Us. And
there was Them. Like from
kindergarten.
ART TEACHER
Very -um. Class? Comments?
The students trade constipated looks.
ART TEACHER
Brigitte. What does it mean for
you?
Brigitte shrugs and squirms.
GINGER
Means there's more to life than
-- well, li.fe.
The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank
faces. Brigitte shakes her head.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Attempts at communication wore
futile.
JASON McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks
Ginger over appraisingly. Ginger ignores him.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Some of Them did seem to wanna
reach Ginger?
Brigitte glances from Ginger's breasts to her own flat chest.
Brigitte takes a deep breath.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
But nobody wanned to reach me.
The bell goes.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
(a tad defensive)
Like I cared.
7
TEENS clog the halls. Judging by the herd, Bailey High is not
big on individual identity, or at least its outward
expression.
Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking
out like sore thumbs. Ginger holds her forehead.
GINGER
Gawd, People! They hurt my
brain!
BRIGITTE
They didn't even get it.
GINGER
They're retards.
BRIGITTE
They're cretins.
GINGER
They're bone-heads.
BRIGITTE
't'hey' re somnambulists.
GINGER
They're leems.
BRIGITTE
They're the goddamn walkin'-/
The girls stop before their locker. A folded up piece of
loose leaf has been crushed into it, its end sticking out.
BR I G ITTE
(UNIMPRESSED)
Another one?
Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper. There's a big
fat joint inside, and a note that says: GINGER, CALL 555-
4636.
Ginger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and
tosses it at a near-by trash can. She misses.
The girls head down the hall..
BRIGITTE
Somebody leaves you all. these
jays an, yer not even curious to
call?
8
Ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself.
GINGER
No pe .
A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great
resentment and jams it into the trash.
Brigitte and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry-
humping, GIRLS applying make-up to one another, and BOYS
snapping each other with their sports cups.
Jason and his fellow jock-pals TIM, FRANK, and JEREMY are
scoping babes.
Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan
swells from the guys.
JASON
See? She's weird, but hot.
TIM
Anybody poled Fitzy yet?
Brigitte gives them a disgusted look.
TIM
Not that one. The cute one.
Brigitte's face falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The
boys try flirty smiles.
GINGER
(to Brigitte)
Sad. Must be hard to think with
yer brains slappin' around yer
thighs like that all day.
Brigitte laughs. Ginger pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
We didn't do guys. Guys were too
gross. Everyone at Bailey High
was just too incredibly gross.
Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter,
9
The Fitzgeralds stop dead. They take in a menagerie of 90210-
wanna-be GIRLS changing for gym class. The background chat is
all sex and mascara.
There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her TRINA
CLONES. The Trinas slide into a-size-too-small shorts while
parading hefty chests. The Trina acts like she owns the
goddamn planet.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
The only thing worse than most
teenage boys are most teenage
girls. Trinas are the limit.
Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully.
GINGER
I feel sick.
BRIGITTE
Me too.
GINGER
No, J. mean really.
Gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes. Other girls
glance at her navel piercing with disgust..
Brigitte is very self-conscious: she steps almost inside the
locker, hiding behind the door while she changes into the
revolting school gym outfit. She eyes the buxom bubble heads
with contempt, as
BRI.GITTE (V/O)
There was really only one Trina,
but they were all the same.
Trina finds the Fitzgeralds' open locker door a nuisance.
She pushes it out of her way, hard enough to whack Brigitte
in the head on the other side.
TRINA
(FAKELY)
Ooops. Sorry.
Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look. Brigitte tries to rub
her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her chest.
Trina and her posse cackle as they prance out, their butt
cheeks waggling. The sisters continue changing.

GINGER
(to Brigitte)
Y' okay's
BRIGITTE
I HATE her. Like to feed her
ground glass with tacks for
desert. Then make her puke it
back up and swallow it again
until she's like shredded to a
bazillion pieces from the inside
out...
Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double.
BRIGITTE,
what's the matter?
GINGER
I got gas...Maybe I'll try an,
cut one right in her face out
there.
They slap hands, laughing. They look down at their gym
outfits, which are SO unflattering. Brigitte and Ginger
exchange identical looks of agony.
Brigitte sits in her bloodied uniform, chewing her nails.
NURSE FERRY - a Mrs. Doubtfi.re-type who chirps more than
speaks - is examining Ginger.
FERRY
The fainting' s worrisome
you don't diet do you dear?
GINGER
No.
FERRY
Hm. Anemia's very common at your
age. Eat more red meat, try an
iron vitamin supplement. If it
happens again, straight to a
proper doctor, all righty?
Brigitte looks relieved.
FERRY
Now as for 'the headache, cramps,
lower back pain .I'm guessing
your period is due.
GINGER
I haven't got a, um, period.
FERRY
Never? Flow old are you?
GINGER
Fifteen. our mother says we're
late bloomers.
1 4
FERRY
Well judging by your troubles,
I'd say you can expect to
blossom any time now!
Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry produces numerous samples of
feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto Ginger.
FERRY
Are you familiar with all these?
Ginger shrugs.
FERRY
Now what suits one girl might
not be comfortable for another.
The proper form of protection is
a personal choice, and may have
a lot to do with your menstrual
flow, which naturally changes
during the time you'll have your
little miracle of nature. It
could start thick and syrupy,
move to a straight-forward basic
bright red bleeding and then
perhaps a deep brownish to
blackish slime, signaling the
end of the flow. Twenty-eight
days later or there abouts,
it'll start all over again and
continue every month until
menopause, in about thirty
years' time.
Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad
advertisement for every month.
FERRY (CON'T)
Here's a little calendar to keep
track, count from the day it
starts twenty-eight days.
That'll be your next time. You
have any questions, come see me
again.
(to Brigitte)
You too sweetheart, be your turn
shortly, I expect.
Brigitte Looks horrified.

The Fitzgerald family are having their evening meal. Their
parents, HENRY (see Men's Section, Seers catalogue) and
1 7
PAMELA (see Martha Stewart's Idea of Living), are liberal,
middle class folks in their early forties. Ginger looks
bored. Brigitte eats like a pig.
HENRY
How was school today?
GINGER
Fine.
BRIGITTE (V/U)
The nicest thing I could say
about Henry and Pamela was also
the meanest thing I could say.
PAMELA
Didn't you have a presentation?
How'd it go?
GINGER
Fine.
Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
They were easily satisfied.
A rogue's gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela's
transformation over the years from angry young Ban The Bomb-
types into middle-class mundane.
PAMELA
Made an appointment for you
girls at my gynecologist. Next
Thursday.
Henry studies his plate. Ginger almost imperceptibly shakes
her head at Brigitte. Brigitte nods, understanding.
GINGER
why.
PAMELA
You know why.
GINGER
we're not going to a
gynecologist.
PAMELA
What did I say about that tone
of voice? .You are going to
the gynecologist.
1 8
GINGER
Dad!? She's completely paranoid!
HENRY
I'd rather stay out of this.
GINGER
She's gonna have some fat jerk
get his jollies poking his
fingers up our ./
HENRY
(INTERRUPTING)
I'm actually eating here.
PAMELA
Henry, neither one of them has
had a period yet.
HENRY
Ah. Yes. You've said.
Repeatedly.
As Pamela says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word
1.a Brigitte.
PAMELA
It's very odd that two perfectly
healthy fifteen year olds are
not menstruating. Right?
Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger.
HENRY
Mmmm. steak's really yummy
tonight. This a new sauce?
The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool.
PAMELA
I started at eleven. The problem
must be on your side, Henry.
HENRY
Pamela? This is not my fault. No
one's at fault here.
PAMELA
when did your sister start?
1 9
HENRY
I've told you, I really have no
idea. Oddly enough, we never
discussed it. why don't you call
her and ask her yourself?
PAMELA
I can't call her out of the blue
and ask a thing like that.
Besides, it's dinner time.
They'll be eating.
HENRY
A--ha!
PAMELA
Well I've been checking panties
for four years now
GINGER & BRIGITTE/HENRY
Mo-othe-er!!! /For chrissakes.
GINGER (CON'T)
You look at our underwear? Fuck!
HENRY
Hey, hey - I don't want to hear
that word in my house. You will
do as your mother says and I
will change the subject. Anybody
going to tell me what happened
to my fence?
From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off
picket stained bloody from Ginger's impaling.
Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see its
masticated contents. Ginger cracks up laughing. Henry and
Pamela sigh.
Norman the terrier barks OFF-SCREEN - constantl
Brigitte grimaces at the cartoon-style diagrams of How To
Insert A Tampon. She carefully unwraps one and sets it in a
glass of water. She times its expansion on her watch.
BRIGITTE
Why din't you jus' tell her
you're going to get it?
20
Ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker. she
sniffs its contents.
GINGER
Can't take her 'attention'. She
grosses me out. Can't believe
she's our mother.
Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid
camera at arms' length from her face.
BRIGITTE
Yeah, but now we have to see
this doctor. You can jus' say
you got it, but I'm screwed.
FLASH! The Polaroid spits out the front. Brigitte sticks
another tampon in her free nostril, and one in each ear as,
GINGER
Did I get you out of Home Ec?
Did I get you out of ballet
classes? So I'll get you out of
this, right?
BR IG ITTE
You better, gawd the idea
FLASH! Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon
sticking out of every visible orifice.
Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and
sticks it in her mouth.
GINGER
I said I will, I will. This
jay's fine. Let us smoke,
sister.
Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She double-
takes Brigitte' s tampon face.
GINGER
WHAT are you doing?
BRIGITTE
(sticking tampons
under her upper lip)
Look - a walrus.
GINGER
Hardee-har. Har.
21
Ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window
open.
EXT A NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT
Norman the terrier's incessant barking goes on in the
distance. The moon is full tonight.
A plastic child's playhouse sits in their next door
neighbors' back yard. A cloud of blue smoke emanates from its
doors and windows. There is an occasional FLASH! from within,
and the whir of the Polaroid's motor.
In the moonlight, the joint's cherry burns hell-fire red. A
couple of Polaroid buddy-shots sit at their feet. Brigitte
tokes and passes the jay to Ginger..
BRIGITTE
How'l1 you know when you finally
get it any ways?
GINGER
Prob'ly feel like peein' your
pants.
BRIGITTE
Disgusting.
GINGER
Well I'm not too excited.
BRIGITTE,
(checking her watch)
We're missing Unsolved
Mysteries.
GINGER
Wish I was an unsolved mystery.
Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned.
GINGER
Hey. You smell somethin' gross?
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 22
Brigitte scrambles through the window and helps Ginger
through after her. They're bloody, sweaty and tearful. They
slump shaking, side by side on Ginger's bed, catching their
breath.
Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down
Ginger's arms. Ginger's shirt is soaking with growing red
stains.
BRIGITTE
Ginger, shit!
Ginger looks at herself. Ginger starts to cry.
GINGER
The fuck was that, Bee?
Brigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first
aid items: gauze, tape, band-aids, iodine. She snags a
washcloth and wets it at the tap.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I couldn't remember Ginger
crying, ever.
Brigitte flies out to,
where Ginger is painfully pealing off her shirt, shaking and
sobbing.
Brigitte offers Ginger the wet cloth, but Ginger's helpless.
27
BRIGITTE
Ginger, sshhh, don't, 'kay.
Don't cry.
Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger's arms with it,
wiping off the blood. Ginger flinches.
The damage is gradually revealed: massive claw marks, deep
scratches, and puncture wounds - BITE MARKS. Brigitte's eyes
fill with tears.
BRIGITTE
Okay, this is really bad. You
need a doctor, Ginge', I can't
stop all the -/
GINGER
No! Not tellin' anybody! Bee?!
Nobody. Get in shit for bein'
out, smokin' up - don't tell.
BRIGITTE
What if you get, sick? What if
these bites get infected?
GINGER
Bce!
BRIGITTE
Fine! I won't tell!
Brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on
thick. Oblivious, Ginger fumbles for a smoke. She can't get
the lighter to work.
GINGER
Wanted to kill me! I could tell.
BRIGITTE
(giving into tears)
I know, I know. I was so scared,
I thought you were -/
GINGER
Me too. Don't say it. I know.
Brigitte lights her smoke for her. Ginger takes a drag and
passes it back to Brigitte.
GINGER
Fuck. You okay?
Brigitte resumes her first aid.
28
BR IG ITTE
Yeah, I'm okay.
GINGER
Why!?? Why me?
BRIGITTE
It was crazy, it was like rabid
or somethin' -- Shit, look at the
size of these bites!
GINGER
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
Right? It's okay.
Brigitte doesn't look convinced. Brigitte snaps the port of
an internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube.
She withdraws a sample-size of Jack Daniels.
BRIGITTE
Drink this.
Ginger glugs some down, and passes the last mouthful left to
Brigit.t.e. Brigitte waves it. away, -,o Ginger finishes it al.l.
BRIGITTE
I seen this thing, on bears?
Said bears'd come after like,
chicks on the rag. 'Cause of
the smell.
GINGER
Wasn't my fault!
BRIGITTE
I didn't say that.../
GINGER
Wasn't a f uckin' bear either.
Whatever it was, it wasn't a
bear!
BRIGITTE
I know, I'm not /
GINGER
Do I stink? Can you smell it?
BR IG ITTE
No! Geez, I was jus', whatever.
A heavy silence falls between them. Brigitte keeps working.
29
GINGER
Doesn't feel anythin' like
peeing your pants, by the way.
BRIGITTE
It doesn't?
GINGER
It's gross though. It's really
gross. I better, ya know, deal
with that...
BRIGITTE
Yeah, sure.
Ginger's only half-bandaged up. she staggers to the bathroom
and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a
picture sits ready to be dispensed.
She pulls it free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte's eyes
bug out as she examines it.
The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the
photo under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head.
BRIGITTE (V/0)
It was blurry. It was really
outta focus, so. Ya couldn't
TELL it was really anything.
Ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch. she
climbs painfully onto her bed, and collapses.
GINGER
That booze - straight to my
head, man.
BRIGITTE
You really okay?
Ginger-es eyes are already fluttering shut.
GINGER
You saved me. Love you. Bee.
Brigitte leans in, listening to Ginger breathe.
BRIGITTE
Me too, Ginge'.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 30
Brigitte sits straight up in bed, sweating, with eyes wide.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I woke up later, I thought the
thing was in our room.
Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out
the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we
see it too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye.
BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)
Then I remembered Sam the tree
planter killed it with his
truck, an' we were okay.
.But really, Ginger -? well.
Wasn't.
Ginger, Jason, Tim, Frank and Jeremy sit toking a gagger. The
guys are giddy with lust. Brigitte is huddled in a corner,
attempting invisibility.
Jason hands Ginger the joint, making sure their fingers
touch.
JASON
Hey. I thought your slide show
in art was cool.
OTHER GUYS
Oh yeah/Unh-huh/Very cool.
GINGER
Yeah?
33
Jason and Ginger exchange a coy smile that makes Brigitte
toke really hard on her pass.
Brigitte passes the dube to Tim, who winks at her. Brigitte
sneers and looks at her watch. She makes a pained face at
Ginger, but is ignored.
GINGER
This home-grown?
JASON
Yeah. This guy we know? Learned
hydrophonics in the pen, man.
BRIGITTE
HydroPONics.
JASON
Yeah, whatever.
Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who does not respond. Brigitte
hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a
corner. She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old
shag rug.
There is a codified knock on the vain door. Brigitte jumps.
JASON
speak of the devil. Enter!
The back doors open and Sam (the tree planter) stands in
silhouette, backlit by the day. His battered county truck
waits behind him. He has a pit bull with him - MORELY.
BOYS
Sam the Man! Hey Morely!
Sam and Morely hop in and close the doors. Brigitte is frozen
at the sight of Sam up so close.
TIM
Whoa dude. What happened to
your truck?
SAM
Shit. Had an accident on the
403. It was weird it../
Morely stomps into Brigitte's lap, sniffing her crotch.
34
SAM
(to Brigitte)
Sorry about him, he's an ass
hole. Morely! My girlfriend's,
she won't leave him at home
alone any more. Ya know, dog
killers. Morely, no! Sit!
Brigitte's mouth is hanging open. Morely slobbers all over
her hands.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I know, I look like an asshole.
Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with
Morely. Morel growls at her. Sam is about to resume his
accident story when,
JASON
Watcha got for us?
Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise.
Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms.
SAM
New harvest, see whatcha think.
(to Morely)
What's your problem? Never seen
a pretty girl before?
Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth.
JASON/TIM/FRANK
(digging out cash)
Thanks, man.
Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger.
Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space.
Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body
press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved.
Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects
squarely with his snout. Morely keels back, and Sam snaps
him up.
SAM
Sorry, he's not really like
this. I'm really sorry.
GINGER
Jus' get'im out!
35
SAM
I'm really - well, see you guys.
And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone.
Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door.
The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as
they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like
they're lepers.
JASON
You okay?
GINGER
Yeah. Just hate dogs.
They give one another this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her
eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises reluctantly.
GINGER
Well. Thanks for the smoke.
JASON
Maybe we could --/
Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun
and shoots him.
GINGER
I'll letcha know.
Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the
van doors open and saunters out. Brigitte :Follows, trying not
to laugh.
Brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls'
washroom. She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the
last scene.
BRIGITTE
I'll letcha, I'll jus' let-choo
know. Bud. .So Ginger. Wanna
tell me about you and like, the
planet yer currently visiting?
No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to
her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She
smacks her dry lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks
from the tap.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 36
GINGER (O/S)
Bee-?
Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her
face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth.
Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it
stuck.
GINGER
Bee!
BRIGITTE
(STARTLED)
Yeah!
GINGER
Com'ere-!
Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it
empty. She giggles and moves to the next one.
BRIGITTE
That smoke fucked me _up._ up.
Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages
peeled off. she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet
paper.
The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo,
under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted.
Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits her on the
way in.
Ginger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall. Brigitte
has not fully closed the door. Ginger is just as stoned as
Brigitte.
BRIGITTE
Geez that's not right.
GINGER
1 didn't think.
BRIGITTE
What's the sticky stuff?
GINGER
I dunno.
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 37
Brigitte carefully rubs a finger over the fuzzy hair in the
wounds.
BRIGITTE
Oooh. Tickly.
GINGER
I got it on my tits too, look.
BRIGITTE
Weird. Does it hurt?
GINGER
No, it's itchy. I can't have a
hairy chest Bee, that's fucked.
BRIGITTE
Yeah, like forget that tattoo
you wanned.
GINGER
This sucks.
BRIGITTE
Quito badly.
The idiocy of the looks of awe on the other's face makes them
both crack up.
GINGER
(LAUGHING)
This isn't funny.
BR I G ITTE

I know, but okay. what I think?

FINGERS)
Attacked. On a full moon. Now,
yer hairy.
GINGER

I'm not Harry, I'm Ginger.
BRIGITTE

Stop, I'm serious. Think about
it.
Ginger stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion
settle.
38
GINGER
That's so stupid!
They both burst into gales again. There is a sound outside
the stall, as
The Trinas prance in to powder their noses. The Trina grabs
the first stall door -- Brigitte and Ginger's.
Brigitte and Ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in
headlights. Trina does not see Ginger's transformation. But
Ginger Is just doing her top up.
TRINA
Eeeew!
Trina backs away, her hands to her mouth.
TRINA
Gawd: They're lesbos!
CLONES
Feeeewww!!
Brigitte smacks her forehead. Ginger steps out and leers at
Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque mock-lust. The Trinas
shrink back against the farthest wall.
GINGER
Yeah, who's next? I'm still
sticky!
Brigitte's jaw drops. Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas,
start to relax. Ginger whips around again:
GINGER
(barking like a dog)
Rrr-uf, ruf, rr-of-rufrf
TRINAS
(SHRIEK)
Ginger gives the Trinas a good dead-eyed stave, and walks
out. Brigitte stumbles out after her.
39
Today's assignment is hacking up little pig feti.
BRIGITTE (O/S)
'Course Trina din't waste any
time.
Trina stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes
it to a classmate. It is read and passed on by every kid in
the room during this scene.
Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy -
hesitating. Ginger's attention is riveted on the little
carcass.
BRIGITTE
They're all looking at us.
GINGER
So?
Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading the note. Jason
smiles at Ginger and destroys the note. Trina seethes.
Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte. she makes a deep
incision in the pig's belly.
BRIGITTE
So! You're growing fur an,
acting like a nut, is so!
Ginger spies two girls giggling at her. Using both hands
Ginger cracks the carcass. wide open like a clam. Ginger digs
in, gouging out the pig's parts with her bare hands. Ginger
breaks into a sweat, her breathing gets heavy.
Brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates. she
moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes.
BRIGITTE
Um. Ginger-?
GINGER
hold on, I'm goi.n' for the
brain.
Ginger has begun scraping away at the pig's cranium with her
finger nails. A sickening creak, snap, and the brain is
exposed. Ginger - unconsciously - licks her fingers as she
admires its frontal lobe.
40
Brigitte fights a ralph.
BRIGITTE
Can't believe you did that!
GINGER
Hunh? What?
Before Brigitte can answer, Ginger lifts the brain out on her
finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte out of her way and...
Whap! The brain lands squarely on Trina's head. Trina
screams.
GINGER
Ha-ha! Bull's eye!
BIO TEACHER
Ginger Fitzgerald! Hall, NOW!
GINGER
What, it slipped!
As Ginger stomps out with the teacher. Brigitte and Trina
gape at one another.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
That week, Ginger was all over
the map. She was the goddamn
schizo poster girl. She forgot
the gyno guy. I couldn't believe
she forgot. She promised.
Brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table
with her feet in stirrups. The GYNECOLOGIST is examining
her.
A NURSE stands next to him, smiling benignly as she passes
him the contraption used to take a pap smear. Brigitte is
almost in tears.
CUT TO:
Same moment in the examination procedure, but now Ginger is
in the stirrups. And the doctor is shocked at his findings.
GYNO
What the -?
41
Brigitte gives Ginger a pout as they both shift uncomfortably
in their seats.
The doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler,
his hand shaking. He talks to Pamela like the girls aren't
even there.
GYNO
I've never seen anything like
it. She's not built like a
normal girl. I've sent samples
to the lab. But this is very,
VERY unusual.
Brigitte pokes Ginger in the ribs. Ginger doesn't like this,
and pushes Brigitte so hard she almost falls off her chair.
PAMELA
Girls, please.
INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
The window is open. Norman the terrier yams.
Ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her hair growth is
spreading. Brigitte is sitting at. the desk with a pile of
monster books.
GINGER
What're you, nuts? I got a skin
thing, whatever.
BRIGITTE
If you just gotta skin thing why
does it get worse everytime yer
being a bitch? Why's the gyno
say you're a monster inside?
GINGER
He din't say that!
BR I G ITTE
Just listen to these symptoms!
GINGER
I'm takin' a shower.
42
Ginger slams the bathroom door shut. Brigitte consults her
books, and the feminine hygiene calendar 10 days are
ticked off. Norman the terrier barks on.
BRIGITTE (V/0)
(READING)
"The key to his survival is a
constant diet of fresh warm-
blooded victims. His appetite is
insatiable, and grows with each
kill. But his appetite is also
the key to his own demise,
Ginger is in the shower. she runs shaking hands over her
body. Ginger hears Norman's barking as super-amplified.
Its persistence is making her mental.
BRIGITTE (V/0 - CON'T)
".. .for eventually the blood-
lust over-takes human reason,
overtakes oven the instinct for
self-preservation, and he will
risk all for the excitement of
the euphoric high of his
murders."
Ginger shaves the delicate area around her ankles. She cuts
herself and freaks. Ginger snaps the Lady Bic in half and
throws the pieces hard against the shower wall.
GINGER
Fuck fuck fuck FUCK
There are two other broken razors in the stall, stuffed with
hairs. Blood mixes with the water and swirls around her
toes.
The doq is still barkin .outside. Brigitte closes her book.
BRIGITTE (V/0)
But see all the books and movies
an' shit said it had to be a
full moon, that it'd be all at
once. An, ya know, not one word
about chick werewolves on the
rag. Typical.
43
Ginger flings open the door, tears to the window, hauls
herself out and is gone. Brigitte is after her in a heart
beat.
Brigitte sits staring into space. Ginger is showering in the
attached bath.
GINGER (O/S)
(SINGING)
Ho-ow much is that daw-gy in the
window... Arf-Arf!
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Ever been too sick to be sick?
Like the bottom of your stomach
is wrapped over the top of your
head?
There is a knock at the door. Brigitte checks the dead bolt
is on.
BR IGITTE
Yeah?!
PAMELA (O/S)
Who's showering so late?
BRIGITTE
Ginger!
PAMELA(O/S)
Why?
45
BRIGITTE
she's dirty?!
Brigitte throws up her hands: what an idiotic conversation.
PAMELA (01S)
Dirty!? How'd she get/
BR IG ITTE
I'm tryin' to study, here!
PAMELA (01S)
oh, all right then.
Brigitte slumps against the door. The showers stops.
Ginger appears in a towel, pink and clean and freshly furry
in places. She's in a really good mood. She takes one look
at Brigitte's face of doom and tries to be serious.
GINGER
I couldn't help it. Really.
Guess you were right.
Ginger finds and lights a smoke.
GINGER
You know what's really weird?
BRIGITTE
Weirder than KILLING A DOG AND
EATING IT???!!
GINGER
I liked it. I liked it a lot. I
feel all fucki.n' goofy now.
Like, I dunno. Like .happy?
Brigitte shakes her head over and over.
GINGER
I feel like I just got off the
Planet Smasher ride at WarWorid,
okay? It rules!
Ginger leaps to the stereo and blasts on some tunes. She
flails around the room wildly. Ginger grabs Brigitte by the
arms and makes her dance too. Ginger spins and spins
Brigitte, who fights it but laughs.
46
BRIGITTE (V/O)
So she'd killed Norman. 1 never
seen anyone bliss out like that.
I wanted to be so blissed, jus'
once.
There is repeated pounding on their door. Brigitte still
entangled in Ginger, hits the music off.
PAMELA (O/S)
Little late for that, girls.
GINGER/BRIGITTE
(Bite me:)/Sorry;
They stand in each other's arms listening to Pamela mount the
stairs OFF SCREEN.
Ginger shoves Brigitte backward onto her bed. Ginger piles
on top of her, playfully pinning her down.
GINGER
I want more.
Brigitte squirms fitfully.
BR IG ITTE
No, it's too gross! You'll get
caught.
GINGER
Not if you help. Bee. I'm
starving.
Brigitte looks into her sister's beaming face.
GINGER
Jus' keep watch. Look, I'm gonna
be somethin' totally else. Tell
me you don't so dig it. Tell me
you don't wanna see what
happens.
Brigitte groans.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Straight up? Crazy's contagious.
Trust me.
47
Ginger holds her mattress up while Brigitte stuffs handfuls
of the collars underneath. They collapse, exhausted. Ginger
crawls on her hands and knees to the toilet in the
Ginger drinks out of the toilet like a dog.
Ginger burps loudly and crawls back to join her sister, who
offers her a cigarette.
BR IG ITTE
Pig.
GINGER
You love it.
Brigitte examines the feminine hygiene calendar. In it, a
cartoon of a female egg is personified with a heels and
sunglasses, strutting across the date.
BRTGITTE
trey, look yer ovulating.
Ginger rubs her belly.
GINGER
I'm still hungry, Bee.
BRIGITTE
How can you - you've done every
dog we can
GINGER
It's not enough. I want
somethin'... I need more.
Brigitte waits outside a door marked GUIDANCE.
Trina struggles by with the help of her clones. Trina sports
a big ugly bandage on her neck, knees and an arm in a sling.
She shoots Brigitte a Death Stare.
TRINA
Yer bitch sister's dead, freak.
BRIGITTE
(under her breath)
Fuck off.
Jason lopes up. He indicates the guidance office door.
JASON
Ginger in there again?
Brigitte ignores him.
JASON
Cool. Um. Look, Belinda...
BRIGITTE
Brigitte.
JASON
Right, right. T'd really like to
take yer sister out. Think you
could ask her for me?
53
Brigitte' s face clouds.
JASON
Hey. I could fix you up too. I
guess.
Brigitte seethes.
JASON
Fuck. Never mind, I'll ask her
myself.
(under his breath)
Freak.
Jason takes a post on the opposite Brigitte to wait. Brigitte
glares at him.
The grossly over-weight guidance councilor, MR. WAYNE, is
perched on the edge of his fake wood desk, holding their
death slides (from the credit sequence) up to the fluorescent
light. His arm pits are stained with sweat.
Ginger slumps in a chair before him. There is a fish bowl
full of condoms on his desk. Ginger picks one out, unwrapping
it, examining it as he talks.
MR. WAYNE
Look, you keep getting sent
here. We might as well be
friendly.
GINGER
I don't do friendly, Mr. Wayne.
MR. WAYNE
Hey. I know where you're coming
from. I was a kid once too.
GINGER
Really? So was I. Weird.
Ginger fakes an eye-lash batting smile. She winds the condom
over her erect fingers.
MR. WAYNE
Okay, you aren't a kid. You're a
young adult. With some issues.
Let's explore them.
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 54
Ginger rubs the condom's lubricant between her two free
fingers, intrigued by the texture.
MR. WAYNE
Hey. I'm reaching out here.
Your plays for attention are a
cry for help, aren't they?
GINGER
Uh, no.
MR. WAYNE
Is it a problem at home? With
your parents?
GINGER
They think I'm cute.
Mr. Wayne sighs.
MR. WAYNE
Maybe I ought to split you and
your sister up.
GTNGER
Aw, c'mon Mr. Wa-ayne. Divide
aii' conquer? That's so old.
MR. WAYNE
Hey. You're antisocial,
antagonistic, and now violent.
The point of high school is you
learn to develop a place for
yourselves in society.../
GINGER
'Long as you like it.
MR. WAYNE
As long as you're at this school
young lady, I better like it.
Ginger gives him a cold, dead stare.
MR. WAYNE
consider this your final
warning. I see you outta line
again, and we're talking
expulsion. And don't look at me
like that, missy.
55
Ginger slams the Guidance office door on her way out.
GINGER
Fuckin' guidance my ass.
She pounds her fist into a locker and makes a dent. Brigitte
cringes. Ginger admires the damage.
JASON
Holy...
Ginger notices Jason and visibly brightens.
GINGER
Hey.
JASON
Hey. whatcha doin' now?
GINGER
Nothin' special.
JASON
Wanna go for a ride?
GINGER
Sure. C'mon Bee.
Jason and Brigitte's faces darken simultaneously.
BRIGITTE
Ginger, we should get home.
GINGER
No we shouldn't.
Brigitte drags Ginger aside. Ginger notes Brigitte's hand
squeezing her arm with a dangerous look.
BRIGITTE
Twenty minutes ago you coulda
killed somebody. Is this really
a good time to start dating? I
don't think so.
Ginger shakes Brigitte's hand off.
GINGER
Well, I do.
56
BRIGITTE
Why?
GINGER
Why?! Look, grow up a little an'
maybe you'll get it
BRIGITTE
What.
GINGER
Forget it, I'm goin'. I'll draw
ya a picture later, 'kay?
Ginger takes Jason's hand and pulls him off to the exit.
Jason gives Brigitte SUCH a smug look over his shoulder.
Brigitte stands alone in the hall, gaping after them.
EXT BAILEY HIGH - LATE DAY
BRIGITTE (V/O)
When Henry renovated the
basement, to build our room? I
was like ten an, in the way an,
shit. Well, he rammed iue with
this beam, right in my stomach.
Accidentally.
Brigitte wanders over the emptying school. lot. She looks
small and alone. She looks disoriented.
BRIGITTE (CON'T-V/0)
But all the air came outta my
lungs at once an, I kept tryin'
to breathe but I couldn't. I
forgot all about that. Till like
right now.
Brigitte consults the hygiene calendar. Ginger's ending the
third week of checked-off days. A special note on today's
date asks DO YOU HAVE PMS?
Ginger and Jason sit in the front seat of his van. They're
making out. Ginger is enjoying herself. Ginger bites his lip.
Ginger draws blood.
JASON
Ouch! whoa. Can't believe you
never had a boyfriend...
Ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead
cold. Jason dives back at her for more. Ginger looks both
aroused and unnerved by her arousal. Ginger's stomach growls.
Ginger pushes Jason off of her.
GINGER
I have to go. It's getting late.
JASON
It's only six o'clock.
Jason presses himself on her again. Ginger shoves him off,
hard.
GINGER
1-have-to-go.
JASON
Oh. Now you get all moody on me?
GINGER
Hey_ You got no idea.
Brigitte lets herself in. The music is now deafening. Trina
is bound in a chair at the end of her bed, screaming her head
off. Her screams are buried by the music. Brigitte slams and
locks the door behind her.
GINGER
(yelling over noise)
Stop screaming or I'll rip your
permed head right off you neck.
An' ya know what? I can do
that. Now open wide
Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon. Trina screams
with her mouth full, trying to spit it back out. Ginger
offers Trina a glass of milk.
GINGER
Chaser? No?
GINGER SNAPS-WALTON/July 15, 1996 59
Blood trickles out of the corners of Trinas mouth as she
chews while bawling. Ginger sets the glass of milk on the
desk.
BRIGITTE
Ginger WHAT are you doing-!
Ginger grins and shows Bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks.
GINGER
Jus' like you said, Bee!
S' perfect!
Brigitte grabs the bowl away: glass shards and tacks rain
around them.
BRIGITTE
Are you crazy?!
GINGER
Hey! I'm Join' this for you!
As the sisters argue, Trina rocks the chair back and forth,
trying to free herself.
BR I G ITTE
Oh no, no way... No!
GINGER
Yer still burnt over Jason!
BR I G ITTE
No, Ginger, I'm burnt 'cause you
don't see like jail in yer
future! You don't get how hugely
fucked this is! DO you?
Trina lurches back hard and rocks forward. Trina struggles to
get her toes to meet the floor. She lurches back for more
momentum.
GINGER
You sayin' I'm stupid?!
BRIGITTE
I'm sayin' she? Will tell on
you! This is someone who will
tell!
Trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect
firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a
sickening CRACK on the sharp corner of the desk. The milk
glass dumps on top of her.
60
Brigitte and Ginger look at her. Trina hangs there in the
chair at this strange angle for a moment, dripping milk.
Then Trina and the chair keel to the floor. Trina is still.
Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina. Blood
trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass
mess at her mouth. Her open eyes stare at nothing. She's
dead.
GINGER
Ha-ha.
Ginger grabs her own right arm (most damaged by the original
attack) and shudders with pain.
GINGER
Ow. Ow. Owchee-wow-ow.
Brigitte takes Trina in from head to toe. Brigitte checks
Trina for a pulse. Brigitte snaps her hand back as though it
were burned. A tremor wracks Brigitte's body and she
convulses. Brigitte runs to the bathroom. OFF SCREEN,
Brigitte throws up.
Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand. The hand is
nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw. The
nails are black, curling claws.
Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face
with a pillow.
BRIGITTE
My life is basically over.
GINGER
Bee. ..BEE!
Awestruck, they both watch as Ginger extends and retracts her:
new set of claws.
There is a knock at the door. The girls look at one another
in mute horror. Ginger addresses the door.
GINGER
What!
PAMELA (O/S)
Are you two fighting?!
GINGER
-- No!
GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15. 1996 61
PAMELA (O/S)

Brigitte and Ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit.
GINGER (O/S)
Coming!
TNT FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Ginger has her new paw curled up in an over-sized sweat
jacket sleeve. Brigitte stares at the stew before them with
grave distaste. Pamela has a number of used tissues around
her - she's been crying.
HENRY
The gynecologist called.
Pamela grasps Ginger's gnarly arm and squeezes it through her
sleeve. Brigitte and Ginger look at Pamela's hand.
PAMELA
There's something wrong, Ginger.
He wants to do an ultra-sound!
HENRY
Pamela, don't scare her. How
could the cells not be human
cells? we'll send you to
somebody else.
PAMELA
I'm sure your father's right.
I'm just upset... How are you
feeling, do you feel. all right?
GINGER
Um. sure. Fine.
PAMELA
(lowering her voice)
No unusual discharge or anything
like that?
Henry, Brigitte and Ginger groan.
PAMELA
I worry, all right? I've made
another appointment with a new
doctor. Early next month was the
earliest he could see you. okay?
62
GINGER
okay.
They all begin eating in silence. Except Brigitte who gags
as Henry squirts ketchup all over his stew.
Their alarm clock goes off reading 8:00 AM. Ginger's paw
comes down hard on it, cracking the plastic casing.
Brigitte is already up. She sweeps up the glass mess from the
night before.
Ginger rolls out of bed, steps over Brigitte and stumbles to
the bathroom. Ginger steps on tacks and doesn't even react.
GINGER
Man, I'm not getting enough
sleep.
Ginger closes the bathroom door.
Brigitte leaps to the door, looping one end of a noosed
extension cord around the handle. The other end is tied to
the door handle of the bedroom door. Brigitte checks to
ensure the latter is bolted shut.
65
OFF-SCREEN, the toilet flushes. OFF-SCREEN, Ginger tries to
open the door. She can't.
GINGER(O/S)
The fuck -? Beef
Brigitte watches the vibrating length of cord hold the door
firmly in place. Ginger bangs hard on the door.
GINGER
BEE!?
BRIGITTE
Ginger, don't be pissed...
GINGER
Open the fuckin' door you feeb.
BRIGITTE
No!
Ginger pounds on the door with great violence.
BR I( 'TF.
Want Pamela dc h, e?
The pounding Sto2s.
BRIGITTE
We have to stop it Ginge'. If we
can. I`ll be back before dark.
Brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her book and
leaves by the window.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Told Pammy Ginger wasn't feeling
well. Just to get her checkin'
regular on. her, keep the
pressure on Ginger to be cool.
EXT COUNTY GREENHOUSES - DAY
Brigitte steps off a county bus at the drive.
There's a police car parked next to the Sam's truck. She
looks back to the bus, but the doors swing shut and it pulls
away.
Brigitte smoothes her hair, takes a deep breath, and over-
acts innocent as she walks up.
66
INT COUNTY GREENHOUSE - DAY
Brigitte can hear male voices as she minces down the leafy
aisles.
COP (O/S)
It's in your best interests to
be cooperative.
SAM (O/S)
My lawyer's co-operative, I just
know my rights. I don't know
where she is, I'm very
concerned. That's it, unless you
got a warrant.
She ends up backing into a COP behind some palms.
BRIGITTE
Shhh-it! I mean, sorry.
SAM
(to cop)
You can see I got customers, so
if that's all.
COP
Okay. Sure. For now.
The cop gives Sam a final Dirty Harry squint and leaves.
Sam collects himself with difficulty. So does Brigitte.
SAM

score, I don't keep nothin' here
at work, sweetheart.
BRIGITTE
I din't. I mean I skipped, but-/

SAM
Fuck. She's missing.
BRIGITTE
Oh. S-sorry.
SAM
Yeah, well. Cops think I know
where she is. I don't.
Sam looks Brigitte right in the eye. Brigitte is caught up in
him for a second.
SAM
Sorry, what do you care right?
What do you need.
BRIGITTE
Um. Lookin' for this.
She holds out the torn page. Sam takes it.
SAM
Aconitum lycoctonum? Sorry.
Brigitte yanks her own hair hard. Sam smiles.
SAM

Well, you know it's poisonous,
right? Wolfs bane? Deadly. Be

BRIGITTE
No, I thought it did something
else. Doesn't matter.
SAM
Anyways they're perennials -
only flowers in spring.
Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation.
Sam watches her stamp toward the door.
SAM
Hey. Ranunculaceae come in about
a hundred species. I've gotta
cousin, monkshood. Not so toxic.
If you're interested.
66
Brigitte stops and considers him.
SAM
Don't know if it'd help.
INT GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
They sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers. Sam.
picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and
hands it to Brigitte.
SAM
S'called monkshood 'cause people
used to think it kept 'em pure
from dirty thoughts. Seriously.
BRIGITTE
(EARNESTLY)
Make my life easier.
Sam laughs. Surprised by this, Brigitte smiles and hides
under her hair.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
This is awful. but the whole time
I was with him there? I din't
even think how I'd just put
pieces of his girlfriend in the
deep freeze, like, at all.
Ginger pulls with all. her might to get the door open a few
inches. The door knobs on both doors are straining.
Something starts to crack.
With ferocious effort, Ginger contorts herself through two
inches of space. The cracking is coming from Ginger as she
squeezes her body bizarre-ly out of joint, as a contortionist
might.
Once through, she snaps and clicks her distended bones back
in place. She gasps for breath. Her face is distorted with
murderous fury.
There is a knock on the bedroom door.
PAMELA (O/S)
Ginger, feeling any better?
Ginger climbs noiselessly out of the window.
69
PAMELA (O/s)
Ginger? You sleeping?...God, I
hate this lock, I know it's-
privacy but what if you were in
trouble in there for god's sake?
Brigitte stands at her on locker, tying a rubber band
around stalks of the monkshood. There is a goofy half-smile
on her face, and she's humming.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
The book said dry it out before
using it. I figured I'd keep
Ginger locked up - feeding her
Trina - till it was ready.
she hangs the monkshood upside down in the locker. The
buzzer goes as she slams the door shut.
Ginger stomps the deserted halls, with their class schedule
in hand. Classes are in session. A fat silhouette appears-at
the end of the corridor.
WAYNE
Fitzgerald. Tardy! My office
NOW!
Ginger faces him with a dreadful expression.
70
Brigitte slumps in her seat doodling. The RCMP officer is
back, speaking to the class. The poster this time has a class
photo of Trina.
OFFICER
If any of you have seen Trina
please let us know. She went
for a run this morning and has
not returned or contacted her
family or friends...
Ginger stands imposingly over Mr. Wayne in his chair.
WAYNE
Sit down, Ginger.
GINGER
I can't stay.
WAYNF:
I said, sit.
GINGER
An' I said ./
WAYNE
(cutting her off)
You are expelled. This is not
your personal playground, this
is a school.
GINGER
Oh dear.
Ginger's good hand lifts the telephone receiver on Mr.
Wayne's desk. With her wolfen paw she dials. In the
background we see blood splattered over the walls.
71
GINGER (O/S)
(imitating Pamela)
Hello, main office? This is Mrs.
Fitzgerald. would you page my
daughter Brigitte please? I'm
waiting to meet her in the
guidance office. Thank you so
much.
Brigitte catches herself writing Sam's name on her binder.
She scribbles it out, looking very guilty.
PA SYSTEM (O/S)
Would Brigitte Fitzgerald please
report to guidance. Brigitte
Fitzgerald.
Brigitte freezes. The cop, the teacher, the whole class look
at her. Brigitte scoops up her stuff.
GINGER
Don't ever fuck with me like
that again.
BRIGITTE
You .got out.
Brigitte gapes at all the blood. Ginger is very agitated.
GINGER
He asked for it. Was gonna expel
me. So.
Backing away, Brigitte trips over Mr. Wayne's foot sticking
out from under the desk.
GINGER
What do we do, Bee? What do we
do?
72
Brigitte sinks into a chair looking completely traumatized.
Ginger hops about - charged by the kill.
GINGER
C'mon we need a fuckin' plan
here!
The school bell goes off. Brigitte snaps out of her daze,
reaches up and hits the light switch off. They now sit in
virtual darkness.
BRIGITTE
Last bell. wait till everyone
goes. We'll stuff him someplace.
Clean this up. I guess.
The sound of the full halls around them seems very loud now.
GINGER
Bee, gotta a smoke?
Brigitte hands her a smoke.
GINGER
Sorry about this.
BRIGITTE
Whatever.
GINGER
Don't be mad, ' kay?
BRIGITTE
I'm not mad.
The school is deserted. The lock pops on the Guidance door
and Brigitte and Ginger peer out. Nobody.
BRIGITTE
Stay here. Lock the door. I'll
knock once.
Ginger nods. Brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor.
Ginger shuts the door. Then Ginger whips it open again.
BR IG ITTE
Shut the door, Ginger!
73
GINGER
Bee?
BRIGITTE
WHATI
GINGER
Thanks.
Brigitte blinks at her, then continues to skulk away. The
office door shuts and the lock locking reverbs after her.
Brigitte walks fast, looking for a place for the body.
She looks inside full garbage cans and sizes them up. Too
small.
She looks up at a loose ceiling panel. She jumps a few times
trying to reach it. Too high. She gets an idea.
Brigitte jogs past the sign directing us to gym.
A JANITOR pushes his cart toward the guidance office. He
stops at another door, produces keys, and lets himself in.
He returns with a trash can and empties into his bin. He
replaces the can, closes the door and locks it.
Ginger, gnaws on Mr. Wayne's arm but really isn't enjoying
it. She stops in mid-chew and listens. The janitor's
footsteps approach: his cart wheels squeak
The janitor wheels up to the guidance office. He slides this
key in the lock.
Ginger grips the door knob as best she can with her one good
hand, her feet braced against the wall on either side.
74
On the other side, the janitor tugs, and tugs again.
Ginger's getting madder the more he persists.
The janitor gives the door one last wrench and it flies open.
Brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls
around a corner.
The janitor crawls toward her, his hands lifted to her for
help, blood spurting from his slashed throat. He tries to
cry out, but only makes a gurgling whistle, the air in his
Qi s passing through blood.
Ginger walks behind him as he crawls. Ginger applies her boot
to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore.
Ginger giggles.
Ginger looks up and sees Brigitte gaping in utter revulsion
at her. For a split second, Ginger stops cold. Ginger seems
to falter before her sister's horror.
Then, without breaking their locked gaze, without even
seeming conscious she's doing it - Ginger steps on the man's
fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps.
Brigitte tries to pry her eyes away, but can't.
Still staring at Brigitte, Ginger extends her claws. Ginger
shakes her head, as if to say I can't help it.. .Ginger
pounces on the man. Brigitte turns her face to the wall.
The lanitor makes a final horrible noise. The halls fall
silent.
as Brigitte stuffs Mr. Wayne into the gym basket and covers
him with balls,
Ginger runs madly up and down the halls screeching and
whooping, slamming her monster arm into the lockers bashing
them in.
as Brigitte pushes the janitor's body into a ground level air
VENT
Ginger breaks the fire extinguisher out of it's case and
unleashes foam into the halls.
GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15, 1996 75
Brigitte mops up the janitor's blood with his own cart stuff.
The Guidance office is already clean.
Ginger lifts the fire extinguisher over her head. She starts
running with it toward through the frosted glass window of
the main office with a triumphant war whoop.
Brigitte steps between Ginger and her target.
GINGER
Move!
BRIGITTE
STOP IT! Just stop. Enough,
Ginger. Please. Please.
Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to dive
out of the way. SMASH! Glass rains down over. Brigitte.
Brigitte lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the
hall looking for more mischief.
Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her
lap and rocks herself. Brigitte sobs.
OFF-SCREEN we hear Ginger cont.inuing her ram a e else where
in the school. Brigitte wanders up to the janitor's cart,
looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and wretched.
Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid. She sniffs it.
She closes her eyes and tips it back. She washes it around in
her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow. She spews it into
the air, the taste making her heave instinctively. she dry
heaves a couple of times. She throws the bottle at the wall.
Exhausted, Brigitte trails Ginger who is tired too, and
heading for the exit. They stop dead at the doors.
Ginger leans on the bathroom door, which is shut.
78
GINGER
C'mon Bee...
Brigitte is sitting on the closed seat of the toilet trying
to pull her hair out.
BRIGITTE
Shut up, leave me alone!
GINGER (O/S)
It's not that big a deal.
BRIGITTE (O/S)
How can you say that! Two people
are dead because of you. Us.
GINGER
They pissed me off.
Brigitte opens the bathroom door.
BRIGITTE
Oh. Then they we asking for it?
What about Jason an' them? Gonna
kill 'em all when yer done,
Ginger? 'Cause you have to take
yer clothes OFF for that shit,
they wanna SEE yer BODY for that
shit, you gonna let like five
guys live to tell how they
fucked the Beast a' Bailey
Downs? That could annoy you too!
Ginger prods a claw into Brigitte's chest, pinning her in
place.
GINGER
Think yer sooo smart? I think
yer sooo jealous.
BRIGITTE
Yeah, I'm jealous yer turning
into a nympho. I'm so jealous
yer killing people who did never
did nothing to you. Yeah Ginger.
Sure.
GINGER
Oh, wow.
79
Brigitte takes a deep breath, swallows hard.
BR IG ITTE
I don't wanna do this any more.
Ginger's claw pricks Brigitte's skin. Brigitte cringes.
Blood appears around the claw.
GINGER
What.
BRIGITTE
I'm sorry, but...!
Brigitte writhes in pain as Ginger's claw slices in deeper.
BRIGITTE
Ginger?! This is me.
Ginger retracts the claw, and Brigitte grabs the wound.
GINGER
SO?
Ginger hurls Brigitte against the wall. Ginger throws herself
on top of Brigitte. Ginger raises her killing claw to
Bri g.iLt.e' s neck.
GINGER
Who needs you?
Brigitte is helpless and looks terrified. Ginger's face is
contorted with intensity, with madness. Ginger's drooling. A
drip of gob drops onto Brigitte's face.
BRIGITTE
(very small,
PLAINTIVE)
Ginger...
Ginger lifts Brigitte by the shirt-front and searches her
eyes. Ginger drops Brigitte to the floor and grabs her coat.
Brigitte grabs Ginger's leg.
BRIGITTE
Don't, please!
Brigitte struggles to hang on, to rise from the floor;
Ginger's really hurt her.
BRIGITTE
Maybe we can stop it! Lemme try!
Ginger kicks free.
80
GINGER
An' spoil my fun? I'll skin you
alive first.
Brigitte struggles to a point between Ginger and the window.
BR IG ITTE
You're fucked without me.
They'll catch you. Wake up!
GINGER
No, you wake up! Nobody'll live
to catch me. Yer a two-faced
lil' chicken shit? Your problem,
Brigitte. I don't need ya. I
don't WANTCHA! So stay away from
me or I'll kill you I swear I'll
have you for breakfast.
Brigitte backs out of Ginger's way.
Ginger steps up i.o the window and climbs through.
Brigitte rubs her throat, trying hard to keep breathing.
Brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an Adidas gym bag
from under it. Brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the
floor and jamming them into the bag.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I was like, okay. Fuck you too.
She'd be sorry. And I'd be like,
I dunno - somewheres' totally
else goin' not my problem.
Right.
EXT SERVICE LANE - NIGHT
Brigitte trudges up to the bus stop next to the fence of the
playhouse yard with her full Adidas bag.
Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing.
It looks like a UFO has landed on the other side of the
fence.
She peers through the slats. She sees the playhouse, lit up
like a Christmas tree. She sees gloved hands and police
uniforms. Then sliding past, the long - almost endless -
shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse:
they've found Trina's body.
The bus appears, approaching from way down the road.
81
Brigitte looks from it to the crime scene. The crime scene
photographer's FLASH! pops in Brigitte's face - blinding her
for a second. Brigitte rubs her eyes. She shakes her head
hard.
The bus is indicating, slowing to pull over.
Brigitte opens her eyes. The bus is almost here. Brigitte
grips her Adidas bag.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
But you can't break up with
blood. You can't divorce yer
sister. You jus' can't.
The bus passes, obscuring Brigitte from view as its body
fills frame. when its tail lights pass, Brigitte is far down
the street, running like a champion in the direction she came
from.
Brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens
it. The room is dark and just as she left it. Ginger's hed
has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I'd get the monkshood from my
locker at school the next
morning.
Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on.
Empty.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I'd find Ginger, I'd find out if
the stuff even worked.
Brigitte locks the window shut. She locks the bedroom door
and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I could deal with whatever, as
long as I tried. If it was the
last thing she ever saw me do,
it was gonna be me goin' fer
somethin' by myself. The real
Ginger woulda dug that large.
Brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat
out of the closet.
82
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I would try to save my sister
when the sun came up. You know,
if the sun came up.
Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her. She
lights a smoke. She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on
the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at
Halloween, taken many years before.
The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday. Friday is the
full moon. Friday is Halloween.
INT GIRLS' ROOM - DAWN
The lamp is still on. The ash tray is full of butts. Brigitte
stirs in her sleep.
Ginger stands at the end of Brigitte's bed, staring at her.
Brigitte snaps to, gripping the bat. Ginger snorts, and
climbs into her own bed.
Brigitte swings her gaze to the window. It is still shut and
locked. The bureau is still in front of the door. Brigitte
holds her hat tightly and watches her sister's back in the
next bed, terrified.
SAM
I showed up to see Trina? But
she's I'm goin' strange in
the head.
Brigitte doesn't know what to say, so she offers his a smoke.
He takes it.
SAM
Why? Why would ya do a thing
like that?
Brigitte examine his. face for an implication. There isn't
one.
SAM
What's unny is I dumped her
that night. Feel bad about it
now. Truth is, she was a pain in
the ass. I sound like a jerk,
right.
BR IGITTE
No.
SAM
Really? Yeah well, while she
was - disappearin', I'm off have
a time at the Highway Home with
my buddy Georgio. Drinkin',
dealin' - an, now she's
Sam is over-come again. Brigitte raises a hand to touch him,
chickens out, and then scores on the second attempt. He
rolls right into her arms.
85
For a brief moment, Brigitte has her nose in his hair, her
cheek on his shoulder, her hands on his back. He's crying,
and she fights her own tears.
SAM
Sorry, this is strange. I don't
even ...Last time I saw her she
was so mad at me. An' we did
have some times, we did. Makes
me sick what her last thought a'
me musta been though.
Their eyes meet, their faces are inches apart. Brigitte
kisses him, very softly and very quickly and then pulls out.
Sam looks shocked. Brigitte looks more shocked.
BRIGITTE
I'm really, um.
Sam leans in and kisses her right back. Better. Longer.
SAM
Shit. Sorry. Kinda freaked. You
know? I shouldn't, well.
BRIGITTE
Yeah. Yeah.
SAM
But that was really nice.
BRIGITTE
Oh. 'Kay. Good.
They sit staring straight ahead a moment. A cop ahead double-
takes them, and reaches into his car for the radio mic.
SAM
You wanna lil' dube or
somethin'? Listenin' to me go
on like a loser-What's yet-
name?
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 22, 1996 86
BRIGITTE
Brigitte. Fitzgerald. No, that's
okay. I need more monkshood...
SAM
Yes! Dirty thoughts! oh. I been
drinkin'. Should not drive.
Right, Brr-igitte?
Brigitte drags her hands over her face with extreme anxiety.
BRIGITTE
Oh, right. OK. Ur.
SAM
Ginger's yer sister right?
Sam grimaces as Brigitte nods.
BRIGITTE
Why?
SAM
Oh, rumors - say she's doin'
all these guys at some party.
Goias' around she's a big time
ho', that kinder thing. Hey.
Don't worry about it. Nobody
mentioned you.
Ginger's most maniacal laugh drifts over to them. Brigitte
sees her dancing sexily on the roof of a car with a whole
crowd of leering boys.
Sam grabs Brigitte',.s a r

I like you Brigitte F.
BR IG ITTE
What -?
SAM
Like to see ya again. Can I come
to yer party too?
BRIGITTE
sh-sure. Sorry. I gotta -
Ginger, so.
Brigitte slips out of the truck as they stare at one another
with that look you get when you're scared because you just
kissed someone you really, really like.
89
The Fitzgerald family is eating. Brigitte pokes at her food.
Ginger eats like a fiend, with sunglasses on. Her monster arm
has been wrapped in gauze from tip to elbow.
PAMELA
Now just remember, no boys in
you bedroom during this party.
Your room is off limits. Ginger
are you sure that arm's not
sprained, or worse?
GINGER
Bruise. Lacrosse.
PAMELA
Mm Henry when'd you get this new
meat from Tinny's? Quite nice.
Brigitte and Ginger exchange a look.
HENRY
I haven't been to Tinny's.
PAMELA
Then where's all the packs
marked "t" come from -?
Brigitte spits out her food.
BRIGITTE
I be excused?
Brigitte is using the vehicle's portable phone as she eyes
the silhouettes of the family -still at the dining table - in
the window above her.
She stares at her watch during the following,
911 OPERATOR (O/S)
911, do you need fire, ambulance
or police, please.
BRIGITTE
(speaking very
QUICKLY)
Sam McDonald is not the Beast of
Bailey Downs. He was at the
Highway Home Motel when Trina
Sinclair was killed. Sam didn't
do it.
90
Brigitte whips the phone shut, hanging up. She breathes out
long and slow.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
In case this was the last thing
I'd do. I wanned Sam out of it.
Sam shouldn't suffer.
Brigitte hovers in the door way. Henry is reading the paper.
HENRY
That Sinclair girl was found at
the Bernstein's, can you believe
it?
PAMELA
What, last night? I didn't hear
a thing! Never going to have
these done in time. Henry help.
Pamela is feverishly creating little straw witches and such
party decorations. She has a se]ecl.i.on of dried flowers,
wheat etc on the table before her.
PAMELA
Brigitte, honey we're
thrilled you two are making
friends. But next time you two
do something like this give
Mummy a little more notice, will
you? Hate having to scramble.
Brigitte slides into her regular chair and props her hands on
her wrists in an attitude of complete distraction.
HENRY
What's your sister up to?
Brigitte looks at Henry as he works on a little witch.
PAMELA
She said she had a lot of work
to do on her costume. Should we
dress up, you think?
Henry grimaces. He sifts through the dried plants before
them. Brigitte double-takes the pile.
PAME-LA
oh, Henry. You're no fun at all.
91
Brigitte sits bolt up right in her seat.
BRIGITTE
What is this stuff?
PAMELA
Just weeds, old cuttings from
the yard.
BRIGITTE
No, THIS stuff.
Brigitte plucks out a handful of dried plant with tiny purple
flowers.
PAMELA
Oh, I had that around the
dahlias. Man at the greenhouse
said it'd keep the cats out.
Seemed to do the job. It's got a
funny name - nun's robe, priest
hat, something
BRIGITTE
Monkshood.
PAMELA
That's right. Do we have a
budding botanist in the family?!
HENRY
Pun intended.
Pamela giggles as does Henry. Brigitte grabs a fistful of
monkshood and races for the door.
PAMELA
Hey, we need that! Brigitte!
But Brigitte is gone.
PAMELA
That was my accent colour!
The half-finished basement has a rec room which Pamela has
decked out in an infantile version of ghoulish for the party.
Punch sits ready next to case-lot pop and Tupperware brimming
with snacks.
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15. 1996 92
Brigitte walks through to the door with a sign, OFF LIMITS.
Brigitte unlocks the door and slips the monkshood up her
shirt.
Candles are burning all over. Ginger's bed is turned down,
ready. Brigitte walks in on Jason climbing through the open
window.
JASON
Hey. Must be the place, right?
Brigitte sneers at him. He holds a half-gone bottle of
schnapps, a dress shirt and his Good Jeans on.
The toilet flushes in the john. Brigitte knocks on the door.
GINGER
WHAT1
BRIGITTE
McCardy's here.
The bathroom door unlocks but. remains closed.
GINGER
Git in here an, gimme a hand.
Brigitte casts an uncertain look at Jason.
JASON
C'mon ladies, there's six other
guys sitting in the shrub
waiting.
Brigitte's face darkens. She slips into the bathroom and
shuts the door.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Do you think some people deserve
to die?
Brigitte does not tryo to hide her fear of being in a
confined space with Ginger. There are razors and whiskers all
over the floor. shaving cream every where. Ginger is red-
faced, sweating and hostile.
93
GINGER
Don't say a fuckin' word.
Ginger lowers the towel she's wearing enough to show the
bump on her butt is now a twitching tail. Brigitte gasps.
GINGER
Take this gauze and tie it flat.
BRIGITTE
Ginger, you can't
GINGER
DO IT!
Brigitte takes the roll of gauze. She grabs the tail between
her fingers and coils it up with utter disgust. Brigitte's
hands tremble.
Brigitte - now in ZOMBIE-face - rubs the monkshood between
her fingers, crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter.
OFF-SCREEN from the bedroom, the sounds of Ginger having
rough sex continue.
Brigitte peels a centimeter of paper off the end of an unlit
smoke and wiggles the cigarette, creating a second pile of
tobacco. She reaches into the radiator vent and withdraws a
package of rolling papers.
OFF-SCREEN, from the rec room part noise grows as things get
under way outside.
Ginger waves good-bye to Jason as she undoes Frank's shirt
buttons. The bathroom door is now inching open a crack.
On the counter at the sink, all evidence of Brigitte's
project with the monkshood are gone.
Brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away,
fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out. The
sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom.
She catches sight of herself in the mirror. As a ZOMBIE. She
tugs her shirt tight over her breasts. Nothing to see.
She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms
down over her waist, her hips. Over her crotch. Brigitte's
fingers skip under her skirt.
Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under
there. She's trying this out. But nothing's happening.
She frowns. She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly
washes her hands in the sink. She checks her watch and sighs.
Brigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours. Above her,
Ginger's feet and some guy's writhe on the bed.
Brigitte reaches up to the bedroom door knob. She opens it
and crawls out.
The rec room is packed with over-grown ghouls. Pamela is
trying to play it cool from her perch behind the punch bowl,
as she marvels at the costumes and all these kids she's never
even. met before.
96
Henry has a group of boys cornered with a college football
story.
Brigitte leans against the wall watching the party and
looking at her watch.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
In English I heard about this
chick who used a man's name to
get her books read. She went by
George but she was really Mary
Ann? Goes, "It's never too late
to be what you might have been."
I was jus' there thinkin', is
that true? Was it too late to be
an unsolved Mystery? Alls I had
to do was walk away...
MALE VOICE (O/S)
Brigitte F.!
Brigitte looks up to see a cheap plastic Frankenstein mask
looking down at her. Its owner flips it up: it's Sam.
Brigitte's eyes snap wide open in shock.
SAM
They let me go. No evidence:
someone called in this tip.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
So I decided to stay.
BRIGITTE
Hey, you gotta get outta here -/
Ginger emerges from the bedroom like a reigning diva, and the
room stops dead.
Brigitte drops her glass of punch.
Ginger has come out as herself, as an almost full-blown
werewolf. She wears a Lill Red Riding Hood cape jobbie and a
plastic mask. She's the best looking monster you ever laid
eyes on. Down her belly she has six perfect nipples showing
and everything.
The room bursts into a_cheerinq round of applause.
GUS.' WITH 'AX IN THE HEAD'
That make-up is amazing!

GUY WITH 'EYE MISSING'
Ginger, it looks totally real!
HENRY

Told you. She's a arts-type,

PAMELA
She's very good, isn't she?
SAM
(to Brigitte)
Wow, yer sister's gone to town.
BRIGITTE
Yeah, she's gone all right. Hey.
can you do me a favor?
SAM
Sure.
BRIGITTE
Can you give somethin' to Ginger
for me? Jus' - we're Navin' a
fight, but I got this thing for
her.
SAM
Yeah, what.
Brigitte shows him what appears to be a joint. Sam takes it.
BR IG ITTE
Don't tell her I gave it to you.
Jus' act like it's from you. She
won't take it if it's from me.
SAM
Oh, okay.
BR IG ITTE
An, don't like, go any wheres
with her. Okay? Jus' come right
back, 'kay?
SAM
Gonna miss me Bee F.?
Brigitte smiles, embarrassed and freaking at the exact same
time.
SAM
Be right back.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15. 1996 98
Across the densely crowded room, Sam whispers in Ginger's
ear. Ginger smiles and nods and palms something he passes
her.
Ginger glances at Brigitte, who tries to pretend she's not
watching. when Brigitte checks again, Ginger is leading Sam
by the hand toward her bedroom. Sam looks over his shoulder
and lifts a finger - one second - back at Brigitte.
The bedroom door shuts behind them. Brigitte leaps toward
the bedroom. Someone catches her arm and holds her back.
PAMELA
one minute young lady, I could
use a little help here.
BR I G ITTE
Let go of me, I have to get
Ginger!
PAMELA
I have to get two more veggie
trays down those stairs. I
think your sister' 11 be fine for
two minutes.
Pamela is already marching Brigitte up the stairs. Brigitte
strains to get back. Looking between her mother and her
closed bedroom door, desperately.
Pamela snags Brigitte again as Brigitte dumps the veggie tray
and tries to get to the bedroom.
PAMELA
All these boys came to see you
two, least you can do is stop
hiding in your room. Honestly,
you act like someone'd forced
this party down your throat.
Now go be nice.
Pamela stands between Brigitte and the bedroom door, her arms
folded.
BRIGITTE
Mother. You don't understand.
PAMELA
Yes--I do. I was shy too at your
age. Mingle.
99
Brigitte backs away with such a dirty look on her face. She
turns to confront the eager painted faces around her - all
desperate for some female attention. Brigitte has I want to
scream written all over her face.
Sam pushes Ginger away from him. Ginger has Brigitte's gift
joint smoldering between her finger tips. Ginger is pretty
out of it, she totters.
SAM
okay, cut it out now.
GINGER
This dope's fucked. Makin' me
blaarrggh. C'mon. I'll do ya.
SAM
No thanks. Told yer sister I'd
be right back.
GINGER
What's up your ass?!
SAM
Don't get mean, s'nothin'
personal. I happen to think
Brigitte's pretty cool. and -/
GINGER
Leave my baby sister alone. Do
me, don't hurt her.
SAM
I won't hurt her. Now be a good
girl and finish up your joint.
GINGER
oh. Well fuck you.
Ginger takes a big toke as she paces between Sam and the
door. Suddenly she's coughing uncontrollably, rubbing her
eyes, wailing in pain.
GINGER
Burning! What is this?!
Sam makes a move toward her and Ginger blindly lashes out at
him. Ginger hurls Sam into the bed. Sam's flight path knocks
the mattress askew: dozens and dozens of dog collars pour
out over him. Sam fingers one in particular.
100
SAM
Morely -?!
Brigitte sits on the stairs to the main floor cornered by a
guy dressed as a cow.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Something was definitely fucked.
Brigitte eyes Pamela, who is slowly being distracted by horny
young men who will now dance with anybody, even Pamela.
COW GUY
Do you think this is a faggy
costume for a guy? You can just
say. I dunno I been gettin'
funny looks. What, like we
aren't advanced enough that a
guy can show up completely in
the spirit of the thing with an
udder, an' not get treated like
a freakin' fruit?
Brigitte looks at her watch. Pamela is dragged off into the
throng by a band of juveniles singing Do The Hustle. Brigitte
makes her move at last.
COW GUY
snob.
Brigitte makes a badly-faked would-be casual bee-line for
their bedroom door.
Brigitte wiggles the knob. It's locked.
TNT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Brigitte (still a zombie) unlocks the door and peers in. The
light is on in the bathroom, the door is ajar. The shower is
running. There are a few candles burning in corners.
otherwise the room is dark.
Brigitte steps inside, closing the door on the party behind
her. She grabs a flashlight and turns it on.
The walls are splattered with blood.
There is gore on the floor. Brigitte plucks the monkshead
joint from a pool of bloody goo - it is soaked. Useless.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 101
On the bed, Sam lays with his shirt off and his fly open.
His face is mutilated. He's missing an eye.
Brigitte creeps toward him.
Sam groans. Brigitte leaps back. she tries to speak, but her
voice isn't working. Her face transforms from horror to fury.
Then she heads to bathroom door.
TNT. ATTACHED BATH - NIGHT
BRIGITTE
You bitch!
Brigitte discovers Ginger sitting in the tub floor under the
running shower, weeping. Her eyes are swollen. Ginger is now
covered in coarse hair. The water around her is full of
blood. There is a kitchen knife next to her. Ginger's stoned
numb on the monkshood dose. She's groggy and weak.
BR IG ITTE
oh fuck !
Ginger is squeezing her now full tail at its base, where the
blood is oozing between her f..inger.s. Ginger has tried - and
tailed - to euL her tail off.
BRIGITTE
Oh no. Oh no. Fuck, fuck!
Ginger doesn't move. Ginger looks so pathetic, it's heart-
breaking. Brigitte snatches the knife away and shuts off the
water.
GINGER
Nobody'll want me now any ways.
Sc.
Brigitte takes in the cut, the rest of the monstrosity her
sister has become.
GINGER
I don't wanna do this any more.
Brigitte yanks Ginger out of the tub and grabs a towel,
frantic.
BRIGITTE
Press this on the cut! Ginger!
Move, c'mon!
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 1 02
Ginger does as she's told. Brigitte digs out gauze and tape
packages. They're both almost empty - they've used it all up.
Brigitte throws them on the floor.
GINGER
I missed you Bee. I'm sorry.
Brigitte searches Ginger's face.
BRIGITTE
Ginge'? That you in there?
Ginger cracks an uncertain, pained smile. Brigitte does too,
an exact replica, in fact.
GINGER
Ya feeb.
Brigitte gently turns Ginger around to try and deal with her
tail. Ginger is woozy and weak from blood loss.
BRIGITTE
okay. I can't clean this one up.
We have to go. Like Go, go. Can
you do it?
GINGER
I'm so woozy.
Brigitte glances out into the bedroom.
BRIGITTE
Um. Ever bite something you
din't kill?
GINGER
No.
(misinterpreting the
question - hopeful)
Wanna be one with me?
BRIGITTE
Ah. No. Sam? Isn't dead.
GINGER
Oooh nooo.
BRIGITTE
Don't worry. Keep pressing.
T'll be right back.
INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGH'T'
1 03
Sam is fingering his wounds, half-conscious, drooling bile
and blood. Brigitte (still a zombie) looms up behind him
with her baseball bat. She fishes in his pants' pocket and
withdraws a set of keys.
BRIGITTE
Hey. Sorry. I really did think
you were. Like. Not bad. So you
know, whatever. Any ways. I'm
really sorry - I have to.
Sam moans as his good eye rolls up at her. Brigitte blinks
away tears and looks away, collecting herself.
Brigitte raises the bat over her head and swings it down as
The party is rocking along. Pamela knocks on their door.
PAMELA
Girls? You in there? You're
not being very sociable...
There's no answer. She tries the knob, and is surprised to
find it unlocked. She opens the door. She turns on the
lights.
Pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere. The room is
deserted. No Sam. No sisters Fitzgerald. Just gore.
Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor.
Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife's body. The boys in
costume crowd in behind him.
HENRY
Pamela, honey, it's just a
prank, you know how they...
(he fingers some
GORE)
Holy mother of - it's warm.
Where are my kids?!!
GUY WITH AX IN THE HEAD
Ginger went in here with Sam
McDonald a while back.
HENRY
Sam McDonald?
104
GUY WITH EYE MISSING
Yeah, you know. The guy they
thought was the Beast, but they
let 'im go.
Henry steps into the room. He spots a bloody trail up to the
open ground-level window.
EXT FITZGERALD HOME - NIGHT
Tires squeal in the street and the county regreening truck
lurches out of its parking spot.
Brigitte (still a zombie) throws the truck into gear with an
amateur's hand. Her Adidas bag and her jar of two dollar
bills is on the seat next to her.
Ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the
dark back of the truck.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Plans, plans arc good. 'Course I
hardly had one. Adrenaline
though, adrenaline is pretty
speedy shit.
BRIGITTE
Ginger?! Don't eat the body
okay? I got this idea, an'
we'll need Sam.
Brigitte floors it and the truck blasts down their cul du sac
to the main road.
Brigitte slows, looking left, right and in the side mirrors
trying to see where the sirens are coming from.
BRIGITTE
Fuck, fuck fuck, FUCK.
105
Then suddenly, four cop cars blast past them in the opposite
direction. Heading back to the Fitzgerald house.
BRIGITTE
Ha! All rightie then.
Brigitte drives on.
What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses
of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street
lamps. Her final spurt of transformation is taking place:
FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur.
FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen.
FLASH! Her face pulls into a wet snout.
FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white
fangs.
Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill. The lights
of the homes below them creep into view.
BRIGITTE
okay, Ginger? They'll think that
Sam took us from our room,
right? 'Cause of his record an,
the arrest, right? We're gonna
make this look like he did, any
ways. He got us, maybe killed
us, took our bodies to do some
unspeakable thingy. But then?
Sam killed himself. You follow?
Ginger doesn't answer.
106
BRIGITTE
So boom, diversion. Meanwhile
you an, me hit the highway. we
can hitch, get you cleaned up.
By the time the find out we
weren't in Sam's clutches at
all, we could be any wheres.
Yeah? Whatcha think?
Ginger doesn't answer.
BRIGITTE
It'll work. (I hope.)
Brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine.
BRIGITTE
Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin'
trail much? Could leave
everybody a fuckin' map...
Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and
trees, shovel ready. we can hear panting and growling.
BRIGITTE
I won't hurt you if you don't
hurt me. 'Kay? Ginge'? 'Kay?
Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she
approaches it.
It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed. Her head and tail
are bleeding. Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her
sister, frantic with grief.
BRIGITTE
Oh no. Ginger. I didn't mean
TO
It/Ginger is gasping, fading. Her eyes start rolling back in
her head. Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but
can't touch her. Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly.
Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning.
BRIGITTE
You can't, you can't, we're out.
You can't, don't don't do this
to me. Not now. Look, look it's
all taken care of. we're
Unsolved Mysteries!
