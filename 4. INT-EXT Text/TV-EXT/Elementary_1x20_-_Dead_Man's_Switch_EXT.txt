  As Sherlock and Joan approach the front door, they HEAR Bach s 
  Cello Suite No. 1 emanating from a window.  Sherlock rings the 
  doorbell and the music stops.  A beat, and then the front door 
  opens to reveal EVA (19, lovely but fragile).  ELEMENTARY - EP. 119 - "DEAD MAN'S SWITCH" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3/04/13     4.

                    Sherlock Holmes, Joan Watson.  
                    We re here to see Darren Whitman.

                    by. 

  She opens the door wider.  Sherlock and Joan enter --


  We WATCH THROUGH A WINDSHIELD as a WEASELY MAN (50s) steps out 
  the front door of a RUNDOWN HOME.  He looks both ways as he 
  locks the door, but doesn t glance in  our  direction.  

                                  JOAN (O.C.)
                    You think that s our blackmailer. 

  ANOTHER ANGLE finds Joan behind the wheel of this parked RENTAL 
  CAR.  Sherlock sits beside her.  And as he watches the man...  ELEMENTARY - EP. 119 - "DEAD MAN'S SWITCH" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3/04/13     8.

                    My tech expert across the pond was *
                    able to trace the account number in 
                    the note to that man and this 
                    address.   Charles Augustus 
                      Milverton.   

  Joan watches as MILVERTON makes his way down the sidewalk. 

                                  JOAN
                    He certainly looks the part.
                          (then)
                    I m just a little surprised how 
                    easy it was to find him...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I can only assume he s quite 
                    confident in the protection his 
                       failsafe  affords him.   Harm or 
                    molest me in any way, my associate 
                    will expose your secrets in my 
                    stead.   That s why I ll leave his 
                    home exactly as I find it this 
                    evening.  
                          (checks an assortment of 
                              LOCK-PICKING TOOLS)
                    I ll assess the threat he poses and 
                    attempt to divine the identity of 
                    his accomplice.  Once both 
                      individuals are known to us, we ll 
                    destroy their blackmail troves 
                      simultaneously.  

  They WATCH as Milverton ROUNDS A CORNER and DISAPPEARS.  And as 
  Sherlock tucks a BLUETOOTH DEVICE into his ear...

                                  JOAN
                      Obviously, he s in bed with Brett 
                    Garvey, right?  How else would he 
                    have gotten his hands on that 
                    video?

                    Perhaps we ll know shortly. 

  And as he EXITS the car --


  Sherlock dials Joan as he moves to Milverton s front door.  
  Drops his phone into his pocket and pulls out his tools.  And as 
  Joan ANSWERS --

  Sherlock defeats the lock in seconds.  And as he ENTERS --


  Alfredo waits, leaning up against his car as Sherlock and Joan 
  approach.  His disappointment is obvious as he explains --

                    Right after I texted you, he hopped 
                    in a cab.  I tried to tail him but 
                    I lost him in traffic.

                      Description?

                    Tall.  Six feet, maybe.  Grey hair.  
                    Mustache.  Double-breasted suit.  
                    Cowboy boots.

  Sherlock and Joan trade a glance:  Cowboy boots?

                    It s weird.  There was something 
                    about the guy...

                                  SHERLOCK

                    Something familiar.  Like I knew

                    From what? 

                                    ALFREDO
                    Dunno.  Maybe I saw him at a 
                    meeting.  Maybe I stole his car 
                    back in the day.

                          (wheels turning)
                    You said cowboy boots, right? 

  Alfredo nods.  Joan pulls out her phone and starts typing, but 
  Sherlock doesn t notice.  He s too focused on Alfredo.

                    And you watched late-night TV?

                                    ALFREDO
                    Of course.

                          (when Sherlock nods)
                    Why not Robert Pistone?  He killed

                    The bruise on Bloom s chest would
