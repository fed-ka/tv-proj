      reading the paper.

                  Hold it!

      Creed holds the door as Dwight jogs on.  Dwight is wearing 
      formal tuxedo tails and a top hat, and he carries two tin 
      buckets of dirt.  Creed looks him over.

      Dwight enters and Erin sees his outfit.  

                                    ERIN
                    Dwight, wonderful!  So funny.  It s 
                  only nine a.m. and already you ve put 
                  two smiles on my face -- one when I 
                  first saw you just now, and now.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I am dressed according to the Schrute 
                  codes of mourning.  
                          (to room)
                  My Aunt Shirley has died.

      Erin keeps her smile but it becomes very confused.  People 
      look over.

                                    PAM
                  I m sorry, Dwight.  Were you close?

                                    DWIGHT
                    I would say that she raised me but 
                  let s not kid each other, I raised 
                    myself.  She was, however, the 
                    closest thing I had to a mother.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/122.

                  My actual mother was very cold and 
                    distant.  I d say she was the closest

                  Well, my condolences.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Keep them.

                                    JIM
                  Okay, and the pails?

                                    DWIGHT
                  As with Schrute custom, I will now 
                  either invite you to Saturday s 
                    funeral by sprinkling fertile, red 
                  dirt in your face, or ask you to keep 
                    a respectful distance during my time 
                  of grief with a dusting of black, 
                    slightly acidic soil.

      He tosses black dirt in Erin s face.

                                    ERIN
                  What color is it?

                                    PHYLLIS
                  It looks pretty black.

                                    ERIN
                  Oh.

      Erin bows respectfully and then leans away from Dwight.  
      Dwight heads towards accounting, passing Phyllis at the 
      copier.  He tosses some black dirt in her face.  She wants to 
      protest but holds herself back.

      Dwight tosses black dirt in Meredith s face, then Kevin s -- 
      who can t help but take a taste.

                                    KEVIN
                  That s acidic alright.

      Dwight gets to Angela.  She holds out her face for him.  He 
      considers, then gives her the black dirt.  He then turns to 
      Oscar, who notices that Dwight is reaching for black dirt.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/123.

                  Oh thank god.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Excuse me?  What was that?

                                    OSCAR
                    Nothing.  Just, I m not free

                                    DWIGHT
                  What do you have to do?

                  I have a personal training session.

                  I m very sorry about that, I ll of 
                  course be there if you want... it s 
                  just the sessions are prepaid and if 
                  you want to take that into account--

      Dwight cuts him off by throwing red dirt in his face.

                  I get red dirt?  Nobody s getting the 
                  red dirt!

      B-roll:  Dwight goes around the office tossing black dirt in 
      everyone s face.  As he progresses he does it with a flourish.  
      Over the shoulder at Andy, behind the back at Darryl, with a 
      big wind up and then great caution at Stanley.

                    I should have kept my mouth shut,

      RETURN TO SCENE

      Dwight now approaches Jim, and stands in front of him for a 
      beat.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/124.


                                    JIM
                  This is a tradition, huh?

      Dwight nods as he grabs a big handful of dirt.

                                    JIM (CONT D)
                  I did mention I am sorry for your 
                  loss.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Yes, thank you.

      Dwight starts packing the dirt in a tight ball.  Jim eyes it.

                                    JIM
                  I m sure she is in a better place 
                  now.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I like to think so.

      Dwight adds a little water (from a nearby bottle) to the dirt 
      ball to make it harder, and then adds more dirt.

                                    JIM
                  Dude, this isn t cool.  You can t 
                  throw-

                                    DWIGHT
                  God I miss her...
                          (emotional)
                  I miss her so much.

      Jim grits his teeth, and Dwight nails him in the face.

      Dwight heads to his car, tossing the pails of dirt aside and 
      ripping off his tux.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Not a bad custom.  I should tell the 
                  other Schrutes, something like this 
                  could really catch on.

                  How would anybody know that?  Think, 
                  okay?  On any given day one could be 
                  colder than the other, you can t just 
                  say a blanket statement like that.

                  Boston is colder.

                  Zeke, empty the pillows, now.

      Zeke runs off.  Dwight again offers keys, and again Mr. Haskin 
      does not take it.  Dwight is getting frustrated.

                  Sorry to make such a big deal about 
                  it.  It s just a fatal allergy so we 
                  have to be extra careful.

      Dwight looks caught, waits for them to turn away, then starts 
      looking frantically for a fax.  He does not find it.

      A lawyer, standing by the tv, speaks to the room.

                  Before you disperse -- I m Dipido 
                  Smith, the Schrute Family lawyer.  
                  I ve been asked by the deceased to 
                  play this short video that she made.  
                    I haven t seen it myself, so we ll 
                  see together if it s any good.

      He presses play.  AUNT SHIRLEY comes up on the tv screen.  She 
      is in bed.

                                    AUNT SHIRLEY
                  Thank you for coming to my funeral.  
                  I want you all to have a nice time.  
                  Have a drink, get something delicious 
                  to eat.

      People look around to the meager display of food -- a tray of 
      Oreos and a carton of milk.  Dwight shrugs it off.

                  I came to this country to escape the

                    I don t want to see our place farmed 
                  by some corporation.  Cows don t even

                  back to live here and work it, full 
                  time.  Heinrich, if they agree you 
                  get nothing, but you can stay until 
                  you die.  So there you have it, call

      Shirley eats, forgetting about her video.  Dwight, Fannie and

      Fannie and Cameron are playing cards, Jeb is reading the 
      paper.  Dwight enters.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Okay, let s do this.  Let s run 
                    Shirley s farm.  We should probably 
                  start by surveying the land for beet 
                    weevils. 

      Fannie, Jeb and Cameron exchange glances.  Heinrich tries to 
      listen in on their conversation.

                                    FANNIE
                    Dwight, no way.  I m not moving back 
                  here.

                  Cause I hate farms, I m not a fan of

                  had left us a flat in Paris instead, 
                  well that would be something.

                    either, D.  But I also don t want to

      prepares a tray of snacks for them (wine and cheese, etc).

                  he can get us to stay, do you?

                    I should kick his ass.

                  Why should you kick his ass?

                    I don t know.  For putting his needs

                                    FANNIE
                    Alright.  But you could just say 
                  that.  Why is violence part of it?

                                    JEB
                  Maybe I meant that I would kick his 
                  ass verbally.  I would say something 
                    cutting.

                                    DWIGHT
                    Really?  How could you have figured 
                  that out?  Because I said what I am

      Dwight walks away with the tray, heading to Fannie s table.  
      He is intercepted by the Haskins.

                  I can give them a tour, Dwight.

                                    FANNIE
                  I ll do it with you.  It might be fun 
                  to look around after all these years.

      Dwight realizes there might be something here.

      DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

                                    DWIGHT
                    I usually walk into something like 
                  this with a plan, often a dastardly 
                  one.  But something underhanded will 
                  come to me, it always does.



      Shot low, we see feet emerge from a room, wearing hunting 
      socks. (We now start to hear James Taylor s acoustic version 
      of  Oh What a Beautiful Morning. )



      As the feet reveal the man, we see Dwight coming down the 
      stairs, wearing overalls and looking tired and grumpy.



      Dwight walks to the door and begins to put his work boots on.

                                    CAMERON (O.S.)
                  What are you doing?

      REVEAL Cameron, who sits in the mostly dark room reading from 
      an tiny book light attached to his book.  Cameron is wearing 
      button down Brooks Brothers pajamas and robe, with Uggs.  
      Dwight looks him over and sighs at the sight.

                                    DWIGHT
                    Chores.  What are you doing up?

                                    CAMERON
                  It s a peaceful time to read, or 
                  muse.  What chores?

      Dwight puts on a headband flashlight.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I m not your tour guide.

      Dwight walks out.  Cameron considers, then begins to follow 
      Dwight out.  He takes a headlamp from a hook by the door.



      Dwight begins to lead a goat onto a small platform, and puts 
      its head and neck in a wooden vice.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1231.


                                    CAMERON
                  Is that a guillotine? 

                                    DWIGHT
                  What?  Oh.  That d be cool.  No, this 
                  is for milking.

                                    CAMERON
                  That s a cow?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Have you never seen a Nigerian Dwarf 
                  goat?  And have you never seen a cow?

                                    CAMERON
                  What are you doing now?

                                    DWIGHT
                    Checking the teat for feces.

                                    CAMERON
                  Right.  And?

      Dwight doesn t answer.  He does a squirt into a bucket, then 
      sifts it around like wine.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                  What are you doing now?

                                    DWIGHT
                    Checking the strip milk.

                                    CAMERON
                  Good strip milk?

      Dwight looks up at Cameron, and Cameron looks back at him.  
      They are lit mostly by each other s head lamp.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Come here.  Put a hand on each teat.

      Cameron does, kind of boyishly excited.

                    Squeeze it out, top to bottom.

      Nothing.

                  Use some muscle.

      And, milk.  Cameron is psyched.  He continues to pump.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1232.


                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Is it going alright?

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t know.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Is the udder hot?  Is the milk 
                    clumpy?  Are there bumps or sores on 
                  the udder?

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t know any of that.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Gimme.  You suck at this.

      Dwight takes over again.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Didn t your father teach you 
                    anything?

                                    CAMERON
                    I never met him.

      Dwight says nothing.



      Dwight now looks at nests.

                                    CAMERON
                  How do you know where the eggs are?

                                    DWIGHT
                  You look.

      Dwight shoos away a hen.

                                    CAMERON
                  Is it dangerous to take their eggs in 
                  front of them?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Yes.  Stand back, these are killer 
                    chickens.

                                    CAMERON
                  I was just asking you something I 
                  didn t know.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1233.


                                    DWIGHT
                  Which is fine and you learned 
                    something, but it was a stupid 
                    question so you re going to get made 
                  fun of a little.  

      Cameron considers, then sees a nest off to the side.  He shoos 
      away a hen and collects an egg.  

                                    CAMERON
                  We re going to eat these today?

                                    DWIGHT
                  If you want.

                                    CAMERON
                  Mom said that nothing is as good as a 
                  fresh farm egg.

      Cameron keeps hunting for eggs, as we see that Dwight has 
      stopped in his tracks.  The wheels are spinning.

                                    DWIGHT
                  She said that, huh?



      Dwight, Mose and Zeke cook up a storm.  (Mose is cutting up a 
      giant side of beef.)

                                    ZEKE
                  Did you find the fax with the 
                    Haskins  allergies?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Nope.

      Dwight peers into the living room, where Jeb is watching 
      television.  He looks a bit stunned.  Dwight smiles to himself 
      and continues cooking.



      Jeb is watching the news.  On TV:  DEA agents haul duffel bags 
      of marijuana onto a truck.

                  The scene was incredible, John.  The 
                    biggest raid in years, as police 
                    confiscated over six tons of 
                    marijuana. 

      We see footage of migrant workers running through the fields, 
      being pursued by DEA agents.

                  It s unknown how many workers have 
                  been detained, but officials say the 
                  land has been confiscated and the 
                  fields will be burned.

      Fannie and Cameron walk past, towards the dining room.

      Fannie and Cameron enter to find the tables set very nicely, 
      tablecloths and everything.  Fannie is surprised.  Dwight is 
      arranging a small centerpiece of flowers.

                                    FANNIE
                  Oh, my.

                  there.

                  He got, like four eggs.

                                    CAMERON
                  It s a different number.  Did you use

      Zeke comes in again and sets down food for Fannie.  As he 
      does, Dwight narrates:

      The Haskins look at Fannie s food longingly.  Jeb enters and 
      joins Fannie s table.

                  Ah, you know, I ve been thinking.  
                  Being around this place, that s what 
                  it s all about.  Maybe I ve had 
                  enough of California.  And I don t 
                  care about money.  This is home.  

                                    DWIGHT
                    I know, right?  Looks like the two of 
                  us are on board.  Too bad about 
                    Fannie.  Unless...?

                                    FANNIE
                  No.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Sure, sure.  No pressure.  Do you 
                    remember Shirley s recipe for 
                    Sauerkraut? That was a taste of 
                    growing up, huh?

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Didn t you just say that you only had 
                  rice growing up?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Would you want me listening into one 
                  of your private conversations, sir?

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  You were standing right here.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I was facing the other way.  Eat your 
                  rice.  Yum.

                          (calling to kitchen)
                  Bring the kraut!

      Dwight takes out a photo of Aunt Shirley (a screen capture 
      from the video.)

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Fanns, as you enjoy the sauerkraut 
                  and horseradish -- Zeke, the 
                    horseraddish -- I thought we might 
                  take a moment to speak to Aunt 
                    Shirley.

                                    FANNIE
                  Don t do this.  

                                    DWIGHT
                    Shirls...

                                    FANNIE
                  This is too soon.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I just think she has a right to hear 
                  it straight from you why you won t 
                  grant her a simple dying wish.  No 
                  big deal.  Except, yes, it is a big 
                  deal.

      Fannie stares daggers at Dwight, who slowly begins to realize 
      that this was a bad move.  After a beat, Zeke brings in Jeb s 
      breakfast.  

                                    ZEKE
                  Eggs, bacon, biscuits and steak okay?

                                    JEB
                    That ll do.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Oh for god sakes!

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  Honey, you haven t even tried the 
                  rice.

      Dwight addresses the photo.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Aunt Sh, my love, I respect your 
                  dying wish, and so does Jeb -- may I 
                  speak for you?  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1240.


                                    JEB
                  Please do.

                                    DWIGHT
                  And so does Jeb.  But Fannie has 
                    something to say.

                                    FANNIE
                    Cameron, get in the car.

      Fannie exits.  Dwight goes after her but Mr. Haskin stops him.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                    Dwight, I was a history minor at 
                    Columbia University.  I also took a 
                    sociology class.  Where am I going 
                  with this?  I realize local cultures 
                  have their own culinary traditions- 

                                    DWIGHT
                  Eat whatever you want.

      Dwight starts putting the food from Fannie s table on the 
      Haskins  table.  (Cameron grabs the basket of muffins for 
      himself.)
