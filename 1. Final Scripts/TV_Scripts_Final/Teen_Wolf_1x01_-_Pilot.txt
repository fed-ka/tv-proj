      FADE IN:

      EXT. BEACON HILLS - NIGHT

      On the rural outskirts of a small California town called 
      Beacon Hills, POLICE OFFICERS and STATE TROOPERS gather on a 
      dirt road. At their sides, SEARCH DOGS bark and whine, 
      pulling their leashes taut.

      One by one, the Officers click on flashlights and then glance 
      to the LEAD OFFICER for his signal. Finally, he gives a nod. 
      Seconds later, a dozen streaks of light tear through the 
      shadowy woods. 

      A desperate search begun...

      EXT. MCCALL HOME - NIGHT

      Not far from those dense woods, a two-story home lies hidden 
      under a canopy of trees. A gentle wind drifts into the open 
      window of an upstairs bedroom where--

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT

      TWO HANDS thread the laces on the head of a lacrosse stick. 
      The work is fast and precise, fingers pulling each lace into 
      a diamond mesh pattern. Knotting the last loop, sixteen year-
      old SCOTT McCALL stands with the re-threaded stick.

      Dressed in only a pair of athletic shorts, his lithe frame 
      may still have some filling out to do but it s easy to see 
      that he ll soon grow into a strikingly handsome young man 
      with deep black eyes designed to melt the hearts of hopeful 
      young girls.

      Scooping a ball up from his bedroom floor, he gives the 
      lacrosse stick a spin, testing his handiwork.

      A moment later, the re-threaded stick lands next to a school 
      backpack while--

      Scott pumps out a few chin-ups at the bar mounted in the 
      doorway of his closet.

      Then, toothbrush in his mouth, he reaches for the window sill 
      to pull it down. But he stops when he hears a SOUND. He cocks 
      his ear to listen again. Under the whispering wind, he hears 
      MOVEMENT... A STRANGE SHUFFLING NOISE.                                                                                      2.



      INT. MCCALL HOME/HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Scott silently slips into the hallway and peers into another 
      bedroom. His mother, MELISSA McCALL, late thirties, both 
      remarkably strong and remarkably beautiful, sleeps over the 
      covers of the bed, fully clothed as if she d just passed out 
      after having walked in. Scott eases her door shut as--

      EXT. MCCALL HOME - NIGHT

      The glass door to the porch slides open. Now armed with a 
      BASEBALL BAT, Scott starts for the yard. Breath held tight, 
      he moves cautiously off the porch steps.

      THE SOUND OF MOVEMENT stops him cold. 

      Holding still, he peers left and right as he white-knuckles 
      the bat, ready to swing. When his eyes wander up to the side 
      of house he sees--

      A DARK FIGURE climbing the vine-wrapped TRELLIS. Before Scott 
      even knows what s happening, the figure BREAKS free and comes 
      HURTLING toward him.

      Scott HOLLERS in terror as an upside down face appears in 
      front of him. He almost swings the bat before realizing who 
      it is.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, what the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  STILES
                    You weren t answering your phone.

      Feet caught in the trellis, STILES hangs in front of Scott. A 
      sixteen year-old with boundless energy, he continues talking 
      upside down as if this were a perfectly normal way to have a 
      conversation.

                                  STILES (CONT'D)
                    I know it s late, but you gotta  
                    hear this. I saw my dad leave 
                    twenty minutes ago. Dispatch 
                    called. They re bringing in every 
                    officer from the Beacon department 
                    and even State Police.

                                  SCOTT
                    For what?                                                                                      3.



                                  STILES
                    Two joggers found a body in the 
                    woods.

                                  SCOTT
                    A dead body?

                                  STILES
                    No, a body of water. Yes, dumbass, 
                    a dead body.

      Reaching up to pull himself free of the trellis, he lands on 
      his feet in front of Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    You mean like murdered?

                                  STILES
                    Nobody knows yet. Just that it was 
                    a girl, probably in her twenties.

                                  SCOTT 
                    Hold on. If they found a body, what 
                    are they looking for now?

                                  STILES
                    That s the best part. They only 
                    found half.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS PRESERVE - NIGHT

      A beat-up jeep skids to a halt just beyond the heavily wooded 
      entrance to the Beacon Hills Preserve. Stiles gets out with a 
      flashlight in hand. Scott follows, hurrying to keep up with 
      him as he charges into the hiking paths.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are we seriously doing this?

                                  STILES
                    You re the one always bitching that 
                    nothing ever happens in this town. 
                    Besides, it s our last night of 
                    summer freedom.

                                  SCOTT
                    I was trying to get a good night s 
                    sleep for practice tomorrow.

                                  STILES
                    Right, because sitting on the bench 
                    is such a grueling effort.                                                                                      4.



                                  SCOTT
                    No, because I m playing this year. 
                    In fact, I m going to make starting 
                    lineup.

                                  STILES
                    That s the spirit. Everyone should 
                    have a dream. Even a pathetically 
                      unrealistic one.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just out of curiosity, which half 
                    of the body are we looking for?

                                  STILES 
                    Huh. I didn t even think about 
                    that.

                                  SCOTT
                    And what if whoever killed the girl 
                    is still out here?

                                  STILES
                    Also something I didn t think 
                    about.

                                  SCOTT
                      Comforting to know you ve planned 
                    this out with your usual attention 
                    to detail.

      Racing up the paths, Scott s breath begins to shorten.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Maybe the severe asthmatic should 
                    be the one holding the flashlight.

      Stiles slows, but not because of Scott. Outside a clearing, 
      YELLOW POLICE TAPE marks off a perimeter under FLOODLIGHTS.

      Grinning, Stiles looks to Scott who can t help but smile 
      back. Crouching low, they circle the crime scene looking for 
      the best vantage point. But they freeze at the sound of a 
      ZIPPER being pulled up on a BODY BAG. TWO BARE FEET are 
      momentarily visible as the zipper pulls closed and OFFICERS 
      lift the body bag up into the Medical Examiner s van.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Is that the second half of the 
                    body?                                                                                      5.



                                  STILES
                    No, they would have called off the 
                    search. Come on.

      He and Scott retreat from the perimeter back into the dark of 
      the woods. As they crest a hill, Stiles pauses. Below, 
      FLASHLIGHT BEAMS scour the shadows, the police search just 
      ahead. Unable to stand still, Stiles races forward.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, wait up!

      But quickly running out of air, Scott pulls his inhaler from 
      his jacket. While he pauses to take a hit from it, Stiles 
      disappears up ahead. Then, realizing he s left Scott behind, 
      he slows to look back when--

      BARKING spins him around.

      FANGED TEETH SNAP FEROCIOUSLY at him, sending him staggering 
      away and falling right onto his ass. SEARCH DOGS yank back 
      against their leashes just before tearing him apart.

                                  STATE TROOPER
                    Stay right there!

      Scott freezes. It s not him the State Trooper was yelling at, 
      however. Peering out from behind a tree, he sees Stiles has 
      run right into a search party. Flashlight beams in his eyes, 
      the boy puts his hands in the air as large, threatening 
      figures hurry forward.

                                  DEPUTY STILINSKI (O.S.)
                    Hold on, hold on, this little 
                      delinquent belongs to me.

      DEPUTY STILINSKI steps into the light past the GROWLING 
      search dogs. Stiles shrinks under his glare.

                                  DEPUTY STILINSKI (CONT'D)
                    Do you listen in on all of my phone 
                    calls?

                                  STILES
                    No... Not the boring ones.

                                  DEPUTY STILINSKI
                    And where s your usual partner in 
                    crime?                                                                                      6.



                                  STILES
                    Who? Scott? Scott s home. Said he 
                    wanted to get a good night s sleep 
                    for the first day back at school.

                                  DEPUTY STILINSKI 
                          (calling out)
                    Scott? You out there?

      Hidden in the shadows, Scott doesn t move.

                                  DEPUTY STILINSKI (CONT'D)
                          (still clearly suspicious)
                    All right, young man, I m taking 
                    you back to your car and we re 
                    going to discuss a little something 
                    called Invasion of Privacy.

      Watching Stiles get escorted away, Scott steps out from the 
      cover of the trees with an irritated sigh.

      Starting back, he tries to find his way out of the woods, but 
      with each step it becomes increasingly difficult to see in 
      the pitch black.

      At a fork in the path, he pauses in confusion. He s about to 
      start off down one direction when he hears--

      A RUSTLING among the trees. 

      Scott holds still. Breath tightening more from fear than 
      asthma, he reaches into his pocket for his INHALER when--

      He hears an odd RUMBLING. The sound of sudden and furious 
      movement RISING in volume and velocity until--

      HALF A DOZEN DEER CHARGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS, soaring past 
      him with the thunderous BEAT of hooves trampling the ground.

      Startled, Scott DROPS THE INHALER. 

      Then, once again alone in the dark, he kneels down to the 
        leaf-covered ground to search for the inhaler. Pulling out 
      his cell phone, he LIGHTS the display.

      Guiding the phone s LIGHT over the ground, Scott doesn t find 
      his inhaler but does manage to briefly illuminate-- 

      A FACE.

      Dead eyes peer up from the pale, yet beautiful face of a 
      young woman torn in half.                                                                                      7.



      CRYING OUT IN SHOCK, Scott lurches up, tripping on his own 
      feet and tumbling over the unearthed roots of a tree. 
      Suddenly, he s propelled down a leaf-covered slope, rolling 
      head over heels right into--

      A CREEK BED.

      Pushing himself up from the icy water, a breathless Scott 
      looks up at the embankment down which he just fell. He s 
      about to stand when--

      A LOW GROWL stops him moving. Stops him breathing. Something 
      crouches in the shadows right near him. Something very large. 

      Scott slowly begins to turn around when--A SHAPE HURTLES 
      TOWARD HIM.

      For the briefest instant there s a flash of razor-sharp 
      teeth. Scott twists forward, CRYING OUT. Then, seeming to 
      disentangle himself from the attacking animal, he scrambles 
      back to his feet and into a panicked run. 

      Whipping through branches tearing at his skin and clothes, he 
      races blindly through the forest until he reaches--

      A BARBED WIRE FENCE.

      With barely a second to coordinate his effort, Scott lurches 
      over the wire, shirt catching and tearing across the barbs.

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

      Crashing out of the woods and into the road, Scott whirls 
      around to face AN ONCOMING CAR. The driver swerves, almost 
      clipping him. HORN BLARING, the car hurtles past.

      Breathless, Scott backs away from the woods. With the world 
      spinning around him, dark blood sticks his tattered shirt to 
      his back over--A DEEP AND VICIOUS LOOKING BITE.

      Struggling for calm, he whips around when he hears the 
      strangest sound.

      THE HOWLING OF A WOLF.

      It echoes through the hills, over the trees, across the 
      rooftops and into the night...

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                      8.


                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

      INT. BEACON HILLS HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY

      A SCHOOL BELL RINGS in the crowded hallway. At their lockers, 
      Scott takes off his backpack and pulls his shirt up a few 
      inches to show Stiles the BANDAGE on his lower back.

                                  SCOTT
                    It was too dark to see much but I m 
                    pretty sure it was a wolf.

                                  STILES
                    A wolf bit you? No, not a chance.

                                  SCOTT
                    I heard a wolf howling.

                                  STILES
                    No, you didn t.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you mean  No, I didn t?  
                    How do you know what I heard?

                                  STILES
                      California doesn t have wolves. Not  
                    for the last sixty years.

                                  SCOTT
                    Really?

                                  STILES
                    Yes, really. There are no wolves in 
                      California.

                                  SCOTT
                    Well, if you don t believe me about 
                    the wolf, then you re definitely 
                    not going to believe me when I tell 
                    you I saw the body.

                                  STILES
                    You what? Are you kidding me?

                                  SCOTT
                    I wish. I m going to have 
                      nightmares about it for a month.                                                                                      9.



                                  STILES
                    That s freaking awesome. This is 
                    seriously the best thing that s 
                    happened to this town since...
                          (looking past Scott)
                    ...since the birth of Lydia Sayers 
                    who s walking toward us right now.

      A drop-dead gorgeous junior named LYDIA SAYERS walks the 
      corridor like it was a fashion show runway in Milan.

                                  STILES (CONT'D)
                    Hey Lydia, how are you? You look--

      She walks right past.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    ...like you re going to ignore me.
                          (at Scott s laugh)
                    You re the cause of this, you know. 
                    Dragging me down to your nerd 
                    depths. I m a nerd by association. 
                    I ve been Scarlet-nerded by you.

      Blending into the crowd, they head into--

      INT. BEACON HILLS HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY

      First period English. Scott takes the desk next to Stiles as 
      the teacher, MR. CURTIS walks in.

                                  MR. CURTIS
                    As you all know by now, there was 
                    indeed a body found in the woods 
                    last night. I m sure your eager 
                    little minds are coming up with all 
                    sorts of macabre scenarios as to 
                    how it happened but I ve been told 
                    that the police have a suspect in 
                    custody.

      Scott looks to Stiles who shrugs, news to him as well.

                                  MR. CURTIS (CONT'D)
                    A vagrant with a long history of 
                      psychiatric disorders was 
                      discovered camping out in the woods 
                    near where the body was found. 
                    Which means your undivided 
                    attention can be given to the 
                    syllabus outlining the semester on 
                    your desks. Read it now. And by 
                    read I don t mean skim.                                                                                    10.



      THE SOUND of paper pages flipping RUMBLES toward Scott as 
      students start reading. It s strangely loud, causing his ears 
      to twitch. Especially when--

      A CELL PHONE RINGS.

      He glances up. The other students quietly read the syllabus. 
      Scott appears to be the only one noticing the RINGING. Gazing 
      about, he can t seem to find the source until his eyes fall 
      on the WINDOWS of the classroom...

      OUTSIDE - across the quad, Scott sees ALLISON ARGENT. Sixteen 
      and radiating with an innocent beauty. When she puts a cell 
      phone to her ear, it becomes obvious that, despite the closed 
      windows and the distance, this is the RINGING Scott is 
      somehow able to hear.

      More astonishingly, Scott can hear both Allison and her 
      caller, their VOICES echoing with a tinny effect.

                                    ALLISON
                    Mom, three calls on my first day is 
                    a little overdoing it.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (V.O.)
                    Just making sure you re there okay 
                    and you ve got everything you need.

      But Allison digs through her bag, becoming alarmed.

                                    ALLISON
                      Everything except a pen. Oh my God, 
                    I didn t actually forget a pen.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (V.O.)
                    Don t panic. I m sure you can 
                    borrow one from another student.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay, okay, I gotta  go. Love ya.

      Unable to take his eyes off the extraordinary girl, Scott 
      watches the school s PRINCIPAL join her on the steps.

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.

      The Principal guides her across the quad, their conversation 
      becoming clearer to Scott with every step.

                                  PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                    So you were saying San Francisco 
                    isn t where you grew up?                                                                                    11.



                                    ALLISON
                    No, but we stayed for more than a 
                    year which is unusual in my family. 
                    We kind of bounce around a lot 
                    because of my Dad s work.

      Even when Allison and the Principal disappear from view, 
      Scott hears the CLATTER of the building door opening, the 
      CLICKING of their heels on the tile floor of the hall.

                                  PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
                    Well, hopefully, Beacon Hills is 
                    your last stop for a while.

      The door opens, causing the rest of the class to look up.

                                  PRINCIPAL (CONT D)
                    Class, this is our new student 
                    Allison Argent. Please do your best 
                    to make her feel welcome.

      Scott barely breathes as Allison heads for the one empty desk 
      left in the room. Right behind him. 

      She puts her notebook down, then glances up to see Scott 
      turned toward her. Holding out a PEN. With a relieved but 
      curious smile, she takes it from him.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks.

      Scott gives her a nod. Turning around, his gaze FOCUSES on 
      Stiles s desk where his friend s SUNGLASSES sit. In the 
      MIRRORED LENSES Scott can see Allison reflected behind him 
      and he can t take his eyes off her.

                                  MR. CURTIS
                    Okay, let s begin with Kafka...

      INT. BEACON HILLS HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY

      Silence. Then the doors of the cafeteria push open. As Scott 
      steps in, the cacophony of high school lunch period SLAMS 
      into him. Every sound assaults him with pin-drop clarity.

                                  STILES
                    You all right?

        Overwhelmed, Scott doesn t even hear Stiles. His hands come 
      up to his ears to cover them when--

      He sees ALLISON across the room, paying for her food.                                                                                     12.



      The CASHIER breaks a roll of quarters, but the coins spill to 
      the floor. Scott hears each one PLINK against the tile.

      Allison immediately kneels to help the embarrassed Cashier, 
      giving a good-hearted smile to the grateful woman while the 
      other students just stand by waiting impatiently.

      Then Allison notices Scott and they connect eyes. Somehow 
      just this look from her seems to return his hearing to 
      normal. She starts to smile back, recognizing him. But then 
      Lydia Sayers swoops in front of her.

                                  LYDIA
                    That jacket is absolutely killer. 
                    Where did you get it?

                                    ALLISON
                    My Mom was a buyer for a boutique 
                    back in San Francisco.

                                  LYDIA
                    You re sitting with me.

      Taking Allison by the arm, she guides her to the popular 
      table. JACKSON, Lydia s boyfriend, pulls her toward his lap, 
      but she brushes him off, still talking to Allison.

      A few tables away, Scott sits with Stiles and their friend 
      Rebecca Harlowe, better known as HARLEY.

                                  HARLEY
                    Can somebody tell me how New Girl 
                    is here all of five minutes and 
                    she s already at Lydia s table?

                                  STILES
                    Because she s hot. Beautiful people 
                    herd together.

                                  HARLEY
                    Is that why Lydia isn t herding 
                    with you?

                                  STILES
                    Lydia s a long term project, okay? 
                    And trust me, I ve got all the 
                    patience in the world for a high 
                    yield investment like her.

                                  HARLEY
                    Well, I don t think New Girl s that 
                    pretty. Scott, you think she s 
                    pretty? Scott?                                                                                    13.



      He doesn t even blink, attention consumed by Allison.

                                  STILES
                    I d take that as a yes.

      Head cocked slightly, Scott TUNES in the conversation across 
      the room, VOICES coming into focus.

                                    ALLISON
                    A party?

                                  SENIOR
                    Friday night. We could go together.

                                    ALLISON
                    I can t. It s Family Night this 
                    Friday. But thanks for asking.

                                  SENIOR
                    You sure? Everyone s going after 
                    the scrimmage game.

                                    ALLISON
                    You mean like football?

                                    JACKSON
                    Football is a joke at Beacon. The 
                    sport here is Lacrosse. We won the 
                    state championship the last three 
                    years--

                                  LYDIA
                          (re: Jackson)
                    Because of a certain team captain.

                                    JACKSON
                    Every season starts with a 
                    scrimmage to decide the new first 
                    string. You ever watch Lacrosse?

                                    ALLISON
                    I m actually not sure how it s 
                    played other than--well, violently.

      Stiles notices Scott watching Lydia s table intently. Not 
      merely staring, but seeming to listen.

                                    JACKSON
                    Maybe you should just come see for 
                    yourself. We have practice today. 
                    You don t have to be anywhere right 
                    after school, do you?                                                                                    14.



                                    ALLISON
                    Well, no--

                                  LYDIA
                    Perfect. You re coming.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY

      A WHISTLE BLOWS. The Lacrosse Team s Assistant Coach gathers 
      the team on the field, Stiles and Scott lagging behind.

                                  STILES
                    Just think about this. If you play 
                    I ll have no one to talk to on the 
                    bench. You really gonna  do that to 
                    your best friend?

                                  SCOTT
                    I can t sit out again. My whole 
                    life is sitting on the sidelines. 
                    This season, I make first string.

      Heading for the field, he pauses to notice Lydia climbing the 
      bleachers. And stepping right behind her... Allison.

                                  COACH
                    McCall! You re in the goal.

      Scott trots over to the COACH, a man with little 
      comprehension of the difficulties of teenage life.

                                  SCOTT
                    But I ve never played goal.

                                  COACH
                    I know. Scoring some shots will 
                    give the boys a confidence boost. 
                    It s a first day back thing. Get 
                    them energized, jazzed up.

                                  SCOTT
                    What about me?

                                  COACH
                    Try not to take any in the face.

      Stepping into the net, Scott glances to the bleachers where 
      Allison watches with Lydia, eyes focusing on them.

                                  LYDIA
                    Him? I m not sure who he is. Why?                                                                                    15.



                                    ALLISON
                    He s in my English class.

      Scott looks up, shocked to hear Allison asking about him. But 
      with his hearing momentarily turned up, he flinches at the 
      WHISTLE BLOW, sound RINGING through his skull.

      One of the bigger players charges forward as the Assistant 
      Coach passes the ball to him. Catching it, he whips his stick 
      forward, HURLING the ball toward the goal.

      Still reeling from the WHISTLE, Scott looks up too late to 
      see the ball soaring toward him. IT BOUNCES RIGHT OFF HIS 
      HELMET and into the net. 

      The team LAUGHS wickedly. Even the Coach snickers.

      Cheeks burning under his mask, Scott steals himself for the 
      next player. When the WHISTLE BLOWS again, he s ready. The 
      Assistant Coach passes the ball to the player who catches it 
      and FIRES it right at the goal.

      Scott moves startlingly fast, almost an instantaneous 
      reaction. Then he notices the player staring at him with a 
      mixture of disappointment and surprise. Scott has the ball. 

      He caught it. When the next player takes the shot, Scott 
      catches the ball again. And then again. And again. Nothing 
      can get past him.

      In the bleachers, Allison and Lydia sit forward.

                                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    He seems like he s pretty good.

                                  LYDIA
                    Very good.

      Intrigued, Lydia keeps her gaze locked on Scott who now 
      stands with a far more confident posture. Until Jackson 
      pushes to the head of the line. Glaring at Scott, he 
      practically strangles the lacrosse stick with his gloves.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh God...

      The Assistant Coach tosses the ball up. Jackson launches 
      forward, catching the ball and spinning around to fire it at 
      the goal. But Scott moves with supernatural precision.

      The ball lands right in the pocket of the goalie stick.                                                                                    16.



      Stiles lets out a HOLLER, jumping up on the bench. In the 
      bleachers, Lydia stands and gives a WHOOP as well causing 
      Jackson to throw a look at her. She returns his glare with a 
      sly smile, a warning to step up his game.

      Grinning, Scott gives the goalie stick a whirl, spinning it 
      with a flick of his wrist and sending the ball soaring right 
      into the pocket of the stunned Assistant Coach s stick.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS WOODS - DAY

      In the woods, Scott retraces his steps from last night with 
      Stiles following behind him.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know what it was. I mean I 
                    felt like I had all the time in the 
                    world to catch the ball. And that s 
                    not the only weird thing. I mean I 
                    can hear stuff I shouldn t be able 
                    to hear. And I can smell things.

                                  STILES
                    Smell things? Like what?

                                  SCOTT
                    Like the mint mojito gum in your 
                    pocket.

                                  STILES
                    I don t have any...

      Stiles pulls out a lint-covered piece of wrapped gum.

                                  STILES (CONT'D)
                    All this started with the bite?

                                  SCOTT
                    What if it s an infection? What if 
                    my body is flooding with adrenaline 
                    before I fall into shock? I knew I 
                    should have gone to the ER.

                                  STILES 
                    I ve actually heard of this. It s a 
                    specific kind of infection.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you serious?

                                  STILES
                    All the symptoms add up. I think 
                    it s called... Lycanthropy.                                                                                    17.



                                  SCOTT
                    What s that? Is it bad? It sounds 
                    bad.

                                  STILES
                    It is. But only once a month.

                                  SCOTT
                    Once a month?

                                  STILES
                    On the night of a full moon.

      Scott looks at him. And then gets it.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re an ass.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, you re the one who heard a 
                    wolf howling.

                                  SCOTT
                    There could be something seriously 
                    wrong with me.

                                  STILES
                    I know! You re a werewolf!
                          (off his look)
                    Okay, obviously, I m kidding. But 
                    if you see me in shop class melting 
                    down all the silver I can find it s 
                    because Friday s a full moon.

                                  SCOTT
                          (glancing around)
                    I swear this was it. The body was 
                    here. The deer came running, I 
                    dropped my inhaler...

                                  STILES
                    Maybe the killer moved the body.

                                  SCOTT
                    If he did, I hope he left my 
                    inhaler. Those things are like 
                    eighty bucks.

      Stiles taps him on the arm, bringing his attention to a 
      FIGURE standing just a few yards away.

      DEREK HALE. Nineteen and unquestionably handsome, he has a 
      rougher look than the cleanly shaven Beacon Hills boys.                                                                                    18.



                                  DEREK
                    What are you doing here?

      Both Scott and Stiles are too stunned to speak at first.

                                  DEREK (CONT'D)
                    This is private property.

                                  STILES
                    Sorry, we didn t know.

      Derek stares at Scott, barely noticing Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    We were just looking for something. 
                    Forget it. Sorry to bother you.

      As they re turning to go, Derek tosses an OBJECT to Scott. 
      HIS INHALER. When he looks up, Derek is already walking away.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Come on. I have to get to work.

                                  STILES
                    Dude, that was Derek Hale. You 
                    remember, right? He s only a few 
                    years older than us.

                                  SCOTT
                    Remember what?

                                  STILES
                    His family. They all burned to 
                    death in a fire like ten years ago. 
                      I remember the cops pulling him out 
                    of class to tell him.

                                  SCOTT
                    I wonder what he s doing back.

      Scott eyes the inhaler in his hand, closing his fist over it.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    19.


                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

      INT. BEACON HILLS ANIMAL CLINIC - DAY

      Inside the town s lone veterinary clinic, Scott flips the 
      sign on the door to CLOSED and then grabs a few packages off 
      the reception desk.

      INT. BEACON HILLS ANIMAL CLINIC/CORRIDOR/CAGE ROOM - NIGHT

      The door to a storage room opens into the corridor. Scott 
      backs out, hauling a huge bag of kitty litter. Setting it 
      against the wall he takes out a set of keys and unlocks the 
      next door. But just before pulling it open--

      He pauses, hand gripping the doorknob as he listens to the 
      utterly silent clinic. And then he hears it... RAIN. The 
      pattering of drops on the roof.

      Scott twists the knob and opens the door. He barely has a 
      foot inside the room when the cages filled with CATS come 
      alive with activity--

      The frightened felines suddenly bare their teeth, HISSING and 
      clawing frenetically at the cage doors. All of them focused 
      on Scott, their backs arched, struck with absolute terror.

      Stunned, he staggers out of the room, SLAMMING the door shut.

      INT. BEACON HILLS ANIMAL CLINIC/WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

      Retreating into the waiting room, Scott can still hear the 
      pandemonium coming from inside when a HAMMERING spins him 
      around.

      Standing outside and banging on the glass door with her fist 
      is Allison. Rain-soaked it s nevertheless easy to see that 
      she s crying and in a visible panic.

      Quickly unlocking the door, Scott lets her in as she tries to 
      explain through tears what happened. 

                                    ALLISON
                    I didn t see it. I took my eyes off 
                    the road for like two seconds to 
                    switch songs on my iPod and this 
                    dog--it came out of nowhere--

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, it s all right. Do you 
                    remember where it happened so I can 
                    send out animal control to find it?                                                                                    20.



                                    ALLISON
                    No. I mean yes, I know where I hit 
                    it. But the dog--

                                  SCOTT
                    Right. Where is it?

                                    ALLISON
                    In my car.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS ANIMAL CLINIC/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Following Allison to her car under the now drizzling rain, 
      Scott opens the back seat door to reveal an injured stray. 
      Hackles raised, the frightened lab mix is clearly in pain. 
      Allison reaches in to pick him up but the dog snaps at her. 
      She flinches back, stepping right into Scott s arms.

                                  SCOTT
                    You okay?

      She nods, looking up at Scott behind her, his hands on her 
      forearms, fingers lightly touching her soft skin.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    He s just frightened.

                                    ALLISON
                    That makes two of us.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let me see if I have better luck.

      Letting her go, Scott steps toward the open door, oddly calm.

                                    ALLISON
                    Careful.

      As he connects eyes with the dog, something happens... SOUND 
      drops out around him, all except for the dog s nervous 
      PANTING. Then its harsh gasps begin to ease as some sort of 
      primal communication occurs between them. 

      CLOSE ON SCOTT - for the briefest moment, his EYES take on a 
      strangely YELLOW tint, like that of a wolf.

      In response, the dog lowers its body submissively, yielding 
      to the obviously dominant animal. 

      With Allison watching in amazement, Scott gathers the dog 
      into his arms and carries him into the vet s office.                                                                                    21.



      INT. BEACON HILLS ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

      Inside, Scott gently lays the injured animal down on the 
      examining table. Allison stays back, watching him inspect the 
      dog while petting it, doing an expert job of calming it.

                                  SCOTT
                    I think his leg is broken. I can 
                    splint it now myself, give him a 
                      painkiller and then let the doctor 
                    take a look in the morning.

      Allison steals glances at him, looking on with admiration as 
      he works. But Scott doesn t notice, terrified to glance at 
      the beautiful girl. When he finally does look up, he sees 
      she s hugging herself, soaked and obviously freezing.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I have a t-shirt in my bag.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh, I don t want to trouble you.

      But Scott is already reaching into his bag for the shirt. 
      Allison takes it with a smile. When she steps into the hall 
      for privacy, Scott can t help but notice her REFLECTION in a 
      wall mirror. As she s pulling the wet shirt off, he catches 
      sight of her bare back. Looking away, Scott notices the dog 
      staring up at him.

                                  SCOTT
                            (whispering)
                    What? I didn t see anything.

      The dog doesn t look convinced. Allison comes back into the 
      room, now wearing his shirt and no longer shivering.

                                    ALLISON 
                    Thanks for doing this. I feel 
                    really stupid.

                                  SCOTT
                    How come?

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t know. For freaking out like 
                    a total girl.

                                  SCOTT
                    You are a girl.                                                                                    22.



                                    ALLISON
                    I freaked out like a girly girl. 
                    And I m not a girly girl.

                                  SCOTT
                    What kind of girl are you?

                                    ALLISON
                    Tougher than that. At least I 
                    thought I was.

                                  SCOTT
                    I d be freaked out too. In fact, 
                    I d probably cry. And not like a 
                    man. I d cry like the girliest 
                    girl. It would be pathetic.

                                    ALLISON
                          (laughing)
                    Yeah, right.

      Scott finishes wrapping the dog s leg.

                                  SCOTT 
                    So it looks like he s going to 
                    live. And I m pretty sure he ll 
                    even let you pet him if you want.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t think so.

                                  SCOTT
                    Come on. You don t want him to sue. 
                    This breed is very litigious.

      Allison approaches, tentatively reaching out to stroke the 
      dog s neck. Calm now, the dog even licks her hand.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    See? He likes you.

      He watches Allison. Unable to take his eyes off her.

                                    ALLISON
                          (noticing his stare)
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Sorry. You have an eyelash on your 
                    cheek.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh. From the crying.                                                                                    23.



      She wipes at her cheek. But the lash is still there. Scott 
      shakes his head. She tries again. Still there. So Scott 
      reaches with his thumb to brush the lash from her cheek.

                                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.

      He nods, hand coming down like he s not quite sure what to do 
      with it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Um... I was wondering--I mean--is 
                    it really Family Night on Friday or 
                    do you think maybe you d like to go 
                    to that party with me?

      She throws him a curious look. How did he know she said that?

                                    ALLISON
                    Family Night was a total lie.

                                  SCOTT 
                    So is that a yes? You ll go?

                                    ALLISON
                      Definitely yes.

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

      Tearing down the road on his bike, a huge smile nearly splits 
      Scott s face in half. He s ecstatic. Jubilant. But not for 
      long...

      He slows. Smile fading, something has caught his attention.  
      He eases to a stop on the rain-slick road and holds still. 
      Turning his head up, he takes a quick whiff of the air.

      Slowly, he turns around to find dark woods surrounding him on 
      all sides. The road completely empty. Strangely quiet. 

      THEN THE SOUND OF MOVEMENT catches his ear.

      He turns, peering into the woods. Nothing. He starts pedaling 
      again, glancing to each side of him as he picks up speed.

      Then he notices a SHADOW. Moving through the woods. Keeping 
      pace with him. When he starts pedaling faster, that strange 
      loping SILHOUETTE moves just as fast.

      Pedaling harder and harder, Scott pushes the bike to its 
      limits, steel chain threatening to come off.                                                                                    24.



      The SHADOW slows, letting him get ahead. Not at all relieved, 
      Scott keeps going, looking back to see--

      SOMETHING LARGE AND FAST crossing the road just a few yards 
      behind him, diving into the dark of the woods.

      Now on the other side of the road and driving Scott s panic 
      higher and higher, it keeps pace with him once again until--

      It disappears. A breathless Scott gives a last glance back to 
      the woods on both sides and then forward where--

      A TRUCK VEERS OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. 

      An eighteen wheeler coming from a side road. Scott hits the 
      brakes, the truck LOOMING before him. Bike CRASHING against 
      the hood of the cab, it flips up and smacks down on the road, 
      metal SCRAPING pavement as it CLATTERS to a stop.

      The TRUCK DRIVER jumps out, glancing around in panic. But 
      there s no body on the ground. So he finally peers up where--

      Scott stands on top of the truck. 

      Perched right on the cab. Eyes wide, he looks down, terrified 
      but also strangely exhilarated.

                                  DRIVER
                    What the hell?

      Breathless, Scott is too stunned to even answer.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    25.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY

      Amid the players rushing the field, a very late Stiles finds 
      Scott in the crowd and hurries toward him.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, wait up! You gotta  hear 
                    this.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m playing the first elimination, 
                    Stiles. Can t it wait?

                                  STILES
                    Just hold on. I overheard my Dad on 
                    the phone. The fiber analysis 
                    report came back from LA and they 
                    found animal hairs on the body from 
                    the woods.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, I have to go.

                                  STILES 
                    You re not going to believe what 
                    the animal was--

      But with his helmet on, Scott disappears in the crowd of 
      other players rushing the field, leaving Stiles to say the 
      next words to himself.

                                  STILES (CONT'D)
                    It was a wolf.

      OUT ON THE FIELD the Coach shouts for the players.

                                  COACH
                    All right, gather round...

      Scott glances to the bleachers where students and parents sit 
      to watch the special scrimmage. He spots Allison next to 
      Lydia. She gives him a quick wave and a smile. He holds up a 
      hand to wave back.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    You got a question, McCall?

                                  SCOTT
                    What?                                                                                    26.



                                  COACH
                    You raised your hand.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh, no I was just--nothing. Sorry.

                                  COACH
                          (to the rest of the team)
                    All right, you know how this goes. 
                    If you don t make the cut, you re 
                    most likely warming the bench the 
                    rest of the season. But make first 
                    string and you play, your parents 
                    are proud, your girlfriend loves 
                    you, everything else is cream 
                    cheese. Now show me what you got.

      The WHISTLE blows and the game begins.

      The pace is fast and brutal. When the ball gets passed to 
      Scott, Jackson comes right after him. Lacrosse sticks 
      smacking down on his gloves, Scott tumbles forward and slams 
      to the ground, kicking up dirt around him.

      The WHISTLE stops the play.

      Jackson stands over Scott, glowering down at him as he picks 
      the ball up with a gloved hand. Teeth clenched behind his 
      mask, Scott pushes himself up off the ground.

      Coach gives the WHISTLE a SHARP BLOW, starting the next play. 

      Scott and Jackson find themselves staring across from each 
      other at the draw, crouched down with their sticks waiting 
      for the Assistant Coach to drop the ball.

      At the WHISTLE, Scott moves with shocking speed, grabbing the 
      ball right out from under Jackson.

      AT THE BENCHES - Stiles stands, slowly moving to the 
      sidelines to watch.

      Scott charges the length of the field. DEFENSE lashes out 
      with their sticks, but he parries expertly.

      Jackson catches up and makes a furious stab at stealing the 
      ball. Then with Defense converging on him--

      Scott twists his lacrosse stick around, keeping the ball 
      safely in the pocket while he literally FLIPS FORWARD, 
      leaping right over the heads of the Defensive Players. Feet 
      landing on the turf, he whirls around, tossing the ball in an 
      over the shoulder shot past the goalie--                                                                                    27.



      Right into the net.

      The crowd in the bleachers ROARS with CHEERING, Allison on 
      her feet along with everyone else. Everyone except Stiles.

                                  COACH (CONT'D)
                    McCall, get over here!

      He trots over to the Coach, all eyes on him.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    What in the name of God was that? 
                    This is a lacrosse field. Are you 
                    trying out for the gymnastics team?

                                  SCOTT
                    No, Coach.

                                  COACH
                    Then what the hell was that?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know. I was just trying to 
                    make the shot.

                                  COACH
                    Well, you made the shot. And guess 
                    what? You just made starting 
                    lineup.

      CHEERS ERUPT around him. As team members slap him on the back 
      and knock his helmet with their gloves, a deliriously happy 
      Scott doesn t even notice Jackson s furious stare.

      Or Stiles. Watching with a very worried look.

      INT. STILES S ROOM - NIGHT

      Fingers click furiously over a keyboard. Eyes locked onto his 
      computer screen, Stiles bounces from one web page to the 
      next. Words and images pop up on the screen, flashing across 
      his face--

      Wolfsbane, Silver Bullets, Lycaon, Aconite, drawings of 
      werewolves in different forms, one mostly human, another a 
      massive fur-covered creature and yet another appearing as a 
      normal wolf. Image after image, page after page while...

      THROUGH THE WINDOW OUTSIDE - the sun can be seen setting on 
      Beacon Hills. A FULL MOON beginning to rise.                                                                                    28.



      As his room darkens, an increasingly panicked Stiles watches 
      a sheet of paper come out of his printer - a detailed wood 
      carving of a MEDIEVAL HUNTER standing over the body of a 
      werewolf, aiming a CROSSBOW at the creature.

      He pulls the page out, staring at it with a look of 
      escalating fear when--

      SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

      Stiles practically leaps out of his chair. He rushes to the 
      door, unlocking it to find Scott standing out in the hall.

                                  STILES
                    Get in. You have to see this. I ve 
                    been reading. Websites, books, all 
                    this information.

      As Scott takes off his jacket, Stiles starts grabbing 
      printouts from his desk, pulling his computer screen around, 
      dozens of open web pages on it.

                                  SCOTT
                    How much Adderral have you had 
                    today?

                                  STILES
                    A lot. Doesn t matter. Just listen.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is this about the body? Did they 
                    find who did it?

                                  STILES
                    No, they re still questioning 
                    people. Even Derek Hale--

                                  SCOTT
                    The guy from the woods--

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but that s not it.

                                  SCOTT
                    What then?

                                  STILES
                    Remember the joke the other day? 
                    Not a joke anymore.
                          (off his look)
                    The wolf. The bite in the woods. I 
                    started doing all this reading and--
                    Do you even know why a wolf howls?                                                                                    29.



                                  SCOTT
                    Should I?

                                  STILES
                    It s a signal. When a wolf is alone 
                    it howls to signal its location to 
                    the rest of the pack. So if you 
                    heard it howling that mean there s 
                    others. Maybe a whole pack of them.

                                  SCOTT
                    A pack of wolves?

                                  STILES
                    No. Werewolves.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re seriously wasting my time 
                    with this? You know, I m picking 
                    Allison up in an hour.

                                  STILES
                    I saw you on the field, Scott. What 
                    you did wasn t just amazing. It was 
                      impossible.

                                  SCOTT
                    So I made a good shot.

                                  STILES
                    No, you made an incredible shot. 
                    The way you moved--the speed, your 
                      reflexes--people can t suddenly do  
                    that overnight. And then there s 
                    the hearing, the senses, and don t 
                    think I haven t noticed you don t 
                    need your inhaler anymore. You 
                    haven t used it since that night.

                                  SCOTT
                    I can t think about this now. We ll 
                    talk tomorrow, okay?

                                  STILES
                    Tomorrow? Don t you get it? The 
                    full moon is tonight.

                                  SCOTT 
                    What are you trying to do? I just 
                    made starting lineup. I have a date 
                    with a girl I can t believe 
                    actually wants to go out with me. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                      Everything in my life is somehow 
                    perfect. Why are you trying to ruin 
                    it?

                                  STILES
                    I m trying to help. With the full 
                    moon it s going to be too hard to 
                    resist and there s no going back. 
                    You re cursed, Scott. And it s not 
                    only that the moon causes you to 
                    change, it s also when your 
                    bloodlust will be at its peak.

                                  SCOTT
                      Bloodlust?

                                  STILES
                    Your urge to kill.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m already starting to have an 
                    urge to kill, Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    You need to hear this. The change 
                    can be caused by anger or anything 
                    that raises your pulse. And I ve 
                    never seen anyone raise your pulse 
                    like Allison does. You have to 
                    cancel your date. You have to call 
                    her.

      Stiles grabs Scott s jacket, pulling the cell phone out.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing? Give me that.

                                  STILES
                    I m just finding her number--

                                  SCOTT
                    Give it to me.

      Stiles looks up to see Scott s eyes flash YELLOW for a brief 
      second. His voice low and guttural, he yanks the phone out of 
      Stiles s hand and SHOVES him against the wall.

      Pulling back before striking him, Scott instead LASHES out at 
      the desk chair sending it flying across the room, tossed like 
      it weighed nothing. Then, shaking with anger, he gazes up.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I didn t mean to do that.                                                                                    31.



      He starts to help Stiles up, but his friend flinches back.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry. Really, I didn t mean 
                    it. I have to go. I have to get 
                    ready for the party. I m sorry.

      Grabbing his jacket, Scott hurries out.

      Still shaken, Stiles gradually stands. He slowly picks up the 
      desk chair, putting it back. But then he pauses. With a shaky 
      hand, he turns the chair around to reveal...

      CLAW MARKS. The chair s fabric slashed to ribbons.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT

      Towel around his waist, Scott yanks his closet door open and 
      starts tossing clothes onto his bed.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Big date?

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, a little privacy please?

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Hold on, what do we have here...

      She approaches, feeling his chin with her thumb.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL (CONT'D)
                    I think it might be time for you to 
                    start shaving.

      Something begins to happen to their VOICES. The quality 
      starts to change. Becoming TINNY as we pull back--

      EXT. MCCALL HOME - NIGHT

      Outside the house, Scott and his Mom can be heard talking.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t even have a razor.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Then further down the street, their voices take on the same 
      EFFECT as those that Scott could hear when he was listening 
      in on conversations at school and the police station.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    You better borrow one of mine. I ll 
                    go get it. Stay right here.

      No less than a hundred yards away but still within the line 
      of sight of the house, someone stands beside a black Dodge 
      Challenger, listening in on the conversation... Derek Hale.

      EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

      In the backyard of a dimly lit house, Scott and Allison stand 
      awkwardly among a crowd of a drunk and high teenagers. Scott 
      peers down at the table with the booze.                                                                                    33.



                                  SCOTT
                    So what do you drink?

                                    ALLISON
                    Um... I don t know.

                                  SCOTT
                    Me either, actually. Maybe we 
                    should try beer? Wait here, I ll 
                    hit the keg.

                                    ALLISON
                    Perfect.

      Near a blazing fire pit, Scott fills up two cups at the 
      crowded keg when a SOUND catches his attention.

      A DOG BARKING. A huge ROTTWEILER in the yard next door just 
      beyond a chain link fence. And it s barking at Derek.

      He stands behind the fire pit, staring straight at Scott. But 
      then he shoots a look at the Rottweiler. The dog stops 
      barking instantly. 

      Eyes locked on the animal, Derek gives an almost 
      imperceptible nod. Tail between its legs, the Rottweiler 
        submissively lowers to a sitting position.

      Satisfied, Derek turns back to Scott who grips the two 
      overflowing cups in his hands. And for the briefest second, 
      Derek s EYES FLASH YELLOW.

                                  PARTY-GOER
                    Dude, you done?

      A stunned Scott hands off the keg tap to the Party-Goer. When 
      he looks back to the fire pit--

      Derek is gone.

      Scott turns, glancing to the other teens in the yard, to the 
      chain link fence and then up to--

      THE ROOF - where a shadowy figure seems to disappear just 
      past the chimney.

      Scott steps back, trying to see if he actually did just 
      witness Derek leaping twenty feet off the ground. But there s 
      nothing there.                                                                                    34.



      INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

      Handing a cup to Allison, Scott keeps throwing nervous 
      glances back at the outside porch of the house. He takes a 
      gulp of the beer and then COUGHS, nearly spitting it out.

                                  SCOTT
                    That tastes terrible.

      Allison laughs at him, covering her mouth with her hand.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Now I see what they mean about an 
                    acquired taste.

                                    ALLISON
                    I ve actually never been drunk. I 
                    usually go to these parties and 
                    just stand there with a Diet Coke.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles and I got drunk on Tequila 
                    one night. The next morning I felt 
                    like I had a flamethrower pointed 
                    at my forehead.

                                    ALLISON 
                    Okay, since neither of us is any 
                    good at drinking, how are you at 
                    dancing?

                                  SCOTT
                    Much better. Infinitely better.

      Under the driving pulse of techno, Scott takes her hand, 
      pulling her into the crowd of dancing teenagers. Then as they 
      begin moving, as Allison starts to smile back at him, the 
      usually timid Scott begins to let go.

      His hands reach around her waist with the other teens pushing 
      them closer. Bodies pressed against each other, her cheek 
      brushes lightly against his.

      Then through the crowd, Scott notices Lydia dancing with 
      Jackson, grinding close to him, her fingers wrapped around 
      the back of his neck.

      She presses her lips to Jackson s locking him in a passionate 
      kiss. As he eagerly kisses her back, sliding his hands down 
      past her waist, Lydia opens her eyes.

      And looks right at Scott.                                                                                    35.



      Staring at him as she kisses Jackson. Unused to the attention 
      of one beautiful girl, much less two, Scott finds himself 
      dumbstruck until the bodies of the dancing teens push 
      together to leave him alone with Allison again.

      As Scott peers into her eyes, for a second it almost looks as 
      though they re about to kiss.

      Then the thumping beat of the music begins driving faster, 
      starting to sound almost like the quickening of a heartbeat. 
      Scott s HEARTBEAT.

      The sounds around him INTENSIFY. His fingers clench back, 
      veins at the surface of his hands as he presses against the 
      fabric of Allison s shirt. His upper lip pulls up momentarily 
      to reveal a sharpened incisor. 

      Lights GLARING in his eyes, Scott takes a hard swallow as his 
      breathing tightens, sweat beading his temples. He loses the 
      beat of the music, stepping back and pulling away.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I have to... I have to use 
                    the bathroom.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you okay?

      But he hurries past her and into the hallway.

      INT. PARTY HOUSE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Teeth clenched, a sudden wave of pain SLAMS Scott back 
      against the wall, tremors shuddering through his body.

      Waiting in line for the bathroom, Harley notices him against 
      the wall, his arms wrapped around his stomach.

                                  HARLEY
                    Scott? You all right?

      But he doesn t answer, pushing through the crowd, trying to 
      find an exit out of the house. But one door leads to two 
      teens making out on a bed. Another to a smoke filled room 
      crowded with stoners. He can t seem to find a way out.

      Gasps sounding more like animalistic growls, he crashes 
      through the kitchen, shoving past people to the open door and 
      out to the backyard.

      EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

      Harley finds Stiles near the fire-pit outside.                                                                                    36.



                                  HARLEY
                    Hey, I just saw Scott leave. I 
                    think he had too much to drink.

                                  STILES
                    What? What do you mean?

      But before she can answer, a PANICKED PARTY-GOER charges in 
      from the back door.

                                  PANICKED PARTY-GOER
                    Cops are here!

      Suddenly everyone is moving, darting for an escape.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT

      Scott stumbles into his room, slamming the door shut. But 
      even as he s turning the lock, another wave of pain wracks 
      his body. He falls back, hitting his dresser and catching his 
      reflection in the mirror above where--

      TWO GLOWING, YELLOW EYES stare back at him.

      Crouched on the floor, breathing hard and with sweat 
      streaming down his forehead, Scott squeezes his eyes shut 
      trying to push back the animal inside when someone POUNDS on 
      the door.

                                  SCOTT
                    Go away!

                                  STILES (O.S.)
                    Scott, it s me.

      Hearing the panic in his friend s voice, he pulls himself up. 
      He unlocks the door but only allows it to open an inch.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Let me in, Scott I can help--

                                  SCOTT
                    No.

      Eyes still burning YELLOW, he stays hidden behind the door.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Listen, you have to find Allison. 
                    Take her home--

                                  STILES
                    She s fine. I saw her get a ride. 
                    She s totally fine.                                                                                    37.



                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, I think I know who it is.

                                  STILES
                    Just let me in and we can talk.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s Derek. Derek Hale s the 
                    werewolf. He s the one who bit me. 
                    He s the one who killed the girl in 
                    the woods.

      Scott listens. But there s nothing but shocked silence from 
      the other side of the door. Until--

                                  STILES
                    Scott... Derek s the one who drove 
                    Allison from the party.

      EXT. MCCALL HOME - NIGHT

      Bedroom window thrown open, Scott launches himself out from 
      the second story fifteen feet up. When his feet hit the 
      pavement, his crouched figure slowly draws up to reveal he s 
      no longer struggling against the transformation.

      He s given into it.

      Not the hulking beast of most werewolf horror films, this is 
      a leaner, more human monster. Both powerfully muscular and 
      strangely seductive with gleaming yellow eyes, incisors 
      reformed into fangs, ears tapered to points over thickened, 
      wilder hair and fingernails grown to razor sharp claws.

      The sixteen year-old boy is gone. Scott is now a WEREWOLF, 
      charging down the driveway and into the darkness in search of 
      Allison and the danger she faces.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
