      They follow Nigel outside as he lights up a cigarette.  Shawn 
      looks around, nervous.  Something is out of place, 
      different...

                                  SHAWN
                    Don t--

                                  ST. NIGEL 
                    Well add them to the list.

      Bingo.  SHAWN VISION:  a fresh puddle, WATER streaming into 
      from behind one of the trailers.

      Nigel pulls out a lighter to spark up his cigarette.

      SHAWN VISION: a THICK ELECTRICAL CABLE smolders off in the 
      horizon where the cable emanates from.  Shawn s eyes go wide.

                                  SHAWN
                    STOP!!!

    He RUNS over, bear-hugging the confused judge.  St. Nigel 
      immediately TWISTS AWAY from him, horrified.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    I do not have physical contact with 
                    people with arm hair!

    He gets out of Shawn s grasp and starts to step forward.  
      Nigel pulls away but Shawn GRABS Nigel's platinum engraved 
      cigarette case and fakes a psychic episode...

                                  SHAWN
                    That case...

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Was a gift.  A very expensive--

      Shawn THROWS it in the fresh water.  The metal EXPLODES as it 
      hits what we now realize is super-conducted water.  Nigel's 
      ashen face stares at the sight until he realizes his 
      cigarette case is destroyed.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          PSYCH - Episode #2002 - "American Duos" - Network Draft - 3/30/07   17.

                    I... did.

      Shawn steps back.  Nigel dusts himself off and tries to 
      collect himself, he looks at the smoldering water, shakes his 
      head, then PASSES OUT.

      They walk, revealing a house we know all too well.  Nigel 
      grimaces at the house.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Good Lord.  Who lives here?  The

      Shawn and Gus approach with Nigel in tow.  There s a police 
      barricade waiting for them and Interim Chief Vick, dressed in 
      red, cuts them off at the pass.  She is joined by third judge 
      Rockwell and American Duos host Lester Beacon. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Chief!  You re a vision in 
                    cranberry. 

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. Spencer.  Mr. Burton.  I m 
                    afraid I ve got some unfortunate 
                    news.

      Nigel catches up.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK (CONT D)
                    Ah, Mr. St. Nigel.  There you are.  
                    You ll want to hear this as well.

                    Gus left his Airwolf windbreaker in 
                    the dressing room and it was 
                    accidentally set on fire?

                    I wish.  Emilina Saffron was found 
                    in the bathroom of her hotel suite 
                    this morning.  She was clinging to 
                    life and has been rushed to St. 
                    Thomas of the Apostles.  Thus far 
                    all signs point to an overdose of 
                    some sort, but we are fully 
                      investigating the matter.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    How did she escape?  You must 
                    transport her to some prison 
                    hospital immediately.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Mr. St. Nigel, Miss Saffron was 
                    released from custody last night 
                    when her alibi checked out.  She s 
                    the last person you should be 
                    worried about now.

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    We have to cancel the show!

      Before Rockwell can speak, Lester chimes in.

    All heads turn to Lester s lack of sensitivity.

                                  BEACON (CONT D)
                    I don t want to seem insensitive, 
                    but this is the third time this 
                    season she s been in the ICU.

                    Not like this.  I won t go.  I m a 
                    sitting duck out there.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    I personally will oversee the

                    I m way late for my pilates. 

      Lester leaves.  Rockwell pats Nigel on the back and leaves.

                    Well, I suppose we should rehearse.

                    Not before I get a danish in my 
                    stomach.

      Shawn makes eye contact with Nigel -- his face is white as a 
      ghost.  He points to the Chief.

                                  SHAWN
                    She s the best of the best.  You

                    her on that wall.

                    Mr. Spencer --

      Shawn and Gus leave Nigel alone with Interim Chief Vick.  As 
      they walk off in the B.G., wesee them look back and then 
      veer out of frame in another direction.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK (CONT D)
                    Can I get you anything? 

                                  ST. NIGEL
                    Are you really the chief of police?

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK

                    I m sorry.  It s just that you have 
                    such a calming presence.  You exude 
                    the callous exoskeleton of an 
                      authoritarian while simultaneously 
                    oozing a gentle kindness and a 
                    delicate yet complicated 
                      femininity. 

    She momentarily is at a loss for words -- bordering on 
      blushing.  Then she playfully smacks Nigel on the shoulder.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK

                    I m willing to share.

    The chief blushes in full.  Then shakes her head.  Nigel 
      knows he s rejected.
