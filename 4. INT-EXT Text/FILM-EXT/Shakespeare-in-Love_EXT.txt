WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are
crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and
merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up
with WILL as he strides purposefully along.
HENSLOWE
(catching up)
Who is she this time?!
WILL
She is always Aphrodite.
HENSLOWE
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind
the Dog and Trumpet?
WILL
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can
you understand the emptiness that
seeks a soulmate?
HENSLOWE
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to
boot. My theatre is close by the
plague these twelve weeks, my company
is playing the inn-yards
of England, while Burbage and the
Chamberlain's Men are invited to court
and receive ten pounds to play your
piece, written for my theatre, by my
writer, at my risk when you were green
and grateful -
WILL
What piece? Richard Crookback?
HENSLOWE
No--it's comedy they want, Will!
Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
WILL
Who wrote that?
HENSLOWE
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I
gave you three pounds a month since.
WILL
Half what you owed me. I am still due
for One Gentleman of Verona.
HENSLOWE'S hardly paused in his appeal.
HENSLOWE
. . . Will! What is money to you and
me? I, your patron, you my wordwright!
When the plague lifts Burbage will
have a new Christopher Marlowe for the
Curtain and I have nothing for the
Rose.
WILL stops.
WILL
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty
pounds?
HENSLOWE
(staggered)
Fifty pounds? What for?
WILL
Burbage offers me a partnership in the
Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my
hired player days are over.
HENSLOWE
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to
the dogs!
WILL
(answering for him)
No, then.
WILL turns down a side street.
HENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace
where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone
who will listen.
MAKEPEACE
and the Lord shall smite them! Yea,
harken to me. The theatres are
handmaidens of the devil! Under the
name of the Curtain, the players
breed lewdness in your wives,
rebellion in your servants, idleness
in your apprentices and wickedness in
your children! And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name! I say a
plague on both their houses!
As he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note.
WILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a
doorway.
HENSLOWE
Where are you going?
WILL
To my weekly confession.
As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign
identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH,
apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of
dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.
WILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse
trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him,
and HENSLOWE follows.
HENSLOWE
Now where? Will?
WILL
To the Palace at Whitehall.
HENSLOWE is making his way from the theatre to the market
place when FENNYMAN and LAMBERT appear at either shoulder
and propel him back the way he came. FREES follows
behind.
FENNYMAN
This time we take your boots off!
HENSLOWE
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
FENNYMAN
The theatres are all closed by the
plague!
HENSLOWE
Oh, that.
FENNYMAN
by order of the Master of the Revels!
HENSLOWE
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the
theatre business.
(they stop)
The natural condition is one of
insurmountable obstacles on the road
to imminent disaster. Believe me, to
be close by the plague is a bagatelle
in the ups and downs of owning a
theatre.
FENNYMAN
So what do we do?
HENSLOWE
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all
turns out well.
FENNYMAN
How?
HENSLOWE
I don't know. It's a mystery.
LAMBERT
(dumbly)
Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?
At this point din is heard in the background. a
messenger, ringing a bell, is running though the street.
MESSENGER
The theatres are reopened. By order of
the Master of the Revels, the theatres
are reopened
FENNYMAN is intrigued.
FREES
Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened
the playhouses.
FENNYMAN
Yes I heard.
HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly,
shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip.
HENSLOWE
(to LAMBERT)
If you wouldn't mind
HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE,
curious.
FENNYMAN
Where is the play?
HENSLOWE
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down
HENSLOWE who has come to see him.
HENSLOWE
Will! The theatres are
Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his
hand.
WILL
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God,
I'm good!
HENSLOWE
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
WILL has gone.
BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs
through the door without ceremony.
WILL
(shouting)
Richard!
WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands
by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He
watches for a moment as the pages catch fire.
WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing
with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins,
tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews
(lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time
before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded
street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.
When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in
a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The
river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a
number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest
one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.
WILL
Follow that boat!
BOATMAN
Right you are, governor!
WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits
facing him, rowing lustily.
BOATMAN (CONT'D)
I know your face. Are you an actor?
WILL
(oh God, here we go again)
Yes.
BOATMAN
Yes, I've seen you in something. That
one about a king.
WILL
Really?
BOATMAN
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my
boat once.
LATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to
where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther
shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the
north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run
toward the house.
WILL
Do you know that house?
BOATMAN
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
WILL runs towards the house.
WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a
SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general
direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and
escapes a soaking.
SERVANT
Be off!
WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying
instruments. WILL recognizes them.
WILL
Master Plum! What business here?
MUSICIAN
A five shilling business, Will. We
play for the dancing.
The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a
GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who
have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the
house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX
skid to a halt and enter the house.
There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed
for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space.
WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room
is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto
the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her.
VIOLA sighs dreamily.
VIOLA
Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of
Verona. A comedy. By William
Shakespeare.
WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of
hiding, and approaches the balcony.
WILL
(whispers)
My lady!
VIOLA
(gasps)
Who is there?
WILL
Will Shakespeare!
The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room.
VIOLA
Anon, good nurse. Anon.
(to WILL)
Master Shakespeare?!
WILL
The same, alas.
VIOLA
Oh but why "alas?"
WILL
A lowly player.
VIOLA
Alas indeed, for I thought you the
highest poet of my esteem and a writer
of plays that capture my heart.
WILL
Oh--I am him too!
The NURSE calls again.
VIOLA
(to NURSE)
Anon, anon!
(to WILL)
I will come again.
She goes inside for a moment.
WILL
(to himself)
Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be
punished for this!
VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.
WILL (CONT'D)
Oh my lady, my love!
VIOLA
If they find you here they will kill
you.
WILL
You can bring them with a word.
VIOLA
Oh, not for the world!
The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"
VIOLA (CONT'D)
Anon, nurse!
But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that
there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb
up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a
soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops
his head over the parapet and is face to face with the
NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the
tree.
Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle
flames appear in different windows, the garden door is
flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one
hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top
of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He
could have written it better.
WILL arrives in a hurry at the wharfside, and looks
vainly in the direction of the DE LESSEPSES' house: no
THOMAS.
WILL looks down the alley:--no THOMAS. He turns away. The
URCHIN, the short-lived Ethel, is sitting in the alley.
WILL
Better fortune, boy.
URCHIN
(shrugs)
I was in a play. They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus. When I write
plays, they will be like Titus.
WILL
(pleased)
You admire it?
The URCHIN nods grimly.
URCHIN
I like it when they cut heads off. And
the daughter mutilated with knives.
WILL
Oh. What is your name?
URCHIN.
John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.
Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest.
The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches
the result with sober interest.
URCHIN (CONT'D)
Plenty of blood. That is the only
writing.
WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy.
URCHIN (CONT'D)
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his
head off.
WILL
I have to get back.
WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into
BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.
BURBAGE
Will!
WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls
after him.
BURBAGE (CONT'D)
And where are my pages . . .
WILL hurries on.
VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From
behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears
shouting.
WILL
(O.S. shouting)
Did you give her my letter?
VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind,
following in another boat. She takes a letter from her
coat and holds it aloft.
VIOLA AS THOMAS
(calling)
And this for you.
WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open
the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He
collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.
WILL
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I
am unmanned, unmended, and unmade,
like a puppet in a box.
BOATMAN
Writer, is he?
WILL turns on him savagely
WILL
Row your boat.
WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation
intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The
BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore
him.
WILL
She tells me to keep away. She is to
marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
VIOLA AS THOMAS
If you love her, you must do what she
asks.
WILL
And break her heart and mine?
VIOLA AS THOMAS
It is only ours you can know.
WILL
She loves me, Thomas!
VIOLA AS THOMAS
Does she say so?
WILL
No. And yet she does where the ink has
run with tears. Was she weeping when
she gave you this?
VIOLA AS THOMAS
I
Her letter came to me by the
nurse.
WILL
Your aunt?
VIOLA AS THOMAS
(catching up)
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a
little. Tell me how you love her,
Will.
WILL
Like a sickness and its cure together.
VIOLA AS THOMAS
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and
heat.
(collecting herself)
Is your lady beautiful? Since I came
to visit from the country, I have not
seen her close. Tell me, is she
beautiful?
WILL
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her
eyes! I was born to look in them and
know myself.
He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but
WILL belies his words.
VIOLA AS THOMAS
And her lips?
WILL
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early
morning rose would wither on the
branch, if it could feel envy!
VIOLA AS THOMAS
And her voice? Like lark song?
WILL
Deeper. Softer. None of your
twittering larks! I would banish
nightingales from her garden before
they interrupt her song.
VIOLA AS THOMAS
She sings too?
WILL
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays
the lute, she has a natural ear. And
her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
VIOLA AS THOMAS
(glinting)
What of her bosom?
WILL
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round
and rare as golden apples!
VIOLA AS THOMAS
I think the lady is wise to keep your
love at a distance. For what lady
could live up to it close to, when her
eyes and lips and voice may be no more
beautiful than mine? Besides, can a
lady born to wealth and noble marriage
love happily with a Bankside poet and
player?
WILL
(fervently)
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of
rank or riverbank! It will spark
between a queen and the poor vagabond
who plays the king, and their love
should be minded by each, for love
denied blights the soul we owe to God!
So tell my lady, William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden!
VIOLA AS THOMAS
But what of Lord Wessex?
WILL
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand
Wessexes!
The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house.
The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her
round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her.
The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth
and jumps out of the boat.
VIOLA
Oh, Will!
She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the
house.
BOATMAN
Thank you, my lady!
WILL
(stunned)
Lady?
BOATMAN
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she
was this high. Wouldn't deceive a
child.
WILL gets out of the boat.
BOATMAN (CONT'D)
(reaching under his seat)
Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a
writer myself.
The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript.
BOATMAN (CONT'D)
It wouldn't take you long to read it,
I expect you know all the booksellers
. . .
But WILL has gone.
WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without
hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony.
Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with
envious streaks.
Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a
royal palace, crowded now with noble guests.
The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about,
chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while
QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes
through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with
a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the
best chair
where she establishes a headquarters. Her
current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to
a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the
next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and
bowing as they are greeted by people who know them
Will,
in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until
VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The
QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.
WESSEX
(to him)
Now?
LORD IN WAITING
Now.
WESSEX
(to Viola)
The Queen asks for you. Answer well.
The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL
starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.
WESSEX (CONT'D)
Is there a man?
WILL
A man, my lord?
WESSEX
(impatiently)
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet,
I heard--does he come to the house?
WILL
A theatre poet?
WESSEX
An insolent penny-a-page rogue,
Marlowe, he said, Christopher
Marlowe--has he been to the house?
WILL
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely
waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
WESSEX
(venomously)
That dog!
ANGLE on the QUEEN.
The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks
from a frozen curtsey.
VIOLA
Your Majesty.
QUEEN
Stand up straight, girl.
VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
I have seen you. You are the one who
comes to all the plays--at Whitehall,
at Richmond.
VIOLA
(agreeing)
Your Majesty.
QUEEN
What do you love so much?
VIOLA
Your Majesty
QUEEN
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you
love stories of kings and queens?
Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
VIOLA
I love theatre. To have stories acted
for me by a company of fellows is
indeed
QUEEN
(interrupting)
They are not acted for you, they are
acted for me.
VIOLA remains silent, in apology.
ANGLE on WILL.
He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN
so close. He is fascinated.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
And--?
VIOLA
And I love poetry above all.
QUEEN
Above Lord Wessex?
She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX
has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
(to WESSEX)
My Lord--when you cannot find your wife
you had better look for her at the
playhouse.
The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
But playwrights teach nothing about
love, they make it pretty, they make
it comical, or they make it lust. They
cannot make it true.
VIOLA
(blurts)
Oh, but they can!
She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN
considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched.
VIOLA (CONT'D)
I mean
Your Majesty, they do not, they
have not, but I believe there is one
who can
WESSEX
Lady Viola is
young in the world. Your
Majesty is wise in it.
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
QUEEN
I thought you were here because you
had none.
Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
(by way of dismissing him)
Well, no one will take your wager, it
seems.
WILL
Fifty pounds!
Shock and horror. QUEEN ELIZABETH is the only person
amused.
QUEEN
Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a
very worthy question. Can a play show
us the very truth and nature of love?
I bear witness to the wager, and will
be the judge of it as occasion arises.
(which wins a scatter of
applause. She gathers her
skirts and stands)
I have not seen anything to settle it
yet.
(she moves away, everybody
bowing and scraping)
So--the fireworks will be soothing
after the excitements of Lady Viola's
audience.
(and now she is next to
WESSEX who is bowing low.
Intimately to him)
Have her then, but you are a lordly
fool. She has been plucked since I saw
her last, and not by you. It takes a
woman to know it.
The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again,
we see his face a mask of furious realisation.
WESSEX
(to himself)
Marlowe!
BURBAGE and a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEND are
cleaving a path through the crowds. Their faces are grim.
A figure is running desperately through the streets. He
comes into the square and runs towards the Rose.
Half THE COMPANY are singing. NOL and a WHORE are
tumbling down the stairs together. He is without his
trousers. An awful lot of drink has gone down.
SAM
(to the PRETTIEST WHORE)
I
quite liked it.
VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in
time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a
barbershop quartet of actors.
FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.
FENNYMAN
Master Kent! You have not dipped your
wick?
VIOLA AS THOMAS
(baffled)
My wick?
WILL
(saving her)
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the
theatre you must have a part in my
play. I am writing an Apothecary, a
small but vital role.
FENNYMAN
(embracing WILL)
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your
Apothecary!
In his general enthusiasm, he embraces the next man, who
is RALPH, stone cold sober.
FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
I am to be in your play.
WHORE
(to RALPH)
And what is this play about?
RALPH
Well, there's this Nurse
FENNYMAN, beside himself, shouts for silence, announcing
FENNYMAN
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part
of the Apothecary!
HENSLOWE
The Apothecary? Will, what is the
story? Where is the shipwreck? How
does the comedy end?
WILL
By God, I wish I knew.
HENSLOWE
By God, Will, if you do not, who does?
Let us have pirates, clowns, and a
happy ending, or we will send you back
to Stratford to your wife!
That goes down every well with the entire COMPANY
except
for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then
makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him
and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears.
VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street.
WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the
shoulders by PETER
who, we now see, is in a highly
emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER
has the strength of the news he brings.
PETER
(shouts)
Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!
He brings the room to silence.
PETER (CONT'D)
A black day for us all! There is news
come up river from Deptford. Marlowe
is dead.
There are general gasps and cries for information.
PETER (CONT'D)
Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern
at Deptford!
No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is
worse than the first. He stands horror-stricken.
WILL
Oh
what have I done?
ALLEYN
(standing up)
He was the first man among us. A great
light has gone out.
WILL comes staggering out into the street.
WILL
It was I who killed him! God forgive
me, God forgive me!
He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water
and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.
A church tower looms up in the night sky.
A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing.
VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides
sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather
like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive
animal.
Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a
happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily.
Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA
and greets her merrily.
WESSEX
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you
riding.
VIOLA
It is not my riding day, my lord.
WESSEX
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
VIOLA
I am going to church.
WESSEX
(recomposing his features to
solemnity)
I understand of course. It is to be
expected.
VIOLA
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
WESSEX
And on a day of mourning. I never met
the fellow but once at your house.
VIOLA
(cannot take this in)
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
WESSEX
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would
be me to tell you. A great loss to
playwriting, and to dancing.
VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.
VIOLA
(faintly)
He is dead?
WESSEX
(cheerfully solemn)
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come,
then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in
distress.
NURSE
My lady
my lady
now is the time to
show your breeding.
Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the
church. She calls his name.
VIOLA
Will!
He does not answer. She runs after him.
VIOLA (CONT'D)
Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!
She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment
then WILL pulls back.
WILL
It is worse. I have killed a man.
VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still
sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among
the buttercups and looks down at him.
VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She
has not yet revealed her feelings.
WILL
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus
Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house
built on his foundations.
VIOLA
You never spoke so well of him.
WILL
He was not dead before. I would
exchange all my plays to come for all
of his that will never come.
VIOLA
You lie.
WILL turns to look at her.
VIOLA (CONT'D)
You lie in your meadow as you lied in
my bed.
WILL
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes,
and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir
Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife
come from Stratford to tell you that.
And yet you let me come to your bed.
VIOLA
Calf love. I loved the writer, and
gave up the prize for a sonnet.
WILL
I was the more deceived.
VOILA
Yes--you were deceived. For I never
loved you till now.
WILL
Now?
VIOLA
(declaring herself)
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
WILL
Oh, my love
(he kisses her)
You ran from me before.
VIOLA
You were not dead before. When I
thought you dead, I did not care about
all the plays that will never come,
only that I would never see your face.
I saw our end, and it will come.
WILL
You cannot marry Wessex!
VIOLA
If not Wessex the Queen will know the
cause and there will be no more Will
Shakespeare.
They kiss again, passionately.
WILL
No
no.
VIOLA
(through his kisses)
But I will go to Wessex as a widow
from these vows, as solemn as they are
unsanctified.
And as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut
to:
TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.
TILNEY
You will go far, I fear.
TILNEY (CONT'D)
I hope we work together again. Tilney
walks away.
A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is
muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is
FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary,
for which he has a special voice.
FENNYMAN
"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's
law Is death to any he that utters
them." Then him. Then me.
"Put this in any liquid thing you will And
"--something
He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair.
FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
"Such mortal drugs I have
" What is
it? What is it?
He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not
notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance
dismounts and walks inside.
The closure notice is nailed to the door.
A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a
paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble
pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of
wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen
flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot
runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at
the poster. It says
BY PERMISSION OF
MR. BURBAGE
A
HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION
OF
MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION
OF
THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE
OF
THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY
OF
ROMEO AND JULIET
with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary
WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He
walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:
HENSLOWE
Will!
WILL does not turn to look at him.
HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
We'll be needing a Romeo
WILL carries on walking.
WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the
river.
WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats.
WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he
crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down
on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of
the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and
his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the
carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal
The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as
WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S
veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just
see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage
is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction.
Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer
from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at
it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to
VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes
it to the NURSE.
WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage
awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door
for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to
follow her.
NURSE
My lord!
The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S
discomfort.
NURSE (CONT'D)
Be good to her, my lord!
WESSEX
I will.
He tries to disengage. She won't have it.
NURSE
God bless you!
WESSEX
Thank you. Let go, there's a good
nurse.
After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates
himself.
WESSEX (CONT'D)
The tide will not wait. Farewell!
WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.
Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among
them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the
crowds to run away from sin
MAKEPEACE
Licentiousness is made a show, vice is
made a show, vanity and pride likewise
made a show! This is the very business
of show
But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the
main doors of the theatre.
Word has got around. Even rich people are coming. They
arrive by carriage and by palanquin.
Some of them are cloaked and hooded, slumming incognito.
A cannon booms from the Curtain. The flag of the
ADMIRAL'S MEN flutters above.
LAMBERT and FREES are taking the entrance money.
VIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain.
A furious WESSEX is hurrying along the road to the
theatre.
In the semirural view towards the City of London, there
can be discerned a gaggle of approaching MEN and three is
something orderly about them. As they come closer, we see
that they are a company of PIKE MEN, marching toward the
theatre, led by the Master of the Revels, TILNEY. Thunder
rolls.
TILNEY, on the march. His hand grips a copy of the
Curtain flyer.
A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her
carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase
as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the
following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking
place, including some of the actors crowding to see her
off. WESSEX bows out of breath.
WESSEX
Your Majesty!
QUEEN
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so
soon?
WESSEX
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this
to end?
VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the
other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.
QUEEN
As stories must when love's
denied--with tears and a journey. Those
whom God has joined in marriage, not
even I can put asunder.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
(she turns to VIOLA)
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost
his wife in the play- house--go make
your farewell and send her out. It's
time to settle accounts.
(to WESSEX)
How much was the wager?
WESSEX
Fifty shillings.
(the QUEEN gives him a look)
Pounds.
QUEEN
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it
rightfully home. WESSEX gives his
purse to VIOLA.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
(to VIOLA)
And tell Shakespeare something more
cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.
The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an
enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN
hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the
puddle as cloaks descend upon it.
QUEEN (CONT'D)
Too late, too late.
She splashes her way into her carriage, which departs.
Two figures plunge into the water
WILL (VO)
the wild waters roar and heave
the
brave vessel is dashed all to pieces,
and all the helpless souls within her
drowned
VIOLA in the water
WILL (VO)
whose soul is greater than the ocean
and her spirit stronger than the sea's
embrace
not for her watery end, but
a new life beginning on a stranger
shore
VIOLA is walking up a vast and empty beach
.
WILL (VO CONTINUED)
It will be a love story
for she will
be my heroine for all time
DISSOLVE slowly to VIOLA, walking away up the beach
towards her brave new world.
