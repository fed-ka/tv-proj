Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A
strong wind bends them back, showing their light green
bellies.
This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane
tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to
be more rural than suburb.
CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked
on the sky, narrow as he stares at...
A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.
It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and
gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending
wispy tentacles toward the ground.
Curtis stands, awestruck.
The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake
his position. A light rain begins.
The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his
cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder
now. He notices something strange.
The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his
shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his
palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.
He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an
amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.
Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.
Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends
back the trunk of the maple tree.
Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.
TITLE: TAKE SHELTER
Curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door. Keys in
his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down
the porch steps and onto the front walk.
He pops open the chain-link gate and heads for the PICK-UP
parked on the street. Clear blue sky overhead.
Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. A slight
breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is
drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling.
A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the
ground. Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the
drill's cabling system and yanks down.
CURTIS
Yeah, let's keep going with that
bit! It'll go another 10 feet!
He yells to DEWART(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of
a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long
rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.
DEWART
We won't get the gravel pack down
today!
CURTIS
Why not?!
4.
DEWART
Those clouds! We're gonna have to
call it!
Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming
across the horizon.
CURTIS
Happy hour starts at five Dewart!
DEWART
(TO HIMSELF)
Not if it's rainin'...Ready?
CURTIS
Oh, yeah.
Samantha walks briskly, talking to the other children.
SAMANTHA
You guys okay?
SUE
Yeah.
Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues
banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the
child sees her mother, she stops.
Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board
away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at
the same time.
SAMANTHA
No. Don't touch.
Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha
touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
(signing and speaking)
You understand?
Hannah nods once, "yes".
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Oksy. Come here.
Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the
back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the
ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with
two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky.
She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her
pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh.
Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the
approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks
back inside.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.
THUNDER STRIKE.
The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark
soil into black mud.
6.
Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. He watches as the
hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. He lifts
his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from
the mud.
Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting
up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the
controls of the rig.
DEWART
What? It's not my fault! I told
you!
CURTIS
Yeah. All right...All right! I'm
callin' it! Shut it down!
Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.
I/E. LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
Samantha holds the front door open as Nat and Cammie leave
with their children packed up and in tow. It's raining
pretty hard outside.
SAMANTHA
Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.
NAT
I'll call next week about the Lions
Club supper.
SAMANTHA
Okay. Love you.
CAMMIE
Bye Sam.
SAMANTHA
Bye Cam.
Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat.
Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The
rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.
IN THE KITCHEN,
Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching
the rain. Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her.
She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the
glass.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?
7.
Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and
signs "s-t-o-r-m". Hannah turns to see her mother's face,
and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol.
Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Storm.
Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm
together.
I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/DEWART'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard
as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water. He
cracks it open and takes an extended sip.
Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his
drunk friend.
CURTIS
I gotta get home.
DEWART
Nat and me been lookin' into a
threesome. We've been chattin' with
a girl online from Canton. Yeah.
Big `ol girl.
CURTIS
What's big?
DEWART
She's about two fifty, two seventy
five. She can't be no taller than
5 foot.
Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.
CURTIS
Shit man.
The laughing subsides.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I don't see me and Sam gettin' into
somethin' like that.
DEWART
No. I don't guess you would.
Dewart is staring at Curtis.
DEWART (CONT'D)
You got a good life Curtis.
8.
Curtis shrugs.
DEWART (CONT'D)
I'm serious. I think that's the
best compliment you can give a man,
take a look at his life and say,
that's good. That guy's doin'
somethin' right.
CURTIS
Well. It ain't always so easy.
DEWART
Hell I know that.
Dewart sees something out his window.
DEWART (CONT'D)
Ah shit. I gotta go...Manana.
CURTIS
Good night.
Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the
maze of junk on their front lawn.
Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as
she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts
into drive and pulls away.
Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow.
He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic
playscape in the middle of the backyard.
The dog, Red, paces by the back door. He's agitated, but his
movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his
collar to a nearby post. He barks.
THUNDER STRIKES.
Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and
sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected
by the noise.
To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the
corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland
that runs up to his property.
Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete
culvert that leads out to the open field.
A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there.
Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the
rope tied to his collar.
Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the
ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a
circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder.
10.
A light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks
into the air. He gnashes at the rope.
Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to
the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and studies
the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid.
With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy
tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE
TORNADOS out in the field.
Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He
thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies toward
Curtis and Hannah.
Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time to
set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm.
They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming down
hard now.
Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries
his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams
from the wound.
Curtis screams in pain.
Curtis and Dewart walk to Curtis' truck.
CURTIS
Hey, I gotta make a stop before we
head out there.
DEWART
Think we got time?
CURTIS
Yeah. There's time.
The wheels of the well-drilling rig are half sunk into the
muddy soil.
Curtis stands over the hole being drilled. The turning metal
pole suddenly seizes up and stops. Smoke begins to seep up
from the hole.
CURTIS
Sonofabitch.
Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.
DEWART
We stripped that bit.
CURTIS
Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta
re-set it.
Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab
of the drilling rig and checks his watch.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Shit.
Something catches his eye in the distance. Clearing past the
rig, he walks out into the adjacent field.
He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland
that stretch for miles in front of him.
In the sky overhead,
14.
AN ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS ROLL IN UNISON.
Hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts
in the air. They dive bomb then ascend in intricate,
GEOMETRIC patterns.
Curtis watches, mesmerized.
Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches
in reverse.
DEWART
Curtis!
Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the
pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps
to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography.
Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking
with the SOUND of metal on metal.
CURTIS
You ever see birds fly like that?!
DEWART
(holding his hand to his
EAR)
What?!
Curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review.
I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/HOUSE - EVENING
The sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky. Curtis
steers his truck up to the front curb of his house.
THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD,
He sees Samantha standing by her car, the back door open.
She watches him pull up. Hannah is already packed into her
car seat.
CURTIS
(TO HIMSELF)
Shit.
PARKED,
Curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway.
SAMANTHA
Come on we gotta go.
CURTIS
Ah, Jesus. I could really use a
shower.
15.
Samantha isn't having it. She climbs in the passenger seat.
Curtis makes his way to her car.
The reverse lights shine as Curtis' pick-up rumbles backward.
Curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into
his backyard. In the mirror, the trash pile comes into view.
Just behind it, the STORM SHELTER doors appear.
The truck shutters to a stop. Curtis studies the Shelter in
the side mirror for a moment. A grassy bulge with angled
metal doors peeking over the trash heap. He climbs out.
A blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating
down to the yard.
Curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye
the Storm Shelter. He yanks a bale of chain-link from the
bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the
yard. He steals another glance back toward the Shelter.
21.
Dropping the bale, he sizes up the space. He looks to the
sky. It's a beautiful day.
He begins counting off steps from the back fence line.
-A mallet drives tall metal stakes into the ground.
-The cord holding together the bale of chain-link is snipped
and a boot rolls the fencing out flat.
-Chain-link is attached to the stakes with a number of metal
braids.
-The prefab DOGHOUSE is set down in the back corner.
Curtis stands in front of his newly created dog pen. It's
waist high and about 7' X 10', tucked in the back left corner
of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the
existing fencing.
Curtis unlatches a piece of the braided wire holding a
separated section of fencing that acts like a gate.
CURTIS
Red! Come on.
23.
He opens it and looks down at Red, who sits at his feet. He
speaks gently to the dog.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Get in.
Red walks into the pen.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Good boy.
Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the
fence. Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis'
fingers. Curtis scratches him.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I'm sorry about this buddy. We
just gotta work it like this for
awhile okay?
Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. He sees
the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. He
looks down at Red.
Curtis walks to the Shelter. Clearing past the trash pile,
the shelter appears, the mound fully visible.
Curtis stops at the angled doors. He studies them. A rusted
padlock is snapped shut across the handles. He reaches out
and lifts up the padlock. He yanks on it, then lets it fall.
Curtis walks back out to the storm shelter, keys in hand,
long flashlight in his back pocket.
He pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors
together. Popping off the rubber cover, he tries a key. The
lock pops up. He unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall
to the ground.
Curtis strains to pull the first door open. It's heavy and
sticks from lack of use. Finally, with a creak, the door
swings back.
24.
Curtis holds his head to the side, a musty odor coming from
inside. He forces the second door open.
Curtis stands in front of the shelter, a gaping black hole
angled up from the earth.
He takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on. It
illuminates concrete steps leading down.
The dog, nose at the fence, watches from his pen on the other
side of the yard.
Curtis enters the shelter.
Curtis leads Hannah up the front walk of the Grafton Public
Library. It's a one-story brick building with 1960's
architecture. The parking lot is nearly empty behind them.
The construction site sits in the middle of open farmland but
is considerably more involved than Curtis' last job site.
Dump trucks, backhoes and cement mixers roll and beep across
muddy ground. A 20 MAN CREW operates throughout.
NEAR THE WELL DRILLING RIG,
Dewart pushes down a lever that activates the hydraulic lift
for the drill. Curtis appears behind him.
CURTIS
Hey Dewart!
DEWART
(HALF TURNING)
What you say Curtis?
CURTIS
Not much.
Curtis kneels at the ground beside the rig. Sifts dirt
through his fingers.
DEWART
They want us to get a pilot hole
drilled by lunch. I figure worse
comes to worse we can eat on the
rig.
CURTIS
Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend
all right?
DEWART
Yeah. Same old shit.
It's lunchtime. The men sit around in different groups
eating out of bagged lunches.
Curtis eats a sandwich and watches the men. Some bitching.
Others laughing.
38.
Wind blows through a wooded area nearby. He watches the
leaves move. He looks to the sky. It's a beautiful day.
Almost peaceful.
The insurance office sits in a row of small downtown
buildings.
INSURANCE AGENT (O.S.)
No. I need the name of the
specialist whose diagnosis you'll
accept.
Curtis and Dewart attach a drill bit to the rig.
CURTIS
You want me to come there and do it
for you? Jesus.
Curtis steadies the large metal piece as Dewart ratchets it
down.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hey, how much food do you think
you'd need to live on for a week?
DEWART
What do you mean?
CURTIS
I mean to stay alive. What do you
think you'd need?
DEWART
Not a lot.
CURTIS
You think?
DEWART
I don't know. You hear about
people livin' for days all the time
offa bark and melted snow.
CURTIS
I've never heard of that.
DEWART
Shit I don't know. You asked the
question.
CURTIS
It's on there. It's on. Come on.
43.
Curtis steps back from the arm of the drill. Dewart taps the
wrench on two bolts to make sure they are secure.
A LOUD BOOM RATTLES. THUNDER.
Curtis flinches at the sound.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Dammit.
DEWART
What?
Curtis turns around and checks the sky. It's clear blue.
Not a cloud in sight.
CURTIS
It sounds like thunder.
DEWART
What sounds like thunder?
BOOM. ANOTHER THUNDER STRIKE.
Curtis doesn't move. He watches Dewart walk to the controls
of the drilling rig.
MORE THUNDER. ROLLING NOW.
Curtis steps back from the rig and checks the horizons.
Nothing. It's a beautiful day.
Dewart looks down at him. Curtis' face is pale, scared.
Curtis looks at him. Not sure what to say. Curtis turns and
walks to his truck.
DEWART (CONT'D)
Where you goin'? Curtis. Where you
goin'?
BY CURTIS' TRUCK,
Curtis stops and rests his hands on the bed of the truck.
Another THUNDER STRIKE makes him flinch.
Curtis VOMITS next to the back tire.
He quickly stands, wiping his mouth. He checks over his
shoulders to see if anyone has seen him.
I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/RURAL HIGHWAY - MOVING - DAY
Curtis studies his face in the rearview mirror as he sails
down the rural highway.
44.
He rubs his eyes with the back of his hand and looks in the
side mirror. The horizon is still clear.
Curtis begins to hyperventilate. Short breaths accompanied
by cold sweat. Sucking air. He can't breath. He panics.
The truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly
slams on the brakes and steers off the highway.
Dust settles outside as Curtis begins to get his breathing
under control. He rests his head on the steering wheel and
shuts his eyes tight.
Everything quiets down. His breathing. The road. No more
thunder.
Curtis looks out his passenger window.
His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot. A
rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on
it reads, "CONTAINERS FOR SALE".
Curtis stares at this. He climbs out of the truck.
Curtis walks around his truck to get a better look at the
depot. The dirt lot is piled high with containers.
He studies the "FOR SALE" sign, then a smaller sign next to
it that lists available sizes.
Curtis turns back to his truck and rubs his face, still
shaking things off. He looks up at the sky. Clear and blue.
A thought comes to him. He checks his watch.
I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/INTERSTATE - DAY
Curtis drives down a divided four-lane interstate.
Curtis' truck pulls into the parking lot of the Pleasant
Grove Apartments. It's a well manicured, new construction
facility. The words "AN ASSISTED LIVING COMMUNITY" are
written under the apartment name on the sign out front.
The relatively new gas station sits just off the interstate.
Curtis stands at the pump filling up his truck.
He watches the numbers next to the dollar sign roll higher.
He looks back at the busy freeway. Cars passing.
The pump stops. The final amount reads, "$68.79". He hangs
the hose back onto the pump and pulls a cell phone from his
pocket. He dials and waits.
CURTIS
(into the phone)
May I have the number for Doctor
George Shannan?
(WAITS)
Thanks.
Curtis, phone still at his ear, turns and watches the
horizon. The sun hangs low in the sky. A reddish haze.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I
speak with him? This is Curtis
LaForche.
(WAITS)
Hey Doc. Yeah, sorry...Sorry to
call you at home, I just don't
think I can make it to Columbus to
see that psychiatrist. Yeah, it's
just too far. Is there somewhere
local you can send me?
48.
The backyard is almost pitch black. Curtis stands in front
of the storm shelter doors holding out the Coleman Lantern.
49.
He surveys the backyard with it. The trash pile has been
removed leaving the yard more open.
Curtis begins to count steps out from the left edge of the
shelter doors. He counts to himself, three feet per stride.
He begins to outline a rectangle.
Curtis opens the door to his truck which is parked in the
bank's lot. He unbuttons his starched white shirt and places
it on the truck seat.
He pulls out a dirty blue work shirt and begins buttoning it.
Dewart sits at the controls of the drilling rig. He sees
Curtis approaching through the construction site. Curtis
waves two fingers at him. Dewart shuts down the drill.
CURTIS
Hey.
DEWART
Hey.
CURTIS
Sorry I left you yesterday.
51.
Dewart hops down and the two approach the drill site. Dewart
seems sullen.
DEWART
Jim came by. I covered for you.
CURTIS
Thanks.
DEWART
I need your help with the depth
charts.
CURTIS
Sure.
Curtis and Dewart sit on the drilling rig eating lunch.
DEWART
Fuckin' Nat put me in charge of
frying oysters for that Lions Club
supper.
CURTIS
You need another burner?
DEWART
Yeah, if you still got yours I
could use it.
CURTIS
You think you could help me with
somethin'?
DEWART
Whatta you need?
CURTIS
I'm gonna build out the tornado
shelter in my backyard. I could
use some help.
DEWART
The hell you wanna do that for?
CURTIS
Just needs to be done.
Dewart eyes him, unsure.
DEWART
What do you need?
52.
CURTIS
I figure I'll do it on Saturday,
borrow some equipment from work.
DEWART
You sure about that?
CURTIS
I just need a backhoe, a hauler.
I'll rent the rest.
Dewart stares off into the distance. He notices Curtis
looking at him, waiting for an answer.
DEWART
Yeah. Whatever. I'll help.
CURTIS
Thanks.
DEWART
You all right man?
CURTIS
What do you mean?
DEWART
I just don't wanna see you fuck up.
CURTIS
I'm not.
Curtis stands and talks with a MAN in the middle of the
Tractor Trailer Depot just off the highway. The Man points
to a row of shipping containers and uses his hands to mimic
how one would be lowered.
They shake hands and Curtis walks away.
The Community Health Center is a one-level, aged brick
building.
Samantha's car pulls up and parks on the opposite side of the
street from their house. She gets out, puzzled by the
Backhoe and Trailer parked in front of her house.
Huge light brown tracks of dirt stripe the concrete driveway.
Leading Hannah by the hand, Samantha follows the tracks to
the backyard.
IN THE BACKYARD,
Samantha stops, mouth agape, stunned by what she sees.
A 20 foot by 8 foot wide hole that is 10 feet deep sits in
the middle of her yard. Smaller trenches lead out from it.
Dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of
the yard. He digs dirt from underneath his fingernails with
a pocket knife. Seeing Samantha, he waves a hand.
Curtis' head appears from the hole. He stops when he sees
Samantha. They stare at one another. He can see her
surprise. He continues up the ladder and walks over to her.
Dewart watches from the back of the yard.
CURTIS
Hey. It's all right. Calm down.
Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Samantha.
SAMANTHA
Are you out of your mind?
She continues into the house. Curtis turns, frustrated.
Dewart takes this in, then goes back to his nails.
58.
The ambulance lights splash across the house. Curtis escorts
TWO EMTs down the front walk. He favors his left leg,
walking with a slight limp.
CURTIS
I'm sorry you fellows had to come
all the way out.
EMT
It's what we do. Now we can still
take you in if you want a doctor to
look at those cuts in your mouth.
CURTIS
Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see
somebody on Monday.
EMT
All right.
CURTIS
Thanks.
Curtis shakes their hands. He turns to walk back in the
house and notices NEIGHBORS watching from their porches.
Curtis stands with Russell over the hood of a pick-up truck.
They look over a roll of ground water charts.
Russell talks and points to the map, but Curtis' attention is
focused elsewhere. He watches Dewart in the distance.
RUSSELL
...this point just to the west. I
don't think we'll have any problem.
We should be able to get twenty,
maybe thirty in this next week. But
we're looking to see how that's
gonna shape up, so...
Dewart smiles and makes broad gestures with his arms. He's
telling a story to Dave, who laughs hard.
RUSSELL (CONT'D)
Curtis?
His attention snaps back.
CURTIS
Yeah.
64.
RUSSELL
What do you think?
CURTIS
Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get
it done.
Russell rolls up the charts. They walk toward the work site,
toward Dewart.
The sun has just set and a purple hue hangs over everything.
Curtis stands in the very back of the yard and watches a MAN
guide a long, flatbed trailer up the driveway. An 18 foot
metal SHIPPING CONTAINER rides on the back.
Curtis stands at the driver's door of his pick-up. The box
sits on the seat in front of him. He opens it and removes
one of the gas masks.
He stares into its vacant plastic eyes. He drops the mask
back into the box and shakes his head. Sighs, frustrated
with it all.
He checks over his shoulder, scans the parking lot.
Curtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in
the hole roughly a foot below the yard. Wearing tinted
goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container
with a small blowtorch.
The sparks stop and Curtis raises the goggles to inspect his
work. He kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the
metal falls into the container.
68.
He sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a
cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole.
KYLE (O.S.)
What the hell are you doin'?
Curtis smiles to himself. He turns to find KYLE(42) standing
at the edge of the hole. His hands are tucked into the back
of his jeans and he's sizing up the work.
Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto
ground level. He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never
taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter.
KYLE (CONT'D)
What you got goin' on here?
CURTIS
Just addin' on to the storm
shelter.
KYLE
Why?
CURTIS
Just `cause.
Kyle notices the PVC piping running in the trenches.
KYLE
You runnin' water to it?
CURTIS
Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin'
sewer out to the city line.
KYLE
How much you spendin' on this
thing?
CURTIS
It's not bad.
KYLE
Doesn't look it.
Curtis shrugs. Kyle sees his reluctance.
KYLE (CONT'D)
You take your eye off the ball one
minute in this economy and you're
screwed. You got the cash for
this?
CURTIS
Yeah.
69.
KYLE
Don't put nothin' on credit cards.
That shit'll eat you up.
CURTIS
I'm not.
Kyle is staring him down. Curtis just looks at the shelter.
There's a long silence shared between them.
KYLE
Samantha called me.
CURTIS
I figured.
Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues
installing the roof vent.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Called you to come tell me to quit?
KYLE
She called `cause she's worried.
Says you've been stressed out.
Curtis doesn't answer.
KYLE (CONT'D)
So?
CURTIS
So what?
KYLE
You stressed out?
CURTIS
No. No more than anybody else.
KYLE
Work all right?
CURTIS
Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come
by and have dinner sometime, Kyle.
That's fine. We'll have a beer and
talk about the old days, but you
got somethin' to say just say it.
KYLE
You can stop that shit right now.
I'll come over there and remind you
what it feels like to get your ass
whipped.
Curtis keeps his head down, scolded. Kyle relents.
70.
KYLE (CONT'D)
I'm just coming here to check on
you.
CURTIS
Well I appreciate it Kyle.
KYLE
You been to see Mom?
CURTIS
Yeah. A few days ago.
KYLE
She all right.
CURTIS
You should see her. Take your
girls.
KYLE
Yeah. I'll get around to it.
There's an awkward moment as Curtis works with his back to
Kyle.
KYLE (CONT'D)
You need a hand?
Curtis turns and looks up at him. Shakes his head.
CURTIS
No. I've got it.
Kyle nods.
KYLE
Okay. Call me if you need me okay?
CURTIS
I will.
Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward
the driveway.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hey Kyle?
Kyle turns back. Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over
to him.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Actually you could do me a favor.
KYLE
What's that?
71.
CURTIS
You still looking for a dog?
KYLE
Sure.
Kyle looks at him.
Curtis slaps down the tailgate to Kyle's truck, which is
parked in the driveway. Red, tail wagging, hops up into the
bed. Curtis closes the tailgate and sets a leash and two
bowls into the back of the truck.
Curtis rubs Red behind the ears.
CURTIS
They got a good spot for you, okay
bud.
Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck.
KYLE
You sure?
CURTIS
Yeah.
KYLE
I know it'll make my girls happy.
All right.
Kyle walks around the truck to the driver's side.
CURTIS
Hey Kyle?
KYLE
Yeah?
Kyle stops. Curtis walks up and hugs him. Kyle slaps him on
the back.
CURTIS
Take care of yourself.
KYLE
All right. All right. I will little
brother. You take care of your
family. Handle your business.
Okay?
Curtis nods. Kyle smiles, shaking his head.
72.
KYLE (CONT'D)
All right.
Kyle climbs into the truck and cranks it. Curtis steps back
as he pulls away. Red looks back from the bed of the truck.
Jim, Curtis' boss, stands with his hands on his hips looking
down at the planted shipping container. Curtis approaches.
CURTIS
Hey Jim.
JIM
Curtis. Dewart told me you took
equipment from work for a project
at your house. Said that's why you
wanted him off your crew. I came
out here to see it myself.
CURTIS
Yeah. It was just a hauler and a
backhoe. It was Saturday. I had
`em back in less than 8 hours.
JIM
You know that doesn't matter. I
can't even tell you how many rules
you broke.
(MORE)
74.
JIM (CONT'D)
What if you had an accident? Huh?
What if you ran somebody over on
your way out here? Lawsuit like
that could bankrupt me.
CURTIS
Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't
thought of that. Thank God nothin'
like that happened. You know? I'll
do whatever I can to make it right.
JIM
You can pick up your last check on
Friday. You've got two weeks
benefits.
Curtis nods. Accepts it.
CURTIS
Did you fire Dewart?
JIM
He's on two weeks leave unpaid...
I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to
yourself.
Jim turns and walks out of the backyard.
Curtis' truck is parked in the driveway with the hood up and
the engine running.
Curtis stands over the vibrating engine, studying it. He
looks at the belts. He watches them move.
Samantha steps out of the house. She walks over to Curtis,
who is standing on a grassy section of the yard over an
assortment of auto parts. They don't speak for a moment.
SAMANTHA
What's that?
CURTIS
That's the alternator from the
truck.
(MORE)
78.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I was just trying to figure out a
way to charge enough batteries to
run lights down there. Ah, what the
hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your
old exercycle.
Samantha almost smiles. Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
You gonna leave me?
Samantha looks at his hands. They hang by his sides.
SAMANTHA
You flinched when I touched your
hand this morning.
CURTIS
I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA
I was in one of your dreams?
Curtis nods.
CURTIS
Yeah.
SAMANTHA
Can you deal with that?
He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.
CURTIS
Yeah.
SAMANTHA
Okay. Then I made a decision. We
cancel the beach trip. We have
enough to cover bills for the next
two months with your last check.
I'm going to get a job. You're
gonna find another job. I'm going
to call to see if we can move
Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to
see what it costs to extend your
policy to the end of the year. I
want you to see a psychiatrist.
Not a counselor from the free
clinic. Someone good.
CURTIS
Doctor Shannan gave me the number
of somebody. But, uh, I just don't
think we can afford it.
79.
SAMANTHA
We'll find the money. Also, the
Lions Club supper's this weekend.
I want you to come with me.
CURTIS
I don't want to see any of those
people.
SAMANTHA
I want you to go. I need to do
something normal.
CURTIS
All right.
Curtis nods. Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to
the house. Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts.
Hannah stands on a toolbox and rests her elbows on the side
of Curtis' truck. The hood is open. She watches her father
fiddle with re-installing the alternator. His fingers
covered in grease.
Hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front
yard. Curtis pauses, hearing a high-pitched, warbling SOUND
in the distance. He notices Hannah is gone.
CURTIS
Hannah?
He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing
on the curb. She looks down the street. He runs down his
driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hannah!
A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns,
swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist
and bend into speckled black shapes.
Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her
by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM
CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into
his arms, stepping back from it.
The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find
the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He
turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so
powerful it knocks him backward.
He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and
wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and
scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest.
SMASH!
The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis
looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken,
rests crumpled on the hood.
SMACK!
83.
Another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him.
Then another. Curtis looks up. The Flock of birds are
circling overhead and diving down at him.
More birds crashing to the ground. Curtis covers his head.
The neighborhood's tornado SIRENS begin to sound.
Curtis rushes Hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds
plummet from the sky. The sirens BLARING.
Wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground.
Rain cuts at a sharp angle. The Tornado Sirens continue.
Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits
the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. He
passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys.
At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to
shield Hannah from the hail. Curtis gets the lock and opens
the door. They go inside.
Curtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway. Out of
the corner of his eye he catches,
A MAN PASSING BY.
Curtis is startled. He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the
power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner
of the house. A power line dangles overhead.
He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris.
Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a
storm.
Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She
surveys the damage.
CURTIS
It's fine.
She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on
the head. Curtis looks up at the sky.
Curtis scoops handfuls of sand out of a foot deep hole on the
beach. He slops the wet mixture into a castle shaped bucket,
his back to the shoreline of gentle, breaking waves.
CURTIS
(signing and speaking)
Hey. Good, huh?
Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry
sand over castle shaped mounds already formed.
The wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo. A
picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks. WIND
lifts the corner of a stack of napkins. The wind blows
harder, fanning the napkins off the table.
ON THE BEACH,
Curtis, still working in the sand, puts a top on the sand
castle.
CURTIS
Good. We put a top on it.
Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and
turns it over to top off their sand mound. He hands the
bucket over for Hannah to refill.
The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't
notice.
Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the
sand castle.
Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah
staring at the water. She looks at him and signs something
with her hands.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
What is it honey?
Curtis misses it. He shakes his head, "no", and Hannah signs
again, slowly: "S-T-O-R-M".
CURTIS (CONT'D)
What?
Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet.
He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared,
she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and
rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.
AT THE CONDO,
A gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the deck
holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili. She stops,
seeing the horizon. Her mouth falls open.
She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her
mind racing. She looks down at Curtis in disbelief.
91.
Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact. He
studies her face.
Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. She
looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis. Concern
on her face, she nods to him.
Curtis sees her nod.
Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to
apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, "I love you."
Curtis nods back to her.
She looks back up to the shoreline.
ON THE BEACH,
Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.
AT THE CONDO,
Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to
fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm
up. Dark rain collects there.
ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,
THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS. THE DARK
SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR. A STORM CELL
SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON. CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED
WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING.
Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door
clutching Hannah. The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass
next to him.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Sam.
Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous
rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.
On Samantha's face,
SAMANTHA
Okay.
THE END.
