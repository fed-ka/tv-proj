    Vincent now stands at the threshold of the terrace, facing
  into the apartment, the curtains billowing behind him...

                                      VINCENT
                                (calling)
                        Catherine.

  But there s no response.  Vincent s face reflects a
    darkening suspicion, as he turns back out onto the
    terrace, moves to the railing.                                                                                  3.

  from the side, looking out to the nightscape of Manhattan
  as if in hope of an answer, when something twinkles below,

  on a one-ounce gold coin lying on the ground beside him,
    twisted and half-melted. Vincent kneels to pick it up,
  then palms it thoughtfully, knowingly, as a voice from
  the past echoes within his memory.

                                PARACELSUS' VOICE
                  I know more about you than your
                  name. . .

    Vincent looks down at the gold coin in his palm.  Then:

                                PARACELSUS' VOICE
                        (derisive)
                  Found as a baby outside St.
                  Vincent's Hospital...

                                                            CUT TO:


  The trio forges ahead, still following the pipe along a
    rocky-walled tunnel. A light mist floats down the tunnel
    towards them, like a spirit.
