I have the ability to reach my aim

I will channel my energy towards my

NICKI'S HOUSE- DAY

Laurie is bringing out a foam board with magazine photos
collaged on to it. She's wearing a tight tank top with an
Indian symbol and brown velour sweat pants.
LAURIE
Girls, time for school!
Sam, Nicki and Emily come sit on the coach with sari fabric
thrown over it and ethnic-looking pillows. Nicki flips up her
Ray-bans slowly. Sam has messy hair, she looks like she got
home late. She's eating a bowl of cereal, Nicki's on her
Blackberry.
The room is filled with Buddha statues and Balinese wood
carved furniture and candles.
The girls are flipping through magazines.
LAURIE (CONT'D)
Put the phone away...ok you guys,
today's lesson is about character
development. In "The Secret" we
talk about the law of attraction
and we want to be careful about the
people we surround ourselves with
because we become the average of
those people. So we're going to
make a visual board of people who
are demonstrating good character,
like Angelina Jolie. So what are
some qualities you admire about
her?

How long do we have to do this for?
LAURIE
Until we're finished with this and
then we're going to do some flower
essence work.
The door bell rings, and Nicki goes to answer it.
A young guy delivering water, comes in with big bottles.

New York." We walked in, it was
unlocked, there was no alarm.
DETECTIVE (O.S.)
The door was unlocked?
MARC
Yeah, I've never even broken a

DETECTIVE
How did you find the Rolexes?
MARC
We found a safe at the bottom of a
closet with the Rolexes and like
five thousand dollars...I'll give
everything back that I still have,
and I'll find a way to repay them,
I'm really sorry about what I did.
DETECTIVE
Did you know Rebecca was leaving
the state?
MARC
I just thought she was going to
stay at her dad's cause she wasn't
getting along with her mom and step
dad.

If I tell you where everything is,

let's say I may know where this

how could that help me?
DETECTIVE
The detectives on this case are
trying to recover hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of

We've adopted her, we met in ballet
class when we were little.
LAURIE
I was friends with her mother--
NICKI
Mom, this is my interview. I met
her when my parents divorced. Now
she lives with us, my mom's home
schooled us all for a while.
LAURIE
The philosophy of `The Secret',
it's based on the law of
attraction, but my great-
grandmother and grandmother both
studied this philosophy. It's man's
relationship to the Divine, that's
what energy science means.
NICKI
Since I was young I learned about
every religion.
KATE
So, Sam was in your ballet class,
did she have parents?
NICKI
She had a dysfunctional background,
we both did...

Nicki, I don't want you to answer

NICKI
I think that I'm a firm... I have a
good statement to say.
KATE
She can speak generally.
NICKI
I'm not gonna speak about the case,
what I was going to say is that I'm
a firm believer in karma and I
think this situation was attracted
into my life as a huge learning
lesson for me to grow and expand as
a spiritual human being.
Nicki is getting emotional as she speaks, her voice quivers.
NICKI (CONT'D)
I don't think the universe chose a

the health of our planet--
Nicki starts to get teary eyed.
SHANNON
Nicki has expressed to me a lot of
her humanitarianism.
NICKI
It's my main goal. God didn't give
me these talents and what I look

KATE
And now you're a star.
Marc laughs.
MARC
On my Facebook page recently I had
800 friends requests, I accepted
them all, I didn't even look at
them, then I noticed someone had
created a fan page for me. If it
had been for something I had done
to help the community or benefit
something I'd love it, but it's
just kind of awkward for me that
these people are loving me for
something that's looked down on in
society... It's kinda showing that
America has some sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of
