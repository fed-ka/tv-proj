A HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of
the Bastille. PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes
as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.
SUPER: PARIS, 1641
The many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters.
SUPER: NATO HEADQUARTERS, BELGIUM
MCCULLEN (V.0.)
War used to be the exception. Now
it is the new state of play, a
constant, unavoidable...
The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates,
passing a sign: "MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE". Two
BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy.
The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by
the rising sun. Below them, the convoy is thundering down a
winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range.
A RADAR DISH on the rear Cougar sweeps vigilantly. Inside, a
SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER watches the RADAR MONITOR, clear
except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks.
In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out.
RIPCORD
Hey Duke, ya know how they always
tell you to empty your head of
distracting thoughts on these runs?
DUKE
Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.
RIPCORD
And you know how people sometimes
joke that it must be easy fr me to
keep my mind empty?
DUKE
Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty
of thoughts up there.
(into radio)
Keep rear security tight, boys.
11.
RIPCORD
Well, the second I try and make
myself not have thoughts, I always
have 'em. Like now, know what I'm
thinking about?
DUKE
Please don't say the Air Forces.
RIPCORD
The Air Forces.
DUKE
I thought we were done with that
discussion.
RIPCORD
You were done with it, not me.
Look, I loev flying...
Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:
RIPCORD (CONT'D)
I've been flying since I was
thirteen years old.
Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.
DUKE
I don't think your daddy's crop
duster counts as hours logged.
RIPCORD
Jets, man, jets. You know I always
qualify when I'm on leave.
DUKE
Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get
up in the air, we'll get you a
trampoline back at the base.
RIPCORD
We've done ten years in the Army, I
just think we should see if the
grass really is greener.
DUKE
This continues to be the stupidest
idea you've ever come up with, nd
that's saying something.
RIPCORD
Funny. Real funny.
12.
DUKE
I don't wanna transfer to the Air
Force, okay?
RIPCORD
It's always about you, isn't it?
Give me one good reason?
DUKE
I want to be in the fight, not
flying over it.
RIPCORD
Won't be saying that when you call
in an air strike and I come
screaming in to save your--
DUKE
--Eyes on the road, Rip.
Behind the Blackhawks and the convoy an ominous, DARK SHAPE
suddenly drops INTO FRAME. ENGINE EXHAUST blurs our view of
the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy.
On the rear Cougar's RADAR SCREEN, we see the two Blackhawk
signatures still appearing in position.. .but nothing else.
Too late. CONCUSSION CANNONS slide out of ports on both sides
of the dark shape. They fire simultaneously. The SUBATOMIC
BLASTS punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a
beer can on your forehead. It explodes and drops.
13.
Duke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of
them, blocking the convoy's path. Rip hits the brakes.
RIPCORD
Jesus Christ! Bird Down!
DUKE
(urgent, but utterly calm)
Back up! Back up! Back up!
(into radio)
Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
are under attack. Repeat --we are
under attack!
The second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's
like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six JET
THRUSTERS. It's a next-gen "TYPHOON" GUNSHIP.
The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI-
GUNS. But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor.
The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching
it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending
it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the
rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy.
The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof-
turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again. The
blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally
flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet.
Duke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into RADIO:
DUKE
Out! Everyone get out of the
vehicles! Now!
A final CONCUSSION BLAST lands between the last two vehicles
now. Spinning the Grizzly. It's WINDOWS SHATTER and a
thousand lethal GLASS SHARDS shoot inside, killing the
drivers. The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch.
14.
A SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six
"VIPERS", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black
BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES. They exit
the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left.
The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE
with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the
Viers' armor. The Vipers fire back, the impact from their
pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and
fling them backwards.
Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them
toward the Typhoon. The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the
air with their pulse rifles. It EXPLODES well out of range as
the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the
pack. Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six
feet underground. A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot.
Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon. Long,
slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in
black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR. She's beautiful, exotic, and
most of all, lethal. She's known in certain circles only as
"THE BARONESS" but we will know her as ANA. Her DARK GLASSES
glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly.
The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up
to shoot her. But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS.
BOOM! BOOM! The shots crush both soldiers.
15.
Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows
the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside.
She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the WEAPONS
CASE.
Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell.
RIPCORD
Duke?
DUKE
Shut up.
RIPCORD
If I die...
DUKE
You're not gonna die.
RIPCORD
I just want you to know... you never
could run worth a damn.
DUKE
Jesus, Rip.
RIPCORD
I'm just saying, it's be nice if
you could move a little faster.
And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana
turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go
ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of
her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke.
DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.
DUKE
Stay here.
RIPCORD
(really messed up)
Sure.
DUKE
I'm gettin' that package.
Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs
up the embankment. --And comes face to face with a Viper, who
raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away. A hand
clamps down over the barrel.
The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a
flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.
16.
Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn
clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes.
DUKE (CONT'D)
What the hell...?
Her face softens hesitantly.
ANA
Hello, Duke...
Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face,
knocks him out on his ass.
ANA (CONT'D)
You have to admit you had that
coming.
Ana struggles with something going on inside her head. Then
her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the
first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.
ANA (CONT'D)
Good-bye, Duke.
Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something
behind Duke. It's a "HOWLER" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the
scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees
to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump
to his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls-
ass.
A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and
lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he
draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper. Then he
glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far
away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.
BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in
the space of six breathless seconds.
Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES
sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking
Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass
defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse
burst just missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana,
his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE
BURSTS crackling past his head. He curses under his breath:
DUKE
Air Force.. .right.
17.
A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips
through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA
"SCARLETT" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler,
holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL. She lines up on
another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the GRIZZLY.
But Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL viewfinder snapped an image of
his FACE ARMOR. She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake-
Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's
LED SCREEN. Then she fires behind her, in the complete other
direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns
around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover,
the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.
Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but
LAMONT "HEAVY DUTY" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler
holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER. Only a man this
big can carry such a weapon.
HEAVY DUTY
Time to lay down some bass!
He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You
blink, you miss it. BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty,
but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE
THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The CONCUSSION BLASTS
whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging
awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.
The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.
The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS
and rip them apart. The Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the
recovering Typhoon. Duke races after her through a hail of
pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.
DUKE
Ana!
She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest
and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates, because of
the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.
SCARLETT
The warheads!
Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana
backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon. Duke charges like a
bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free.
Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes
after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray
gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon,
which is raked by the bullets.
18.
Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky
and disappears over a rise ...
SILENCE... Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach
Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild.
DUKE
Stand down! Stand the hell down!
HEAVY DUTY
Lower your weapon, Sir. We're not
the enemy.
DUKE
Pointing weapons at me doesn't make
you my friend.
ABEL "BREAKER" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:
BREAKER
Please hand over the case, sir.
DUKE
I don't know who you are, and I
sure as hell don't know who they
are, and until I find out, I'm not
lowering anything or handling
anything over.
CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle.
RIPCORD
What's your unit?
SCARLETT
That's classified.
Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his
belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back.
BREAKER
Someone would like a word with you.
Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke,
which projects a 3D IMAGE OF GENERAL HAWK. Duke is stunned.
HAWK
State you name and rank.
DUKE
.you first.
19.
HAWK
My team just saved your life. now's
the part where you say "thank you".
DUKE
Those aren't the words that come to
mind just now. We weren't told
about any support for this mission,
so you better tell your team to
stand down.
Ripcord eyes his sight.
RIPCORD
Happy to turn this into a turkey
shoot.
Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.
HAWK
You must be... Ripcord, expert
marksman, weapons specialist, jet
QUALIFIED--
RIPCORD
(to Duke)
Told ya.
HAWK
I'm General Clayton Abernathy. You
may have heard of me, .Duke.
A glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods.
DUKE
General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO
Forward Command...
Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and
starts sweeping a scanner across the case. Hawk smiles.
HAWK
That was my last job.
(a twinkle in his eye)
I'm in a whole new outfit now.
Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head. Breaker flinches.
BREAKER
Just need to deactivate its
tracking beacon, for security.
20.
HAWK
Hand over the weapons case son, and
let us deliver the warheads.
DUKE
No way. I signed for 'em. My
mission, my package. I carry them,
I deliver them.
Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING
promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke.
BREAKER
Wasn't hard, was it?
DUKE
Fine. But you seem to be a little
short on transportation a the
moment. Team Alpha will deliver you
to me.
DUKE (CONT'D)
And where exactly are you, General?
The Howler skims over the GIANT PYRAMIDS OF GIZA, a caravan
of camels below. The aircraft continues out into the golden
desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it.
And a huge sand dune directly in front of Howler spirals open
to reveal a CAVERNOUS HOLE. The Howler's THRUSTERS twist
vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole.
SUPER: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity.
McCullen turns as Ana appears on a HOLO-PROJECTOR behind him.
MCCULLEN
I spend five years setting this up.
Wringing money out of NATO. This
was supposed to be the easy part.
ANA
If you'd let me stage the assault
at your precious factory, we could
have contained the situation.
MCCULLEN
And lost the trust of our clients
in the process? It had to be NATO's
fault.
(steps closer)
What happened? Did you hesitate?
ANA
You're implying this was about some
ancient history? That's as
laughable as your Intel. What went
wrong was the Joes appearing out of
nowhere.
He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.
MCCULLEN
Forgive me, jealousy isn't my
strong suit.
ANA
Forget that, where are we now? Have
you tracked the case?
MCCULLEN
They deactivated the beacon. I gave
them a code to quietly re-arm it.
McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP
OF THE WORLD. A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the
Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.
MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
There it is. The infamous Pit.
ANA
I will get those warheads back.
30.
McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his
hand going right through her. McCullen whispers menacingly.
MCCULLEN
I hope so.
ANA
(diffusing the threat)
If I were really there, I might
actually let you touch me.
MCCULLEN
(sly smile)
I'll send a jet.
ANA
Business first. Besides, I'm
married, remember?
Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.
MCCULLEN
Sometimes I really hate technology.
He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:
STORM SHADOW (O.S.)
It is most often used by those
without honor.
McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean
man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other
side of the room.
MCCULLEN
There can't be any more mistakes.
The schedule can't be compromised
any further.
STORM SHADOW
If you had sent me, it would be
done.
MCCULLEN
(walking towards him)
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
To the Baroness's villa. .Make
sure her commitment doesn't waiver.
Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now
realize Storm Shadow was a holo-proj. Storm Shadow vanishes.
31.
McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window. WE PULL
BACK out of the window to reveal that he's riding through
DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN inside a next-gen "TRIDENT" submarine.
CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK to show the Trident approaching the
docking bay of a MASSIVE FACILITY built into the seabed under
the jagged canopy of the POLAR ICE CAP. The place is defended
by several HARPOON CANNONS and a fearsome TURBO-LASER. It's a
breath-taking sight, but also a little frightening.
A BLACK, BEEFED-UP SUV drives towards a magnificent mansion
in the Parisian suburbs. Though the vehicle looks relatively
harmless, we'll come to know it as a "SCARAB" attack truck.
SUPER: PARIS, FRANCE
Duke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of
Washington shimmering beyond them. He suddenly kneels down
in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand.
Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes.
DUKE
I've been wanting to do this before
we deploy.
ANA
Duke...it's beautiful. It's too
nice you lunatic.
DUKE
Only time I'm buying one of these,
so why not?
They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws
up his face, worried?
DUKE (CONT'D)
Well, what do you say?
She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear:
REX (O.S.)
Say yes, you idiot...!
Lieutenant REX LEWIS saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his
collar. The look on his face tells us he's happy for them.
REX (CONT'D)
.Before I tell my new brother-in-
law what it's like to share a
bathroom with you.
DUKE
Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.
REX
I was coming to offer you a ride
back to post.
ANA
Time already?
DUKE
We go at oh-five hundred.
41.
ANA
Is it WMDs? It is, right? That's
why you're pulling Rex out of the
LAB--
DUKE
Ana, we can't--
ANA
Yeah, yeah. Classified. Top
Secret. Have to kill me if you
told me, blah, blah, blah.
DUKE
Speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered.
ANA
Yes. Of course it's yes. On one
CONDITION--
She grabs REX and pulls him down on his knees next to Duke.
ANA (CONT'D)
Promise me that you won't let my
genius egghead brother get hurt.
(looks at Rex)
He's the only family I've got left.
(back to Duke)
Promise me.
DUKE
I promise.
She smiles and holds out her hand. He threads the ring onto
her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint
of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered
doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.
DUKE (CONT'D)
Jesus, Rip.
Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:
RIPCORD
How was I supposed know she was
married!?
(then, notices the ring)
Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?
DUKE
I'm done proposing.
42.
ANA
I already said yes.
RIPCORD
Not official until you answer my
question. Do you love my boy?
ANA
Always and forever.
Ripcord flips open his CELL PHONE and takes the photo of Ana
that Duke carries with him.
RIPCORD
Now I've gotta find someone to love
me, as many times as possible for
the next three hours.
WE PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.
The sun is sinking, turning the dunes a brilliant orange.
The HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a
FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars. All of a sudden,
MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking
him over. He stares at them as they abruptly disappear
deeper under the sand, like diving submarines.
--and fly up through the hole where their Typhoon gunship
rockets up. They fly in through a door as four Joe ANTI-
AIRCRAFT TURRETS spring out of the sand, firing away at the
Typhoon as it speeds away into the dark desert night...
Dawn light shimmers across the reflecting pool, the Lincoln
Memorial, the Washington Monument.
SUPER: WASHINGTON D.C.
A TEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ORPHAN BOY, cold from the rain and
desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he
looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side
of a wall and gate MARKED WITH RED CLAN MARKINGS.
INSIDE THE TEMPLE: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the
Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter. As he
takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED
CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow,
healthy, wealthy, and well fed.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW
Thief !
He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake-
Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot. They fight
fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and
furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm
Shadow's classic training gives him the edge. He finally
traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his
face. He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot ...
HARD MASTER (O.S.)
(Japanese, subtitled)
Enough! Storm Shadow!
A Ninja Master steps forward. Storm Shadow turns to him.
60.
YOUNG STORM SHADOW
(Japanese, subtitled)
Father, he was stealing. We need to
call the magistrate.
HARD MASTER
(Japanese, subtitled)
He is hungry. We need to invite him
in and show him the way.
STORM SHADOW
He's a cur! A Frenchie!
HARD MASTER
He doesn't fight like one.
The two young warriors glare at one another.
HARD MASTER (CONT'D)
(Japanese, subtitled)
Now what shall be your clan name?
Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes
furiously. Hard Master just smiles, AHl
AND WE FLASH BACK TO: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands
up and walk off...
And then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at
Mach three. It's the Howler.
CAMERA PANS AROUND a village choked by thick jungle as
EXPLOSIONS erupt in SLO-MO and a BLACKHAWK circles, ROTORS
beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality.
DOWN IN THE VILLAGE: Duke leads a frontal assault of the main
building. They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down.
Other GUARDS flee. The way to the door is cleared. Duke gives
hand signals along with his commands.
DUKE
Go, Bravo.
Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They
disappear inside.
Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his
hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his
shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats.
One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals "ALL
CLEAR." Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder.
DUKE (CONT'D)
You're good to go, Rex. You don't
find it in four minutes, get out of
there, because that house won't be
standing in five. I already called
for the air strike.
Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low
to the door, entering the house. Duke watches him go, then
looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars. Duke
takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the
mortar rounds start to hit.
The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke,
Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover.
We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle,
firing. Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire.
67.
RIPCORD
I've gotta level with ya!
DUKE
I hate it when you level with me.
RIPCORD
Gonna be a long five minutes.
Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the
distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS.
RIPCORD (CONT'D)
I love that sound...
But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.
DUKE
No, no, no... It's too soon.
ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across
the sky. Duke looks back at the main building.
DUKE (CONT'D)
Rex.
Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions
all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker buster. Duke
dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke
is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely
registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles
toward the smoking. Flaming rubble that was the building.
The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the
tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black smoke washes over
Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris.
RIPCORD
Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've
got wounded! And incoming enemy!
Lots of 'em!
DUKE
I can't.
RIPCORD
Nothing you can do. Come on...!
Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from
the ruins of the house.
68.
Paris by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory.
Ana's SCARAB ATTACK TRUCK pulls up to a GUARD SHED outside a
large building which is surrounded by an ELECTRIFIED FENCE. A
SECURITY GUARD steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's
window. The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the BACKSEAT
WINDOW, revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back. The guard
smiles at Ana. They speak in French, subtitled.
SECURITY GUARD
Good Morning. Baroness.
ANA
Good morning. Gene. My husband's
expecting me.
SECURITY GUARD
Absolument.
The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab
drives up to the building.
A BRAWLER charges through the streets. On the outside it
looks like your Uncle's R.V, but inside it's all next-gen.
70.
The Brawler races up towards the lab, they see it out their
forward windows.
HEAVY DUTY
There it is.
Ana and Storm Shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the
back of the Scarab as the two Neo-Vipers climb in the front.
The Security Guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and
glances at the oncoming Scarab just as a Neo-Viper leans out
with his PULSE RIFLE and blasts the whole shed to pieces.
The Scarab crashes right out the gate.
72.
At the same time, the Brawler reaches the laboratory and
there's a split second where both sides see each other in
their windows. Duke and Ana lock eyes. Snake-Eyes and Storm
Shadow do the same.
BREAKER
That's them!
Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto
the street as the Brawler still moves, running right at the
Scarab which turns to get away. Scarlett immediately follows
him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator suit.
Ana leans out of her window and fires her PULSE PISTOLS at
the Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside. Then she fires at
Snake-Eyes and Scarlett. Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts
nail Scarlett. She crashes hard. Snake-Eyes glances at her.
SCARLETT
Keep going!
With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back
of the vehicle as it tears away. The Brawler stops right
next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suit
FRITZING.
SCARLETT (CONT'D)
(to Duke and Ripcord)
Don't worry about me, go and help
Snake-Eyes!
Duke doesn't need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs
after the Scarab. Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.
BREAKER
Careful. They're worth millions of
dollars... each.
RIPCORD
Millions of dollars, got it.
He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself
up. Gets hit by a car. Picks himself up again.
RIPCORD (CONT'D)
(to Driver)
Sorry! Excusem moil
(to a stunned Breaker)
Won't happen again.
73.
Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke.
An ACCORDIAN BUS passes casually through an intersection.
All of a sudden, the Scarab bursts through it, ripping it in
two and barrelling on down the busy street. Snake-Eyes is
still barely clinging to the back.
Breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his
SATELLITE VIEW as Heavy Duty drives through the city streets.
BREAKER
Christ, they just shot right
through a bus!
Duke and Rip charge after the Scarab. Their speedometers
reading 15mph...then 30mph...then 40mph. they leap over and
around speeding cars and trucks.
The Scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path, leaving a
trail of destruction for Duke and Ripcord to leap over or
dart around in their suits. Ana and Storm Shadow hear Snake-
Eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and
shoot at him. But Snake-Eyes quickly clambers down the side
of the vehicle, escaping their shots by disappearing beneath
the undercarriage.
And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following. She sits
back down inside and keys a button on a console.
SIDE PANELS slide open on the outside of the Scarab to reveal
two MISSILES, one on each side. They fire.
The MISSILES streak back towards Duke and Ripcord. No time
to get out of the way, they dive and roll in various
directions, extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward. The
two missiles whip between them and detonate, one on a PARKING
OFFICER'S CAR and the other on a BILLBOARD. The EXPLOSION
from the car knocks them down. The Scarab tears away around
a corner.
74.
They see Snake-Eyes on their monitors in the Brawler.
BREAKER
They're turning the corner. Go
through that building at 6 o'clock!
Duke and Ripcord see the building in front of them.
RIPCORD
There's no door!
BREAKER'S VOICE
Make one!
Duke charges directly at the building. Ripcord reluctantly
following as Duke smashes through the wall into...
.back out onto the city streets where they turn and level
their WRIST-MOUNTED ROCKETS at...nothing. A puzzling beat.
And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed.
Ripcord dives out of the way just in time. Duke has no such
luck. He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet
into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down. But the
Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to
crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic.
Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into
the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage.
Duke tumbles up onto the roof. A PULSE CANNON pops up. Duke
dives off the back as the weapon fires. He tumbles to the
pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST-
MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab. Duke fires with him.
75.
Their rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON.
BOOM! But its armor saves the vehicle.
INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around. Storm
Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR
SUITS. Hands it to Ana.
STORM SHADOW
Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy
if I let you die.
Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.
ANA
How thoughtful.
Snake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage.
Duke and Rip are catching up behind him.
SCARLETT'S VOICE
Guys, you have to stop them.
DUKE
Yeah, we're working on it.
76.
SCARLETT'S VOICE
I mean right now. They're going to
detonate one of the warheads on the
Eiffel Tower.
Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.
RIPCORD
Oh, man...
Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and
fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which
promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the
vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks.
Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes
into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the
Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe.
Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages
to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of
the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and
PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train...
The Scarab, Duke and Rip all CRASH HARD to the pavement and
tumble. Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere. Duke
and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the
wreck of the Scarab.
Scarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors.
HEAVY DUTY/BREAKER
Holy shit...
SCARLETT
(CRINGING)
You guys okay?
Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged.
77.
DUKE
What happened to you?
RIPCORD
I went through the train. What
happened to you?
DUKE
I jumped over it.
RIPCORD
You can do that?
DUKE
Yeah, you didn't know?
INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm
Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in
her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons
case and he and Ana leap out.
Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls
out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana
emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.
DUKE (CONT'D)
C'mon!
Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.
HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower
to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and
Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they
bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana.
Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their
Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot
Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The
Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke
and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits.
RIPCORD
(to Duke)
How do you say "we're the good
guys" in French?
Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up
under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.
78.
ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs
and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the
opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a
gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the
man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing
a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs--
--where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The
avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the
stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without
a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after
Ana and Storm Shadow.
ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first
out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them
carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the
defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up.
Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French.
SCARLETT
(French, subtitled)
Don't shoot! We're a special anti-
terrorist unit! There's a bomb up
there!
POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them.
ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the
main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow
hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case
and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH.
Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top
of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him
while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's
pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at
Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the
warhead.
A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils.
ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate.
ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze.
ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in
all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and
hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as
everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The
floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the
stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The
mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the
railing.
79.
ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her
coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in
time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes.
Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the
tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice.
RIPCORD
Where you going?
DUKE
Each warhead has a kill switch.
RIPCORD
It's too late! We gotta get off
this thing!
DUKE
Those nano-mites will level the
entire city!
Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator
Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the
little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes
grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs.
The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them,
Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police
evacuate the Tower.
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.
ANA
(into mike)
Be ready to pick up in thirty
seconds.
IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of
the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.
ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing
him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck
just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION
CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but
manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost
on top of him now. The climbs even faster.
ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow
calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers
up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower
groans and wobbles. It's a long way down. Time has run out.
Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon.
80.
With the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps
up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and
latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon.
IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight.
Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs
inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL
SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger.
Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the
ground around the Eiffel Tower.
The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.
Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes
down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of
water. The shock on the faces of everyone around
reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his
eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets
an idea.
BREAKER
Come on!
He hauls-ass.
A crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab. Heavy Duty
yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out. Breaker yanks off the
guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his
SURVEILLANCE SUIT. Scarlett moves into position to help him.
Ripcord kneels down.
RIPCORD
What are you doing?
BREAKER
Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the
top of the Neo-Viper's head. Ripcord winces at the sight.
81.
SCARLETT
The brain survives for a couple of
minutes after death. We can read
his most recent memories.
RIPCORD
Can you find Duke?
BREAKER
If this guy remembers the way home
we can.
INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.
Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway,
driving the ARMORED CAR. As the images continue, we PUSH IN
on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and CUT TO:
Instantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to
shake. Everyone gets a shock. Backing up.
HEAVY DUTY
He's still alive!
SCARLETT
He's not alive.
HEAVY DUTY
You ever seen a dead guy do that?
SCARLETT
They activated a self-destruct.
The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands
of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones.
BREAKER
Nano-mites!
82.
RIPCORD
They're eating him!
SCARLETT
Hurry, Breaker!
But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are
now gone. His chest and arms next. Breaker rapidly scans
through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES consume
his head.
BREAKER
NOW
Breaker looks crestfallen at the empty Neo-Viper suit in his
arms. Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft.
RIPCORD
You did the best you could.
BREAKER
Relax, I got it.
RIPCORD
You got it?
(CONFUSED)
Well, what was the "NOO!" for?
BREAKER
That was for McCullen.
There is the sound of weapons being raised. The team looks
to see they are surrounded by FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS.
FRENCH SWAT CAPTAIN

Put your hands in the air!
The Joes trade looks, shrug and raise their hands.

RIPCORD

The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place.
RIPCORD (CONT'D)
We're not doing Duke a damned bit
of good sitting here. If it was
reversed, Duke would be kicking
down every door between here and
the freakin' moon 'til he found me.
SCARLETT
And we'll do the same for him as
soon as we get out of here.
She has a thought and turns to Breaker.
SCARLETT (CONT'D)
Partial? You said partial latitude
and longitude.
BREAKER
We only got the one coordinate-- 90
degrees, then the image went to
snow.
SCARLETT
Maybe it was the whole coordinate,
just 90 degrees latitude.
(they all look at her)
(MORE)
85.
SCARLETT (CONT'D)
Before the image went to
snow,...it's the polar ice cap.
RIP'S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet. The Joes
all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.
A NIGHT RAVEN rockets through the orange skies, SMASHING
through the sound barrier with an ear-tingling SONIC BOOM.
Rain is drizzling on a military cemetery. Ana sits alone,
without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's
casket is lowered into the ground.
Parked on a nearby road is a lone car. Duke sits inside it,
staring at the funeral in the distance. His face tells us
the anguish he's living with. He pulls out and starts to
drive away, the rain on the windshield BLURS AS WE DISSOLVE
TO:
The Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge
CAVE. A SET OF RUNWAY LIGHTS appear under the ice, guiding
it in for a smooth landing. The cave swallows the plane
whole.
The DIVING BELL comes shooting down out of a shaft in the
bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility.
90.
A school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks
away from the school. CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a
fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system.
A sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters.
BREAKER (V.0.)
Picture's coming on line now.
A quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice. All
of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of
all earthquakes. It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as
the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds
to a halt. A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch
out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away. Ripcord and
Breaker on one. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other.
Our team races into the ice cave on their ROCK SLIDES and
park beside the dormant Night Raven. Weapons up. Scanning the
place from top to bottom. Ripcord stars at the awesome plane
towering before him.
RIPCORD
That McCullen's got some gadgets.
Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana
sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out,
revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell.
BREAKER
Maybe we could slide down.
Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful
SCARLETT
The arctic water would kill us.
The Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the
earthquake. A large circle of ice near them MELTS. And then
the first drone EXPLODES UP before them and LAUNCHES into the
morning sky, peeling away to the east. Before they can react,
the second drone EXPLODES UP a hundred yards away, peeling
off to the west. They hear the third one about to rocket up--
96.
Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a
Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a WEAPONS SWITCH on his
Rock Slide, prepping two HEAT-SEEKING ROCKETS on either side
of the vehicle. The third drone LAUNCHES UP from two hundred
yards away. Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and FIRES. The
missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky.
It EXPLODES. Metal FLIES. Snow BURNS.
Topside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away.
BREAKER
What about the other two?
RIPCORD
We find the kill switches and short
out the nano-mites.
BREAKER
(shakes his head)
They're already way out of range.
SCARLETT
Then somebody has to go up there
and shoot those things down.
97.
RIPCORD
(PAUSE)
That's me.
The NIGHT RAVEN tears across the ice and launches into the
sky. Ripcord WHOOPS with adrenaline. Scarlett, Snake-Eyes,
and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the
ice REFORMS behind them, hiding the hole.
The GI JOE submarine peels around a rocky headland now, in
full view of the underwater facility. A series of TORPEDOES
fire out of the submarine's launch tubes. Most are blown up
by the facility's Harpoon Cannon defenses, but several manage
to hit the facility's exterior. KA-BOOM!!
Outside, the massive TURBO-LASER swings wildly towards the
submarine and fires. A BRILLIANT BLUE PULSE ripples through
the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel. WHAM!!
Hatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten
SHARC ATTACK CRAFT carrying dozens of Joes. At the same time,
batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen MANTIS
attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge.
Heavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the SHARCS. The huge
opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying.
HEAVY DUTY
Keep tight everybody.
He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis
craft RETURN FIRE. The whole area explodes in a pulse fire
and harpoon blasts. The Joe submarine sinks and EXPLODES at
the base of the facility.
Ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven,
the curve of the Earth visible out his windows. Ahead, he can
see a PULSATING LIGHT.
RIPCORD
I see it, dead ahead.
Ripcord flicks a switch and opens a PULSE LASER on the nose.
RIPCORD
Uh, I've got a problem. The fire
controls are not in here.
106.
BREAKER'S VOICE
What do you mean, not in there?
RIPCORD
I mean I can't see them anywhere!
Ripcord lines up the missile in his sights, gets a lock.
RIPCORD
Fire!
(nothing happens)
Shoot!
(still nothing)
Blast away!
Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the
Earth.
Ripcord's not sure about this, the missile arcing down.
RIPCORD
Teine.
SCARLETT
Listen to my voice, "Teine".
RIPCORD
Teine! Teine! Teine!
(nothing happens)
It's not working!
SCARLETT'S VOICE
That's because you're not saying it
right!
RIPCORD
How many different ways you want me
to say it?
SCARLETT'S VOICE
One way! The right way! Teine!
RIPCORD
Teine!
And at last the PULSE LASER fires. Blasting the missile out
of the sky. The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats aimlessly away.
Ripcord sighs with relief, already peeling away.
RIPCORD
Just doing my job. Guide me to the
other drone...
(MORE)
108.
RIPCORD (CONT'D)
(under his breath)
.man, I freakin' saved Moscow!
The White House glistens in the midday sun.
Another blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC.
Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS.
SHIPWRECK
That cannon's going to kill us all.
HEAVY DUTY
My guy will take care of it, trust
me.
Outside, the TURBO-LASER fires. The Joe craft desperately
weave and dodge.
Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing
down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him.
RIPCORD
Second drone in my sights.
Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He targets the missile.
RIPCORD
Taine!
But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.
SCARLETT'S VOICE
Teine! Teine!
RIPCORD
Don't yell at me!
SCARLETT'S VOICE
Teine.
Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT
starts beeping on his control board. Rip does his best to
ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear
into the lower atmosphere. The light beats faster and louder.
RIPCORD
Teine!
The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which
is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For a moment, he can't
tell if he hit it or not.
Ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere
himself. The spread of WASHINGTON D.C. Far below him now.
Above Washington, Ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling
drone. Getting real close this time. No way he can miss.
Ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden.
RIPCORD
Actually, I think I'm just about
close enough...
(PAUSE)
.teine.
The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES right
in front of him. Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD
OF NANO-MITES latching onto his wings.
Ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the
NANO-MITES swiftly eat his plane.
His FUEL LIGHT flashes at him alarmingly. He angles the Night
Raven upwards, giving it all he's got, NANO-MITES everywhere.
The Night Raven is breaking up all around Ripcord now. He
quickly attaches his flight helmet's BREATHING MASK.
Ripcord smiles, parachuting down towards Washington.
114.
RIPCORD
(into headset)
Good...cause I think I'm about to
get arrested.
Ripcord lands on the White House lawn, holding his hands up
benignly as dozens of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround him.
Heavy Duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position.
HEAVY DUTY
Turbo-laser is down!
He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It
EXPLODES. Heavy Duty howls with delight.
Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle. A
SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe
harpoon cannons.
Heavy Duty notices the Trident escaping out of the EXPLODING
docking bay into the arctic water. He angles towards the sub.
HEAVY DUTY
We got a runner! Cut him off!
All of a sudden, the whole damn facility EXPLODES.
INSIDE THE DIVING BELL: Our heroes are rocked by the BLAST,
then they see MASSIVE CHUNKS OF POLAR ICE plummet down from
the ice pack above, cutting off Heavy Duty and the Joes, and
DEMOLISHING the remainder of the facility. The Trident
disappears behind the trillions of bubbles and falling ice.
117.
Shipwreck checks his targeting scanner.
SHIPWRECK
All other targets neutralized.
HEAVY DUTY
GO JOES!!
The Trident is moving fast through the water somewhere.
