
	LOIS and CLARK practice their drives.  Loin only has	*
	one ball left in her bucket.  She sets the ball down and	*
	swings.  The ball goes straight, hitting the 150 yard mark.	*
	mark.	*

				CLARK
		Nice.	*

				LOIS
		Thank you	*

	Now it's Clark's turn.  He sets a ball down, swings, but	*
	it slices right.	*

				LOIS
		Not your game, huh.	*

	Clark shakes his head.	*

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		I'm going to get another bucket.	*
		Be right back.	*

	As Lois leaves, she passes an OLD in riotously	*
	colorful attire and a tan cap, who pauses from his	*
	practice to survey Clark critically.  Clark swings; this	*
	time, the ball hit& the roof and lands in front of the
	old timer.

				OLD TIMER
		You're bending your elbow.  Don't
		bend your elbow.

				CLARK
		Thanks.

	Clark tries another shot.

				OLD TIMER
		And watch your temp.  Smooth,
		smooth.

				CLARK
		I appreciate this.

				OLD TIMER
		Sure.  But don't be afraid to hit

	The Old Timer CACKLES at his own joke.

				CLARK
		Got it.

	Clark teas up again, doesn't bend his elbow, watches his
	tempo, hits through the ball.  It rockets off to disappear
	in the  sky. Clark shades his eyes to follow the flight.



	The ball flies away.



	Clark lowers his hand, turns to the Old Timer.

				CLARK
		How was that?

	The Old Timer closes his mouth, which was open in awe.

				LOIS

		He's right about one thing.  Until	*

28	A TRUCK						28

	... comes roaring down the street, speeding up to make the
	green light.


29	LOIS AND CLARK					29

	From behind then comes A SKATEBOARDER, a spacesuit-looking
	soul speeding down the sidewalk.  Suddenly he loses
	control.

	The skateboard flips out from under and flies into the
	small of Lois' back, punching her forward, into the
	street, into the path of the truck.

	Clark REACTS - GRABS Lois by the back of her jacket and
	SWINGS HER IN A SWEEPING ARC BACK ONTO THE SIDEWALK. A
	split second later he descends on the fallen Skateboarder,
	GRABS HIM by his shirt, LIFTS HIM up and PLANTS HIM
	ON HIS FEET, holding him by his lapels.

				CLARK
		All right, who sent you?

				SKATEBOARDER
		Chill, dude.

	Clark tightens his grip, lifts the guy off the ground.

				CLARK
		Who sent you?

				SKATEBOARDER
		Sent me to do what?

				LOIS
		Clark!  Let him go!  How could
		anybody have sent him?  My story's
		not even out yet!

	Good point -- though Clark still holds on, maybe because
	the guy has one of those insufferable Beavis & Butthead
	laughs; for that alone he's indictable.

		Right, her story's not even out

			(beat; confused)
		Like, what story?


He laughs, exits.  Lois looks at Clark, smiles.

				LOIS
		I'm impressed, 'dude.'

	As they start across the street...

					CUT TO:


	Evening.  Lois and Clark walking to Lois' house.

				CLARK
		So, you made a mistake.  It	*
		happens.	*

				LOIS
		I didn't make a mistake.  He	*
		looked just like him.	*
			(beat)
		I asked Jimmy to track Dr. Hubert	*
		down, but he's disappeared without	*
		a trace.	*

				CLARK
		Let's start over.  Why would	*
		someone kill Winninger, then go	*
		into the bathroom and clean up?	*

				LOIS
		Who knows?  Maybe he wanted to	*
		wash the blood off, or maybe he	*
		was just compulsive about germs,	*
		like Howard Hughes.

	Just before they reach the front of her house, A MAN IN A
	MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR approaches, and Lois and Clark step
	aside to let him pass.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		Well, here we are.  Thanks, Clark.

				CLARK
		We're not there yet. When I take
		somebody home, she gets door-to-
		door service.

				LOIS
		Unnecessary.  Like I told you...	*

	Before she can finish, Clark notes a movement out of the	*
	corner of his eye, REACTS to it, looks...


32	CLARK'S POV				32

	A BLUR as the wheelchair spins around to face then...

				CLARK
		Lois!



	WITNESS   (#10)     Blue Rev.     10/27/93		18.


33	SCENE						33

	At that moment a motorcycle BACKFIRES down the street.


34	BACK TO CLARK'S POV				34

	Two FLASHES from the wheelchair as its occupant fires a
	pair of GUNSHOTS at Lois.


35	SCENE						35

	Almost simultaneously:

	Clark PUSHES Lois (she virtually flies back and lands on
	the stoop on her tush).

	Clark STEPS into the line of fire... GRABS the bullets as
	they strike his chest.  He BLOWS HARD...

	Under the force of Clark's breath the wheelchair SPINS.

				LOIS
		Clark?

	Clark is eager to get the gunman.

				CLARK
		Stay back!

	He leaves her at the foot of her stoop and hurries to the
	wheelchair.  He can't go too fast because Lois is watch-
	ing.  As the wheelchair slows down and stops it is appar-
	ent that it is unoccupied.  Clark looks around.

	He SEES: Pedestrians coming home from work carrying brief
	cases and grocery sacks; a car pulling away, driven by a
	white-haired woman; a delivery man hopping back into his
	double-parked van.  The shooter could have been anyone.

				LOIS
		That hurt!

	Clark REACTS, startled: Lois has come up behind him.

				CLARK
		Lois! You don't sneak up on
		somebody at a time like this.

	He closes his hand, concealing the bullets.

				LOIS
		A time like what?

				CLARK
		Somebody tried to kill you!

		Yes, you .
			(noticing)
		What's in your hand?

				CLARK
		What?

				LOIS
		What are you hiding?

	Clearly she means the left hand; he shows her the right.

				CLARK
		Nothing.

	He clenches his right fist, crushing the bullets.

				LOIS
		Let me see the other hand.

	Clark lets the pulverized lead slip from his hand before
	he shows her.

				CLARK
		See, nothing.

	Lois looks confused.  They walk to the foot of Lois'	*
	stoop.	*

				CLARK
			(continuing)
		Maybe I'd better stay with you

				LOIS
		Nice try, Kent.

				CLARK
		Somebody took a shot at you!

	They return to, enter her building.


	OMITTED (36-37)



	Clark Kent turns a corner, finds a seat on Lois' stoop and
	keeps a steady vigil on Lois' apartment.



	Early morning.  Clark Kent, reading the morning paper,
	sits on the stoop.



	The front door opens and the building superintend, MR.
	TRACEWSKI, a pleasant-looking man in jeans and workshirt,
	hurries out, muttering in an East European accent.

				TRACEWSKI
		I tell then, Hey, go for it, they
		don't listen, they buy cheap.  And
		what?  Here it is.  Costs two times
		as much more.

	He scoots down the stairs and up the street.

					CUT TO:


	Clark and Lois exit the building.

				LOIS
		... Look, Winninger, Finn and
		Barbara Trevino ware all in the
		same photo.  That's a connection.

				CLARK
		Fine, but why would Finn kill
		Winninger and what's any of this
		got to do with Barbara Trevino?

				LOIS
		That's what we're going to find
		out.

	They start searching for an empty cab.

				LOIS
		This is very creepy.

				CLARK
		Taxi!


55	LOIS' POV - FACES				55

	Everybody looks suspicious.  The faces are distorted, as
	if photographed up close with a wide-angle lens.

				LOIS (V.O.)
		Don't you think it's creepy?  Finn
		could be anybody.  Anybody you see
		could be somebody else.

	BARBARA TREVINO, still beautiful, though more likely,
	these days, to be called "handsome," completes the answer
	to a question.

				BARBARA
		... it's a global village now.  We 
		of the Rain Forest Consortium have	*
		to act accordingly.

				REPORTER
		How does it feel to be the first	*
		to hold this post?

				BARBARA
		Well, I don't officially hold it
		for two days, but at the risk of
		being premature...
			(smiles)
		... It feels great.

	The audience appreciates her charm.


A58	ANGLE - LOIS AND CLARK				A58

				LOIS
		Ms. Trevino, concerning the death
		of Dr. Vincent Winninger...

				BARBARA
		Dr. Winninger was a brilliant

		mine for many years.  I was shocked
		and saddened by his death.


				BARBARA
		How do you feel about the Ozone
		Layer?

	Barbara, like everyone one also, looks confused.

				LOIS
		What about increased male potency?

	Now everyone, including Clark, looks at Lois like she's

				BARBARA
		Well, Ms. Lane, I find your sense
		of humor odd, to say the least, and
		totally inappropriate.  I suggest
		this would be a good time to close
		this press conference.

	She walks off the podium, and the conference breaks up.

				CLARK
		Bold, Lois.  Not too bright, but
		bold.

				LOIS
		Did you see the look on her face?
		She know exactly what I was talking
		about.
			(beat)
		Even if I didn't.

				CLARK
		Well, now we'll never got to her.

	An AIDE -- small, energetic, with a slight but undeniable	*
	Latin accent -- approaches Lois.

				AIDE
		Ms. Lane?
			(Lois turns)
		I am Dr. Trevino's administrative
		assistant.  She wishes me to tell
		you that she will discuss whatever
		you like, privately.

	She glances at Clark.

		I'm... hare with Mr Kent...

		I'm sorry.  Just you, she said.
		You understand...

				LOIS
		She wants to talk woman-to-woman.

	Lois rolls her eyes an the Aid leads them away.



	The Aide hobbles up, grabs the gun again and begins
	looking for Lois on the flat, pebbled roof.  He HEARS
	FOOTSTEPS.


70	LOIS						70

	... running... where?  She knows where The Aide is coming
	from, she doesn't know where she's going, but she knows
	that every footstep is leading her pursuer to her.



	WITNESS   (#10)     Pink Rev.     10/28/93		34.


71	THE AIDE						71

	He follows the SOUND, comes around a building element,
	expecting to see Lois.  He doesn't.  He listens.  SILENCE.
	There is no place she could have gone.


72	WIDER - THE ROOF				72

	The Aide walks around the perimeter of the roof, looking
	down -- perhaps she's holding on to the edge.  He walks,
	his footsteps crunching pebbles... He scampers to another
	element of the roof, flattens his back against it,
	carefully looks around it.  His look in quizzical...


73	HIS POV - LOIS					73

	... hiding at the foot of an element on another, higher,
	seemingly separate part of the structure.  There is no
	visible connection between this part of the roof and that.
	How did she get there?


74   THE AIDE						74

	He may be confused, but not so confused that he doesn't
	know what to do.  He raises his gun, aims...

	But even though Lois faces him and her legs don't move,
	she FLIES ACROSS the roof behind another chimney.  The
	aide is now totally confused.  But before he can sort it
	out, he HEARS a  WHOOSH! behind him.  He whirls around and
	sees Lois standing there with Superman.

				LOIS
			(to aide; re: Superman)
		In this guy cool, or what?

	The aide raises the mm.  THE GUN TURNS RED-HOT.  The
	Aide CRIES OUT with pain, drops the gun.	*

				SUPERMAN
		Hey, if you can't stand the heat...

	Superman puts his hands around the Aide's waist and lifts
	him, keeping his distance, and takes off.

					CUT TO:


	Lois enters the courtyard, winded, excited.  Clark talks
	to the Aide, who is fastened to the chair - which is to
	say the chair is rescued around him, containing him.

				CLARK
		Superman had to run... or fly.  I
		said we'd wait for the police.

	She looks closely at the Aide, sees a seam in his neck,
	pulls off a condom-thin mask and makeup.

				LOIS
		Sebastian Finn, I presume.  So...	*
		why'd you kill Dr. Winninger?

				FINN
		His Rosencrantz was atrocious.

				LOIS
		But why come after me?

				FINN
		You could identify me.

				LOIS
		No, I couldn't.

			(shrugs)
		Well, that's the way it goes

				LOIS
		How does Barbara Trevino fit into

	He looks at her sympathetically, as if to say -- Don't you
	know it's hopeless?

				LOIS
		Maybe you'll talk to the police.

		Not likely.  Superman may be the
