  SPARTACUS, reinstated from the Pits, spars with HAMILCAR in 
  a rotating drill with the other GLADIATORS. Bruises and 
  scrapes still mar his flesh, but he trains with focus and 
    determination. DOCTORE cracks his whip.

  The Gladiators switch partners. Every man is drenched in 
  sweat, lips cracked from lack of water. The drought has 
  taken its toll. VARRO grins, crossing sword and shield with 
  Spartacus. After a few beats, Doctore cracks his whip.

  CRIXUS moves into position opposite Spartacus, attacking. 
  Spartacus tries to keep a steady pace, but Crixus strikes 
  hard, pressing beyond the exercise. Doctore cracks his whip.

  GNAEUS, exhausted and winded, moves to face Spartacus -- but 
  Crixus doesn t give way. He continues to press, catching 
  Spartacus by surprise. Spartacus stumbles back, barely 
  deflecting the blows. Crixus raises his practice sword to 
  crack Spartacus' skull.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Crixus!

  Crixus freezes. Doctore steps closer, displeased.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Did you not hear the command?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Apologies, Doctore. I hope I did 
                        not frighten the rabbit.

  Snickers from the men. Doctore glares.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The games of the Magistrate

  Gnaeus swoons from the heat in the background, collapses to 
  the ground.

  PIETROS rushes over to Gnaeus with a skin of water.

                      to the infirmary.

  Spartacus and Varro carry Gnaeus out of the square. Doctore 
  cracks his whip, commanding the rest of the men to continue.

  THUMP! A CHUNK OF FLESH lands on a table at a market stall. 
  It's the rotted, decaying, maggoty shoulder of one of the 
  assassins from 104, bearing the distinct BRAND. The flesh 
  was just tossed by

  ASHUR,

  who glares at MARCELLUS, a greasy merchant of questionable 
  repute. BARCA looms behind Marcellus, face filled with 
  impending violence.

                                        ASHUR
                        That was the mark on one of the 
                        slaves who tried to kill Batiatus. 
                        Who is the master?

  Marcellus glances at it in disgust.

                                          MARCELLUS
                        The mark is unknown to me.

                                        ASHUR
                        Perhaps a closer look...

  Barca slams Marcellus' face into the maggoty flesh, holds it 
  there.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Details of such craftsmanship 
                        should not be viewed in haste.

  OFF Ashur's murderous grin...



  Calavius and Solonius step out onto the balcony. Batiatus 
  and Lucretia follow, with Naevia ever in tow. Doctore 
  continues putting the men through their paces beneath the 
  setting sun in the square below.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

                        Half. Your opponent still to be 
                        chosen.

  Batiatus shares an excited look with Lucretia.

                                        BATIATUS
                      If you hope to appease the gods, 
                        you must have one upon the sands! 
                        Crixus, the Champion of Capua!

  Batiatus indicates Crixus, sparring with Hamilcar, muscles 
  rippling in the light of the setting sun.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      He will gladly meet anyone Solonius 
                        has to offer.

  Solonius' face splits into a grin. Exactly what he wanted to 
  hear.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Excellent! It will truly be a 
                        contest between legends!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Legends?

                        Solonius has secured Theokoles for 
                        the Primus!

                        I managed to coax him to our fair 
                        city, at great expense.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        With our gratitude.  If the gods 
                        fail to grant us rain for such a 
                        tribute, then we are surely cursed.

                        I fear the gods will be displeased. 
                        The match is unbalanced. Only one 
                        man has ever stood against 
                        Theokoles and lived.

  Solonius looks down at Spartacus as he trains below.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        What if Crixus were joined by your 
                        man Spartacus? His death was fated 
                      in execution, yet he refused to own 
                        it. And cost me four men in its 
                        defiance.

  Batiatus struggles to find an honorable way to back out.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Your debts are well known, 
                        Batiatus. Even if you lose the men, 
                        the purse is enough to hold your 
                        creditors at bay, for a moment. Of 
                        course if you'd prefer to sit out 
                        these games, and others to 
                        follow...

                                        BATIATUS
                        No. I will set my men to the task.

  Lucretia stiffens in shock. Solonius grins in satisfaction. 
  Batiatus glares at him as he steps to the railing and 
  addresses his men.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      My titans! Pause, and hear glorious 
                        news!

  Spartacus, Crixus, and the other men look to Batiatus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Magistrate Titus Calavius has 
                        invited our best men to fight in 
                        his Primus! Crixus! Step forward!

  Crixus grins as he proudly steps forward. Of course he was 
  asked to fight. For a moment, his eyes meet Naevia's on the 
  balcony above. She quickly looks away.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus! Step forward.

  A murmur of surprise ripples through the Gladiators. Crixus 
  glares as Spartacus steps forward, equally surprised.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        the Shadow of Death!

  The men react in shock and excitement. PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS 
  as the weight of the matter settles upon him...



  The MORNING SUN blazes as Ashur hobbles along with Barca 
  towards the main gate, accompanied by TWO GUARDS. Ashur 
  snorts at Spartacus and Crixus warming in the square, 
  separate and far from a team.

                                        ASHUR
                      As if they stand chance against 
                        Theokoles.

                                        BARCA
                        Perhaps the gods will favor them.

                                        ASHUR
                        And perhaps I shall sprout wings 
                        and flutter off. The odds lay a 
                        thousand to one against them.

  Barca eyes Crixus across the square.

                                        BARCA
                      No man has ever won betting against 
                        Crixus. I would lay coin towards 
                        their victory.

                                        ASHUR
                        A fool's wager, happily received.

  Ashur hobbles off. Barca glares after him, nods to the 
  GUARDS to unlock the gate. Pietros hustles up.

                                          PIETROS

  He kisses Pietros softly, exits. Doctore enters the square, 
  calls for Pietros.

                        Pietros! Weapons!

  Pietros hustles over to the weapons barrel. Gnaeus, looking 
  pale and dehydrated, gives the boy a leering grin with 
  cracked lips. Pietros ignores him, drawing two practice 
  swords. He hustles the weapons PAST FRAME, WIPING US TO --



  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS as a wooden practice sword cracks him in 
  the face. Blood erupts from his mouth. POP WIDE to reveal

  DOCTORE

  schooling Spartacus and Crixus with two practice swords. 
  Spartacus slams to the ground, stunned by the blow. Crixus 
  rushes Doctore. Doctore counters with lightning speed, 
  cracking Crixus repeatedly before kicking him to the ground. 
  Ashur, watching with a few other men, stifles a laugh.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You attack as you would a man. 
                        Theokoles is beyond flesh. Beyond 
                        blood and bone. He is the shadow 
                        that precedes death. Allow it to 
                        fall upon you alone... and you are 
                        lost. Rise, and come at me as one!

  Spartacus glances at Crixus. Crixus glares, turns away as he 
  rises and attacks. ARM UP to find

  LUCRETIA AND ILITHYIA

  on the balcony watching the display. Ilithyia thirstily 
  downs a cup of water, holds it out for Naevia for more. 
  Naevia looks to Lucretia, who reluctantly nods the go-ahead.

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Doctore whirls and spins, fluidly countering every attack 
  from Spartacus and Crixus. Crixus and Spartacus move to 
  attack simultaneously, but only succeed in getting in each 
  other's way. Crixus snarls.

                        The advantage was mine!

  Doctore uses the distraction to attack, dropping both men to 
  the ground again.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You jostle and trip over the other 
                        like fools. You face Theokoles in 
                        the Primus! Prove yourselves 
                        worthy!

  Spartacus and Crixus comply, rising to engage Doctore again.

  THE BALCONY

  Ilithyia takes in the show, her eyes dancing.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I crave a closer look. Can we go 
                        down among them?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My husband would frown upon it. The 
                        bowels of a ludus are no place for 
                        a senator's daughter.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        A private viewing then, in the 
                        villa? I would pay for it, of 
                        course.

  Lucretia hesitates, sees opportunity.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A favor among friends.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        You must let me return it, then. 
                        I've given thought to your problem, 
                        and have discovered solution.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My problem...?

                        Children.

  Lucretia forces a smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Oh. Of course.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I've heard of a woman, a priestess 
                      of Juno, blessed with certain gifts 
                      of fertility. Many prominent women 
                        speak of her. Servillius, Cornelia, 
                        Laelia --

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Ovidius' wife?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        You know her?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      In passing. She has a young boy.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And would have none, if not touched 
                      by the woman I speak of. Will you 
                        let me arrange it? As a gift for 
                        your hospitality?

  Lucretia hesitates, nods uncomfortably. Ilithyia squeals, 
  kissing her impulsively, innocently.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                      We are friends, aren't we?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The very best.

  Ilithyia beams, turning back to the square. Lucretia eyes 
  her for a moment, not feeling friendly in the least, before 
  shifting her gaze to

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Sweat and grime stain Crixus and Spartacus as they battle 
  Doctore. Still unable to work as one, Doctore once again 
  smashes each painfully to the ground. He stares down at 
  them.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Pathetic.

  He turns away in disgust, WIPING US TO --



  The sun hangs low on the horizon. TIGHT ON Spartacus as he 
  hits the ground hard, his face bloodied. POP WIDE to reveal 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.
  CONTINUED:

  Crixus laid out nearby. Doctore stands over them, twin 
  practice swords in hand.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You dishonor me.

  Spartacus and Crixus, exhausted and drenched with sweat, 
  painfully rise to their feet.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The Thracian impedes my attack.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I seek to strengthen it.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I need no aid.

                                          DOCTORE
                        No, you need the gods to descend 
                        and fight by your side! And even 
                        then victory is doubtful.
                                    frustrated)(
                        Words, falling upon deaf ears.

  Doctore throws his swords at his feet, sticking them in the 
  sand.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Attend your eyes, then...

  Doctore unlatches his breast plate.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Let them drink deep the pain that 
                        awaits you.

  He lets the breast plate fall to the ground, revealing the 
  horrible scars he carries from his encounter with Theokoles. 
  Spartacus and Crixus take them in with shock.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      My failure. Your lesson.

  Doctore indicates a mottled SCAR that snakes from his chest 
  down to his abdomen.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        His first cut...                                                                                    29.



  A SWORD slices across Doctore's stomach and chest. He 
  stiffens in agony, FRAME FREEZING as the blood continues to 
  splatter. (NOTE: In all the FLASHBACKS, we will never see 
  Theokoles, only the giant's blade. He will not be revealed 
  until he enters the arena against Spartacus and Crixus.)



  Doctore stalks around Spartacus and Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Dealt when I thought him 
                        vulnerable, and pressed my attack 
                        unwisely.

  Doctore shoots Crixus a withering look.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        His next assault came when I fell 
                        back to regain position....



  Theokoles' sword tears open Doctore's back. He screams, the 
  FRAME FREEZING as the blood continues to splatter.



  Spartacus eyes the ugly SCAR creasing Doctore's back as he 
  continues circling.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Yet these wounds are nothing. A 
                        game of blood, to amuse the crowd. 
                        And when he tires of playing, he 
                        will move to part head from your 
                        neck...



  Doctore bends out of the way as a SWORD almost decapitates 
  him. The blade catches Doctore across the face, ripping open 
  his flesh in a gush of blood. FREEZE FRAME on Doctore as the 
  blood splatters, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    30.



  Doctore glares at Spartacus and Crixus, the SCAR marring his 
  face a harbinger of what awaits them.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I live only because I survived 
                        longer than any man who ever stood 
                        against him. Some herald that as a 
                        victory in itself.
                                  a beat)(
                        I am not among them.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You tell us the Shadow wounds both 
                        when he is pressed and when he is 
                        given ground.

                                        CRIXUS
                        How is he to be defeated?

                                          DOCTORE
                      By accomplishing both at once.
                                to Crixus)(
                        Press...
                                to Spartacus)(
                        and defend.
                                to Crixus)(
                        Distract...
                                to Spartacus)(
                        and strike. Fight as one. Or die as 
                        two.

  Doctore retrieves his swords.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Show me the way to honor.

  Spartacus glances at Crixus, steeling himself. Crixus grits 
  his teeth and attacks. As Spartacus follows to engage 
  Doctore, we MOVE OFF of the action to --



  Batiatus, Lucretia and Naevia watch from above.

                        The games tomorrow, and yet Doctore 
                        presses them.

                      To their benefit. I have business 
                      in town. It will take me late into 
                        the night.

  She doesn't respond, her eyes fixed on Crixus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

                        comes with her Priestess.

  Batiatus puts a hand to Lucretia's stomach.

                                        BATIATUS
                        May the gods bless us with miracle.

  He gently kisses her.

                        They fucking owe us something.

  He exits into the villa. OFF Lucretia, her eyes falling on 
  Crixus as she prays for a different miracle...



  WHAM! TIGHT ON A GLADIATOR with blood spewing from his 
  mangled face shield as he hits the ground, twitches, lies 
  forever still. POP WIDE to reveal his opponent (Hoplomachus) 
  raise his gory spear in victory. The CROWD roars.

  THE PULVINUS

  Naevia and other SLAVES attend with water and wine, fanning 
  the PATRICIANS crowding the Pulvinus. Batiatus and Lucretia 
  sit with Ilithyia. Solonius and several DIGNITARIES converse 
  further down. The Magistrate's wife DOMITIA occupies the 
  center with her excited 14-year-old son NUMERIUS. The 
    Magistrate's seat is currently empty.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Did you see?! Septimus the victor, 
                      as I said! Valarius always drops 
                        his shield when he attacks, a 
                        disadvantage against the spear.

                        Towards gladiators, yes. His 
                        studies are another matter.

  Numerius scowls. Down in the arena, the dead Gladiator is 
  dragged from the sand by the LIBITINARII.

  A PAINTED FIGURE OF CERES,

  the Goddess of Harvest and Renewal, is carried in and 
  paraded around to the CHEERS of the sweat-soaked crowd.

                        Finally, the Primus. Another moment 
                        and my tongue would turn to dust.

  Lucretia motions to Naevia to bring Ilithyia water.

                        Apologies, Domina. We have used our 
                        last.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Please. Share a bit of mine.

  Solonius waves one of his Slaves over to fill her cup. 
  Batiatus forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are too kind, good Solonius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You'd do the same, if you were 
                        able. No matter. Soon Theokoles 
                        will honor the gods with blood, and 
                        they in turn will bless us with 
                        endless rain.

  Magistrate Calavius enters, obviously upset as he takes his 
  seat.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        I pray for the truth in it. The 
                        drought is driving the city mad! 
                        Unfortunate word has reached us 
                        that our dearest cousin Ovidius was 
                        murdered in his home.

  Everyone is shocked. Solonius stiffens.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Ovidius?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                        No. I spoke of his wife not a night 
                        ago.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What of their child? He was so 
                        young.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Their villa was burned, only a few 
                        bodies yet recovered. I fear the 
                        boy among the ruins.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A tragedy. One can not but wonder 
                        what would prompt such an act.

  Batiatus shoots Solonius a look. Solonius isn't sure what to 
  make of it, shifts uncomfortably.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Let us turn our minds to hopes of 
                        rain, to cool the fevered brow of 
                        our city.

  He steps forward to address the crowd, who ROAR their 
  approval.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS(cont'd)
                        Citizens of Capua! Brothers of 
                        Rome!



  Spartacus trots out into the arena.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Behold, Spartacus! Thraex!

    A smattering of CHEERS but mostly boos. His humiliating 
  defeat against Crixus has not been forgotten.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS (O.S.)
                        Joined in battle today by the 
                        Undefeated Gaul! The Champion of 
                        Capua! Behold, Crixus! Murmillo!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.
  CONTINUED:

  Crixus trots out to the ROAR of the masses. He raises his 
  arms, shouting his usual call to glory:

                                        CRIXUS
                        Capua! Shall we begin?!

  The mob goes WILD. Crixus takes his place, nods to 
  Spartacus. Spartacus returns it.


  PULIVINUS

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Together they stand against a man 
                        that has never fallen!  A beast 
                        that has never been tamed!  A 
                        legend that has never been 
                        tarnished!  By the grace of Marcus 
                        Decius Solonius!  Behold, 
                        Theokoles!  The Shadow of Death!

  The crowd ROARS... then SILENCES, excited and terrified as 
  another gate GRINDS OPEN.

  THEOKOLES, THE SHADOW OF DEATH,

  enters the arena, the sky darkening with CLOUDS as he steps 
  onto the sand. He stands nearly seven feet tall.

  His exposed flesh crisscrossed with the scars of a thousand 
  battles. He brandishes a THICK SWORD in each hand. No 
  helmet. No shield. His invincible body his only armor.

  SPARTACUS AND CRIXUS

  trade a look.  Ho-ly fuck me.  A long, silent beat, finally 
  broken by Theokoles roaring to the crowd.  The CROWD erupts 
  in thunderous cheers.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS(cont'd)
                        Begin!

  Crixus surges forward, taking the lead. Spartacus fans out 
  to the side, backing him up. Crixus attacks, his sword 
  singing through the air, helmet gleaming in the sun. 
  THEOKOLES COUNTERS,

  but when Crixus moves back Spartacus surges forward to take 
  up the attack. They continue ebbing and flowing, like 
  Doctore instructed. The crowd GASPS as their swords find 
  their mark, opening up fresh wounds across the giant's 
  mangled flesh.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  THE PULVINUS

  is electric with excitement and surprise.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        They draw blood!

  Lucretia's eyes fill with sudden hope. As do Naevia's, 
  unnoticed behind her.

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus and Crixus circle Theokoles, moving without 
  hesitation or fear. Blood splatters as they land more blows.

  THE CHUTES

  Doctore stands at the gate, jaw tense, eyes blazing at the 
  display. Varro, Barca, and a handful of other men from the 
  ludus crowd behind him, cheering. All except Ashur, who 
  hangs back, concern creasing his face.

  CRIXUS

  lands a glancing blow, narrowly avoids Theokoles' sword as 
  it whistles past his helmet.

  SPARTACUS

  rushes in, distracting Theokoles as Crixus redoubles his 
  assault. Swords clash. Blood spews in glorious slow motion 
  as they continue to hack away at the giant. Spartacus lands 
    a devastating blow. The crowd GASPS as

  THEOKOLES STUMBLES

  back in pain. Crixus lands a second, equally devastating 
  blow. Theokoles momentarily lowers his guard, stunned. 
  Spartacus and Crixus both surge forward, simultaneously 
  slicing Theokoles across the chest.

  THEOKOLES FALLS BACK,

  crashing to the sand. BLOOD splashes up into the air. The 
  giant doesn't move. A beat of stunned silence -- broken by 
  the deafening ROAR of the crowd.

  THE PULVINUS

  Everyone leaps to their feet. Tears well in Lucretia's eyes. 
  Naevia beams in relief. Batiatus cheers. Solonius looks 
  stricken.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

                        Yes! YES!

  THE CHUTES

  The men go insane. PUSH IN ON Doctore, his eyes wide in 
  disbelief.

  THE ARENA

  Crixus whips off his helmet. Spartacus follows suit. They 
  share a grin. Crixus throws his arms up in victory. The 
  crowd ROARS. Crixus motions for Spartacus to do the same. He 
  laughs, reluctantly complies. The crowd ROARS -- then 
  suddenly falls silent.

  THEOKOLES STIRS

  behind Spartacus and Crixus. LIGHTNING FLASHES as he rises, 
  bloodied and wounded but far from dead.

  THE PULVINUS

  Batiatus' joy crumbles. Lucretia stiffens in concern, as 
  does Naevia behind her.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                  stunned)(
                      He yet lives!

  Solonius smiles, assured in the outcome as he looks back to 
  --

  THE ARENA

  Theokoles laughs, his voice a deep and terrible thing. He 
  looks out across the arena, ROARS to the crowd.

                                          THEOKOLES
                        Capua! Shall I begin?!

  The crowd goes INSANE.

  THE CHUTES

  Doctore's eyes drain of hope. Dread seizes Varro's heart. 
  Ashur allows himself a grin in the background.

  THE ARENA

  Theokoles grins as he trots towards Spartacus and Crixus. 
  Spartacus shares a concerned look with Crixus. Perhaps the 
  legends are true. The Shadow can truly not be killed.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  THEOKOLES

  slams into them, swords contrailing through the air. 
  Spartacus and Crixus engage the giant, once again working as 
  one, ebbing and flowing in their attack. Theokoles is driven 
  back -- then suddenly counters, driving the two men back, 
  giving them no time to regroup.

  SPARTACUS AND CRIXUS

  struggle under the assault, their carefully orchestrated 
  attacks shattering into chaos.

                                        CRIXUS
                                to Spartacus)(
                        Move out of the way, you fucking --

  WHAM! Theokoles slams Spartacus into Crixus, sending both 
  men crashing to the ground in a tangled heap. Theokoles 
  laughs, grandstanding for the crowd. Crixus hisses at 
  Spartacus.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Give ground, or I'll kill you 
                        myself!

  Crixus rises. Spartacus follows, eyes deepening with worry. 
  Whatever common ground they may have shared is quickly 
  slipping away.

  CRIXUS

  rushes Theokoles. Theokoles whirls to met him. Swords flash, 
  Theokoles' blade finding its mark and SLICING open Crixus' 
  arm. BLOOD flies as he staggers back in shock. The crowd 
  ROARS.

  THE PULVINUS

  Lucretia sucks air. Batiatus sinks into despair, his ruin at 
  hand. Solonius gloats.

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus rushes in to distract Theokoles from the wounded 
  Crixus. They trade thunderous blows. Theokoles whirls, 
  slamming his sword into Spartacus' shield with such force 
  the smaller man is sent flying, landing hard some distance 
  away. He spits blood, dazed and nearly unconscious from the 
  blow.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  THEOKOLES

  turns his attention back to Crixus as the Gaul rushes him, 
  mad with rage. Lightning fast blows are exchanged. Crixus 
  sees advantage and RAMS HIS SWORD through the side of 
  Theokoles' gut. The crowd gasps. A frozen moment -- broken 
  by Theokoles snarling and HEADBUTTING Crixus.

  CRIXUS STUMBLES BACK,

  blood spurting from his nose as he loses his grip on his 
  sword. Theokoles drops one of his own and with a grunt PULLS 
  THE SWORD FROM HIS SIDE and attacks Crixus with it. Crixus 
  tries to deflect with his shield, but

  THEOKOLES SLICES CRIXUS OPEN

  from stomach to chest, sending blood spraying. Crixus loses 
  his shield as he's spun around from the blow. Theokoles 
  SLICES CRIXUS ACROSS THE BACK, sending more blood spewing. 
  Crixus staggers, falls to his knees. The roar of the crowd 
  fades as he looks up to

  THE PULVINUS

  where Lucretia stands stricken. But it's Naevia's face he 
  seeks. He finds it, slick with tears. The deafening ROAR of 
  the crowd surges back up.

  THE ARENA

  Theokoles moves in behind Crixus. He raises his sword to 
  decapitate him and --

                                          SPARTACUS
                        THEOKOLES!

  Theokoles turns. Spartacus has risen, bloodied but 
  determined. Spartacus snarls and charges. Theokoles grins, 
  kicking Crixus to the ground before whirling to meet 
  Spartacus.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as the two warriors trade bone-shattering blows. Theokoles 
  swings his sword. Spartacus bends out of the way, narrowly 
  avoiding decapitation. He counters, slamming his shield into 
  Theokoles' wounded side. The giant howls, SMASHING THE 
  SHIELD from Spartacus' grasp.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.
  CONTINUED:

  SPARTACUS

  crashes across the sand, landing near Theokoles' sword, 
  abandoned when he pulled Crixus' sword from his side. 
  Spartacus snatches it up and reengages the giant with TWO 
  SWORDS as he attacks. Steel flashes.

  CRIXUS

  sputters blood, spots his helmet glinting in the sun close 
  by. He struggles to reach it. Spartacus is smashed back. 
  Just as Theokoles raises his sword for the death blow, 
  Crixus latches onto the gleaming helmet, REFLECTING A RAY OF 
  SUNLIGHT into the giant's eyes.

  THEOKOLES GRUNTS,

  momentarily blinded. Spartacus seizes the distraction and 
  attacks, slicing into Theokoles. BLOOD SPLATTERS. The giant 
  raises his sword to counter but SPARTACUS SWINGS UP, HACKING 
  OFF THE FRONT OF THEOKOLES' FACE.

  THE CROWD GASPS

  as Theokoles staggers. He works the half of his jaw that 
  remains as he collapses to his knees, blood pouring from his 
  ruined face. Spartacus swings again, DECAPITATING THEOKOLES 
  in a GEYSER OF BLOOD.

  THE CHUTES

  A bit of the giant's blood SPLATTERS across Doctore's 
  face...and for the first time, we see the formidable man 
  smile. Varro and the men go INSANE behind him. Ashur glances 
  at the celebrating Barca, realizing he just lost a fortune 
  to him on the wager. He is now beyond fucked.

  THE ARENA

  The giant's body slumps to the sand. LIGHTNING FLASHES. 
  THUNDER BOOMS. The heavens split open as it begins to RAIN. 
  The crowd ROARS.

  THE PULVINUS

  Batiatus throws his arms up in celebration, gloating over 
  Solonius as the Magistrate bolts to his feet. Ilithyia is 
    post-orgasmic, the sight of gore exploding inside her. 
  Lucretia stands numb. Her eyes, as well as Naevia's, fall on





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.
  CONTINUED:

  CRIXUS,

  the rain mixing with the blood caked on his face as he slips 
  into unconsciousness. Spartacus glances at him with concern 
  as the Medicus rushes to aid the fallen Gaul. The crowd 
  ROARS Spartacus' name, drawing his attention to the stands.

                                        THE CROWD
                          Spar-ta-cus!! Spar-ta-cus!!

  Spartacus holds his blood-drenched arms up in victory. The 
  crowd roars. The drought is ended. But the legend of 
  Spartacus has just begun...


  BLACKOUT.
