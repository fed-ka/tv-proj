                                        "WHAT IT SEEMS"*

          (GENERAL NOTE: JOHNNY IS STILL USING A SINGLE CANE
          THROUGHOUT EVEN IF IT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY CALLED FOR.)

                                              TEASER*

          FADE IN:

          RECAP OF PILOT*

            ...ending with Allison coming home as it begins to rain...*
          seeing the killer's boots.*


  11*EXT. ALLISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING (NEW SHOT)

          Rain falling.  Lightning illuminating the house like*
            something out of an old James Whale movie.  (Note: Include*
          mailbox in shot so we will recognize the house in Scene*
          16.)*


  22INT. ALLISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A SMALL BASEMENT WINDOW

          breaks as a hand in a black glove punches through it... 
          and our first thought has to be this is the killer but as
          the hand reaches in, unlocks the lock and then opens the
          door, we see it's JOHNNY and BRUCE... wet from the rain,
          eyes intense... Bruce is carrying a baseball bat, Johnny
          using his cane... lightning flashes now and then... they
          pause once they're inside... whispering --

                                        BRUCE
                          Anything you want to tell me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like?

                                        BRUCE
                        Like 'I can see the killer and
                        he's hiding upstairs in the hall
                        closet'...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't have X-ray vision, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you sure?
                                (as they climb the
                                  stairs)
                        How do you know if you don't try?


          UPSTAIRS - INTERCUTTING STEADICAMS AS THEY CHECK THROUGH
          THE HOUSE -- BRUCE

          pauses by a door, hesitates, opens it quickly... sees no
          one inside and moves on...


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

          moving, encountering no one... he hears a strange noise...
              clickety-clickety-clickety... he reacts, moves toward the
          sound...


  33INT. DEN - LIGHTNING FLASHES IN THE EYES OF A HAMSTER

          running an endless race around its spinning wheel in its
          cage... it stops to stare at Johnny who sticks his head
          in the door...


  44INT. ALLISON'S BEDROOM

          as Johnny enters... like everywhere else, there's no one
          to be found... he takes off his gloves and starts to touch
            things... a hairbrush, a nurse's uniform hanging on the
          back of a door.  Bruce enters... Johnny grows more
          frustrated as the scene continues...

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, he's not in the hall closet. 

          More desperate, Johnny starts touching the bed, the walls,
          the windows...

                                        JOHNNY
                        The hospital said she went home
                        three hours ago... so where the
                        hell is she... I don't feel
                          anything...

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you're just trying too
                        hard...

                        ...What if it means she's already
                        dead?

          Off Bruce's reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT.*

  55*INT. PENOBSCOT COUNTRY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT -
          CLOSE-UP ON DEPUTY FRANK DODD (23) (RESHOOT ENTIRE SCENE)*

          In contrast to Johnny's desperation, Dodd is calm,
          measured... Johnny, wet and impatient, is sitting at Dodd's*
          desk as the deputy takes the report...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (controlled)
                        It is my real name.  Smith.  John
                        Smith.    

          Dodd stares at him a beat then, unconvinced, types a short
          burst into his computer.  We see we're in a modest office. 
          Up 'till now, it's been a quiet night.  Bruce is sitting
          by the door, watching Johnny give the report.  Two other
          deputies (including ROSCOE, 30) and an attractive but
            dressed-down police reporter, DANA BRIGHT, 25, are playing
          liar's poker in a far corner... her feet are up on the
          desk, crossed at the ankle as a man's might be... she
          studies a dollar bill...

                                        DODD
                        And why do you think something
                        has happened to this woman, Mr...
                          "Smith"?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Isn't it enough that she's still
                        missing three hours after the
                          hospital said...

                                        DODD
                        We don't begin to investigate
                        missing person reports for forty-
                        eight hours.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...She may be dead by then... she
                        may already be dead...

          Dodd is growing more suspicious of this man with every

            answer... he studies him a long distrustful beat...

                                        DODD
                        And how would you know that, Mr.
                        Smith?

          Behind Johnny, we may see Bruce hang his head and rub his
            temple...

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a beat)
                        I just do. 

          Bruce just can't stay silent any longer --

                                        BRUCE
                        He sees things.  Okay?  Like a
                        psychic but times a hundred.  He
                        sees things.   

          At that, the reporter swings her legs off the desk...

                                        DANA
                        Scuse me, Roscoe...

                                        BRUCE
                        He saved a baby from a burning
                          house...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        He found a man's mother that
                          everyone thought was dead.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce... sit down...

                                        BRUCE
                        Do not, under any circumstances,
                        play poker with him.  Okay?  Listen
                        to the man.

          The Sheriff who has come out of his office to see what
          the commotion is about... and in case we've forgotten, he
          is WALT BANNERMAN, Sarah's husband... who moves to
            Johnny...

                        I'm Sheriff Bannerman.  Can I
                        help you?

          Johnny stands... realizing who he is...

          Walt gives him a look - do I know you?

                        catch the strangler?

                        Don't answer that.  Let's go in
                        my office.

                        Piece of advice, the media is not
                        your friend.  Unless of course

          over with... he doesn't believe any of this...

                                        WALT
                        Okay, so let's hear it; you had,
                        what... a... a trance and you saw
                          something... a murder...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She may not be dead yet... I'm
                          hoping... sometimes these visions
                        take place in the future and...

                                        WALT
                                (not listening,
                                  overlapping)
                        ...What do they call that - second
                        sight?

                                        JOHNNY

                        They don't have a name for what's
                          happened to me.  

          Johnny studies the man who is married to the woman he
          loves...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I had a car accident six years
                        ago after leaving my fianc e's
                        house.  I was in a coma for six
                        years.

          Dead silence.  Walt's face goes pale... he stares at Johnny
          a long, long beat... after a beat --

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        Give my love to your family, won't
                        you?

          Walt lets out a deep, incredulous breath... this is a
          helluva way to meet each other...

                                        WALT

          He stands up... tries to get a handle on all this...

                          Because, you know, it sounds like
                        you're not entirely all right
                        yet.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sheriff, I'm not even close to
                        "all right".    

          Johnny studies him a long beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you don't want to believe me,
                        there's nothing I can do about

                        But something came up.

          He comes over, sits beside her on the floor, kisses her
          hello on the cheek.

          And this is something they would have discussed and decided

          The rain has ended but the ground is still wet from the
          night before.  Johnny is taking a walk in his neighborhood
          as Purdy's limo arrives.  Purdy gets out of the back...
          beams at Johnny...

          The words don't quite fit the man.  Six years ago, Johnny
          might have smirked and made a sarcastic comment but a lot
          has happened and Johnny stifles any feelings he might
          have had toward Purdy and simply smiles (and avoids
          touching him)...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.  Got to do ten miles this
                          morning.

                        Ten.  Well, I don't know if my
                        legs will stretch quite that far...

          As they begin to walk, the long limo inches along behind
          them... Johnny glances back but chooses not to comment...

                        May I make a bold suggestion? 
                        Come visit us out at the
                          university, inspect your mother's
                        legacy.  There's still work to be
                        done...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me?  I don't think I'd fit in,
                          Reverend.

                                        PURDY
                        Sure you would.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The truth is... I've never been
                        much of a believer in anything I
                          couldn't see with a microscope. 

                                        PURDY
                        Even now?  After what you've been
                          through?
                                (cordial)
                        Your... resurrection is pretty 
                        strong evidence of a greater power
                        at work from where I sit.  There
                        I go again, preaching.  Sorry,  
                        it's my job.

          He stops.  The car stops behind him.

                                        PURDY
                        Think about it, okay?

          Purdy smiles warmly, sticks out his hand to shake good-
          bye...

                        I don't mean to be rude... I find
                        it difficult to... touch people...
                        since the coma... sort of a
                          phobia...

          Purdy studies him with sympathy and concern, nods.  Behind
          him, the limo driver gets out and quickly opens the back
          door...

                                        PURDY
                          Anything you need.
                                (call me implied)

          He gets in the car.


  1616EXT. ALLISON'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny, miles later, continuing his walk, arrives on the
          sidewalk... (lose wild line: "Allsion, where are you")... *
          he studies the building, looking for clues... he moves
          toward the mailbox, opens it to look inside and as he
          touches it...


  1717SCENE FREEZES A BEAT AND PIVOTS AROUND JOHNNY - (OPTICAL)

          as he finds himself in a mailman's uniform, carrying a
          bag of mail... a moment later, a barking dog is snapping
          at his heels and he runs for his life... the vision ends
          abruptly as we cut back to:


  1818JOHNNY

          still standing there by the mailbox as before... he takes
          a moment... then begins to walk slowly around the house.

          as he moves outside a bedroom window... he takes another
          step, he sees boot prints in the soft yard... takes a
          beat, squats and puts his hand in the muddy print...


  2121SCENE FREEZES A BEAT AND PIVOTS AROUND JOHNNY - (OPTICAL)

          and suddenly he is wearing a raincoat with a hood... it's
          raining like hell... thunder crashes... his heart pounds,

          we can hear it... his breath gets short and tight... he
          looks down to see --


          THE DISTINCTIVE SHOES OF THE KILLER


          JOHNNY ECU

          as he reacts... and sees...


          HIS POV - ALLISON THROUGH THE WINDOW

          in her bedroom, taking off her nurse's uniform and placing
          it on the door where we saw it hanging before... as she
          moves to a closet, now in bra and panties...


          JOHNNY ECU

          and lightning flashes... in a rush of images, we're in...


  2222EXT. FIELD - NIGHT - (OPTICAL)

          as seen in episode one, the shovel is in his hands... the
          shallow grave... a girl's body is thrown in (although we
          don't see her face)...*

          standing several yards away... he moves toward Johnny...

                        Look, this isn't making things
                        any easier for you and me...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (the vision still
                                  resonating)
                        He was standing here.  Last night. 
                          Watching her.

          Walt sighs, looks at him, looks at the window.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: WHAT IT SEEMS - ACT ONE - 01/17/02         16.

                        The man in the boots.

          Walt raises an eyebrow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Steel-toed Navy boots... size
                        eleven and a half, narrow...

          And now Walt just turns and stares at him, would almost
          laugh if this weren't so serious...

                                        WALT

                        I told you... I see things...

                        We got a plaster mold from one of
                        the crime scenes... never told
                        the public... one of those things
                        you don't want the killer to know
                        you know?  Steel-toed Navy boot.
                        Size eleven and a half, narrow.

                                        WALT (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                        By the way, what size boots do
                        you wear?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ten, wide.

                        Good, because right now every
                        other cop in America would be
                        saying you should be my prime
                        suspect...

                        When the last three girls were
                        killed you were in a coma.  As

                        one.  Unless you sleepwalk.

          He walks away, inspecting the house...

                        leak in my department?

          Dodd reacts and, as we widen, throws a curious glance to

          a smile forming on her lips.


  2828EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce in sweats... Johnny's dragging from a

                        How'd you know it was me?  Don't
                        answer that.  And don't leave. 
                        I'm picking you up in twenty
                          minutes.

          He hangs up the phone, shakes his head at the whole thing.

          as Johnny hangs up the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's going to arrest me
                        after all.


  3131INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -  DAY

          Johnny is seated.  Walt pulls out a manilla envelope from
          his safe... 

                                        WALT
                        I can't believe I'm doing this.  

          Walt angles the envelope and slides out three plastic
          evidence bags, marked for the three murders...  Inside
          each are several cigarette butts...

                                        WALT
                        Aside from the footprints, this
                        is the only evidence our guy might
                        have left behind.

                        Look, if it's a waste of time...

                        I don't know.  Sometimes it works. 
                        And sometimes it doesn't.

                                        WALT
                        Now, don't start with me.  Already
                        with the excuses...

          He pushes the bag at Johnny.  A challenge.  He leans back
          in his chair... his gaze says 'convince me'...

                                        WALT
                        Same brand, all three murder
                          scenes... half the smokers in the
                        county smoke the same kind...

          Johnny opens the bag, pulls out a cigarette butt...


  3232SCENE FREEZES ON HIS TOUCH THEN CONTINUES - (OPTICAL)

          in a match cut, his fingers are holding a lit cigarette
          and it is EXTERIOR - NIGHT... it is raining...  CLOSE-UP
          ON JOHNNY as he takes a puff...

                        The cigarettes.  Whoever smoked
                        them considers it a weakness. 
                        Doesn't want anyone to know.

          And as we continue to move, we fuse the two scenes - Walt
          is in the sheriff's office, Johnny is outside in the
          rain... he starts to breath harder...

                                        WALT
                        What's wrong?

          Johnny begins to shudder...

                        His mother... did terrible things
                        to him.  Painful things.  He's
                          impotent.
                                (beat, an insight)
                        Except when he kills.  He only
                        kills when it rains.  Outside. 
                        To wash away any evidence.

          Walt reacts, didn't know that.  Continuing our move around
          the INT/EXT fusion...and we may begin to sense a
          personality change in Johnny... more cocky, a little more
          wired... he begins to sing softly...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)

                        at all.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh they struggled.  They kicked, 
                        they clawed... but their fingers
                        just slipped off the slick vinyl
                          raincoat...

          As he takes another puff, we move to reveal a dead woman's
          body lying at his feet in the rain... and we may realize
          the cigarette he's smoking is post-coital...

                        they don't get a bit of me...
                        because I'm just so slick!

          Walt is looking into the eyes of a killer...

                        Hey!  You're talking crazy!

          Johnny's eyes change... he looks at Walt and drops the
            cigarette butt to the tabletop, exhausted. 

                                        JOHNNY

                        phone number -- that would help.  

          Johnny can't give him that.  Walt shakes his head, rises,

          Several marked and unmarked police cars parked in front...
          forensic technicians are moving in and out (mostly out)
          of the house carrying their gear... Johnny and Walt get
          out of his patrol car and move toward the door...

          Moving with them as they enter... to see Allison sitting
          on the sofa talking to Dodd.

          Neither does Johnny... he glances over at Walt who, if he
          had a hammer, would be banging himself over the head with
          it and will not under any circumstances look at Johnny
          because he might kill him if he did.  And on that image,

          A few minutes later.  Johnny stands alone as the forensic

          confused and very much out of place.  A few yards away,

                          I didn't even stop to check my

          Johnny stares at her a beat and walks away... she looks
          up to see Walt exit, saying good-bye to Allison...

                                        BRUCE
                                (on the phone)
                        Damn, your new brain must come
                        with Caller I-d.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's Caller I-d?

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE
                                (on the phone)
                        Later.  Look, I'm coming to get
                        you.  I know what happened.

  5050EXT. ALLISON'S HOUSE - DAY

          As Bruce and Johnny get out of Bruce's car...

                                        BRUCE
                                  (mid-conversation)
                        ...so, I'm talking to Allison all
                        day at work trying to figure out
                        how we screwed up so badly...
                        well, not we but you... when
                          suddenly the whole Zen of what
                          happened became crystal clear...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Since when are you Zen Master
                        Flash?  You take a class once a
                        week.

    50CONTINUED:50

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm a master compared to you so
                        zip it up.  Life is about moments
                        of time strung together... take
                        one moment out of the string,
                        change one detail, turn left
                        instead of right, and all of life
                          changes.  Now look here...

          He moves to the side of the road...

                                        BRUCE
                        This is where Allison said she
                        parked her car... she gets out
                        and opens the trunk to get some
                        of her books out, right...?

          He mimes her movements...

                                        BRUCE
                        She walks to the door.  

          He walks toward the door.

                                        BRUCE
                        If you're the guy, where are you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know... maybe somewhere
                        over here...

          He moves to the left of the door where she might not see
          him.  Then crosses the walkway to the right...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or here...

          And now he reaches the same spot we saw the boots the
          night before... as he does --


  5151THE SCENE FREEZES FOR A MOMENT - (OPTICAL)

          and we pivot around to find Johnny as the man in the slick
          vinyl raincoat standing there... thunder rolls... but it
          is not raining yet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here.  This is where he was.

          He's watching Allison walk toward the door... she talks
          to him in her own voice but the words are Bruce's... now
          it begins to rain...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: WHAT IT SEEMS - ACT THREE - 01/17/02       35.

                                        ALLISON/BRUCE
                        Good.  Okay.  So I'm Allison and
                        I'm strolling to the door.  Only
                        I never get there because of you. 
                        You pull me into the bushes.  I'm
                        dead.  Good-bye.


  5252RESUME DAY - JOHNNY AND BRUCE

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not getting your point.

                                        BRUCE
                        Adjust one detail and all of life
                          changes.

          Bruce moves back to position one.


  5353RESUME NIGHT - JOHNNY AND ALLISON - (OPTICAL)

          Allison back at the trunk of the car, again: her voice
          but Bruce's words...

                                        ALLISON/BRUCE
                        Okay... I'm Allison opening the
                          trunk... only this time...

          The phone inside her house starts to RING as it did the
          night before... Johnny reacts, still doesn't understand...

                                        ALLISON/BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        I hear the phone... and what do I
                        do?

          She runs into the house as we saw her do... right past
            Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        She ran.


  5454RESUME DAY - JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Bruce is holding a cell phone which he just used to call
            Allison's number.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        She ran, instead of walked.  And
                        got by him...





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: WHAT IT SEEMS - ACT THREE - 01/17/02       36.


    54CONTINUED:54

                                        BRUCE
                        That was me on the phone.  Calling
                        for like the fifteenth time trying
                        to find her.  She didn't get there
                        in time to answer it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He only kills outside.  In the
                        rain.  Once she was inside, she
                        was safe.

                                        BRUCE
                        End of story.

          A beat.  Slow push to Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish it were.
                                (off Bruce's look)
                        He had a compulsion to kill that
                        night, Bruce.  If it wasn't
                        Allison... then he killed someone
                        else.

          Off Bruce's reaction...

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:

  5555EXT. ALLISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - (OPTICAL)

          As we remember it from the murder night... thunder and
            lightning... the man in the slick vinyl raincoat stands
          outside Allison's bedroom window... she's inside, taking
          off her clothes... moving around to find Johnny in the
          raincoat... we can hear his heart pounding... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's frustrated.  Angry.  Like a
                          predator who's lost his prey.


            BEGINNING A SERIES OF MATCHING SHOTS AS WE INTERCUT BETWEEN
          DAY (BRUCE WATCHING, GUIDING THE VISION) AND NIGHT (JOHNNY
          AS THE KILLER)...

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay... you can't get to her so
                        what do you do...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can't stay any longer... god, I
                        can feel it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        The hunger.  Oh God.  The need. 

          He begins to walk...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to find... someone...
                        else...

          He moves away from Allison's house...


  5656EXT. ALLISON'S STREET - NIGHT

          As Johnny, as the killer, walks casually down the sidewalk,
          smoking a cigarette, hands in pockets, hood pulled over
          his head, thunder and lightning... humming...

                                        JOHNNY
                        "Jimmy crack corn, and I don't
                        care.  Jimmy crack corn, and I
                        don't care."

          He pauses in his song as he see something off camera.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What time did Allison come home?

                        The early show was just letting
                        out...

          Moving to reveal from his POV -- a TRIO OF YOUNG WOMEN
          among the crowd coming out of the movie theater.

          They react as they see it's starting to rain, quickly say
          'good night' to each other.  Two of the women run between
          rain drops away together; the third, a blonde, moves alone
          around the side of the theater toward the parking lot.

          opens it to reveal Johnny, Bruce behind him... Johnny
          looks wrecked, eyes bloodshot, shaky, a frightening image
          to anyone let along a little boy... the boy looks up at
          him for a beat then runs away...

                        Mommy, it's that man!

          Sarah enters... recoils as she sees how Johnny appears...

                                        SARAH
                        My God, Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to talk to Walt... they
                        told me he...

          Walt enters, reacts, incensed to see Johnny, makes sure
          the boy is safely gone.  In a low but angry voice --

                        This is... this is over the line.

                        Fianc .  Hasn't heard from her in
                        two days.  Last time any one saw
                        her she was leaving the movie
                          theater.  Right around the corner
                        from the Connover woman's house.
                                (beat, looking at

                        Just like our friend said.

          A voice calls "Sheriff" (O.S.) and Walt moves away from
            Johnny... looks at Johnny once - a grim look that says,
          okay, I'm convinced, I believe you now... and then walks
          away... as we stay with Johnny and Bruce...

                        John.

          Johnny couldn't care less.  He watches the woman's body
          being loaded into a medical examiner's vehicle...

                        How am I?

          And we begin to see, as Johnny realizes, how complex his
          life has become... the huge responsibility he now has...
          a power over life itself.  (Note: From existing cut, remove*
          Bruce's last line in Post, if possible.)  The body covered*
          in a body bag moves by them and Johnny steps forward
          blocking their way for an instant; every cop on the field
          looks at him with a mixture of fear and puzzlement...

          Johnny is overwhelmed by what he feels... eyes closed, he
          sinks to his knees almost in a prayer-like position...

                                (to Walt)
                        He would come home and tell her
                          everything... from the very first
                          murder... names, places, details...  

          Walt reads her reaction and she's clearly scared beyond
          what you'd expect in this situation...

                                (to Walt)
                        What are you looking at me like
                        that for?  You're not believing
                        him...?

                                        WALT
                        I'm gonna need to take a look
                        around, Henrietta.

                                        HENRIETTA
                        You can't do this!

          She tries to block him... he moves her out of the way.

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny)
                        Stay with her.

          Walt starts to go up the stairs...

  73A73AANGLE AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

          Walt doesn't have his gun out but his hand is resting on
          it in its holster... as he looks around the dark second
          floor... moving through the shadows... someone could jump
          out at any time...


  73B73BWITH JOHNNY AND HENRIETTA

          As she stares at him...

                        You kept a journal.  About all
                        the women he killed.  Where is
                        it, Mrs. Dodd?

          Her eyes react...

                                        HENRIETTA
                        You...  you've been sent here
                        from hell.

          And she retreats, disappearing into the darkness... Johnny
          moves after her...

          Moving with Johnny as he tries to find her in the
          shadows... an instant later she appears from the far side
          of the refrigerator brandishing a huge kitchen knife...
            startled, Johnny tries to fend her off but stumbles on
          his bad leg and goes down to the floor on his back...

          crazed now... coming down on top of Johnny... the knife
          coming down toward his chest, he uses his arm to protect
          himself and the knife slashes his shoulder, blood drips
          out...

                        Frank didn't go fishing.

          Walt moves through the kitchen toward the basement stairs. 
          Johnny struggles to get himself up...

          floor... a few records are stacked...

          Henrietta's body on the floor... blood seeping out from

          Moving with Walt as he kicks open a locked door beside
          the record player... and if he had any remaining doubts
          they are now surely gone... because this is a souvenir
          room of terror and death... a wall of newspaper clippings
          about the murders... keepsake items from his victims...
            lipsticks and compacts... the lips on some of the pictures
          of the victims have been painted with different colored
          lipstick... there are small tufts of hair pasted on some
          other photos... ripped panties and bras are fitted to
          blow up plastic dolls of women... and old-fashioned
            clothespins... Suddenly, Walt realizes he's not alone. 
          We reveal Frank Dodd just outside the doorway.

                        to know the first rule is never

          Walt turns to face him... his gun is facing down but still
          in his hand.

          But he's about to shoot when out of the darkness, Johnny's
          cane comes crunching down on his arm... the gun fires
          into the floor... Dodd coils back against Johnny throwing
          him against the old record player which comes to life as
          Walt fires but misses Dodd who disappears into the
          darkness... From the record player, Burl Ives begins to

          It's the most vulnerable we or Walt has ever seen her and

                        this case.

                        And you owe him an apology.

                        Why?  I wrote a good story
                        yesterday.

                                        DANA (CONT'D)
                        I'll write a better one tonight. 
                        You're big news, Mr. Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (grim, preoccupied)*
                        Just as soon not be.

          He climbs into the ambulance...

                                        DANA
                        The self-effacing, shy hero.  An
                          American classic.  In no time at
                        all, you'll be endorsing breakfast
                        cereal.

          Johnny gives her a dubious glance.  She grins and moves
          away; we stay with Johnny...

                                        DANA
                                (moving to O.S. action)
                        Hey, Roscoe... how about a quote...

          Johnny glances at the scene one last time and thinks about*
          what Dana said... and as the ambulance doors close and it
          pulls away...*

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO:*


  9292*INT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT (FORMERLY SCENE 10 - POSSIBLE
            RESHOOT)*

          Wide shot... darkened lighting... finding the lone*
          silhouette of Johnny coming home to an empty house -*
          emphasizing his isolation after seeing what his life might*
          have been... the only color in the shot coming from a*
          lavish almost vulgar arrangement of flowers in a vase*
          beside Johnny... he's reading a gift card...*


          INSERT - THE CARD WITH A FAITH HERITAGE ALLIANCE LOGO*

            handwritten: "Welcome home, Johnny!" signed Eugene Purdy.*


          RESUME (POSSIBLE RESHOOT)*

          Johnny silently walks up stairs, a man alone with his*
            thoughts...*

                                                                              FADE OUT:
