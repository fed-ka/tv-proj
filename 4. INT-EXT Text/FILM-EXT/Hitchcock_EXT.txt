We move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass
fire. Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes
stamping them out.
SUPER: PLAINFIELD, WISCONSIN, 1944
HENRY GEIN (O.S.)
We're just lucky it didn't reach the
trees...
We move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED
GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the
flames. Both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts.
Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat.
HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)
There's gonna be a lot more jobs at that
factory by Milwaukee come June. I could
put in a word.
ED GEIN
You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both
OF US--
HENRY GEIN
Can you stop being a momma's boy for one
second?
Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back.
HENRY GEIN (CONT'D)
I'm not trying to hurt you but Jesus you
got to live your own life someday. That
woman can take care of her own goddamn --
CLANG. Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and
goes down.
Ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. The look on
his face isn't anger. It's BLANK. He pulls at the flaps of
his Elmer Fudd hat... then calmly walks away.
The camera pans until we discover :
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
in his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the
whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few
feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea...
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
He takes a sip and turns to address the camera --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Good evening.
He places his cup daintily back on the saucer.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Brother has been slaying brother since
Cain and Abel, yet even I did not see
that coming. I was as blind-sided as poor
Henry over there.
He glances back over at the murder scene.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Apparently the authorities shared my
naivete and believed the young man's tale
that Henry fell and hit his head on a
stone and died of smoke asphyxiation.
He shrugs: `Who would've thought it?'
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Of course if they hadn't believed him, Ed
never would have had the opportunity to
commit the heinous acts for which he
became famous... and we wouldn't have our
little movie. Instead, we'd have more
nice, safe, predictable ones like
these...
CUT TO:
A RAPID MONTAGE OF CLIPS
from various Technicolor Films of the era: Peyton Place, with
Lana Turner and Betty Field. Pillow Talk with Doris Day and
Rock Hudson. A Summer Place with Sandra Dee --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Mere Technicolor baubles.
He shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS
LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump
produces an umbrella.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Ah. A bit of doom and gloom. Now, that's
more like it.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
As Hitch opens his brolly and the RAIN starts to bucket down
WE --
CUT TO :
Equally torrential rain lit up by rotating KLEIG LIGHTS as
they scan a MARQUEE: "WORLD PREMIERE! NORTH BY NORTHWEST.
DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK." JOSTLING CROWDS run the length
of the block.
SUPER: JULY 8, 1959.
A PUDGY HAND discreetly squeezes a tiny, delicate one.
ALFRED AND ALMA HITCHCOCK
Step out into a sea of FLASHBULBS. Hitch basks in the
limelight while Alma, his razor-sharp, charming wife of over
30 years stands in the background, uncomfortable with all the
attention.
Hitchcock's agent LEW WASSERMAN, 45, dynamic, charismatic,
comes into view.
LEW WASSERMAN
This thing is going to be gigantic. I
wish I had twenty percent of the take.
Lew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS.
REPORTER ONE
Does tonight's incredible reaction
surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
No, when I was planning North by
Northwest I could already hear the
screams and laughter.
(then, to a BEAUTIFUL
BLONDE FAN)
Any questions, my dear?
The blonde fan, holding out her autograph book, shakes her
head `no' and giggles.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
A pity.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
The reporters crack up. Alma manages a polite smile as Lew
helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment
to sign his autograph for the blond fan...
REPORTER TWO
Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six
motion pictures. You host a hit TV show
seen around the world. You're the most
famous director in the history of the
medium... but you're sixty years old.
Shouldn't you just quit while you're
ahead?
HOLDING ON HITCHCOCK
motionless and quietly devastated as FLASHBULBS CRACKLE over
his face. The whiteness transforms into...
The FAMOUS MOUNTAIN TOP icon looms large. TWO GUARDS snap-to
for the arrival of Hollywood royalty.
FIRST GUARD
Mr. Hitchcock. Mrs. Hitchcock.
Alma waves from the wheel of a GLEAMING BLACK 1957 CADILLAC.
Hitchcock sits next to her. He has his two SEALYHAM TERRIERS
on his lap. He nods, awaiting more.
FIRST GUARD (CONT'D)
(to the dogs)
Sirs.
The Cadillac pulls up. Alma notes Hitchcock's look of
frustrated envy as CREW MEMBERS bustle in and out of STAGE
15. It's a hive of activity.
ALMA
There's a story out there waiting for you
somewhere, Hitch. I promise.
He gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door.
ALMA (CONT'D)
Don't forget your lunch.
Alma hands him a compact Fortnum & Mason basket and pats him
on his girth. He opens it to discover CELERY AND CARROT
STICKS wrapped in Saran.
OMITTED
ON HITCH
Completely engrossed as he sits reading "Psycho" in a chair
by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home. He takes another
gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine
glass out of view. Alma pops her head in the door.
ALMA
Hungry?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Famished.
She disappears to take off her coat.
ALMA (O.S.)
If you're good, maybe you can have a
grapefruit later.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
She comes back in again carrying some galleys, notices the
title of Hitch's book -- some trash called "Psycho."
ALMA (CONT'D)
Whit gave me the galleys of his new book
yesterday at lunch. I've already got some
ideas on how you could adapt it.
Hitch continues reading.
ALMA (CONT'D)
It's elegant, sophisticated, full of
INTRIGUE --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?
She taps Hitch's book dismissively with the galleys of "Taxi
to Dubrovnik."
ALMA
This might be the one, Alfred.
He finally looks up.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Leave it on the night stand.
As she leaves she points to Hitch's `hidden' wine glass.
ALMA
There are calories in that, you know.
But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his
imagination starting to turn...
The Hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the
GARDENERS trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Just think of the shock value. Killing
off your leading lady halfway through.
Alma can feel Hitch looking at her, waiting for a response.
Clearly he isn't going to let this one go.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
You're intrigued. Admit it.
She butters her toast, casually taunts him by adding a large
spoon of marmalade.
ALMA
Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
Hitch falls silent, a chastised schoolboy.
ALMA (CONT'D)
You shouldn't wait till halfway
through... Kill her off after 30 minutes.
OMITTED (SCENE 17)
Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy
courtyard past Hitch's office.
LEW WASSERMAN
What a putz. You know what his family did
before they built those movie palaces?
Ran a grocery store.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
My father ran a grocery store.
LEW WASSERMAN
Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He
should show some respect.
Hitch turns to Lew.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
They think I've lost my touch, Lew.
My association with television has
cheapened me.
LEW WASSERMAN
Are you referring to that deal I got you
where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine
grand an episode and you own the
negative? That's my kind of cheap.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
They just want the same thing over and
over. They've put me in a coffin and now
they're nailing down the lid.
Lew puts a comforting hand on him...
LEW WASSERMAN
Hitch, I will never let that happen.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Hitch doesn't respond, Lew sensing the true depth of his
friend's melancholy.
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
How much do you think you can make this
picture for?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Eight hundred thousand... Give or take.
Lew digests the figure...
LEW WASSERMAN
I have whisky in the car.
ALMA does afternoon laps in the pool. A contemplative
Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black
sunglasses and a business suit. He watches Alma a moment.
Finally she notices him.
ALMA
You're back early.
He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of
lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off.
ALMA (CONT'D)
I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's
book a chance.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What about him?
ALMA
He knows you well enough.
She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her
swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it
for that much longer.
He looks off cryptically.
ALMA
Why?
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Paramount refuses to finance the movie.
Imagine -- The studio that brought you
Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On
Earth considers Psycho distasteful.
He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Lew can't find the money. Not quickly
enough at least.
ALMA
Why not wait?
He doesn't reply. She knows him well enough too and doesn't
question him further.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
We're going to have to go it alone, old
girl.
(BEAT)
We'll finance the movie ourselves.
ALMA
Are we going to have to sell the entire
house or just the pool?
She looks at Hitch but he's not joking. She turns to survey
their beloved home and gardens.
A long pause.
ALMA (CONT'D)
Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why
this one, Hitch? It's not just because so
many people are telling you 'no,' is it?
Pause.
ALMA (CONT'D)
Hitch?
Without turning he takes her hand.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Remember the fun we had when we started
out and there was so little money and
time? We took risks, we experimented. We
invented new ways of making pictures
because we had to.
A long moment as he gazes across the pool.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
I want to feel that kind of freedom
again.
He turns to look into her eyes for the first time. A glimpse
of the real Hitchcock. Someone even his wife doesn't see that
often...
The famous gates and the executive building beyond it.
LEW WASSERMAN (PRE-LAP)
Barney, we're about to propose a
restructured deal for "Psycho"...
The door opens and Hitchs step outside. The Cadillac is
waiting.
Alma follows him out and makes a final adjustment to his tie.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
The only thing worse than a visit to the
dentist is one to the censor.
ALMA
Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your
temper.
Anthony Perkins now sits across from Hitchcock.
ANTHONY PERKINS
I can't count how many times I've seen
Strangers On a Train and Rope.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Well, Norman is the logical extension of
the boys in those movies. Appealing,
sensitive, suffering the terrible burden
of being forced to pretend to be
something he is not.
Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins.
ANTHONY PERKINS
My only worry is that playing Norman
might cut too close to home.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
How so?
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Hitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young
actor...
ANTHONY PERKINS
I was incredibly close to my mother. So
close I remember wishing my father would
drop dead. And then when I was five, he
did just that...He keeled over from a
heart attack.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
You see I've been guilty my whole life,
Mr. Hitchcock.
Hitch is enthralled.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Try to remember this is all just make
believe.
Perkins wishes he could be more reassured...
ANTHONY PERKINS
Not to be prudish, but how far do you
plan to push Norman's relationship with
his mother?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Further than you can possibly imagine.
On Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting himself
in for?
Hitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's
dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the
rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure.
She shovels the manure around the rosebushes.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I'm getting blisters just looking at you.
ALMA
Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and
exercise is exactly what you need.
He holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red
Sydonie rose.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
If I could get Grace Kelly to play the
girl, they'd let me get away with
anything.
ALMA
Well you can't. She's a princess now
which makes her permanently unattainable.
Hitchcock beheads the ROSE, muttering to himself.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And all the more desirable.
His shears are now poised over a yellow specimen.
ALMA
Lew suggested Deborah Kerr.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Too... Scottish.
Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect
pink rose.
ALMA
What about Janet Leigh? She's always the
`good girl' but she did awfully well in
Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do
you remember how you always remarked on
her figure at the Wassermans' parties?
As the shears hover on the stem, unsure whether to cut...
MATCH CUT TO:
PERFECT PINK ROSEBUSHES
Like in a Douglas Sirk movie. The same roses that are the
`color' of Janet Leigh. Alma hovers with her secateurs for a
moment and then starts SNIPPING off their heads with a
Caligula-like lack of mercy.
A sign posted outside the soundstage reads, "PRODUCTION
REHEARSALS 9401. ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS!" It only makes
passing REPORTERS AND WORKERS more curious.
Hitch knocks at the door.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Are you decent my dear?
JANET steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and
pencil skirt. She does a twirl for him. The effect is
stunning. Even the stagehands stop to watch.
JANET LEIGH
Am I alright?
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
His picks a tiny piece of lint on her sleeve.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Perfect.
As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet
them.
ANTHONY PERKINS
I want to thank you again for this
opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock.
Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a
gracious peck on the cheek.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Look at you two. America's favorite boy
and girl nextdoor...
Janet flicks a glance back at Hitch.
JANET LEIGH
And we're about to move to a whole new
neighborhood.
Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch
and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the
soundstage where the crew are assembling.
VERA MILES
Morning Janet. Morning Tony.
Vera Miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig.
VERA MILES (CONT'D)
"Thanks" for the wardrobe, Hitch.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
(already moving past her)
That's hand-woven imported camel hair
from Rodier. Don't you approve?
VERA MILES
You're the genius.
She checkmates him with a ravishing smile.
VERA MILES (CONT'D)
One thing, though. My script is missing
the last ten pages.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the
revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're
just in time for the oath.
VERA MILES
The what?
He steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming
a circle with the rest of the cast.
He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and
officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly
follow suit, all except for Vera.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I solemnly promise...
CREW
I solemnly promise...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
(ignoring Vera's sarcasm)
That I will not divulge the plot nor the
many secrets of Psycho...
CREW
That I will not divulge the plot nor the
many secrets of Psycho...
WE SEE VERA'S CROSSED FINGERS BEHIND HER BACK
Then tilt up to Janet's look of mock disapproval. Vera pokes
her tongue out.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
To friends, relatives, trade reporters or
columnists -- not even to outgoing
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless
him.
Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the
reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right
beside him.
As Alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new
swimsuit. She breaks into a front crawl. Her strokes are
vigorous, surprisingly so.
She drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through
the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with
rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster...
Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL
GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the
stage.
Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks
into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls
back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty
SECRETARIES.
Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC.
WHITFIELD COOK
You girls go on ahead.
The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette
before catching up with the others.
Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the
soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there...
WHITFIELD COOK
Hello, stranger.
She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac.
ALMA
Whit.
WHITFIELD COOK
Where have you been hiding yourself?
ALMA
I've been doing the revisions on...
She points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
WHITFIELD COOK
Psycho.
(THEN)
And how is the old boy?
ALMA
In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that
he's back on the set.
WHITFIELD COOK
And you? How are you?
ALMA
Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to
do for Reader's Digest on what it's like
to be married to a man obsessed by
murder.
He looks at her a moment.
WHITFIELD COOK
I've got a better idea.
He steps closer.
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
Why don't we drive out to Santa Barbara?
We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy
steaks we like at El Encanto.
He playfully tugs at her sleeve.
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
No shoptalk ... No silly magazine
articles...just a wonderful meal...
Alma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the
WINDOW of the production office and notice the tell-tale BEND
in the blinds.
HITCH exits the soundstage doors, only to find the humorless
face of BARNEY BALABAN blocking his office door.
BARNEY BALABAN
Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm
hearing interesting things...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
It's a wonder you can hear anything over
the noise coming from the Shurlock
office.
Balaban offers up his handkerchief. Hitchcock waves it away
even though he's now covered in sweat.
BARNEY BALABAN
I shouldn't be in a position of just
hearing things, Hitch. It's time you
showed me some footage.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Why?
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
BARNEY BALABAN
To see if you're making a picture
Paramount can actually release.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
As you well know, Barney, my contract
guarantees me final cut.
BARNEY BALABAN
Your contract also says Paramount isn't
required to distribute any film that
could cause us embarrassment.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis
pictures you're all so proud of.
He slams the door in Balaban's startled face.
A majestic view of the coastline as Whitfield Cook's Cream
MERCEDES 190CL, zooms along, top down. Alma wears white-
rimmed sunglasses and a head scarf.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Whitfield, in true Hitchcock leading man style, has the
perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair.
WHITFIELD COOK
Those steaks haven't changed at all, have
they?
ALMA
It's so nice not to have to take care of
someone, even if it's just for an hour or
two.
She takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past.
ALMA (CONT'D)
Whit, where are we going? You still
haven't told me.
WHITFIELD COOK
I have a little surprise.
ALMA
A surprise. How fun.
Whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car
ROARS off down the highway.
Hitch stands in the parking lot tapping his foot impatiently
near the parked Ford Fairlaine police car used in `PSYCHO'.
Janet watches him, sitting behind the wheel of her VOLKSWAGEN
BEETLE. After a moment she toots her horn and drives up.
JANET LEIGH
What happened to your driver?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I've been asking myself the same thing.
She smiles.
JANET LEIGH
I can give you a ride if you want.
Hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with
great effort inches his massive frame through the open door.
TWO PAIRS OF FEET
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
nesting in the sand. Alma and Whit sit out watching the surf.
The water laps over their toes.
ALMA
I don't mind that he uses his obsession
to fuel his art. I just don't like it
when he uses it against me.
WHITFIELD COOK
He's like any great artist. Impossible to
live with but worth the effort.
(he throws a rock into the
SEA)
Van Gogh wasn't exactly a walk in the
park either.
ALMA
Did you know when we started out I was
his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out
until he'd worked his way up to assistant
director.
Whit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through
her fingers...
WHITFIELD COOK
What do you think of that place over
there?
He nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way.
ALMA
Looks nice. Terrific location. Why?
WHITFIELD COOK
It's mine.
She looks at him askance. Is he joking?
ALMA
I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't
she tell me?
WHITFIELD COOK
She doesn't know about it.
The sun is setting on the Hitchcocks' driveway. The VW pulls
to a stop in front of the front door.
INSIDE THE CAR
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Janet looks over -- decides to risk it.
JANET LEIGH
So what did happen between you and Vera?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I was going to make her star. But she
chose the life of a housewife.
He stops chewing. We push in as his features turn reflective.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
I cast her as the lead in Vertigo. Then
two weeks before filming she told me was
pregnant.
He screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at Janet.
Then, almost like a child --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Why do they do it? Why do they always
betray me?
ON JANET
As she looks across and sees the lonely abandoned little boy
just sitting there...
Alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around. It
is old and falling apart with only a few functional
furnishings.
WHITFIELD COOK
I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A
place to get away from the wife and kid
and write.
ALMA
Very Bohemian.
WHITFIELD COOK
You might find that room interesting.
Alma looks. The door is partially open -- she sees the one
conspicuously new item of furniture. A double bed.
ALMA
Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong
idea.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
He gives her a rakish grin, then pushes the door open further
to reveal the deck beyond.
TWO MAUVE CORONA TYPEWRITERS
Sit on a table facing each other.
WHITFIELD COOK
If you were serious about helping me
adapt my book, I thought it would be the
perfect hideaway.
She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and
the crashing surf.
Then, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the
typewriters. Gives the key an approving TAP.
Hitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it.
His annoyance only increases when he notices the SCATTERED
LEAVES `contaminating` the surface of the pool.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Look at this mess.
He grabs the net and starts scooping them out.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Bloody belt-tightening.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
He can't get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down
on his hands and knees and starts PULLING OUT the leaves with
his hands.
ALMA
watches from the window... then turns away.
HITCH
Pulls out handful after handful of wet leaves, clawing away
at them like a madman...
A TEMPERATURE DIAL INCHES INTO THE RED
Alma sits at her typewriter while Whit stares off, looking a
little uncertain.
ALMA
Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling
his age. He'll come around.
WHITFIELD COOK
But he's right. It does need more
feeling.
Alma ponders the problem. Finally --
ALMA
So why don't we put some in?
She gets to her feet and starts to pace...
ALMA (CONT'D)
All we need is a better catalyst. Some
innocuous little trigger to release all
that underlying desire.
The soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless
HISS of SHOWER WATER --
Peggy and Perkins to react to the noise...
HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME
They come through the door to see Hitch lying on the floor.
He looks like he's dead.
PEGGY
Oh God...
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Peggy rushes forward to help. Perkins just stands and stares,
as if paralysed in some Freudian nightmare.
A TELEPHONE
starts to ring.
It is inside the beach house, and partially drowned out by
the sound of the crashing waves. Alma and Whit are on the
deck, acting out the scene as they write, too engrossed to
notice.
WHITFIELD COOK
What if Helen and Michael try and get
into the cab at the same time?
ALMA
Even better, what if they reached for the
cab door at exactly the same time?
Alma demonstrates so that their hands touch.
ALMA (CONT'D)
That way, we could start close on the
hands...
(tracking the movement)
... and then tilt up to the eyes.
They stare into each other's eyes, lips just inches apart...
WHITFIELD COOK
That feels better already.
Finally, the phone intrudes.
ALMA
Are you going to get that?
With some effort, Whit goes inside and picks it up.
WHITFIELD COOK (O.S.)
Hullo?... Yes... Hold on.
He comes outside, holding out the receiver for Alma.
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
It's for you.
Balaban, incensed, leaves the stage with Kirkpatrick. Alma
steps out into the sunlight not far behind them. As she
watches them leave, she lets out a breath.
A voice calls out to her --
WOMAN'S VOICE
Mrs. Hitchcock?
She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a
sleeveless top. She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package.
JANET
I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was
sick so I got him a little something.
She hands Alma the gift. A bag of candy corn tied with a
ribbon.
ALMA
That's kind of you.
JANET
Well, he's been very considerate with me.
(A BEAT)
I haven't always had that from my
directors.
ALMA
Janet, you've been very... professional.
It hasn't gone unappreciated.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Alma takes in Janet's unaffected natural beauty -- and her
sincerity.
She can't help but notice the second glances Janet is
provoking from passers-by now...
She's an impossible rival for any woman.
BEETHOVEN'S 3RD SYMPHONY, `EROICA'
Blares deafeningly...
Wind blows sand off the dunes. Alma sits in the parked car
outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the
seat next to her. An inkling that they may not be as magical
as she had hoped.
No matter. She checks her reflection in the rearview and
applies some lipstick, readying herself.
She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck.
She sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of Whit.
Something doesn't feel right.
She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees
Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the
pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot. Alma and Whit's eyes
meet. Whit is horrified at being caught.
Alma ducks her head, wheels around in shock.
ALMA'S CAR
She yanks open the door and gets in. Whit runs half dressed
from the house...
WHITFIELD COOK
Alma, I thought you were coming later
tonight.
ALMA
I thought you rented this place so we
could write.
WHITFIELD COOK
I did. I swear -- this just happened.
She struggles to get the key in the ignition. He puts his
hand desperately on the car door.
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
You won't say anything, will you?
ALMA
Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
WHITFIELD COOK
I mean to Hitch.
Whit smiles feebly.
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
We can't all be geniuses.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Alma tries to hide what a body blow this is.
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D)
Alma -- you're incredibly talented. But,
after all... we want him to read the
script with an open mind.
ALMA
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
She starts the car and drives off.
Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his
receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light...
Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the
foyer.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
You're going to have to cut all that
nudity.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
What nudity? It was suggested.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
I definitely saw that knife jabbing her.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
We did no such shot.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK
I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm
recommending you cut the shower scene
entirely.
Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
I'll go over it frame by frame and set up
another screening.
But Shurlock is already walking away...
Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with
BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication
but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
What's the verdict?
LEW WASSERMAN
Let's just say it was a four-letter
review and it wasn't `good'.
The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock.
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
Screw him. It's too late for Paramount to
back out no matter what Balaban says.
Hitch just stands there.
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
The other route is to recut it as a two-
parter for the TV series. Because of the
budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a
good chance of breaking even.
Still, Hitch doesn't say a word.
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire
of Winchester 73 and that was a dog. At
least I could sit through your picture.
Hitch stares bleakly off. He can't help noticing the KIM
NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and
kissing her date.
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
More importantly, what does Alma think?
A full moon. The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one
in the kitchen.
We glimpse the figure in the window. A corpulent man in
profile, like a Hopper painting.
A series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life :
CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS, STRIPS OF
CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT, INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK
WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER.
HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like
schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola.
ALMA
You'll need to cut those six or seven
frames where she blinks after she's
supposed to be dead.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
We've seen the footage a thousand times.
She doesn't blink.
Alma gives him a look ...
Hitch's voice booms from LARGE SPEAKERS MOUNTED UNDER THE
MARQUEE.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.)
The manager of this fine motion picture
theater has been advised not to allow
anyone to enter the theater once Psycho
begins.
We PAN DOWN to the STAFF and GUARDS as they test out the
RECORDED message that will be played for the ticket holders
line. A couple of PASSERSBY listen, perplexed...
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Should you be so foolish as to attempt to
slip in by a side entrance...
A DAZZLING MARQUEE for "ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S PSYCHO." The car
pulls up. Hitch and Alma step out. There's a long line of
people outside the theatre.
ALMA
Well, at least there are some people
here.
But Hitch's nerves are hardly soothed. The people in line
start to notice the Hitchcocks...is it really them?
PEGGY
Comes over to greet them with the THEATRE MANAGER.
PEGGY
We can go through the side entrance.
As the theatre manager ushers them through the side alley --
(CONTINUED)

THEATER MANAGER
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock.
Hitchcock turns to Alma.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Ready for the gallows?
A few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past
the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car. Hitchcock
gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of
behind him. She shyly waves him away but eventually, and
appreciatively, relents.
As the flashbulbs start to POP --
ALMA
This could be the biggest hit of your
career, Alfred.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
Our career, Alma.
He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense
gratitude and joy. As more flashbulbs pop --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
I've realized I'll never be able to find
a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.
ALMA
You do realize I've been waiting decades
to hear you say that.
He gives her a gentle peck.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
And that, madame, is why they call me
"The Master of Suspense"...
He helps her into the car.

as if having walked through a portal.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK
But you know what they say in Hollywood:
"You're only as good as your last
picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I
must toddle off to begin the exhaustive
search for my next project.
He holds out his cigar towards something we don't yet see...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Unfortunately I find myself once again
bereft of all inspiration. I do hope
something comes along soon...
A SMALL BIRD
Alights on his cigar tip and FLAPS its wings. Hitchcock can't
resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which
promptly flies away. He gives the camera a final
characteristically deadpan look...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
Good evening.
The distinctive THEME TUNE to his TV show starts up and Hitch
toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace, where
Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch...
