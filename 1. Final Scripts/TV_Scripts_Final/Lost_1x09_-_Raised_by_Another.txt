      FROM #108 IS RELEVANT IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE.

      PURE SILENCE.  Then THE DISTINCT SOUND of a BABY S CRY rises 
      as we PUSH THROUGH the  O  of the LOST logo onto --

    A CLOSED EYE.  SNAPS OPEN as we hear the CRY again and --

      INT. THE VALLEY - CLAIRE S CUBBY - NIGHT11

      CLAIRE BOLTS UPRIGHT INTO FRAME.  And we re EXTREMELY CLOSE 
      on her.  She s confused.  Disoriented.  Couldn t have heard --

      The BABY CRIES again.  Distant, but not too distant.

      And instinctively Claire s hand falls to her belly... and her 
      face REGISTERS this before we MOVE DOWN to find --

      Her belly is perfectly FLAT.  She s not pregnant.  And she s 
      trying to make sense of how this is possible as we REALIZE --

      Claire is in one of the small caves/cubbies inside the 
      valley.  The CRY again.  Coming from outside the caves.

      And whatever the fuck is going on, Claire is DRAWN TOWARDS 
      that sound so --

      We FOLLOW HER as she leaves the caves and enters --

      EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS22

      Moonshadows mix with mist.  A WHISPERING wind.  STARS 
      brighter in the sky than we ve EVER SEEN THEM.  And a baby.  
      Somewhere out there -- STILL CRYING.

      And this is really fucking SCARY.  Anything could be out 
      here.  Claire very aware of this, but moving through the 
      DENSE FOLIAGE anyway.  And suddenly --

    A BRANCH CRACKS!

      Claire spins -- SOMETHING flashes through the thick brush -- 
      SOMETHING FAST --

      Claire stumbles back -- steadies herself with one hand on the 
      TRUNK of a LARGE TREE.  And oddly enough, embedded in its 
      trunk are two PINK LINES, like RINGS around the tree.  They  *
      seem to GLOW in the moonlight.  And Claire is as perplexed by 
      them as we are but...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   2.
      (CONT'D):22


      The baby cries again.  And it s closer now.  More URGENT.  
      Distressed.  A WAIL.

      Claire lets go of the tree -- still scared, but DRIVEN now -- 
      PUSHING THROUGH the thick LEAVES until she emerges into --

    A CLEARING

      And Claire comes to a full STOP as she sees --

      LOCKE.  Sitting at a LARGE WOODEN DESK, eyes down, flipping 
      over what look like LARGE PLAYING CARDS by the light of a 
      PURPLE SHADED DESK LAMP.

      This makes as much sense to Claire as it does to us --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Wh -- what s happening?

                                  LOCKE
                    You know what s happening.

      Locke turns over another card.  Claire, FREAKED, takes a step 
      closer to the desk --

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t understand -- Why are 
                    you...?

      The CRY again.  Anguished.  In trouble.  Locke nods his head 
      towards the sound --

                                  LOCKE
                    He was your responsibility.
                          (turns a card)
                    But you gave him away, Claire.

      FINALLY, Locke looks up -- And both his eyes are OPAQUE.  ONE 
      is SOLID BLACK.  One is solid WHITE.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Everyone pays the price now.

      Oh.  SHIT.  Claire backs off, TERRIFIED as LOCKE SHOUTS AT 
      THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS...

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    EVERYONE PAYS THE PRICE NOW!!!!

      And Claire TAKES OFF, running --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   3.
      (CONT'D): (2)22


      Running towards the sound of the CRYING BABY.  Even MORE 
      DIRE.  The jungle even THICKER.  The noises around her even 
      SCARIER.  And we re so close on her -- SO IN HER HEAD as 
      she s literally being SUFFOCATED by the jungle until -- 
      Claire BURSTS into --

      ANOTHER CLEARING

      And here is A BASSINET.  White.  Crisp linens.  A MOBILE 
      hangs from a TREE BRANCH above it.

      And the CRIES are gone.  Eerily SILENT.

      Part of Claire doesn t want to look inside... but she has to.  
      Slowly moves towards the crib, as we get a better look at the 
      MOBILE --

      Half winged, busted TOY AIRPLANES hang from its strings -- 
      THE OCEANIC LOGO clear on them all.

      And as Claire looks down into the crib, all we can make out 
      is THICK BLANKETS.  And as Claire reaches for what s SWADDLED 
      INSIDE --

      The mobile TURNS ON.  And eerie, tinkery tune --  Catch a 
      Falling Star.   The fractured PLANES begin to SPIN --

      And Claire ignores this as her hands DIG into the blankets... 
      but something is wrong... something is seriously wrong -- *

      And the JUNGLE around us is ALIVE -- SHADOWS, WHISPERS and 
      THINGS MOVING FAST -- The SONG in high gear, CHIPMUNKS SPEED -
    - and those once white blankets are NOW COVERED IN THIS 
      VISCOUS DARK LIQUID until FINALLY --

      The MOBILE STOPS.  The jungle is STILL.

      And Claire pulls a PRISTINE BABY from the blankets.

      Wait.  No.  It s not a baby... It s a DOLL.  Plastic.  
      Diapers.  Eyes closed.  And Claire just holds it.  Scared.  
      Confused.  A beat.  Another beat.

      And the Doll s eyes FLIP OPEN as it CRIES.  An INHUMAN HOWL.

      Claire DROPS it -- PETRIFIED -- STEPPING BACK -- TRYING TO  *
      GET AWAY -- And that s when she realizes -- There is *
      something DARK all over her HANDS.  LIQUID.*

      CLAIRE SCREAMS!  And we --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. THE VALLEY - NIGHT33

      SUPER TIGHT ON CLAIRE AS -- SHE SCREAMS!

      And we PULL BACK to find her STANDING in the middle of the 
      valley.  Alone.  Waning FIRELIGHT.

      And now STIRRING.  People waking up to the sound of the 
      SCREAMS.  And it s --

      CHARLIE who reaches her first -- Claire STILL screaming --

                                  CHARLIE
                    Claire?  Claire!?!

      No idea what the fuck is going on, Charlie grabs her by the 
      shoulders -- And she WAKES up -- EYES WIDE -- AS SCARED AS 
      SHE S EVER BEEN -- instinctively LASHING OUT at Charlie --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Claire -- Stop!  It s me -- It s 
                    Charlie -- It s okay!

      In the far background, SUN, JIN, HURLEY and MICHAEL arrive  *
      from other areas of the caves.  They ve heard the screams.   *
      As they meet up, fast, overlapping --*

                        SUNMICHAEL
        (in Korean)I think it s Claire.
      What s going on?

                      HURLEYJIN
      Is she okay?(in Korean)
                                                  Is it the baby?

      Meanwhile, Charlie is still trying to rouse Claire -- *

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Claire.  Listen to me --*

      And finally Claire zeroes in on Charlie.  Blinks.  Confused. *

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    It s okay.
                          (consoling)
                    You were dreaming -- 
                      sleepwalking...

      And that s when Charlie s eyes drop.  Sees something. *

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Claire --
                          (beat)
                    What happened...?

      And we can feel it before we see it.  Claire looks down at 
      her hands -- in fact all the way up to her wrists --

      They re covered in blood.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. THE VALLEY - INFIRMARY CAVE - MORNING44

      We find Claire with JACK over in his INFIRMARY AREA.  He s 
      putting on his bedside manner as he examines her HANDS.  
      She s still shaken up, but putting on her best game face.

                                  JACK
                    Must ve been a hell of a nightmare.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (forced smile)
                    Who says it was a nightmare?

      Jack rips off a PIECE OF BANDAGE, delicately wraps Claire s 
      hand in it as we see FOUR DEEP CUTS embedded in her palm.

                                  JACK
                    I d say when someone makes fist so 
                    tight they dig their fingernails a *
                    quarter inch into their palms, 
                    they re not dreaming about pony 
                    rides.
                          (her eyes drop)
                    Y ever sleepwalk before?

                                  CLAIRE
                    No.  I mean I don t think so-- I 
                    mean how would I know?

                                  JACK
                    It d get back to you.  I had a 
                      girlfriend once, told me I talked 
                    in my sleep.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What d you say?

                                  JACK
                    Don t know.  Whatever it was, she 
                    didn t like it.

      Claire cracks a GRIN as Jack BANDAGES her other hand --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    How was your OBgyn -- in Sydney?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Good.  She s good.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   6.

                                  JACK
                    She was okay with letting you fly 
                    in your third trimester?

      There s something here.  Something Claire doesn t wanna TELL.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I had a checkup the week before... 
                    she said it would be okay.

                                  JACK
                      Ultrasound cool?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah.  Very healthy.

                                  JACK
                    How ve you been feeling?

                                  CLAIRE
                    My back hurts.  Probably from 
                    sleeping on the ground.  I get 
                    dizzy when I stand up too fast.  
                    And I have to pee all the time.

                                  JACK
                          (smiles)
                    Eating enough?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Boar N  Bananas, yeah.

                                  JACK
                          (finishes bandaging)
                    How many weeks in are you?
                          (off her uncertainty)
                    ... what was the date you found out 
                    you were pregnant?

      We re ON CLAIRE as she can t help but recall:

      INT. LOFT - DAY - FLASHBACK55

    A small, typically messy Sydney loft of a 21 year-old guy.  
      Canvases and paints.  CDs and clothes and posters and food 
      and it s comfy, but definitely a young person s first place.  
      There have been lots of parties here -- but this moment is 
      not one of them: the guy who lives here, THOMAS, is freaking 
      out -- as is CLAIRE -- both of them walking across the small 
      place, from the open bathroom door, towards the window, for 
      light -- she s holding a PREGNANCY TEST WAND: 




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      7.
      (CONT'D):55


                        THOMASCLAIRE
      -- is it pink?-- I don t know yet!
      -- Did you pee on it?-- Yes!  Gimme a second--
      -- maybe you didn t use it 
      right ---- I can pee on a wand, 
      -- what color is it?Thomas--
          (checking his watch)-- how long has it been?
      -- sixty-six seconds...

      They re at the drapeless window now, both closely studying 
      the wand, waiting for the result.  CLOSE ON THEM (maybe 
      HANDHELD CAMERA?) in this tense-as-hell moment.  We love her -
    - and we like him, too -- for caring so much.  He s such a 
      guy, but he s got a heart.  HOLD ON THEM for a long beat.

                        THOMASCLAIRE
      -- oh God---- shh.

      Suddenly Claire holds up the INSTRUCTIONS, re-reads them, as 
      Thomas holds the wand, checking it again:

      -- okay, it s definitely two-- 
      two lines---- two pink lines?

                                  THOMAS
                    Pink?  No-- these are, like, red... *

                                  CLAIRE
                          (eyes on the wand)
                    ... they re pink.*

                                  THOMAS
                    -- these?  That s...

    A beat... shit.  She stares off... tears coming to her eyes.  
      But Thomas doesn t want to give up -- his mind racing:

                THOMAS (CONT D)CLAIRE
      Okay, first of all, these 
      tests are not always -- Thomas...
      accurate.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    No, come on: my uncle thought he 
                    had testicular cancer -- remember 
                    that?!

                                  CLAIRE
                    He did!  He s dead!

                                  THOMAS
                    No, it was a-- a-- wrong, a bad  *
                      diagnosis!  This thing doesn t mean 
                    for sure that you re pregnant -- we 
                    should go get another one--

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m six weeks late.  Six weeks.  
                    That never happens.
                          (beat, then, simply)
                    I m pregnant.
                          (tears)
                    ... so, um...

      -- but she s so afraid -- there s really nothing to say -- 
      and she s staring off, her mind racing, tears streaming down 
      her face.  What the hell is she gonna do?  Thomas is freaking 
      too -- but he s too good a guy.  So he takes her, holds her.

                                  THOMAS
                    Okay.  Okay, so this is gonna be 
                    okay.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (not at all believing it)
                    ... I know...

      Then we re ON THOMAS as a thought comes to him.  He looks  *
      into Claire s eyes.  Considers this before he says it.  Then: *

                                  THOMAS
                    Claire...
                          (then)
                    ... if we wanted... we could do  *
                    this.*

      And staring into his eyes, she starts to understand what he 
      means.  And this moment goes from being horrifying to 
      being... only a little less horrifying:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Stop it.

                                  THOMAS
                    No, I m not kidding.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Can you imagine that?
                          (then)
                    My mom would disown me--

                                  THOMAS
                    She basically has already.

    A beat.  Then: she can t even consider it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    With what, my five dollar an hour 
                    job at the Fish N  Fry?

                                  THOMAS
                    You re not the only one with a job.  *
                    I mean... I ve got my art.*

                                  CLAIRE*
                          (doesn t wanna go there)*
                    You re sweet.  But this isn t what 
                    we want.

                                  THOMAS
                    Maybe it is.  I mean this could 
                    be... I dunno, the best thing ever.

      She s still, obviously, shocked at the whole situation.  But 
      this idea -- of keeping the baby -- bends her mind.  She s 
      never considered something like this before.  But she likes 
      him.  Christ, maybe this could work.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... you d... really wanna...?

                                  THOMAS
                    Claire.  I love you.

      And she cries a little more now as he kisses her -- a 
      convincing kiss -- and we CUT TO:

      EXT. BEACH - DAY66

      And here s KATE, just standing at the edge of the ocean.  
      Watching as the foam of tired waves washes over her feet.  He 
      stops a few feet from her --

                                  JACK
                    This is a first.

      Kate turns and sees Jack.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    You.  Standing still.  Middle of 
                    the day.  Doing nothing.  Amazing.

      As Jack takes off his shoes and Kate looks at the ocean --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      10.

                                  KATE
                    I m doing something.

                                  JACK
                    Yeah?  What s that?

                                  KATE
                    I m sinking.
                          (beat)
                    When the water goes out, it takes 
                    the sand with it and... you sink.
                          (a smile: then)
                    I used to do this with my Mom.  
                    When I was a kid.

      Jack is surprised by this quiet and gentler Kate -- he steps 
      up to the water line.  Next to her.

                                  JACK
                    Ah.  A new plan -- sink your way 
                    off the island.  Sayid would be 
                    proud.

      Kate reacts to the sound of Sayid s name.  Looks up at Jack --

                                  KATE
                    He s been gone almost a week.*

                                  JACK
                    Something tells me he ll be okay.

      Kate nods.  Turns back to the ocean --

                                  KATE
                    So what re you doing, Jack?

                                  JACK
                    Bringing down some water.  Bringing 
                    back some fish.

                                  KATE
                    Whatever would we do without you?

      Jack shakes his head, smiles.  A few beats pass.  Jack just 
      looking out at the ocean.  And then --

                                  JACK
                    Claire s going to have the baby 
                    soon.

      Kate turns to him.  And as we see the real WORRY on Jack s 
      face, the full implications of what that actually MEANS...

      EXT. THE VALLEY - ENTRANCE - ROCK WALL - DUSK77 *

      Claire writes in her JOURNAL.  The occupants of the valley  *
      BEDDING DOWN for the night -- starting to light their fires.

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                     Dear Diary -- Still on the bloody 
                    island.  Ate a bug today.  Love, 
                    Claire. 

      Claire looks up to see CHARLIE.  Smiles as he hands her a cup  *
      of STEAMING liquid --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    What separates us from these savage 
                    Yanks if we do not have tea?
                          (sits, then)
                    Feeling better?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It was just a dream.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I have this dream -- craziest 
                    thing.  I m driving a bus and all 
                    my teeth start falling out.  And my 
                    mum s in the back.  Eating 
                    biscuits.
                          (beat)
                     Course I don t wake up screaming.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m fine, Charlie.

      And it s clear from her tone that Claire clearly doesn t want 
      to talk about this.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Right.  Well.  Of course you are.

      And now a somewhat awkward moment.  Charlie obviously wanting 
      to SAY something here -- and he s a little bit NERVOUS, so it 
      comes out in sorta one sustained THOUGHT --










                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   12.
      (CONT'D):77


                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I was just thinking how 
                    hard it must be for you... y know, 
                    being here in this... place -- 
                    without your family and your 
                    friends and I just wanted to tell 
                    you that we could be friend -- I 
                    mean I could be your friend.
                          (off her look)
                    Not like we should do each other s 
                    hair or anything -- I just mean...
                          (beat; sincere)
                    If you ever needed anyone to talk 
                    to.  About anything.  I m here.

      And while Claire might be touched by all this, there is also 
    a part of her that PULLS BACK as a result of it.  Simply put: 
      she is uncomfortable with Charlie s affection.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Charlie, trust me.  You don t...
                          (trying to find the words)
                    You ll change your mind.  I m...*

      Charlie s hurt, but does his best to cover with humor --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Lemme guess.  Damaged goods.*

                                  CLAIRE
                    Something like that.

      Charlie feels like he put himself out there and got shot down 
      for it.  He s embarrassed.  Forces a smile as he gets up -- *

                                    CHARLIE
                    All right then.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I didn t mean you--

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sweet dreams, Claire.

      HOLD ON Claire as Charlie walks off.  Disappointed.  Maybe, 
      with HERSELF.  As she takes a SIP of the tea, we CUT TO: *

      EXT. MALKIN S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK88 *

      Claire, walks with her friend, RACHEL, towards the entrance  *
      of a MODEST HOUSE in suburban Sydney.  Rachel playfully rubs  *
      her hand over Claire s still FLAT belly --*

                    -- oh yeah, it s a girl.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (smiling, nervous)
                    -- God, it just feels impossible.
                          (then, brightly)
                    Thomas cleaned out his whole 
                    apartment -- I m officially moving 
                    in on Tuesday--

                                  RACHEL

                    -- I know, he s the best.

      Rachel goes to knock on the door, but Claire stops her, is 
      having second thoughts.

                CLAIRE (CONT D)RACHEL
      Maybe we shouldn t --
                                                  -- Uh uh.  You re not backing

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    It feels silly --

                                  RACHEL
                    He s just a psychic, Claire.  I 
                    thought you were into this... all 
                    your astrology stuff...

                                  CLAIRE

                    someone telling me what s gonna 
                    happen or how to live my --

                                  RACHEL
                    It s not about what you need 
                    Claire.  It s about what s fun.
                          (then)
                    You ll go in, find out if it s a

    a nearby apartment.  Piles of books.  Dark and musty.  You 
      can see the dust in the air.  A cat may occasionally jump up 
      on the stacks of newspapers and mail, then back down again.

      In the middle of it all, Claire sits across a table from 
      RICHARD MALKIN.  Australian (60 s).  Doesn t look sharp at 
      all, wears a dark blazer and tie.  There s something oddly 
      legit about how he does his thing.  No evident humor from 
      Malkin.  Not a bad guy, but a touch odd.  Takes this 
      seriously.  Rachel is in the b.g.

                                  MALKIN
                    I need your hands.  For this.

      And Claire offers them, palms up.  He looks at her palms.  
      Closes his eyes for a long beat.  Leans his head back a 
      touch.  Claire finally, subtly, turns to Rachel, who 
      indicates for her to turn back to Malkin.  She does.

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)
                    ... oh...
                          (then)
                    ... when did you, uh...?  Find out?

      TIGHT ON CLAIRE as she stares.  Already, this is weird.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... what.

      There s a beat -- we re TIGHT ON MALKIN as he listens, eyes 
      closed, to whatever voices talk to him.  Despite the 
      surroundings, this is an increasingly eerie moment...

                                  MALKIN
                    ... you know, about the baby.

      And holy fuck does Claire just go still.  Claire is freaked.   *
      Christ, she almost wants to cry.  She turns to Rachel --  *
      shoots her a look -- did you tell him?  Rachel shakes her  *
      head, no -- she didn t.  She s just a freaked as Claire is.   *
      Claire turns back to Malkin.*

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... uh... two days ago.

      Malkin listens, searches, on some kind of journey, sitting  *
      there, he seems to encounter something that disturbs him -- 
      creates a huge question -- something that makes him open his 
      eyes and check Claire s palms.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   15.

      Claire watches him closely -- what the hell is he doing? *

                        RACHELCLAIRE
      She hasn t told her mom yet -- 
      we re afraid she--Shhhh!

      TIGHT ON MALKIN as he studies her hands -- and apparently 
      sees something -- something that concerns him deeply --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)*
                    What.  What, should I not tell her?

      Suddenly Claire wants to know what he thinks.  But Malkin, 
      holding her wrists, staring at her hands, does the best he 
      can to hide the utter terror that begins to creep up on him -- 
      he only wants to run the hell away -- but he doesn t want to 
      show his fear.  He lets go of her -- saying:

                                  MALKIN
                    I m not, uh...*
                          (then, agitated)*
                    I m overdue for a break --*

      Claire and Rachel are confounded as Malkin goes to his pocket  *
      -- counts out and hands back the money --

                        RACHELCLAIRE
      What?  A break?  We have an -- hold on-- were you 
      appointment --thinking something?

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)*
                          (standing)*
                    I m not doing this reading.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But you were gonna say something--

      But Malkin ushers them to the door.  As he opens it and  *
      motions for them to leave --*

                                    MALKIN*
                    Go.  Now.*

      After a beat, Rachel snorts her displeasure, laughs. *

                                    RACHEL*
                    What a freak.*

      And Rachel heads out -- but we HOLD ON CLAIRE, who looks off,  *
        surprisingly troubled by what she saw in Malkin s face.

      INT. THE VALLEY - NIGHT1010

      NIGHT has fallen again.  The pure STILLNESS of the valley 
      suggests we are in the WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING.

      THE CAMERA DRIFTING THROUGH IT ALL.  Something OMINOUS about 
      this.  Quiet.  Still.  And CREEPY.  And finally, we REST ON -- *

      INT. THE VALLEY - CLAIRE S CUBBY - CONTINUOUS1111

      CLAIRE.  Sleeps on her side, hand on her belly.  ON HER BABY. *

      And the CAMERA gets EXTREMELY CLOSE until Claire s face FILLS 
      THE FRAME.  And we just SIT here as --

      We begin to hear SOUNDS.  Unsettling noises.  METAL AGAINST 
      METAL -- not unlike a SWORD BEING UNSHEATHED.  Huh?

      Claire s EYES suddenly POP open -- Instantly aware that  *
      someone or SOMETHING is HERE with her -- looks down to see -- *

      SOMEONE IS STANDING OVER HER.

      The SHADOW moves quickly -- COVERS HER MOUTH with his (its?) 
      free hand!

      Maybe a man.  And Claire is fucking petrified with fear, 
      because it s not just that he s here, it s what he s doing...

      And this is highly STYLIZED -- TWENTY QUICK CUTS -- ONE 
      SECOND EACH -- CONFUSING -- DISTURBING -- BIZARRE --

      HERE is what we catch quick GLIMPSES OF: Claire s SHIRT is  *
      pulled up -- BARE STOMACH EXPOSED -- SHE STRUGGLES -- A WEIRD 
      METALLIC DEVICE pressed up against her belly -- AN OVERSIZED 
      HYPODERMIC NEEDLE DESIGNED BY H.R. GIGER -- CLAIRE S FEET 
      KICK AT THE AIR, BUT SHE S HELD DOWN -- A PLUNGER EXTENDS 
      FROM THE SIDE OF THE DEVICE -- SOMETHING PUNCTURES INTO HER 
      SKIN? -- All of this underscored by RAPID BREATHING --

      AND THE CUTS ABRUPTLY END because in the midst of this pure, 
      unadulterated TERROR, the scariest thing about it is the 
      CRACKLY WHISPER which comes from this unseen SHADOW --

                                  SHADOW
                    Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

      And off THE HORROR in Claire s WIDE EYES --


                                  END OF ACT ONE




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   17.

      INT. THE VALLEY - JACK S CAVE - NIGHT1313

      BANG!  JACK s eyes fly open.  Find him in his SLEEPING AREA.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    SOMEBODY HELP!!!!!!!!

      And this is not just a scream, it s a SCREAM TO THE TENTH 
      POWER -- Jack is instantly ALERT -- JUMPS UP -- RUNS --

      OTHERS awake now -- Some of them instinctively moving towards 
      the SHOUTS --

      But we STAY with Jack because this is PURE CHAOS -- HANDHELD 
      AND INSANE -- as he reaches --

      CLAIRE

      Literally HYSTERICAL.  Charlie already at her side, turns to 
      Jack as he RUSHES UP --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Someone attacked her!

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- I don t know... I didn t... he

                      CHARLIEJACK
      We should fan out -- search 
      the area around the caves...-- Wait... hold on --

                    -- He can t have gotten far.
                          (to some others)
                    Hurley -- You two -- come on!

      Charlie and the others RUSH OFF through one of the cave 
      FINGERS as Jack puts his arm around Claire -- She s totally 
      PANICKED -- HYPERVENTILATING -- Jack in nurture mode --

                                  JACK

                    Sure.  Yes -- of course.

      Ethan heads off.  Claire left just with Jack and Michael -- 
      CAMERA settling down... but not completely --

                                  JACK
                    Okay -- you re safe, Claire.  Try

                    Did you get a look at him at all?

                                                  -- Where did this happen?

      DOLLY OFF A FIRE, revealing, in the distance, CHARLIE, 
      MICHAEL and some of the others tending to Claire.  But we 
      find Jack and Hurley over by one of the TORCHES -- a 
      conspiratorial conversation between FRIENDS.

                                  HURLEY
                    We hoofed it around the entire

                                  JACK
                    Nobody saw or heard anything?

                    Uh-uh.  Everyone was asleep.  Nada.

      Jack shakes his head.  Fuck.  What the hell is going on here?

                    So I had an idea.  I m out there

                    Yeah, like a registry.  Names.  
                    What people look like.  Who s 
                    related to who.  We lay down the 
                    law, maybe everyone won t go around 
                    attacking each other.  I mean --

                    something every other day, man.
                          (beat; serious)
                    We gotta find who did this to her.

      And Jack NODS... but there s more to it -- because that DOUBT 
      is still etched on his face...

      INT. THE VALLEY - CLAIRE S CUBBY - LATER1515

    A little later.  Charlie drapes a BLANKET over Claire s 
      shoulder.  She s still WIRED.  SCARED.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You all right?

      She doesn t say anything -- just offers a small nod.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Don t worry... You want to shut 
                    your eyes, I ll be here all night.  
                    No one s gonna get near you.
                          (beat; intensely sincere)
                    I won t leave you, Claire.  
                    Promise.

      And on that sentiment, we move in TIGHT on Claire s 
      UNBLINKING EYES as --

      INT. LOFT - DAY - FLASHBACK1616

      JOHN MAYER PLAYS on the stereo.  Claire stands on a chair, 
      putting up drapes.  The sun pours in behind her, putting her 
      figure in silhouette -- and her figure has changed since we 
      last saw her in FLASHBACK; SHE S FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT NOW.  A 
      cute little belly.

      She turns as Thomas enters, carrying a backpack he slings  *
      down.  Gotta love Claire s smile.  Sweet and heartbreaking. *

      Thomas, moving to the kitchen, glances at the drapes.  He  *
      seems a little distracted --

                                  THOMAS
                    -- wow, we have drapes now.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (climbing down)
                    I know, I sort of feel grown up all 
                    of a sudden.  Do you like them?

                                  THOMAS
                    -- yeah, they re good.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (going through the bags)
                    I don t know why drapes represent 
                    age for me, it just... feels like 
                    something my mum would do--

      Thomas pops a beer, heads to the pantry.  Wants a snack. *

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Sasha called-- they re going out 
                    tonight, wanted to know if we 
                    wanted to come...

      And Thomas is motionless now, staring into the pantry --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    What?  I didn t eat all the chips, 
                    there s another bag --

                                  THOMAS
                    Claire...
                          (empty)
                    ... I can t do this.

                    Do what?*
                          (moves to him, sweetly)
                    D you have a bad day?  You re pale.

      She s being so loving... but the truth is, Thomas just isn t 
      here.  He turns to her.  And from his face, she just gets it.

                                  THOMAS
                    ... this isn t working.

      She stares for a long beat.  Thunderstruck.  Mortified -- *

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)*
                    -- you knew that.*

                                    CLAIRE*
                    -- I what?*

      And he s walked past her, to the window, where she just hung 
      the drapes.  He looks out.  Guilty as hell, but fronting with 
      all the pride of a young man.  Claire turns toward him -- she 
      barely moves, her whole being in shock.  Her face wracked.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)*
                    Just... so I don t over-react... 
                    Tommy, are you breaking up with--?

                                  THOMAS

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- like who?  Like what?  Am I-- 
                    being too-- I m just trying to-- to 
                    make sure when the baby comes--*

                                  THOMAS
                    -- and the baby!  That s like not-- 
                    I mean it s like this now.  Y know?*

                                  CLAIRE
                          (softly)*
                    But you said we should do this.*

                                  THOMAS
                    Yeah... well now it s real. *

      SLAMMING the door behind him.  Claire stands there, just in 
      trauma.  She cries now -- and the FINAL SHOT is WIDE, 
      Claire s belly once again silhouetted by the window light.

    A new day.

      EXT. BEACH - DAYA18A18 *

      ON HURLEY in census-taking mode, jotting stuff down as he  *
      converses with SCOTT and STEVE, on the move.*

                                    HURLEY*
                    Okay, so it s Scott Jenkins...*

                                  STEVE*
                    I m Jenkins.  Steve.*

                                    HURLEY*
                    Right.  Steve... Jenkins.*
                          (then)*
                    And you dudes were on vacation in *

                    Yep.*

                                    HURLEY*
                    So... Safe to assume... I mean, I *
                    guess you re, uh... I mean, you two *
                    are... y know...*
                          (gay)*
                      ...Married... Or something?*

      Scott and Steve share a look.*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Nah.  We re both single.*
                          (re: Steve)*
                    And my buddy s got serious  *
                      commitment issues.*

                    Just haven t found the right person *
                    yet.*

      ON HURLEY, somewhat uncomfortable as Steve looks at him.  The  *
      ambiguity of these two guys  relationship still ambiguous.   *
      Gratefully, Hurley then notices*

      HIS POV - LOCKE, laying out boar pelts to dry in the hot sun. *

                                    HURLEY*
                    Excuse me, guys.*

      Hurley crosses to Locke, as Steve and Scott move off. *

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)*
                    Yo.*

      Locke peers up at him, but says nothing, continuing his work. *

                    This about your census?*

                                  HURLEY*
                    Yeah, thought it d be a good idea *
                    to, y know, find out who everybody *
                    is.  Get their names, places of *

                    And who s checking to see who you *
                    are?*

      Hurley s slightly taken aback at that.*

                                  HURLEY*
                    M-me?*

                                  LOCKE*
                          (a grin comes to him)*
                    It was a joke.*

                                  HURLEY*
                          (forcing a chuckle)*
                    Oh... Yeah... Good one.*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Well, you already know my name.  *
                    Lived in Tustin, California for *
                    most of my life.*

                                  HURLEY*
                          (writing)*
                    Uh huh.  And your reason for *
                    travel?*

      Locke suddenly pauses and looks at him.*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Sorry?*

                                  HURLEY*
                    Y know...  The reason you were in *
                      Australia.*

      After a beat, Locke looks off, pondering. *




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Raised by Another"   (GOLDENROD)    10/26/04      23C.

                                  LOCKE*
                    I was looking for something. *

      Hurley eyes him for a moment.*

                                  HURLEY*
                    Looking for...*
                          (then)*
                    O-okay.  So, uh... Did you find it?*

                                  LOCKE*
                    No.*
                          (looks back at Hurley)*
                    It found me.*

      Hurley stares at Locke, finding himself strangely unnerved by  *
      these cryptic answers, but without the nerve to pursue it. *

                                  LOCKE (cont d) (CONT D)*
                    Anything else?*

                                  HURLEY*
                    No.  No, that s great.*

      Locke offers up a smile, and moves off, leaving Hurley to eye  *
      him as he goes.*

                          (to Charlie)
                    Let s say she s telling the truth.  
                    What do we do?

      Good question.  And Charlie really doesn t have the answer 
      for it.  At a loss.  So Kate turns to Jack --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Okay.  And if it s all in her head?

                                  JACK
                          (beat; serious)
                    Claire s due in a little more than 
                    a week.  Maybe two.*
                          (then)
                    If she stays stressed like this -- *
                    has another panic attack... it 
                    could trigger an early labor.  And 
                    out here?  With no instruments, no 
                    monitors, no anaesthetic?  That 
                    would not be good.

      And maybe because there is a ring of truth to the possibility 
      that none of this is happening --

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s not all in her head.

      Charlie WALKS OFF.  After a beat, Kate turns to Jack --

                                  KATE
                    So what do we do?

      EXT. COCONUT GROVE - DAY1919 *

      Hurley approaches Ethan.  Our first real look at him.  He s 
      pleasant.  Unassuming.  But there s something INTERESTING 
      about him too.  Something we can t quite put our finger on...

                                  HURLEY
                    Hey -- Lance.*

                                  ETHAN
                    Sorry?

                                  HURLEY
                    Your name s Lance, right?






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (GREEN)       9/27/04      26.

                                  ETHAN
                    Ethan.

                                  HURLEY
                          (remembering)
                    Dude.  That s right.  Lance is the 
                    little skinny guy.  With the 
                    glasses and the red hair.

      Ethan looks nothing like the person Hurley just described.

                                  ETHAN
                          (good natured)
                    I can see how you d get us 
                    confused.

                                  HURLEY
                    Sorry, too many names and faces.  
                    Pretty pathetic -- I mean, you d *
                    think after a couple of weeks on an *
                    island with the same people we d *
                    all know each other...*

                                  ETHAN
                    Yes.  You would think that.*
                          (smiles; then)*
                    Well... it is what it is.*

      Hurley looks at this guy.  O-KAY...*

                                    HURLEY*
                    So, uh, we re doing a list, you 
                    know, of survivors.  Name, home 
                    address.  Like that.

                                  ETHAN
                    Well you already have my name.

                      HURLEYETHAN
      Not Lance.
                                                  -- Definitely not.

                                  HURLEY
                    Last name?

                                  ETHAN
                    Rom.

                                  HURLEY
                    Rom?  R-O-M?

                                  ETHAN
                    That s right.

                                  HURLEY
                    Great.  Where you from Ethan Rom?

                                  ETHAN
                    Ontario.  Canada.

                                  HURLEY
                    Right on.  Love Canada.  Great... 
                    uh... weather.
                          (then)
                    Well, that covers it.  Thanks for 
                    your time, dude.

      And just before Hurley walks off --

                                  ETHAN
                    Hey, Hurley -- What s this for?*

                                  HURLEY
                    Nothing, man.  Just...
                          (finding it)
                    Thought it d be a good idea.

      And OFF HURLEY, not the greatest liar in the world --

      INT. THE VALLEY - CLAIRE S CUBBY - DAY2020

      CLOSE ON -- CLAIRE, writing in her journal.  Eyes bloodshot.  
      She s shaky.  Anxious.  Seen much better days.

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    Claire?

      She jumps!  Startled by his arrival.  Looks up, DESPERATE --

                                  CLAIRE

      Jack sits down next to her.  He s very COMPASSIONATE here --

                                  JACK

                    It can mess with your head a *

                    feels real...

                                  CLAIRE
                          (confused)
                    I don t...?

                                  JACK
                    Your baby s coming.  Soon.  And I *
                    can t imagine how scary that must *
                    be... but the more upset you get, *
                    the more dangerous it is for you... *
                    and the baby.*
                          (then)*
                    I want you to take these.*

      Jack holds out his hand.  TWO PILLS in his palm.*

                                  CLAIRE*
                    What is it?*

                                  JACK*
                    A sedative.  It s very mild.  *
                    Commonly used in situations like *
                    yours. *
                          (off her look)*
                    It won t hurt the baby.  I promise.*

      It takes Claire a moment to put together the implications of  *
      this.

                                  CLAIRE*
                    You... don t believe me.

      TIGHT ON CLAIRE as she strides out of the caves and towards

        frustration.... HER ANXIETY.  HER FEAR.  And when we can t

                                  MALKIN
                    ... yes?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      30.

      Now we see the REVERSE.  It s Claire.  Four months pregnant.   *
      It s sort of a rainy day.  She s wearing a hooded raincoat.  
      She pulls back the hood.  Looking sweet and vulnerable.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Mr. Malkin, I met you before.

      He stares at her for a long beat.  Finally:

                                  MALKIN
                    ... yes, I remember.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... you wouldn t give me a reading.
                          (then)
                    I was hoping maybe you would now.

      And on Malkin, staring at her, debating, nervous...

      INT. MALKIN S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK2323

      Claire sits at the table, counts out two hundred Australian 
      dollars.  She is not accustomed to carrying this kind of 
      cash.  She hands Malkin the money.  He takes it.  Counts it.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (nervous smile)
                    If you re a psychic, why do you 
                    have to count the money?

                                  MALKIN
                    That s not how it works.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I was just -- I was joking.

      Malkin pockets the money.  She knows the drill, so she 
      extends her hands, palms up.  Waits.  Then withdraws them:

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    -- are you not-- ready yet?  For--?

                                  MALKIN
                    Yes.

      And she extends them again.  He takes her hands.  Holds them.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... so... how does it work?

                                  MALKIN
                    ... I don t know.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      31.
      (CONT'D):2323


      Then he closes his eyes, as he did before.  Head tilts back  *
      just a touch.  Claire watching him hopefully.  Then:

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)*
                    When did he leave you?

      And that s all it takes; tears come to her eyes.  She doesn t 
      sob, she s just saddened, and tries to keep it together.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Last week.
                          (then)
                    Was that... why you didn t want to 
                    do my reading?  Last time?

      Malkin opens his eyes -- looks at her now.

                                  MALKIN
                    Oh, no.
                          (then, back to her hands)
                    I saw something.  A sort of... 
                    blurry thing.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And... blurry s bad?

                                  MALKIN
                    ... blurry s bad...

      She waits.  And with his eyes closed again, we PUSH IN SLOWLY 
      ON MALKIN as he  sees.   And Claire can tell it s bad... and

                    You want to know what to do.  About 
                    your baby.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes.  Please.

      And we re getting CLOSER -- all SOUND FADING AWAY -- and it s 
      getting WORSE -- it s like he s sensing something TERRIBLE in 
      those palms.  The more he sees, the more HE wants to cry.  
      Finally, he looks at her.  His eyes red and worried.  A beat.

                          (how does he say this...?)
                    It s... crucial.  That you.  You, 
                    yourself, raise this child.

                    I just wanted to know -- What would  *
                    give the baby the happiest life.

                                  MALKIN
                    This is no happy life.  Not for 
                    this child.  Not without you.

      Now Claire is offended.  She doesn t like this at all.

                    It can t be another.  YOU MUSTN T

      Claire just looks at him for a moment.  Something authentic --  *
      genuine about what he s saying... but she doesn t want to *

      Malkin now passionate, imploring:

      INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK2424

      TIGHT ON CLAIRE, asleep on her back.  Her stomach now at a 
      whopping EIGHT MONTHS pregnant.  SLOWLY PUSHING IN on her as 
      the PHONE RINGS, waking her -- she reaches over -- it is (as 
      is everything) harder with that belly -- she answers it:

                                  CLAIRE

                    Ms. Littleton.  It s Richard 
                    Malkin.

      Claire s reaction indicates that he has, on a number of 
      occasions, contacted her.  She sighs, incredulous, exhausted:

      EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT2525 *

      TIGHT ON Claire -- unsettled by this MEMORY -- still revved 
      up -- anxious, upset, scared -- ALL OF IT -- as she strides 
      down the JUNGLE PATH (this should be the same location we saw 
        Locke/Charlie/Kate/Jack come through on their way to the 
      caves) carrying her bag.

      Then -- a NOISE.  She freezes.  Frightened.

      SOMETHING COMING from behind her -- FAST -- Moving through 
      the DENSE FOLIAGE -- and just as she s about to SCREAM --

      Charlie emerges from the JUNGLE.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hi.

      Claire just looks at him sadly.  A beat.  Then, she turns 
      around.  And continues walking.  Charlie scampers after her --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Where you going?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Back to the beach.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What happened?  Did Jack --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Jack tried to dope me up is what 
                    happened.  He thinks I m -- I m 
                    making all this up.  That it s not 
                    really happening.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   36.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Ah.  So as proof of your sanity, 
                    you go tromping through the jungle 
                    alone.  Well done.

        Good-natured as that was intended, Claire stops.  Squares off 
      with Charlie.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not crazy.

      And she s off again.  ON CHARLIE.  Clearly, she wants nothing 
      to do with him.  Nothing to do with anyone.  But after a beat 
      -- he follows her anyway.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY2626

      BACK ON THE BEACH, we find SHANNON and BOONE in the midst of 
      PACKING.  Hurley here with them, writing in his notebook --

                    incident in the valley last night.

                    know her?  Yeah, she kinda got,

                    I am not moving to the rape caves.

      Shannon abruptly stops packing.  Boone s lost in thought for 
    a second, something DAWNING on him -- to Hurley --

                                  BOONE
                    Hey -- y know your life would be 
                    much easier if you just had the 
                    manifest.  We crossed off the names 
                    of the dead after we burned the 
                      fuselage... so it should be a full 
                    roster of the rest of us.

      Hurley PLOPS down in the sand next to SAWYER.  Sunning in his

                                  HURLEY
                    I hear you have the flight 
                    manifest.  I need it and I want you 
                    to give it to me.

                                  SAWYER
                    That so.

                                  HURLEY
                    Now you can do what you usually do 
                    when someone asks you for something 
                    and tell me to screw off...

                                  SAWYER
                    Screw off.

                                  HURLEY
                    Or you can just give it to me.  
                    Because dude?  You could use the 
                    points.

                                  SAWYER
                    Gosh.  You sure know how to butter 
                    a man up, Stay-Puff.

      Hurley doesn t rise to the bait of the insult.  Just offers 
      up his winningest smile --

                                  HURLEY
                    It s a gift I have.

      Sawyer takes a beat.  Then another beat.  Finally --

                                  SAWYER
                      Manifest s in the tent.  Take it.

      And OFF Hurley, surprised that this actually WORKED...

                    You don t like me, Charlie.  You 
                    only think you like me.  Maybe 
                    because I m so damn... pathetic

      CLAIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACTION.

      She s in PAIN, but this is not the anxious Lamaze breathing 
      of LABOR.  And she s keeping it fairly well together...

      Charlie, on the other hand, is PANICKED.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Was that another one?

                    Listen: trust me -- I m not going 
                    to let anything happen -- You re 
                    safe -- Yeah -- I may not know what

                    If I can kick heroin, I can deliver 
                    a baby.

      And it s out of his mouth before he realizes he even said it.  
      Claire s just staring at him.  Beat.  Then --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Okay: let me explain.  I m an 
                    addict.  Was an addict.  But look, 
                    I ve been clean for five days!

      Another beat.  Then, more than ever:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Get.  Jack.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Right.

      One more beat of indecision -- concern for her -- opens his 
      mouth to say something -- but instead, HE TAKES OFF RUNNING.

      And as we sit here with Claire, another SHOT OF PAIN crosses 
      her face.  And the WIDER we get, the more ALONE she is.  HER 
      BREATHING the only thing penetrating the SILENCE of the 
      jungle as we BLAST INTO --

    a conference table.  EARL SLAVITT, an attorney, and his 
      clients, ARLENE and JOSEPH STEWART, sit across from her.

      Slavitt slides the substantial contract over to her.

                    As discussed, once the baby is born 
                    and handed over to the Stewarts you 
                    will have no right to see the child

                    You will have no right to 
                      correspond with the child and it 
                    will be entirely up to Arlene and 
                    Joseph to decide whether to tell 
                    the child anything about you.  
                      Understood?

      Claire listens, considers.  Then, staying strong:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes.

                                    SLAVITT
                    Upon your discharge from the 
                    hospital, you will be given an 
                      additional payment of twenty 
                    thousand dollars.

                    good care of the baby.

                    Of course we will.

      Slavitt slides documents and PEN across the table to Claire.

                                    SLAVITT
                    I ll need you to sign and date

      Claire lifts up the pen, but hesitates.  Is she changing her 
      mind?  Has Malkin gotten to her?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Do you know  Catch a Falling Star?   
                    It s a song, like a lullaby?*

                                  CLAIRE
                    My father used to sing that to me.  
                    Could you sing it for the baby?  
                    Every once in a while?

                                  ARLENE
                    Of course.

      And now, things are getting emotional.  Claire opens the 
      documents.  Finds the signature line.  Puts pen to paper.  
      Signs, BUT THERE S NO INK.  So Slavitt offers another pen -- 
      she takes it -- tries to sign.  BUT AGAIN, NO INK.  This is 
      fuckin  weird.  Arlene hands her a pen of her own.  Claire 
      takes it -- scribbles on a POST-IT.  The pen works.  And she 
      brings the pen to the page.  Is about to sign.  Everyone s 
      watching her -- waiting -- sensing that she s unable to do 
      this... finally, she stands:

                    Claire!  Claire!!!  He s coming!

      He arrives at her side -- drops to his knees, out of breath, 
      but encouraging:



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      45.

              CHARLIE (CONT D)CLAIRE
      Jack s on his way, he ll be -- it hurts--
      here-- are you--?  What s--?

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Okay, okay-- he ll be here, just 
                    breathe, keep breathing...

      -- and he s holding her hand now, breathing overtly, trying 
      to help lead her --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Like this.  Inhale, exhale, all 
                    that-- do it with me --

      And he breathes -- so does she -- and it actually seems to be 
      helping.  Still, she s scared, in some pain, and frustrated 
      as hell.  Under her breath and mostly to herself, she says:

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... I m not supposed to be here.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I think we ve all been feeling a 
                    bit of that--

                                  CLAIRE
                    I know... there was just... someone 
                    who promised me I wouldn t be here.

                                    CHARLIE
                    He was wrong.  Keep breathing.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (breathing, with regret)
                    ... yeah... he was wrong...

      -- and on CLAIRE, TIGHT, breathing, we CUT TO...

      INT. MALKIN S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK3535

      Claire stands in the middle of the over-crowded apartment 
      with Malkin.  He s handed her a small manila envelope.  She 
      pulls out six-thousand Australian dollars.  Can t believe 
      this.  Is suspicious and uneasy about it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You ve spent the last three months *
                    telling me I need to raise the baby 
                    myself.  Now you re giving me money 
                    and saying I don t have to.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   46.
      (CONT'D):3535


                                  MALKIN
                    I ve found a couple in Los Angeles *
                    who are very eager to adopt.  The *
                    baby will be safe in their care.  
                    I ve foreseen...

                                  CLAIRE
                    Foreseen?
                          (starting to lose it)
                    What am I even doing here?  I can t 
                    believe I m listening to --

      And Malkin shakes his head.  Empathizing.  REAL.

                                  MALKIN
                    I know it sounds ridiculous, 
                    Claire.  All of this...  psychic  
                    business.  And I appreciate that 
                    you must think I m a madman --
                          (totally genuine)
                    But this is what must happen.

      Her reaction: she doesn t believe a word.

                                  CLAIRE
                    So you re giving me six-thousand 
                    dollars to give my baby to a pair 
                    of strangers in Los Angeles.

                                  MALKIN
                      Twelve-thousand.  The other six 
                    when you get to Los Angeles.  And 
                    they re not strangers -- They re 
                    good people.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (considers; then)
                    How do you know I won t just take 
                    the six and run?

                                  MALKIN
                    Because I know your soul.  I know 
                    your honesty.  That if you promise 
                    me you ll go... you will.

      He hands her a PLANE TICKET in a ubiquitous sleeve.  Off the 
      CLOSEUP of the ticket, and OCEANIC AIRLINES LOGO, CUT TO:

      EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY3636

      Charlie with Claire, still in the deep breathing exercises:

                                  CHARLIE
                    A psychic.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I know.  I m so embarrassed.
                          (then)
                    And after everything... he was just 
                    full of it.

    A breathing beat.  A long one.  Then:

                                  CHARLIE
                    Or not.
                          (off her look)
                    All he wanted was that no one else 
                    raise your baby, right?
                          (with dread)
                    ... so maybe he knew.

      TIGHT AS HELL on Claire as she turns to Charlie... just now 
      starting to figure out what he means.  She stares at Charlie, 
      stares, horrified by the thought...

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    ... I mean... if he wanted it bad 
                    enough... if that guy really... 
                    does have the gift... and I think 
                    some people do...
                          (could this be...?)
                    ... he could ve known, Claire...

      SO TIGHT on Claire -- the very idea ghastly -- and Christ, if 
      she doesn t suddenly remember details of the moment:

      -- in the same moment that he gives her the ticket:

                                  CLAIRE
                          (smiling)
                    I can t leave tomorrow, I need a 
                    few days to--

                                  MALKIN
                    No.  It has to be this flight.  It

      TIGHT ON MALKIN as he watches Claire, agreeing, leaving his

                    ... he knew about the plane...

                    ... he knew what was going to 
                    happen...

      And Claire heads off, walking away from him -- forever --

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... he knew... oh my God, he 
                    knew...

      And we re SO TIGHT ON MALKIN as he watches -- tears coming to 
      his eyes -- staring at this woman... who he s just put on a 
      flight he knows is going down.

                                        ACT FIVE

      AND THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING POUNDS US INTO --

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY4040

      RUNNING LEGS as they JACKHAMMER through masses of PLANTS -- 
      scrabble over ROOTS --

      SOMEONE is trying to get through the dense jungle as fast as 
      they can, but a LIMP from an injured leg prevents them from 
      reaching top speed -- and now we see -- it s SAYID -- His  *
      clothes weathered from an ordeal (you ll read all about it in  *
      EPISODE 108.)  His face and arms TORN UP from his TWO DAY  *
      TREK.  He runs, smashes his way through the jungle.*

      And if this wasn t ENOUGH action to get us excited about 
      staying tuned for the denouement --

      EXT. JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE - DAY4141

      ANOTHER PAIR OF LEGS pounds through the foliage, running in 
      the opposite direction -- NO LIMP -- A different RHYTHM to 
      the BREATHING that accompanies them -- very different,  *
      because we pull up and see, IT S HURLEY. *

      By the way this is CUT, we get the sense that Sayid and  *
      Hurley -- are RUNNING TO THE SAME PLACE.*

      And off this pure KINETIC INTENSITY we find --

      EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY4242

      STILLNESS.

      Claire sits against a tree.  CHARLIE huddles at her side with 
      friendly concern.  The TRADE WINDS ease around them, 
      prompting the grass to sway with reassuring grace.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You feel another one coming?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know...

                          (looking around)
                    Where in the bloody hell is Jack?

      Claire shifts, starts to get to her feet --

                                  CLAIRE
                    I think... I think I m all right.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Wait.  You shouldn t -- the 
                      contractions --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Maybe that was the last one.
                          (a half-prayer)
                    Please, let it have been the last 
                    one.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (hopeful)
                    Jack said the stress might cause 
                    some kind of false labor...
                          (beat)
                    Are you sure you re all right?

      She assesses for a beat, then --

                                  CLAIRE
                    No pain.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Well, there you are, then:  
                    Birthing emergency averted.     
                    Told you I d take care of you.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (a heartbreaking smile)
                    Thank you, Charlie.

                                  CHARLIE
                    ... you re quite welcome.

      And a moment of GENUINE WARMTH.  Claire finally giving in to 
      it, too.  After all they ve been through, we want these two 
      to be together.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Any chance of you making it back to

                          (beat; and he means this)
                    I won t let anything happen to you.

      And after a moment, she NODS.  But lest we get too 
        comfortable, we CRASH BACK INTO --

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY4343

      SAYID -- RUNNING -- LIMPING -- His breathing more RAGGED -- 
      More DESPERATE --

                                                                  INTERCUTS WITH:

      INT. THE VALLEY - RED ROCK WALL - DAY4545

      ON JACK standing with KATE as they both turn to find --

                                  KATE
                    Sayid?

      SAYID limps toward them -- And now that he s made it home, 
      willpower gives way to reality and he COLLAPSES --

      -- Jack immediately moves for him, eases him to the ground.  
      Kate is close behind.  Sayid is really fucking WEAK, out of 
      breath -- DISORIENTED -- Trying to get it all out at once --

                                  SAYID
                    -- Listen -- on the island -- I *
                    found her -- the woman -- she --*

      -- Jack checks over Sayid s body for injuries.  Sees his 
      rather brutal LEG INJURY.

                                  JACK
                    I need some water!
                          (to Sayid)
                    What happened?  Where were --?

      Just then, HURLEY (the other pair of legs) bursts out of the

      ground, WIPED.  Jack tending to him.  Hurley desperately 
      trying to communicate something himself --

      QUICK CUTS covering all of this as (sorry, Marita) --

      Hurley holds up a METALLIC CLIPBOARD --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    The manifest...

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  HURLEY
                    My census -- the names of-- 
                    everyone who survived.  All forty-
                    six of us.  I interviewed 
                      everybody.  Here.  At the beach.  
                    Got everyone s -- name...
                          (beat; catching his 
                            breath)
                    But one of them -- Jack, one of 
                    them isn t in the manifest.

      Jack.  Kate.  Locke (oh yes, we LINGER on Locke) all exchange 
    a look.  Even with Sayid s arrival, Hurley s information has 
      take on major SIGNIFICANCE.

      And we PUSH IN on Hurley just so we GET IT when he says --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    He wasn t on the plane.

      And now it s time to PUSH IN on Kate --

                                  KATE
                    Who wasn t on the plane?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY4646

      One of the DARKER sections of the jungle.  Definitely CREEPY 
      as we find --

      CLAIRE and CHARLIE as they make their way back along the path 
      toward the valley.  Charlie carries her BAG in one hand.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   53.
      (CONT'D):4646


      Claire suddenly STOPS -- puts her hand on her belly.  Charlie 
      instantly WORRIED --

                                  CHARLIE
                    You okay?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah -- he just kicked.

      Claire SMILES and reaches out, taking Charlie s hand in hers.  
      Charlie smiles, abashed, as --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello there.

      Charlie and Claire both JUMP.  Didn t hear anyone come up.  
      They both look up to see --

      ETHAN.

      Just kinda standing here.  Arms at his sides.  More than just 
    a little UNSETTLING.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (confused)
                    Ethan?  Where s Jack?

                                  ETHAN
                    Oh.  Jack?
                          (simply)
                    I didn t go and get him.

      Ethan exudes a creepy calm -- he s still the same guy we ve 
      come to know, but there is something slightly askew in his 
      delivery, something just... OFF.*

                                  CHARLIE
                    What do you mean you didn t go?

      Ethan ignores him.  Turns his attention to Claire, takes a 
      step forward --

                                  ETHAN*
                    I know you re scared.  It s okay.*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    What the hell are you talking *
                    about, you git?  One more step --*

      AND SUDDENLY, a NOISE in the DENSE JUNGLE behind them --  *
      MOVEMENT -- NON-DESCRIPT --*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   54.
      (CONT'D): (2)4646


      Charlie and Claire both turn towards it -- NOTHING.  And the  *
      instant they turn back --*

      Ethan is standing right in front of them -- *

                                  ETHAN*
                    I m sorry it s come to this.*

      And as we CLOSE IN ON ETHAN S COLD EYES -- wondering who the  *
      hell he is -- what he wants -- and what the fuck he is GOING  *
      TO DO...*

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK. *
