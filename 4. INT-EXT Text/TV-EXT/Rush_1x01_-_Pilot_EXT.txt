      A pristine 1963 Ferrari Lusso convertible squeals into the 
      parking lot. Will Rush gets out, walks to the passenger side, 
      opens the door:

                                  RUSH
                    We re here.

      The barely conscious Young Hottie looks up, smiles. A low 
      groan of effort, as Rush hoists her up, throws her arm over 
      his shoulder. They begin the slow shuffle to the Hospital. 
      The Young Hottie slurs:

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    What club did you say this was 
                    again?                                                                                      4.


                                  RUSH
                    It s very exclusive. Just opened.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    What s it called?

                                  RUSH
                      Emergency.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    You sure we ll be able to get in?

                                  RUSH
                    Don t worry. I know the door guy.


      Rush exits the hospital, squints into the oncoming dawn. It s 
      a quiet morning, punctuated by low chatter from the PATIENTS 
      and HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES that dot the parking lot. 

      Now, an AMBULANCE speeds in. Attendants swarm it, surround a 
      WHEEZING WOMAN, mid-60 s. Her HUSBAND is by her side. His 
      terrified SCREAMS pierce the morning air.

      BEEP-BEEP. Rush clicks his keychain. The Ferrari unlocks. He 
      doesn t break his stride.

                                  RADIO DJ (O.S.)
                    ...Gonna be a hot one today, Los 
                      Angeles...


      A bright and beautiful LA Morning. Rush drives, sunglasses 
      on, holding his Blackberry against the wheel. His other hand 
      scans the radio.

      His car is filled with Banker s Boxes, files, CD s, empty Red 
      Bulls. An archaic pager rests on the dash. It s a makeshift 
      office. Although a disaster, it s got a sort of messy logic 
      to it. Kind of like Rush himself.

      His CELL PHONE RINGS. He picks up:

                                  RUSH
                    My car s making a strange noise--

      On the other end, EVE, Rush s assistant:

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    I m not a mechanic. You re late.

      Rush clicks on his Bluetooth, tosses the Blackberry onto the 
      passenger seat:

                                  RUSH
                    I m close. Can you order me the 
                    poached eggs with wasabi oil and 
                    shiitake chutney? Actually, you 
                    know what? Just a burger.


      Rush rings the doorbell of a palatial Studio City home. The 
      door SWINGS OPEN, and on the other side--RED CUMMINGS, tall, 
      thick, Midwestern, and American as apple pie. Cleanup hitter 
      for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Took a while.

      Rush ignores him, enters the house. The interior is straight 
      out of MTV Cribs: massive, sparse, with wall-to-wall white 
      carpet. The only personal touch is some of Red s sports 
      memorabilia on the walls.

      And in the Living Room, Rush spots a WOMAN slumped against 
      the couch. Blood dripping from her lip onto the white carpet 
      beneath her. Cut beneath her eye. This is Hannah. Rush shoots 
      Red a look.

                                  RED CUMMINGS (CONT'D)
                    She drank my juice.

                                  RUSH
                          (incredulous)
                    She drank your juice.

      Rush sighs, moves to the woman quickly, opening his medical 
      bag as he does:

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Doc, that juice is hand-squeezed by 
                    a Tibetan monk and imported daily 
                    from Nagchu. It keeps me centered.
                          (off his look)
                    ...And I ve been in this goddamned 
                    slump for weeks. I m sorry, but 
                    that stuff gets to a ballplayer. 
                    They all say it don t, but it does--                                                                                    12.


      Rush kneels by Hannah, gets a closer look:

                                  RUSH
                    Well, that s gonna cost you 15 
                    grand.

      Red looks at him, nods, disappears into the other room. Rush 
      begins to attend to Hannah, removing items from his kit. 
      She s dazed, numb. Red returns, stands over Rush, several 
      stacks of cash in his hand:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Next time, could you at least take 
                    off your rings before you hit her?

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    I know, Doc. I know. But those are 
                    World Series rings. You win  em, 
                    you leave  em on. That s just what 
                    you do. People have to know you re 
                      a champion.
                          (beat)
                    But there ain t gonna be no next 
                    time, Doc. I m gon  get this thing 
                    under control--

      Rush offers no response. Instead, his eyes turn to the cash:

                                  RUSH
                    It s all there?

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Count it.

                                  RUSH
                    You count it. I ll take care of 
                    your lady.


      A beautiful Silver Lake house: simple, tasteful. Rush s 
      convertible screeches into the driveway, pulling alongside 
      Minivans and Station Wagons... He approaches the front door,

      And he s intercepted by Eve, who carries a WRAPPED PRESENT:

                                  EVE
                    It s a Lego Racer. He ll love it.

                                  RUSH
                    What would I do without you?

                                  EVE
                    It wouldn t be pretty.
                          (beat)
                    Uh, Rush?

      He looks at her. She moves in close, wipes a bit of coke from 
      beneath his nose. He gives her the thumbs-up, a wink:

                                  RUSH
                    Keep up the good work.
                          (beat)
                    You sure you don t want to come in? 
                    Could be some cute guys in there--

                                  EVE
                    It s a six-year-old s birthday--

                                  RUSH
                    Please. Just for a second. You know 
                    how much Laurel hates me. You could 
                    run interference--

                                  EVE
                    As enticing as that sounds, I 
                    can t. I have plans this evening.

      Rush s ears prick up:

                                  RUSH 
                    Really?                                                                                    16.


                                  EVE
                    Yes. I do have a life outside of 
                    this job, you know.

                                  RUSH
                    I did not know that, actually. But, 
                    for what it s worth, I m glad 
                    you re dating. I think it s 
                    healthy. 

                                  EVE
                    Coming from the expert on health.

                                  RUSH
                    I am a doctor.
                          (beat)
                    So, who is it? The bartender from 
                    Harvard and Stone? The one who s 
                    doing Blue Steel in all his 
                    Facebook pics?

                                  EVE
                    Bye, Rush.

                                  RUSH
                    No way. Not Hairplugs Guy from 
                    Tender Greens?

      She walks away. Rush calls after her:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Don t go down on him! He ll never 
                    call you again!


      Rush drives, grinning wide. An 80 s power ballad blasts from 
      his stereo. His phone rings. He grabs it:

                                  RUSH
                    This is Rush.

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    We received an emergency call from 
                      Brentwood.

                                  RUSH
                    What is it?


      A BARELY-CLAD WOMAN opens the door to a giant mansion: 

                                  RUSH
                    I m here to see Billy Bloom.

      She nods. Behind her, remnants of a party that s been going 
      on all night and into today. She turns, leading Rush past 
      young hipster girls, older musicians, a few androgynous 
      youngsters, upstairs and into the


      Bass. Beautiful people. A scene. The din of the crowd 
      jockeying for position to get in...

      Eve waits quietly, completely out of place in this setting. 
      The DOORMAN scans the crowd, lets a few people in: 

                                    DOORMAN
                    ...And you.


      Eve walks past gorgeous girls and gawking guys. She feels 
      their eyes on her, as she moves to the bar. She looks around, 
      nervous. A HANDSOME GUY approaches:

                                  HANDSOME GUY
                    You here alone?

                                  EVE
                    I m waiting for someone.

      He nods, contemplating his next move. Then:

                                  HANDSOME GUY
                    Nice skirt.

      She doesn t answer, scans the bar:

                                  HANDSOME GUY (CONT'D)
                    Must be really popular--
                          (beat)
                    I ve seen a lot of girls wearing it 
                    tonight.

                                  EVE
                    I get it.
                          (beat)
                    The compliment that s really an 
                    insult. From that pickup book?                                                                                    31.


      He looks at her, thrown:

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    It s supposed to make me feel just 
                    a little insecure? Supposed to make 
                    me long for your approval?
                          (off his look)
                    I don t want your approval. 
                          (beat)
                    I would try the crowd at the end of 
                    the bar. They seem a bit more your 
                    speed. Not as well-read.

      He stares, dumbfounded. Then turns and walks away. A FEMALE 
      BARTENDER approaches:

                                  FEMALE BARTENDER
                    You make it look easy.

                                  EVE
                    I have a real knack for repelling 
                    men.

      The Female Bartender leans in. In CLOSEUP we see it s

      HANNAH. Red Cummings  girl. Other than the thin scab on her 
      lip, no evidence of the beating she took earlier. She wears 
      the uniform of this place: jeans and a black tank top.

                                  HANNAH
                    What can I get you?

                                  EVE
                    Glass of Shiraz, please.

      Hannah pours the drink, and Eve looks at her,

      As Hannah brushes her hair behind her ear, revealing a 
        particularly nasty bruise. 

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    I think you need a little more 
                      cover-up--

      Hannah instinctively touches her bruise. She looks at Eve:

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    He s not going to stop, you know.

                                  HANNAH
                    I m sorry?                                                                                    32.


                                  EVE
                    Your boyfriend. He s not going to 
                    stop hitting you.

                                  HANNAH
                          (taken aback)
                    You don t know anything about me.

                                  EVE
                    ...You re beautiful. You re young. 
                    You come to Los Angeles--from the 
                    South maybe, judging by that little 
                    bit of an accent you re trying to 
                    hide--to live out your dreams, 
                    right? 
                          (off her look)
                    Actress? 

                                  HANNAH
                    Musician.

                                  EVE
                    ...You meet a guy. He s handsome. 
                    He s famous. He s rich. He takes 
                    you to nice places. Maybe you re in 
                    love with him. Probably not...
                          (beat)
                    ...And then he starts hitting you. 
                    And before you know it, you ve 
                    never felt so stuck in your whole 
                    life, and you can t imagine any way 
                    out--

                                  HANNAH
                    Who are you? 

                                  EVE
                    I work for Will Rush. 
                          (beat)
                    Red Cummings is a bad guy. Bad guys 
                    don t change. Trust me on this. 

      They look at each other. There s a mutual sadness they share. 
      Hannah s eyes glaze over with tears. A beat.

      And just as quickly, Hannah s look shifts. She glares at Eve. 
      Steely now:

                                  HANNAH
                    Listen, I appreciate the gesture, 
                    or whatever this is--
                          (beat)
                    But if you don t leave right now, 
                    I m going to have to call security--                                                                                    33.


      And she moves down the line, to a GUY IN A SUIT:

                                  HANNAH (CONT'D)
                    What can I get you, sweetie?

      And Eve watches her, shakes her head. Walks away.


      Harold lights a smoke:

                                  HAROLD
                    Wish I could help you, brother.
                          (beat)
                    You want blood, you gotta go 
                    inside.


      Rush, flanked by two GANG MEMBERS, pops the trunk of his 
      Ferrari. It s filled with Pelican cases, leather bags, etc. 
      Rush slings a bag over one shoulder, grabs a case, looks at 
      the other guys:

                                  RUSH
                    That your friend in there?

      They nod.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    If you want him to live, you ll 
                    grab some heavy shit.


      Alex, wearing a HOODIE over his scrubs now, moves through the 
      ER entrance into the brisk night. Head down. Eyes up. He 
      passes Tasha, smoking a cigarette. She looks up,

      Just in time to see him get into his car.


      Alex drags a COOLER across a parking lot--empty, save Rush s 
      car and an unmarked van. Far off in the night, a siren 
      passes. He approaches a corrugated metal gate, slides it 
      open, revealing the CARNAGE. 

      In the corner, 2 gangsters wrap a dead body in blankets, 
      sheets. In the center, Julio on a table, shirtless. Rush 
      preps him, DOUSING his stomach with DISINFECTANT. An IV Rack 
      stands next to them, along with a MOBILE vitals monitor. It s 
      the kind of equipment military doctors use in the field. 
      Raoul walks toward Alex, gun held high. His BOYS follow.                                                                                     41.


                                  RAOUL
                    Who the fuck are you?

                                  RUSH
                    He s with me--

      Raoul presses his gun to Alex s head:

                                  RAOUL
                    Open it.

      Alex s hands shake, as he opens the cooler, revealing 2 BAGS 
      of BLOOD atop dry ice.

                                  RAOUL (CONT'D)
                    Good.

                                  ALEX
                    I took it out of controlled storage 
                    19 minutes ago. You ve got 11 to 
                    get it into him.

                                  RUSH
                    Thank you. You can go now.

                                  RAOUL
                    Hold up. Not so fast. 

      Rush looks at Raoul:

                                  RAOUL (CONT'D)
                    Your boy s seen an awful lot to 
                    just go and walk away now. Nuh-uh. 
                    He stays  til you re done.

                                  RUSH
                    He leaves or this man dies.

      Raoul looks at him. Rush looks back, eyes steel:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Try me.

      Raoul smiles:

                                  RAOUL
                    Fine. 
                          (to Alex)
                    Get out.

                                  ALEX
                    No.

      Rush looks at him:                                                                                    42.


                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    I m not leaving you like this.

      Rush pulls him aside:

                                  RUSH
                    You have a wife. You have a kid.

      Alex looks at Rush, angry, concerned. About to say something:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Leave.

      And he nods, walks away. Rush watches him go. When he reaches 
      the door, Alex checks his watch:

                                  ALEX 
                    Nine minutes, thirty seconds, Rush.

      And with that, he s gone.


      Rush, in scrubs now, works quickly, hanging ANASTHETIC, 
      FLUIDS, etc. on the IV UNIT. 

                                  JULIO 
                    I don t wanna die.

                                  RUSH
                    No, I would imagine not.

      He rubs alcohol on Julio s arms, jams TWO BIG IV s into 
      Julio s elbow joints...

                                  JULIO
                    I m a good man, doctor. I have a 
                    kid. A little 2 year old kid. I 
                    wanna see all the great shit she s 
                    gonna do in her life. Don t let me 
                    die, please. Don t let me--

                                  RUSH
                    Go to sleep, Julio.

                                  JULIO
                    Please. Pleeeease--I m 
                      a...good...man--

      And he s out.

                                  RUSH
                    Good men don t usually wind up in 
                      situations like this, ese.                                                                                    43.


      Rush checks his watch. It reads 2 MINUTES

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I need an outlet.

      Raoul, standing by, nods toward the back wall... Rush runs 
      the cord from his RAPID INFUSER (a device that warms the 
      blood prior to any transfusion) to the wall--

      Now, he opens Julio s mouth, intubates. It s a tube that runs 
      to what looks like a little scuba tank. A portable 
      VENTILATOR.  Rush drops to his knees, removes the bags of 
      blood from the cooler.

      He checks his watch. 1:14:00

      He hangs the bags of blood on the IV Rack, grabs the tube,

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    OH MY GOD!

      Rush TURNS to the entrance, sees a MEXICAN WOMAN running 
      toward the OPERATING TABLE. 

                                  RUSH
                    What s the hell is going on here?

      The Woman THROWS herself onto Julio, copiously WEEPING.

                                  SONYA
                    OH MY GOD! OH NO!

      Rush looks at his watch. 00:24:00. He quickly connects the 
      blood tube to the IV...

                                  RAOUL
                    It s OK. It s OK--

                                  SONYA
                    It s not OK, Raoul! This is your 
                    fuckin  fault! 

      Blood starts running down the tube. Raoul pulls Sonya off. 
      Rush looks to her, flustered.

                                  RUSH
                    Who is this?

                                  RAOUL
                    Sonya. My sister.
                          (beat, to Julio)
                    His wife.                                                                                    44.


                                  RUSH
                    OK. Not a good idea to bring the 
                    wife of the victim into the 
                      Operating--
                          (looks around the 
                            warehouse)
                    Place--

      Raoul holds his sister in his arms. He glares at Rush:

                                  RAOUL
                    Just fix him.

                                  RUSH
                    Fine. Keep her away from me.

      Rush s tools are laid atop a PIECE OF CLOTH on a steel TABLE 
      behind him. He grabs the SCALPEL, CUTS into Julio s stomach. 
      Sonya SCREAMS. Rush grabs his head:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Jesus. Listen, I ve got a wicked 
                    hangover setting in right about 
                    now, so can we keep the screaming 
                    to a minimum?

      Rush grabs a RETRACTOR, proceeds to OPEN Julio s stomach...

                                  SONYA
                    Oh my God. What are you doing to 
                    him?

                                  RUSH
                    I believe he s been shot in his 
                    spleen. I m going to take it out. 
                    You don t like it, I suggest you 
                    look the fuck away.

      Rush takes CLOSED SCISSORS, uses them to lift the STOMACH out 
      of the way. Beneath, he sees the SPLEEN. Blood spurts up: 

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.

      Rush moves in, applies pressure.

      The bullet s lodged in there. Rush eyes the artery that feeds 
      into the spleen. He grabs a clamp, clamps down upon the 
      artery. He ties the artery off, brandishes his scissors--

      Snip. He cuts it, and

      THE LIGHTS GO OUT.                                                                                    45.


                  RUSH (CONT'D)RAOUL
      What just happened?What was that?

      TOTAL DARKNESS. Save a whisper of sodium vapor street light.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    We blew a fuse.

      Raoul s silhouette moves up behind Rush. We hear the COCK of 
      a gun.

                                  RAOUL
                    Fix it.

                                  RUSH
                    Waving that thing in my face is not 
                    going to help.

      Raoul looks at him, helpless. Rush looks back.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Please.

      Raoul drops the gun. Rush thinks quickly, then:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I need everyone over here! Right 
                    now!

      Feet shuffle:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    OK, I need light: cell phones, 
                    lighters, anything you got. Let s 
                    go.
                          (beat)
                    Faster! Faster!

      The gangsters line up around the perimeter, hold up their 
      CELL PHONES, illuminating Julio... Rush drops to his knees, 
      starts sifting through his bag.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Where s Manny--?

                                  MANNY
                    Me?

                                  RUSH
                    You. Here. Now.

      Rush grabs something from his bag. Manny approaches. Rush 
      holds up an AMBU BAG. He places the bag in Julio s mouth:                                                                                    46.


                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I need you to breathe for him. Like 
                    this.

      Rush pumps the bag, in rhythm. Manny nods, freaked out. He 
      grabs the bag, takes over. Pumps in rhythm. Rush checks 
      Julio s pulse:

                                  RAOUL 
                    Is he OK?

                                  RUSH
                    I don t know. I m going in--

      Raoul watches, holding his breath, gripping Sonya s hand 
      tight. As Rush starts to separate Julio s spleen from the 
      surrounding organs, 

      Now Rush reaches in with both HANDS,

      Grabs the spleen. Pulls it out, places it on the rusty steel 
      table...

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    A little more light please...

      Raoul steps closer, holding his cell phone above Julio s 
      chest, as Rush goes back in, REMOVES THE CLAMP--

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Keep pumping, Manny.

                                  SONYA
                    What s going on? Is he OK--?

      Rush doesn t answer. Manny still pumps the ambu bag, in 
      rhythm. As Rush manually checks Julio s vitals: heartbeat, 
      blood pressure, etc... 

                                  RAOUL
                    IS HE OK?

      Raoul looks at him...

      And Rush nods. Exhausted.


      The warehouse doors slide open. Rush squints into a bright 
      and brilliant LA morning. Rush walks. Just the sound of the 
      breeze, the birds, a few passing cars, 

      And the BEEP-BEEP of his keychain, as the Ferrari unlocks.


      As in the beginning: Rush in the car, on the freeway, music 
      blasting, sunglasses on. Only this time, his face is covered 
      in dried blood and stubble. And the CD starts to skip.

      Skip. Skip. Skip. He ejects it, 

      And his phone rings. He picks up:                                                                                    50.


                                  RUSH
                    Can you install a fuckin  iPod in 
                    this car, please?

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    You need to get to Red Cummings  
                    house--

                                  RUSH
                    What I need is a shower--


      Rush puts his car in park, gets out. Eve s already there, 
      leaning against her car. When she sees Rush, she goes to him:

                                  RUSH
                    What are you doing here?

                                  EVE
                    He said she was unconscious--

      Rush looks at her, moves to Red Cummings door, knocks. The 
      door swings open, revealing Red. Shaken, flustered. Rush 
      moves right past him, through the house. Red follows:

                                  RED
                    She wouldn t even look at me, Doc. 
                    She can t never look at me after I 
                    have a bad game.
                          (beat)
                    Damn,  why d she have to be like 
                    that, Doc? 

      RUSH POV: Past the KITCHEN, down the HALLWAY, into the 

      BEDROOM

      Where, Hannah lies on the ground, unconscious. Blood streams 
      from her head; her lip hangs off her face. Rush runs to her:

                                  RED 
                    I m telling you, Doc. She was 
                    saying all this crazy stuff-- 

      Rush opens Hannah s eyes, peers in. Red stands over, 
      concerned.                                                                                     51.


                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    She dead?

                                  RUSH
                    Close.
                          (beat)
                    She needs to go to a hospital.

                                  EVE
                    You want me to call?

      Red shoots a look at Eve:

                                  RED
                    Who the hell are you anyway? You 
                    the one talking to my girl? 
                          (beat)
                    She told me someone came to her. At 
                    work. That you? You the one who did 
                    that? 

      Eve looks down, doesn t answer. Rush looks at her. What the 
      fuck? His head is spinning. He tries to focus:

                                  RUSH
                    Red, I said she needs to get to a 
                    hospital. Immediately.

                                  RED
                    I can t have my business in the 
                    papers like that. I mean, can t you 
                    just see the front page of the LA 
                    Times tomorrow?

                                  RUSH
                    Listen, I know a guy--
                          (beat)
                    He s got his own ambulance service. 
                    Unmarked. He can be here in 20 
                    minutes. No one would know--

      Red stops, really thinking now:

                                  RED
                    And it can t touch me? You sure 
                    about that?

      Eve eyes Hannah s prone body, anxious:

                                  EVE
                    Will--                                                                                    52.


                                  RUSH
                    No one would know, Red. You have my 
                    word.

      Red thinks, then:

                                  RED
                    Fine. 
                          (beat)
                    Fine. OK.

      Eve picks up her phone, dials:

                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    Just so long as you keep my name 
                    out of it.


      Eve sits in the back of the unmarked ambulance, next to an 
      unconscious Hannah. 

      Harold, from earlier, long hair in a net, wearing an EMT 
      uniform, straps her in.

      EVE POV: Rush, standing on the street. He peers in. They look 
      at each other.

                                  EVE
                    I was just trying to help.

      The ambulance door closes. Rush looks down.


      Eve walks through the sliding double doors of the ER, just as 
      an AMBULANCE pulls up. EMTs and Triage Nurses hurry to it. 
      Eve turns, as the back door opens. And, there,

      RED CUMMINGS lying on a stretcher, wincing in pain. The EMTs 
      grab the stretcher, take it down the ramp. Where

      RED S EYES MEET EVE S...

      He looks at her. His eyes widen with recognition. And we PUSH 
      IN ON  Eve, as she puts it all together. A look of 
        satisfaction crosses her face...


      Billy, in swimming cap and goggles, swims laps in his pool.

      Suddenly, 4 pairs of Timberlands step into foreground, 4 
      pairs of baggy jeans...

      Raoul and his men. 

      BILLY POV: Rising up from beneath the water to see these 4 
      big badasses. He looks at them, knows he s fucked. 

      He gets out of the pool, saying nothing, just indicating with 
      his eyes, follow me.


      Raoul and his men walk to their Escalade. One of his boys 
      holds the Rothko.  Raoul gives it a sideways glance, as he 
      stuffs some bills into his pocket:

                                  RAOUL
                    My sister s gon  flip. She loves 
                    art.


      Rush strides through the sliding double doors. He spots a 
      RAGGED MAN sitting on the curb. He walks to him, holds out 
      his hand. In it, a $20.                                                                                     58.


                                  RUSH
                    Here.

      The RAGGED MAN takes the money, looks at Rush, who s moved on 
      into the parking lot:

                                  RAGGED MAN
                    I m not homeless.

      Rush freezes, turns around,

      Snatches the $20 back. 


      Rush s Ferrari crests a hill. Los Angeles looms below him. 
      The smog hangs low, an orange-blue haze in the air. And his 
      CD starts to skip.

        Skip--skip--skip--

      Rush, furious, turns to the passenger seat, starts flipping 
      through CDs. All of them, scratched. Until, finally,

                                  RUSH
                    Fuck it.

      He turns the music up. The same line, over and over again.

      Over and over again. Rush shifts gears, accelerates 

      As we go

                                                                              BLACK.
