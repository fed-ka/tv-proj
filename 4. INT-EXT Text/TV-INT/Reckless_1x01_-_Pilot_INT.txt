The full grandeur of Charleston Harbor is visible in the hot 
summer sun. Huge CONTAINER SHIPS come in to unload, DOLPHINS 
play among a peppering of pleasure boats and trawlers...on a 
speedy little launch, leaping across the water, we find:

ROY RAYDER, 37, with piercing eyes and a manly Blake Shelton 
look. He might be a fisherman in painter's overalls, a 
baseball cap and a face-full of wiry stubble. He cuts the 
engine as he approaches the concrete public docks of a city 
park. Steers easily into a slip, ties the boat off.

He unzips the overalls to reveal THE SUIT he wears beneath. 
He tucks the overalls and his deck shoes into a locker, 
pulling out his loafers, a briefcase and an electric razor.

Hopping ashore, he walks toward town, shaving as he goes. 

EST. SHOT - CHARLESTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - HOT DAY88

The imposing, all-white building dominates the square, baking 
in the heat. It was designed by the same colonial architect 
that built the White House, and we can tell. 


It s just before 9:00 a.m., and the hallways are jammed with 
lawyers, families, witnesses and plaintiffs, waiting their 
turn on judges' dockets. People shift, nervous and bored, and 
 walking down then, something interesting happens. Someone s
the hall...someone people want to look at...

JAMIE HORN, 33, strides easily through the center of the 
crowd, wearing sky-high heels, a pencil skirt and confidence 
like French perfume. She has old-school beauty and new-school 
street smarts. Men admire her legs; women admire her cool in 
the heat. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       4.

She meets the eyes of a particularly bold male admirer, who 
steps out of her way...then she stops at the door to...

COURTROOM 9. Her impeccably manicured fingers grip the door 
knob, but it is locked. She knocks. A sweet-faced old BAILIFF 
with a thick country accent peeks out; his face falls.

BENNETT
Sweet baby Jesus. I cannot let you 
in.

JAMIE
(all Chicago)
 Bennett. I brought donuts. C mon,

She holds up a little bag from Dunkin Donuts. 


Jamie is alone in the quiet, empty courtroom.  She walks 
around, going through her questions in her head, preparing.   
She looks into the jury box.  

HER P.O.V. Laid in the leather seat of each empty arm chair 
is A SHARPENED PENCIL and a blank steno pad. 

Jamie calmly collects up the pencils in the front row, then 
goes to the defense table, opens her satchel briefcase and 
takes out a little bundle of pens.  Goes back to the front 
row of the jury box and lays a pen in each seat.  

As she straightens, she hears the courtroom door OPEN.

ROY, now clean-shaven, enters the courtroom. Their eyes meet 
as he walks to the prosecution table. Roy has an educated 
southern drawl.

ROY
Counselor. You look lovely, as 
usual. 

She takes her place at the defense table. They are opposing 
counsel. 

JAMIE
Save the gentleman shtick for the 
press, Roy.  Or the waitresses at 
Hooters or whoever it works on.

He just smiles to himself as he takes out his files.

ROY
Don't be dissin' Hooters. You might 
be working there someday.

Trey walks through. The department is bustling with life, 
arrests being processed, Detectives on the phone, uniformed 
officers hustling to get into the morning briefing.

She glances back once as she passes into the briefing room.

LEE ANNE

He sits at his desk. Types some commands. Leans back in his 
chair to watch:

ON SCREEN, a provocatively sexy picture of Lee Anne pops up, 
 in in tiny lace panties and a barely-there top with  KITTEN 
pink script across her breasts. She slouches, her smile open.

We HEAR a VOICE OVER:

ROY (V.O.)
Prosecution calls Detective Trey 
McCandless. 


Ceiling fans and air-conditioning barely make a difference in 
the courtroom, crowded and close. 

IN THE WITNESS BOX, Trey is questioned by Roy, who is in his 
shirtsleeves, tie loosened. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       6.

ROY
Take us through the facts of the 
case, if you would, Detective. 

TREY
Carrie Baker was working late in 
her studio on the night of February 
6th. 


In a brick storefront space, the shades drawn, an attractive 
woman in her thirties, CARRIE BAKER, sits at a long, wide 
table, making JEWELRY with a slender soldering iron.

Camera PANS with quick flashes; diamonds, precious gems and 
gold are strewn on the table. 

TREY (V.O.)
Computer records show that someone 
entered the building with a 
security card key at 1:23 a.m.  


Camera PANS THE TABLE...the soldering iron, still sputtering 
a blue flame, lies on the wood, burning a black mark on it.  
The gems and gold are gone, stool toppled, and ON THE FLOOR:

Carrie lies, DEAD, eyes open, BLOOD LEAKING OUT from behind 
her head, her pony-tail dragging in the slick red puddle. 

TREY (V.O.)
Her business partner found her body 
when she came to work in the 
morning. Carrie was stabbed with 
one of her own tools...a long, 
sharp knife. It's called a router.  

 neck...the slender Camera ZEROES IN on the back of Carrie s
 pencil-thin wood handle is BURIED into the ROUTER with it s
base of her neck up to the hilt. 

TREY (V.O.)
The router was still in her neck - 
it had stabbed all the way into her 
spinal cord.


Roy stands near Trey in the witness box. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       7.

ROY
Was anything missing from the 
studio? 

TREY
We estimate eighty thousand dollars 
worth of precious gems, gold and 
jewelry.

IN THE JURY BOX...a JUROR clicks her pen to write notes...but 
the pen has no INK. It scratches on the paper... 

ROY
And you found one of these pieces 
of stolen jewelry on the defendant, 
DeShaun Linares, when you went to 
his home to question him. 

He points out a young, tough-looking man sitting next to 
Jamie at the defense table. This is DESHAUN.

building, and his fingerprints were 
found in the victim's studio...

ROY S P.O.V. The entire front row is absorbed with their DRY 
PENS. They re not listening at all as they whisper, asking to 
borrow the pencils of the jurors in the rear... 

Roy glances at Jamie, who betrays nothing.  

ROY
Can we get the jury some pencils?


Jamie stands, questioning Trey. 

JAMIE
Detective, where exactly were 
DeShaun s fingerprints in the 
victim's studio?

TREY
They were found on the kitchen 
plumbing and counters.

JAMIE
Records show that DeShaun had 
  repaired a leak in the studio s
 kitchen that week. Perhaps that s
how the fingerprints got there?

TREY
That s also how he could have 
stolen her card key. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       8.

JAMIE (CONT D)
Were his fingerprints on the murder

TREY
There were no prints on the weapon. 
We believe the killer wore gloves. 

JAMIE
Is there any fiber or DNA evidence 
linking DeShaun to the crime scene?

TREY
...no. 

JAMIE
But you arrested him because you 
found a ring in his pocket. Did he 
tell you that Carrie Baker made him 
that ring, personally, for him to 
give to his girlfriend?

Jamie gestures to a delicate young woman, BRENDA, in a white 
sundress, sitting in the front row of the gallery.  

TREY
Right. She just gave the handyman a 
ring that sells for five grand.

Jamie picks up a PLASTIC BAGGIE from the evidence table in

sweet girl shows the jurors the pretty ring on her finger,

Lee Anne dresses for work. Looks at herself in the mirror, at 
the toughness of the uniform, the authority it gives her. She 
hears a voice calling her.

Her husband, ARLISS, is handsome, bearded, and in A WHEEL 
CHAIR. He sits before the open fridge, pressing himself up on 
the arms of his chair to get higher. 

ARLISS

She looks at him as he wheels himself away from her. 


 paralegal, VI, a super-skinny redneck chick in acid Jamie s
wash jeans, with fried hair and the gravelly voice of a 
lifelong smoker. She works at a computer as Jamie comes 
downstairs, barefoot, in the midst of getting dressed.

JAMIE
 No. One of the jurors in DeShaun s

Jamie walks with a SUITED MAN through the halls. The walls 
are lined with drawers that have engraved memorials to the 
deceased. Fans have been set up in corners and blow a meager 
breeze through the hot rooms. The SUITED MAN takes out a 
handkerchief and wipes his brow. 

JAMIE
Do you have any records on her body 
before the cremation? Would there 
be any mention of a ring on her 
finger?

SUITED MAN
I keep copious, detailed notes, 
which you may not see without the 
 permission. Here we are. family s

Carrie s memorial plate: Beloved sister, daughter and friend. 

SUITED MAN (CONT D)

Jamie hands him a paper. 

JAMIE
I have a court order. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       29.

He takes keys out of his pocket. Opens the drawer and takes 
out the urn. He carefully hands it to Jamie. 

SUITED MAN
I will go look for my notes.

He starts off, then turns back:

SUITED MAN (CONT D)
We have security cameras. And a 
microchip in every urn. 

He smiles creepily and leaves her alone. 

Jamie sits down on a bench. Takes out a folded up piece of 
newspaper and spreads it out. Then she carefully opens the 
urn. DUMPS THE ASHES OUT onto the newspaper...dust puffs up. 

JAMIE
Sorry, Carrie. 

With one delicate finger, she searches through the ashes. She 
sees nothing, just grit and dirt and then...

A GLINT OF METAL...she takes a pencil and fishes it out. 

 A RING. Well, the remains of a ring. The band is still IT S

    The ring now lies on a table between Jamie and Vi.  

JAMIE
No, they don t. The gems were fake. 
They were just...paste.

VI
The victim was making fake jewelry? 

JAMIE
Maybe. But...why? 

VI
I did that search of their business 
records at the city registry, like 
you told me, and I guess these

bills. One of their gem suppliers 
is suing them to get them to pay.

She and Vi look at each other, trying to puzzle it out. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       30.

JAMIE
We need to see more of her pieces. 
Bring up Carrie's sales records.

The jeweler pops one of the diamonds out of the setting. Sets 
it on one of his cloths and SMASHES IT with a small hammer. 
It s reduced to a pile of dust. Marisa and Jamie look at each

He goes off into the back. She looks through the stack he 
pointed to. They are nice landscapes. She looks around, her 
attention drawn to...

A stack of large canvases COVERED IN A DROP CLOTH. But not 
quite covered...she can see the long, BARE LEG of a nude 
figure on the corner of the front one. 

She walks over. Takes off the drop cloth: the paintings are 
NUDES, about seven canvases. 

She looks around. These are the only nudes she sees in the 
whole studio. She glances toward the back...he s not coming. 
She quickly flips through them. The second to last one causes 
her HEART TO CLUTCH...

It s a nude painting of the murder victim, CARRIE BAKER.  She 
pulls it out to see it better. It s definitely her. She looks 
seductively right at the viewer.

Poor Vi white knuckles her car through the pouring rain. She 
can barely see through her flapping wipers. 


Vi slips the lady behind the counter a twenty, shows photos 
of Carrie and the photo of Kenny and Helen, now taken out of 
the frame, but the woman shakes her head. 


Vi, soaking wet, gets another refusal. The clerks are getting 
more redneck, as she gets farther out of the city. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       41.


The store is ugly and old, with peeling linoleum. Signs that

window. The other women in the cell are a motley crew of 
hookers, young toughs and homeless women. They are all 
 stiflingly hot, with no water and nothing to sweating. It s

FEMALE GUARD

Jamie comes out into the lobby, eyes searching, falling on:

him tightly. 

PRESTON

her belongings...her purse and car keys, mostly. 

PRESTON
You want to come back to my place? 

JAMIE
I have to go home. I have to be in 
court in an hour. 

He puts an arm around her. Escorts her out. 

As they pass out of the jail, Jamie sees TREY MCCANDLESS 
standing over by the counter, watching her. She glares at 
him, and he infuriates her by actually smiling.  

ON PRESTON...seeing this wordless interchange. It makes his 
blood boil. 


Jamie is upstairs in her bathroom, RUSHING to get ready for 
court. Vi has come up and is helping her, picking up her 
discarded clothes while Jamie blow-dries her hair.  

JAMIE
Please throw those in the washer. 
They stink of jail.

Jamie turns off the dryer. She takes the clothes from Vi and  
stuffs them in a hamper. 

JAMIE
What did you tell Helen?

Vi offers Jamie dressing choices on hangers: this or that 
blouse, this or that skirt. Jamie points to the ones she 
wants.

JAMIE

 looking, and had sex with Helen s
boyfriend. What do you think? 

Vi chooses the righteous high heels. 

VI
I think you need the kick-ass 
heels. 


Jamie, in those heels, walks from the defense table to the 
witness stand. The principals are all here: Roy at the 
prosecution table, DeShaun at the defense table, Helen on the 
witness stand, Brenda in the gallery. Kenny too. Jamie picks 
up the ring from the evidence table.

JAMIE
Can I ask you to examine this ring, 
Ms. Marcks? 

She hands it to Helen, who looks at it. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       51.

in the center is a diamond. About a 
karat, maybe a little more. 

JAMIE
Thank you. 

Jamie takes the ring. On her defense table is a crystal 
ashtray with a ball of shredded paper in it. She puts the 
ring in the dish, takes out a lighter and LIGHTS THE PAPER ON 
FIRE. A FLAME IGNITES.

People in the courtroom are shocked. We scan some of their 
faces, Brenda, DeShaun, HELEN, who looks alarmed, and...

ROY...who watches Jamie, almost admiring. What is she up to?

JUDGE GARNER
Miss Horn...

HELEN
What are you doing?

She carries the burning dish to Helen.

JAMIE
What happens to precious gems when 
they are exposed to fire? 

HELEN
(confused, worried)
Nothing. 

JAMIE
So what will happen to this ring in 
the fire? Will it be harmed?

Jamie blows out the fire. Takes a pair of tweezers from her 
pocket and holds up the hot ring, showing it to Helen.

JAMIE
Diamonds don t burn. Or melt. 

She sets the ring in the dish. Comes to the jury with it.

The effect the fire had on this 
ring is proof that the so-called 
 fakes. were setting the in  gems 
Nothing but paste. 

She hands it to the jury, who pass it from one to the next. 

ON ROY...he s tightening. He sees that the jury is fascinated 
-- they study the ring.

JAMIE (CONT D)
These necklaces are owned by a 
local woman, sold to her by Ms. 
Marcks and Ms. Baker, along with a 
report from a jeweler who certifies 
that every so-called diamond in

    The Judge looks at the jewelry. Jamie turns to Helen. 

JAMIE (CONT D)
Did you know the jewels were fake? 

HELEN
Of course not. 

JAMIE
Are you sure? Because I have an 
affadavit from a gentleman in 
 been Greensville who says you ve
coming in every other Friday for a 
year to sell him loose gems. 

ROYJUDGE
Objection, your honor...Overruled...

JAMIE (CONT D)
Did Carrie find out that you were 
switching her gems? Is that why you 
went to the studio that night? Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       53.

ROYJAMIE
Objection!Or was it because you found 
out she was sleeping with 
your boyfriend? 

JUDGE
Sustained! Ms. Horn...

There s a rumbling reaction from onlookers. Judge Horn takes 
control.

JUDGE (CONT D)
Order! Miss Horn, Mr. Rayder, 
please approach. 

Helen wipes away tears as Jamie and Roy walk by her. Judge 
Garner looks down at them sternly from the bench.

Roy rolls his eyes. 

JUDGE GARNER
What have you actually got on this 
witness? 

JAMIE
Carrie was the artist. Helen 
handled all the money. She did all 
 the selling of the jewelry. She d
order the real gems, give them to 
Carrie, who would make the jewelry 
and return the finished pieces to 
Helen to distribute and sell. And 
 where Helen took the that s
opportunity to make a little extra 
cash. 

ROY
All hearsay...

who will testify, in return for 
immunity, that they took the real 
diamonds out of Carrie s pieces and 
replaced them with fakes. 

ROY

JAMIE
She would have gotten away with it 
too, but she got greedy. Lived too 
high, stopped paying the bills, and 
Carrie found out. And Helen s 
boyfriend will testify that he had 
an affair with Carrie. 

JUDGE GARNER
Where was Helen the night of the 
murder? 

JAMIE
She says she was home alone, 
asleep. 

A beat. The Judge glances over...

HIS P.O.V. A stoned face Helen stares at him. Has she heard?

Garner turns back to Roy. 

JUDGE GARNER
 got you by the balls, Roy. She s

Roy is not happy. He hates to lose. But the Judge is right. 

ROY
In light of the new evidence, the 
State of South Carolina will have 
to drop its case against DeShaun 
Linares. 

JAMIE
I want him released. Immediately.

JUDGE GARNER
We can make that happen. 

Jamie tries to maintain her joy. But we can read it, in her 
face, when she looks over her shoulder at...

HER P.O.V. DeShaun, looking at her, anticipating. 

Jamie finally smiles...and TEARS come into DeShaun s eyes. He 
turns to look at BRENDA...whose eyes shine with tears of 
relief right back at him. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       55.


The doors to Courtroom Nine are flung open, the spectators in 
the gallery have already poured out and are filling the hall. 
Outside the doors, DeShaun is picking up his daughter Shaunee 
and spinning her around. She touches his face. 

SHAUNEE
You coming home, Daddy? 

DESHAUN
(eyes welling)
Coming home, baby. 

Brenda hugs Jamie.

BRENDA
Thank you. I knew you could do it.Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       56.

JAMIE
We can still go after Trey. Make 
sure he never does this to another 
woman.

BRENDA
I just want to go home. 

Jamie is disappointed, but happy for the little family. She 
watches them, and in this moment, we see how utterly 
exhausted she is from her rough night. She picks up her 
things, intending to slip away, but as she starts out, moving 
through the crowd, she finds herself face to face with ROY.

Can I give you a ride? 

She holds his eyes. 

JAMIE
I have one. 

She gestures, and he turns...PRESTON is standing there, 
waiting for her. He nods a greeting to Roy. 

ROY
See ya, Jamie. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       57.

ON ROY, surprised to feel a sharp pang of envy, watching her 
walk away with another man.

grabs up the overnight bag and goes out. 


Jamie sits down at her conference table. A digital DICTAPHONE 
lies in the middle, its light on, and sitting across from her 
is LEE ANNE HUNTER, who looks different, smaller and more 
vulnerable, in jeans, with no make-up.

Because...I loved him. I don t have

afraid I would have nothing without 
him. 

JAMIE
These cops are saying your 
involvement in the group sex was 
consensual.

LEE ANNE
(wiping tears away)
How can you believe them, after 
what they did to you?

We HOLD on Jamie, feeling that sting.


Roy stands, looking handsome in a suit, in the center of the 
chamber, the gallery full of friends and onlookers, as he is 
sworn in as the new City Attorney of Charleston. His friend 
Knox, the police chief, is there in his dress blues. 

As people clap, Roy shakes hands, gets pats on the back. 

KNOX
Congratulations, buddy. 

ROY
Thanks. I want to talk to you about 
 the materials you sent, there s
some missing stuff... 

Others, including Dec, Tom Johnson and city council members 
take Roy away from the conversation. Knox watches Roy.

Roy sits in the outer office with his paralegals, Angela and 
 Darren, watching THE PRESS CONFERENCE on a television. He s
not happy. 

ROY
Okay, Jamie. Game on. 

He flicks off the TV in disgust.
