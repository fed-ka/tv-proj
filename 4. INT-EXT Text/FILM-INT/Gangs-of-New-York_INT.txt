Half in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a clean
white clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor to
his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not
flinch.
The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we
hear.
VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor
ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve
years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and
excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket.
VALLON
No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son.
He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known
as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father.
From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden
crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son.
Amsterdam squeezes tight.
VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim
hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human.
MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a
hymn.
CUT TO
VALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up
with him.
They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of
LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out
from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched
across his path.
CUT TO
Another room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of
a Madonna and child painted on the wall.
A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal
point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies only
half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial
paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY.
Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends
down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back
and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an
unlucky rabbit.
Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body.
He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.
CUT TO
Jack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike with
the dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross.
HAPPY JACK
Did you bring the boy for a charm, Priest?
VALLON
No, Jack. For a baptism.
Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up
by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS.
MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous.
Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR
wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of
chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it
were a twig.
RABBIT WARRIOR
We'll send a few across the river today, Priest.
He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half
again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of
destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like
Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink.
The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart
around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals
frightened in a burrow.
CUT TO
Vast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on...
... the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead.
Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same
age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of
the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it
as he stands up.
He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude
weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor
is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew
into his rat.
Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we
see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded
with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men
and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo
animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or,
more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny
enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries.
Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that
spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the
Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after
them.
The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in
the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front:
Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.
SHANG
What's the fight?
AMSTERDAM
The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever. But it'll all
be settled today.
SHANG
Are you Native or Rabbit?
AMSTERDAM
(points to rabbit on pike)
What do you think?
SHANG
Looks alright. I'll stand by you, then.
CUT TO
The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel.
In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN
(MONK EASTMAN). VALLON stops near the door.
VALLON
I don't know you.
MAN
(lightly)
I suppose there's to be a fight.
VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice.
VALLON
Derry?
MAN
Donnegal. Name's Monk Eastman.
VALLON
And you want to fight, Mr. Eastman?
MONK
lf there's money in it.
VALLON
Fight for the Natives. They have a proper war chest.
MONK
Well, I might at that. But I thought I'd ask you first, seeing as how I'm
not quite a Native American myself.
VALLON
Let's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later.
MONK
Fine. But if you like what you see, pay me double.
Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a
SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT
streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man,
in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes his
head look even bigger.
VALLON
(as the door splinters settle)
Stand with us then.
CUT TO
WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet.
VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS
slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and
maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints
Brewery.
It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding
ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud
and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage.
WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument
erected to some forgotten war hero.
The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts
and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles
anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a
pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or
never came at all.
VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His
battalion of irregulars waits for his signal.
Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comes
ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like
Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and
bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of
this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles.
Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.
VALLON
Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled?
A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young,
lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is
real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved,
instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE.
On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending
combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight.
They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own
favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.
BILL THE BUTCHER
On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who
holds sway.
VALLON
Bene.
BILL THE BUTCHER
By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those
warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in
our wounds.
VALLON
But this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes, Bill? Can
you see it clear with your single eye?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returns
wounded has been touched by God.
VALLON
It wasn't God who touched your eye.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blow
like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from
his death.
VALLON
I don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher. Let's have at it.
BILL THE BUTCHER
There is another matter.
VALLON
Say it out and quick, before spring gets here.
BILL THE BUTCHER
No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the
halt and maimed.
VALLON
So?
BILL THE BUTCHER
So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits
can smile out of both sides of his face.
A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the
tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE
BUTCHER's feet.
In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he
carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls
trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to
him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is
sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass.
The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled.
VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose,
underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down,
like the blades of a jackknife.
VALLON
Prepare to receive the Lord.
And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl
across Paradise Square into BATTLE.
VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of
his cross and turns to fight again.
Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.
Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act
together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling.
Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a
blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses
unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however,
they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them.
BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's
skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm.
The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with
CHEERS.
VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once.
Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. He
raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING his
spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone.
The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new
star in the making.
The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and
lowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as the
Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs.
A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary,
delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach.
A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range
against several Rabbits.
A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS to
GOUGE his face.
The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit's
face.
Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks
around in growing PANIC for his father.
SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the
Brewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOING
him...
... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGED
NATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the
sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat.
SHANG
(desperate)
I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood of
five generations!
PEG-LEG
Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.
He pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted by
the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling on
the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving
the BOY quaking.
The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready
POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise
Square.
The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops.
The POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF the
wagons.
There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND of
the wind and the GROANS of the wounded.
Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the police
together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kids
get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time.
The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky cops
climb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remain
behind, dead on the ground.
The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating
POLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confront
each other once again.
Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into their
spectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity.
Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battle
like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible
fury.
Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to the
relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear. He
hits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street,
which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face
to face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limb
and driven it through his heart.
Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a
NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEON
from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the
knees.
The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He is
hysterical.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a single
look, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weapon
to help...
... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten
senseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between
the Butcher and his father...
As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting,
falling back... looking for his chance...
... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off
balance...
...just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his father
FALLING, tries to turn but...
... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLON
falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get
away...
... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLON
screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into his
enemy's eyes ... and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering,
VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ... he forces himself to look at Bill...it's a
terrible struggle... but VALLON will not look away.
Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdam
by the arm, making him drop his hatchet.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You need a weapon? Use a knife.
He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the
Butcher sunk into his father's chest.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It makes a deeper cut.
And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON's
heart.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Say a benediction, Priest.
VALLON bellows in agony. Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, his
cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Amsterdam)
Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up against
the Native Americans.
Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious
signal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes
a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and
sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(announcing)
Ears and noses will be trophies of the day.
The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives
can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are many
corpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and the
Natives have clearly carried the day.
The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him.
Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in his
throat.
VALLON
Can't..can't cross the river... with steel through my heart.
Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly
something he is meant to do himself.
Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon
tries not to cry out. The knife does not move.
Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly
wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony.
Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off
the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain.
Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but
Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father,
and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart.
He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm,
closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.
MONK
That's yours, rightfully.
Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat,
REMOVING some money.
MONK
And this is mine. Only what's owed. Use the rest for funeral.
AMSTERDAM
No!
He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior
intervenes.
HAPPY JACK
It's fair.
Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk
takes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks,
then on his left eye.
The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid
springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him:
a last moment of recognition.
VALLON
Hon ...
AMSTERDAM
No, Pa!
VALLON
... honor me... think of me ... don't never look away.
Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him.
RABBIT WOMAN
Take the body. Bring the boy.
Several RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at
them, like an animal.
RABBIT WARRIOR
Come an, lad. Therels nothing to be done now.
AMSTERDAM
Get away! Get away!
HAPPY JACK
Leave him be. He's his to mourn.
And the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down
the narrow streets.
Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple of
SCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies.
Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping
solitary vigil over his father.
A TITLE is superimposed across this scene:
NEW YORK CITY 1844
The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look
(MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city.
The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of
the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity
Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the
streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial
district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points .
The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square.
Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer
buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of
the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor.
The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the
creaking of masts in the winter WIND.
CUT TO
A funeral chapel.
Vallan's body lies in state. He is wearing his gang regalia, and all the
Dead Rabbits FILE PAST his coffin in solemn tribute. A WOMAN bends down
and kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he
has obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister mutters
PRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam.
HAPPY JACK
We passed the plate amongst ourselves. Come up with enough ned to carry
all this, and carry you a while, too.
He stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket.
AMSTERDAM
Where will my father rest?
HAPPY JACK
Potters Field, with everyone else.
AMSTERDAM
My father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in fresh
ground, facing east.
HAPPY JACK
What difference where he faces?
AMSTERDAM
He'll face east for the second coming of Christ.
HAPPY JACK
Fine, son. When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from there.
The Minister finishes the service. MR. CORNELIUS, a funeral director who
resembles one of his own customers, ushers in a WOMAN (MAGGIE) pulling a
lovely 10 year old GIRL (JENNY EVERDEKNE) by the hand. The woman is
obviously drunk, the girl frightened.
MR. CORNELIUS
Will you have music, entlegen
WOMAN (MAGGIE)
My daughter'11 do any song you like.
HAPPY JACK
Not tonight, Maggie, we got...
Monk Eastman interrupts from the Background.
MONK
How much?
MAGGIE
Any ned in your pocket, sir.
MONK hands MAGGIE some coins.
MONK
She sing sweet as she looks?
MAGGIE
Pure celestial, sir.
(to girl)
Go on, Jenny.
Jenny's voice is sweet as promised. The song she SINGS, however, is a
bawdy saloon song. Maggie cuts her off fast.
MAGGIE
No, Jen, the other.
Jenny starts to sing a HYMN. To avoid looking at the corpse, she lets her
eyes rove all around the chapel until she SEES Amsterdam. She locks
straight at him until the hymn is over. And he does not take his eyes off
her.
CUT TO
Mr. Cornelius is about to escort Maggie and Jenny into another room
crowded with mourners when a smartly-dressed man (DANIEL KILLORAN)
gestures to him from the shadows.
KILLORAN
Mr. Tweed would like a word, Mr. Cornelius.
(Cornelius hesitates)
Tweed of Tammany.
At the mention of the name, Cornelius shoos Maggie and Jenny into the
mourning room and shuts the door behind them. Then he gives Killoran his
full attention.
KILLORAN
In your office. At your pleasure, of course.
CUT TO
As the door opens, we see a man gazing out the narrow window onto the
spectacle in the next building. He is in his late 20s, already a little
fleshy but dressed with dash: WILLIAM TWEED... "BOSS" TWEED. He shows a
bemused, almost schalarly interest in the goings-on next door.
This mortuary is located next to a bordello, where the windows are
uncurtained and the energy and variety of the
activities inside is astounding.
Tweed finally TURNS as Killoran opens the door.
TWEED
Mr. Cornelius. With a view like this I'm surprised the dead can rest in
peace.
CORNELIUS
Is there anything I can...
TWEED
(interrupting)
Yes. A favor.
CORNELIUS
Happy to serve, Mr. Tweed.
TWEED
Excellent. Lend me something.
CORNELIUS
(puzzled)
Oh, I don't know what I could ...
TWEED
I believe in form and appearance, you see. Just like yourself, sir. And I
believe in law, and the power of example. Our city is a lawless
wilderness, sir. I'm asking you to help chasten it.
CORNELIUS
A matter of civic duty, then.
TWEED
And civic pride. I want you to help me set an example.
(smiles)
I only need to borrow one of your clients.
CUT TO
Two native Americans open the door where Vallon is laid out and Bill the
Butcher STRIDES into the room.
There is immediate TENSION, like an electric charge, as other Natives
stand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while Bill walks over to the
coffin. He places a BLACK ROSE in Vallon's folded hands.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Tomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square, into territory protected
by the Native Americans. You will be permitted undisputed passage both
ways. That is our tribute. After that, any Rabbits wishing to join the
Native Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed. All
others will be dispatched.
He starts out of the silent room, but STOPS when he sees Mank Eastman
looking at him with easy interest. Bill the Butcher
STARES him down, but Monk's gaze never wavers.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll expect you first.
MONK
Me? Oh, I don't know. All that talk of blood loyalty makes me quake. I'll
spill blood when the price is right. But blood for ceremony? I prefer holy
communion.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You saw us fight today. You know we can pay any price.
MONK
Not mine. Not now, and not any time after.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We'll see. Independence is a slippery thing. But being a rival ... well,
that's dead dangerous.
Bill brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the NATIVES.
Now the RABBITS file out, with Monk among them.
HAPPY JACK
Come on, boyo. I'll put you up tonight.
AMSTERDAM
I'll do for myself, Jack.
HAPPY JACK
You can't.
(Amsterdam stares at him)
There's no mistaking you're his son.
Happy Jack leaves Amsterdam alone in the room.
Now, by himself, sure of no one seeing, Amsterdam CRIES.
CUT TO
Mr. Cornelius is seated in his office, enjoying a late supper while
looking out his window at the bordello activity across the alley. A NOISE
at the door disturbs him: Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
What's the cost to bury my father proud and proper?
MR. CORNELIUS
For a plot, a headstone, hands to break the earth...
AMSTERDAM
How much?
MR. CORNELIUS
What are your current means?
Amsterdam turns out his pockets, which contain Bill the Butcher's pirate
knife as well as the cash Happy Jack pressed on him. Cornelius TAKES it
all.
MR. CORNELIUS
Of course you'll have to wait three days for a city permit. But all this
may do for part.
AMSTERDAM
No.
Amsterdam takes the knife back from Cornelius.
AMSTERDAM
That's owed another.
CUT TO
The largest, noisiest, gaudiest dive we have yet seen, full to bursting
with bawdy CUSTOMERS even at this late hour. Therels a long bar, where men
and women stand three deep; lots of small tables; a dance floor; and a
stage on which four blowsy DANCING GIRLS are giving out with a ribald
number titled "My Father's Teeth Were Plugged With Zinc."
One end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an
attached hose. BAR ATTENDANTS DUMP the unfinished contents of glasses into
the open barrel top as a line of FAR GONE DRUNKS wait their turn for the
hose. Maggie, Jenny's mother, is close to the front of the line, very
drunk, hanging on to a mush-faced HOODLUM.
Two VISITORS watch. One has a pad and makes quick SKETCHES.
VISITOR ONE
Ought to be served in a trough, properly. Will you try some?
ARTIST
Probably. What is it?
VISITOR ONE
All-Sorts. It's made of all that's poured and not drunk, and any they can
salvage that's spilt.
Maggie GRABS the hose, staring at the Artist as she takes a drink. His
hand moves quickly an the page, SKETCHING her.
VISITOR
(to Maggie)
Your health.
She SPITS at him, insulted. The Artist steps forward, puts some of the
All-Sorts from the hose into his glass, and toasts Maggie. She nods and
turns away....
...as Johnny enters, dragging a large SACK across the crowded floor toward
a far door.
CUT TO
Johnny RUSHES toward a wooden pen in the center of the room. There are
cries from the crowd of SPORTSMEN of "Hurry it up" and "More speed!"
Johnny dodges a kick or two before he finally arrives at the pen.
He UPENDS the sack over the pit and a dozen live RATS tumble out. A
GAMEMASTER slips Johnny a couple of cents as he starts his spiel.
GAMEMASTER
Alright, gents and ladies, your bets now on Towser against the vermin, the
count to beat is ten rodents in three minutes.
The crowd starts to place bets. A sleepy Johnny settles down close to
ringside to watch the show.
At a signal from the Gamemaster, a TRAINER tosses TOWSER--A fierce
mongrel--into the ring. The crowd cheers lustily, continuing to shout out
bets, as the dog goes after the rats.The rats, fighting for their lives,
bite the dog, attaching themselves to his body. Towser retaliates by
gnawing the rats, SNAPPING them in half and spitting them out.
As the CROWD cheers, and Towser kills, and money changes hands, Johnny
curls up and goes to sleep.
CUT TO
A row of cells, noisy and cold. The GUARD shoves Amsterdam into a cell.
GUARD 2
You get to live private until they come from the orphan's asylum. On
account of your tender years.
There is nothing in the cell but a board for a bed, and a window through
which Amsterdam can see the late winter moonlight. He looks for stars in
the sky, but can see none.
CUT TO
22 INT- MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY
Jenny Everdeane and a girl FRIEND, her own age, huddle together in a dark
corner of this huge space. The Friend opens her hand to show Jenny a
glimpse of what she's clutching: a penny.
JENNY
Let me see! I don't believe it.
FRIEND
(closing her hand)
No! It's a danger.
JENNY
Oh come on! It's not.
(Friend shakes her head)
Then tell me where you got it.
FRIEND
From some man. He took me in his carriage. He only wanted to do something
to me fast.
JENNY
What?
FRIEND
(shrugs)
I didn't understand.
JENNY
Would he do the same with me?
FRIEND
I won't tell you if he's around again.
(clutches penny tight)
He's my secret.
JENNY
Better keep it more careful, then.
The Friend GETS UP and starts across the Brewery floor, acting nonchalant.
But she looks around her, across the sleeping, passed-out bodies, past the
desperate families and their squalling infants, to see if she's been
noticed.
A man and two women cast a glance her way. She looks away, but the TRIO
keeps watching her... then FANS OUT and starts to FOLLOW her.
The Friend looks over her shoulder again. SEES the Man. Locks in another
direction, SEES: the woman. And then: the second woman. All closing on her.
The Friend starts to RUN. The Trio runs after her. And no one else pays
attention. The Friend PLUNGES into one of the warren of TUNNELS that lead
off the Brewery floor.
CAMERA plunges through the darkness, after her. Her footsteps ECHO; there
is the SOUND of stumbling, falling, an angry CURSE and a BLOW being
struck. The FRIEND picks herself up out of the darkness and keeps running,
CAMERA following down the dank halls.
Suddenly the TRIO runs AHEAD of the camera. There is a SCREAM. CAMERA
staps. And others SOUNDS follow quickly now: the dull THUD of a heavy
object against bone, REPEATED several times; and then, very soon after,
the most terrible sound of all: silence.
Then Two Women emerge from the darkness of the tunnel, fighting over the
penny. The Man, several steps behind them, throws an object to the dirt
floor: it's a STONE, and it is covered with blood. He comes up behind the
Two Women quickly and GRABS the penny from them with a hand that still
DRIPS blood and gore. They CHASE after him across the crowded Brewery
floor.
CUT TO
CAMERA races along the ornate corridor, past PORTRAITS of many affluent
and self-important GENTLEMEN... through a door and into...
... Tweed's domain. Small in size, but there are dozens of CAGES OF
CANARIES all around. Tweed looks up startled as the door flies open. The
birds set up a COMMOTION.
CAMERA bears down on Tweed as a pair of HANDS grabs him and hurls him
against the wall.
Bill The Butcher GLARES at Tweed. Some NATIVES come into the room behind
him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You come into the Five Points and you stole from me.
TWEED
I don't know...
BILL THE BUTCHER
You stole Vallon. He was my kill. My example, of my power. You took him
and made him yours.
TWEED
You're a lunatic to come here like...
In the background, same of the NATIVES have begun to play CATCH by
removing the CANARY CAGES from their places and tossing them all over the
room.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you. Just listen good. The Native Americans holds the Five Points.
We have prevailed. What you do outside the Points is your deciding.
Outside is your city. Inside the Points is mine. Anyone who says
different, or does different, or thinks different...
(smiles)
... theylll draw my unwelcame attention. You understand?
BOSS TWEED
I do understand, yes.
BILL pushes him away and starts out.
BOSS TWEED
But you don't understand at all.
Bill keeps walking.
BOSS TWEED
There's a whole city to share and all you see is your own narrow streets.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(turns now)
You just stay out of my place.
BOSS TWEED
Yes, alright. Gladly. It's all blackjack jobs and panel games and killings
for a fiver.
Bill waits for Tweed to continue. But Tweed stoops and tries to soothe a
canary in a cage.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It's good work.
BOSS TWEED
As far as it goes.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You wouldn't be talking to me otherwise.
BOSS TWEED
But we're talking about different things, Bill. You describe the present.
I see the possibilities. Look to the future. There is so much more.
The Butcher starts to look interested.
CUT TO
Later. The Natives have cleared out; only Tweed and the Butcher remain.
The cages have been restored to their proper places and the room has been
straightened. Bill stands beside the door, while Tweed relaxes in a chair.
BOSS TWEED
There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not even
an obedient one. There's contributions from every dive and brothel.
Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected.
BOSS TWEED (Cont'd)
And now you and your Natives have emerged as the foremost force in the
Five Points, I'm prepared to extend you an opportunity. You can work for
Tammany...
BILL THE BUTCHER
We work for no one.
BOSS TWEED
... beside Tammany... in the performance of these civic obligations. And
for a satisfactory... I'm prepared even to say equitable... financial
participation. It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers
might have recognized. But then, the founding fathers never imagined the
city New York has become.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle
work. Might build you up.
BOSS TWEED
We'd like to. I do miss it. But it's wiser for men in the public life to
give an appearance of probity.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Then get cops to do it.
BOSS TWEED
Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's
being broken.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Appearance means nothing.
BOSS TWEED
Perhaps not within the Points. But the smart man could go higher.
Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment. The he SHOVES himself away from the
wall, pulls away the chair on which Tweed has been resting his feet and
sits down close to him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
If you can talk plain, maybe we can do business.
Jenny's face, as she tries to sleep on a narrow, filthy mattress. Her
mother Maggie lies beside her, crowding her, THRASHING about in a
troubled, drunken sleep.
DISSOLVE TO
28 INT- ROOM/HIGH BRIDGE ORPHANS ASYLUM 2
Amsterdam, eyes wide, lying on a cot in the middle of a long room crowded
with KIDS - This place is a step or two up from the Brewery--but not a big
step. He stares at the ceiling, eyes grave, untroubled by the small cries
of loneliness and fear that come from some of the beds surrounding him. As
we move CLOSE on his EYES we...
DISSOLVE TO
A ramshackle room near the docks. It is part meeting hall, part living
quarters for the gang, and part clearing house forstolen goods. SHANG
presides over a boisterous meeting.
JIMMY SPOILS
You're as flat as Broadway going north. We can't run the river no more.
We're poaching the Natives and the Harbor cops are looking for us.
SHANG
The cops can go to blazes. Who cares about them?
SHEENY MIKE
Youlre all sand when it comes to cops, Shang. But do you have the sand to
go against the Natives?
SHANG
It ain't the time to go against the Natives. We've got to build first.
Then we go.
JIMMY SPOILS
If we go like we did in the river, all of us'll sink.
Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with
contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him.
AMSTERDAM
Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives?
JOHNNY
I don't know. He acts like it.
AMSTERDAM
If he only acts, held be better on the stage.
(looks away)
Like her.
His tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's
ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart.
Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang.
JOHNNY
Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the best bludget in the Points.
Jenny gives Shang silk scarfs, wallets and several purses from her coat.
AMSTERDAM
Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider?
JOHNNY
Yeah. But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses.
Jenny's haul is impressive. Shang picks a BRIGHT RED SILK SCARF with a
distinctive PAISLEY design from the pile of stolen goods. He examines it
with a shrewd, appreciative eye.
SHANG
That's the prize of the month. Spice Islands silk.
He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm
about Jenny in a proprietary way.
SHANG
You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam.
Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and
RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now.
SHANG
Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang. Morts more
than men, being morts.
AMSTERDAM
Yeah? And why is that?
SHANG
Because morts have more resources. Men can work only on their feet, but a
mort can turn out on her back.
AMSTERDAM
I mean, why give at all? Why don't they keep for themselves?
SHANG
If you think there's something off about my way of running things, you got
no place in this gang.
AMSTERDAM
I got no place anyway, and you got no gang. This ain't a gang, no matter
what you say. It's a mob.
There's a tense hush in the grubby room. Shang takes his arm from around
Jenny, wanting to be restrained.
JENNY
(smiling)
It's all your play now, Shang. Maybe you can set him right.
Jenny hands him a cane. Barely managing to hide his reluctance, he
starts--slowly--toward Amsterdam, who stands his ground. The gang steps
back to give them room in this tiny space. Shang pulls the cane apart:
it's a SWORD CANE, but Amsterdam shows no fear. He shifts his weight a
little, watching ... and they're interrupted by a...
VOICE (HAPPY JACK)
You boys settle with me before you settle each other.
They turn to him.
HAPPY JACK
I've come for my due and proper, Shang.
Happy Jack Mulraney (the Dead Rabbit gang member with the halfparalyzed
face) stands before them in a POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM-sparkling clean and
splendid--a leather helmet and long coat. In his hand, he twirls a
NIGHTSTICK.
SHANG
As agreed, then, Jack. Refreshment?
Shang OPENS the top of the gold-handled sword cane. Inside are large,
solid LUMPS of cocaine. Jack reaches for the choicest.
AMSTERDAM
Still smiling, are you?
HAPPY JACK
(sizing him up)
It's the young Vallon, is it? I hardly recognized you.
AMSTERDAM
I hardly knew you under that hat, Jack.
By now, Jack has taken not only the cocaine, and the money and swag Shang
offers, but several of the purses and wallets Jenny delivered. Jenny
stares at him with contempt, and he laughs, tossing one of the purses back
at her.
JACK
There. For your respect.
Jack turns to leave but a BRASH BOY blocks his way. Moving fast and fancy,
Jack bashes the Boy to the floor with his nightstick.
HAPPY JACK
Anybody else? Any number at all, come on.
Several of the gang make a move toward Jack, but Shang WAVES them back.
Jack departs UNHARMED, to general disgust. Jenny walks back across the
room to help the Brash Boy. Shang GLARES at Amsterdam, slides his sword
back into his cane and follows Jenny, trying to explain himself.
AMSTERDAM
Is that sand we've just seen?
JOHNNY
It's politics.
CUT TO
Echoing. Dank. Amsterdam holds a candle high for light. RATS skitter. He
crosses the main floor, enters one of the side tunnels.
CUT TO
A tiny room we recognize from the first scene: this is the place where
Amsterdam lived with his father. He crouches and TEARS UP some
floorboards, then quickly LOWERS HIMSELF into the hole.
CUT TO
A short tunnel under the Brewery floor, the kind a kid might make.
Amsterdam has trouble crawling through it. DIRT and ROCK sprinkle him
until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole; a battered leather
MONEY PURSE; and a PAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE.
Amsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of MONEY is
still there, then turns his attention to the package. He TEARS it open.
Inside is the PIRATE KNIFE that Bill the Butcher used to kill Amsterdam's
father.
Amsterdam handles the knife carefully as he opens it. The candle light
makes the blade GLEAMS.
CUT TO
Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehicle
that looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectators
back uptown from the hanging.
He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage.
Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, which
moves forward with a JOLT.
Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, about
to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as she
sits...
... and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on her
and she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled.
Amsterdam manages to get a little closer.
MAN
I hope you won't think me rude if I speak.
JENNY
No, sir. You look a proper Gentleman down to the ground.
As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in
conversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice what
Amsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on her
lap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap... toward The Man...
MAN
Well, I wouldn't want you to think me forward, you see.
... and BRUSHES past his jacket. He does not notice or feel a thing.
Jenny's hand GLIDES past his THIGH ... nearly brushing it ... moving up
across his pelvis and around his buttocks...
JENNY
Does it matter to you what I think?
MAN
Well, I might like it to.
JENNY
Oh.
...toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing and
continues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Every
silken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like a
CARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. As
she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing
Amsterdam
MAN
I mean, if you would like.
JENNY
I might like, sir. But I can't say now.
Her hand HOVERS above his pocket, waiting for the SWAY of the stage to
match and mask her movement....
MAN
Why?
... and she starts to get up as soon as the stage JOSTLES. The entire car
full of passengers LEANS into one another...
... and Jenny's hand SLIDES the Man's WALLET from his trousers as
he recovers his balance. Amsterdam watches her withdraw her HAND in a
flash and hide it beneath her wrap.
JENNY
Because this is my stop.
MAN
May I walk with you a little, then?
JENNY
(firmly)
That would be too bold.
MAN
But I'll never see you again.
JENNY
I come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father.
MAN
I'll look for you.
Jenny fetches him another fine SMILE--it's almost demure--and takes her
way off the rear entrance of the stage.
lt PULLS AWAY up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley.
CUT TO
A gentlemen's WALLET skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into
Shang's hand. Jenny is giving him her CUT. He opens the wallet, looks up
at Jenny. No more goods are forthcoming. Amsterdam, hanging back, watches
them both.
Shang SEES the RED SILK SCARF, tied around her neck.
SHANG
Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where'd you get that?
JENNY
From Amsterdam.
SHANG
(beat)
It don't suit you.
CUT TO
A low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the
Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played by
Orientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages from
the ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them and
JOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of
All-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around.
JACK
All right, step out, you yellow...
All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues;
nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling.
Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play.
AMSTERDAM
Hello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for.
JACK
Then you're marked for dead.
Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chair
across his path. Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick.
Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him, HITS him twice on the side of the
head. There is a CRACKING SOUND. The PATRONS of the Pagoda gather round.
CUT TO
Later. Festive again. And no sign of Amsterdam.
Two PATRONS step away from the all-sorts barrel. Hanging from the spigot
like the cat from the watch chain is the BODY of Happy Jack Mulraney. The
belt has been removed from his trousers, tied like a NOOSE around his
throat, then looped over the spigot. His TEETH lie scattered on the floor
around him. His NIGHT STICK has been jammed down his throat.
CUT TO
The main floor is jammed with CLUBMEN and PARTY RACKS. Daniel Killoran
bustles from group to group, making promises, taking notes and searching
out Boss Tweed, who is holding court in a far corner, surrounded by
JOURNALISTS.
BOSS TWEED
I would never speak ill of a rival. I would never say that every
Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my observation, however, that every
horse thief is a Know-Nothing.
Good-natured LAUGHING all around. Even TWEED seems amused. Killoran
catches the Boss' eye and whispers to him.
KILLORAN
The Know-Nothings are already finished, and there's four more hours at the
polls yet.
BOSS TWEED
Keep our men voting. Everybody works today. It's not a victory we need,
Daniel. I want a triumph.
CUT TO
Amsterdam roughly deposits REPEAT VOTERS in the barber chairs, as the
BARBERS work FRANTICALLY to cut their hair, prune beards, and otherwise
alter appearances. As soon as one customer is done, Sheeny Mike douses him
with bay rum and pushes another REPEATER down in his place. Johnny keeps
count of the turnover.
DON WHISKERANDOS (BARBER)
Now that's eight... and how many still to come ...
He looks toward the door, where more Repeaters are lined up, waiting their
turn under close supervision.
REPEATER
I already voted once today. Cast for Tammany, by God, and Fernando Wood.
AMSTERDAM
Once? Come here and do your duty.
Amsterdam GRABS him and SLAMS him down in a chair.
CUT TO
Amsterdam and some RABBITS BURST into the front door, frightening and
scattering all the Chinese GAMBLERS.
AMSTERDAM
(barking orders)
Line up like soldiers!
SHEENY MIKE
They got no notion what you're talking about.
AMSTERDAM
(To Johnny)
You explain their democratic right. Illl see they unterstand.
Amsterdam GRABS the nearest two CHINESE by their PIGTAILS and
HURLS them against the wall.
CUT TO
Amsterdam and the Rabbits PROWL the murky darkness where OPIUM EATERS lie
in bunks stacked high against the walls. The Rabbits start ROUSING and
rounding up the Opium Eaters. Jimmy Spoils SLINGS a couple over his
shoulder like flour sacks. Amsterdam SHOVES two more out the door, past an
admiring Daniel Killoran.
KILLORAN
(to Johnny)
I come to see if our counts square. You boys have made a remarkable
showing....
AMSTERDAM
Who the hell's this?
JOHNNY
He's our Tammany man.
Killoran compares his figures to the piece of paper where Johnny has been
keeping his own count.
KILLORAN
... remarkable...
AMSTERDAM
(With an edge)
Our own Tammany man. We are coming along. Happy to meet any friend of
Johnny Siroccols.
KILLORAN
Likewise. Pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole Five Points.
AMSTERDAM
Best but one? Who's better?
Killoran looks up. Johnny, standing behind Amsterdam, SHAKES his head "NO"
VIGOROUSLY. Killoran gets the message.
KILLORAN
(smooth)
Maybe nobody. But when the count's done the numbers will tell who's come
out in front.
AMSTERDAM
I'm in no race. Just pay us what you owe.
KILLORAN
Tonight. At the victory celebration.
CUT TO
A Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam
confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammed
to bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES,
HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of them
off duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING,
GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We START
CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR...
BOSS TWEED
(V.O.)
Read what it says there, alongside the ruby...read it out ...
... and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription.
64 CONTINUED:
WELL-WISHER
"Fortuna Juvat Ordentes."
TWEED
A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany. Now, tell 'em what it means,
Mayor Wood.
WOOD
"Fortune favors the bold."
TWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back.
BOSS TWEED
What do you think? Would that make a fit motto for our fair City?
WOOD
Well, I could certainly see ...
KILLORAN
(interrupting)
We've got a motto.
BOSS TWEED
what is it?
(no one knows)
Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new City
hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor,
you'll make sure the Latin's right?
As Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room...
... past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where the
women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture
of trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to try
and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA...
... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange
MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by
CHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They
perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The
music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST...
... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce
animation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing
beside them seem like tourists.
Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER.
Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER
PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an
elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing
their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to
WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST...
... until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the
Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER.
BOUNCER
I don't know you, you don't enter.
AMSTERDAM
(enjoying himself)
Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us
tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.
JOHNNY
(more temperate)
Daniel Killoran knows us.
BOUNCER
Oh he does?
JOHNNY
We work for him.
AMSTERDAM
The hell we do.
JOHNNY
(to Amsterdam)
Tampen down, will you?
BOUNCER
Why don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story? Go on!
He SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now,
and they step forward together toward the Bouncer...
... until Killoran intervenes.
KILLORAN
(to Bouncer)
It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's work
for a good wage.
Killoran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes
firmly.
KILLORAN
A fine first showing. But second best.
AMSTERDAM
Second, eh? You don't say so.
KILLORAN
It's no shame to be bested by veterans. The Native Americans always sweep
the field.
AMSTERDAM
What?
KILLORAN
We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday.
AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny, glaring)
Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?
JOHNNY
No, I didn't have no idea ...
AMSTERDAM
I was working the same side as the Natives? The Natives?
KILLORAN
That's only right. Bill the Butcher's our ambassador throughout the
Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone
knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone ...
AMSTERDAM
I sure as hell don't fear him. And I sure as hell won't stand with him, or
any who calls him one of theirs.
KILLORAN
Well, if it's matter of personal honor, the money can only be a further
insult. I have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me...
He REACHES to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam BATS his hand
away.
AMSTERDAM
Where is he? Where's Bill the Butcher?
KILLORAN
Listen, buck. This is a Tammany night. If you and Bill Poole have matters
to settle, you can do it any other time, any other place, I don't give a
good dancing goddamn. But you do it here tonight and all the Five Points
will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven. or you could, as
the Book says, put away childish things. Join the celebration. Personally,
I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing. Don't you?
Amsterdam stares at him as we...
CUT TO
As a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air, off the stage, and lands in the
middle of the audience. The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobat
does GYMNASTIC MOVES among them...
... past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled. it is later in the
evening, and everyone has been drinking.
Amsterdam, sullen, intense, WATCHES ...
..Bill the Butcher, across the room. He is like a prince regent. Everyone
pays him court, including several uniformed COPS, TAMMANY HANGERS-ON, and
NEWSPAPERMEN. Bill receives the attention as his due....
... while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in his
eye. He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny. Johnny
takes advantage of the situation.
JOHNNY
I got experience. It's the education I lack.
JENNY
And you heard I was a good teacher?
JOHNNY
I don't listen to talk, I figure for myself. And I figured you'd be good
at everything you did.
JENNY
That's right.
JOHNNY
And tonight I got the ned.
JENNY
And now what?
JOHNNY
Now I'm ready for you. Unless there's an arrangement between you and
Amsterdam.
JENNY
(glancing over at Amsterdam)
Not to my thinking.
JOHNNY
(needs to be sure)
Amsterdam... listen up, Amsterdam...
Amsterdam glances over at them.
JENNY
(to Johnny)
You going with me or him? It's my thinking matters here. You don't have to
ask him nothing.
AMSTERDAM
What?
JOHNNY
(makes his decision)
How's the evening passing?
AMSTERDAM
Fine. Why?
JOHNNY
(puts his arm around Jenny)
'Cause it's treating me fine too.
She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnny
following her, holding her hand. As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS toward
Jenny.
AMSTERDAM
This is no game, you and me. Don't go on like it's a game.
JENNY
I said already, it's not a game. It's business.
Johnny pulls her away. As he watches her go through the crowd, Amsterdam's
gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again...
... and for the first tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam,
take him all in... but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACK
steps up to pay court....
.... and a MASTER OF REVELS, center-floor, SHOUTS ...
MASTER OF REVELS
Gentlemen and gentlewomen, if you please ... we will now... raise the
cages and start the bidding!
The Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to RAISE
the CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with the
second-floor gallery of the Pagoda. WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even as
the cages rise through the air. Depending on their age, the Women and
children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation,
trepidation or fear. A few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensible
in their impossibly cramped space.
Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she
spots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside. Johnny CLOSES the door
behind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE...
... rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the dead
center of the room. He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a FLUNKY.
He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with all
his butcher's implements.
The place QUIETS. KIDS swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a huge
wooden CHANDELIER, LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES. Only the noise from
the Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now.
The Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED toward
the Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT and
SHADOW as The Butcher prepares himself.
Now the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill. He NODS.
The unsprung MUSIC begins. The DANCER starts to move, sinuously...
...and Bill, with amazing skill, starts THROWING his KNIVES. The knife
MISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot.
She doesn't flinch. She keeps dancing. And Bill keeps THROWING...
... the KNIVES, which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful,
deadly choreography. They land just inches from where she has just been,
or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar;
the barrel of all-sorts. After each knife LANDS, kids retrieve it. When
one of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, DRUNKS
knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole.
Native Americans, meanwhile, WORK THROUGH the awed, attentive Crowd. They
AVOID Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too
sober. But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN, they GRAB his
hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes.
Center floor, Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out, BALANCES one in each hand ...
... as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a couple
of Natives. Hels wearing a large RING. As soon as the Natives SEE the ring
they throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and escort
him to Bill ...
... who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer. They land on the floor,
inches from her dancing feet. She SPINS AWAY to great applause as the
Natives bring the Groper to Bill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Evening, sir. Are you prepared to be celebrated? Are you ready to be
famous?
GROPER
How much will it cost?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Just a moment of your time. My men will assist you.
They do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him to
the floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion.
PAGODA SPECTATOR
Watch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum.
The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED.
Bill has one weapon left... in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his
CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment.
The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The
only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the
Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver.
Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing,
figures distance .... and starts THROWING it in the air...
... CATCHING it by the handle ... then throwing it again... higher, FASTER
and HARDER with every toss.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(in full control)
What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet.
The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH...
... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it and
every time he catches it by its handle ...
... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now... standing
very close... he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ...
... sending it SPINNING high in the air... up past the cages ... past the
second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators ... until it
SLOWS ... seems to HANG in the air... then starts its descent...
... FALLING FASTER... towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND.
The Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand out
until ... just as smoothly, just as confidently...
... he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact on
the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. The
Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat.
One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand.
Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer.
BILL THE BUTCHER
There's for your beauty and your song.
The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES the
hand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuring
compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the
Butcher's implements.
Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd and
FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand.
The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper's
unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like a
wave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on them
as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable
sacrament.
Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is
about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others.
AMSTERDAM
Mr. Poole!
Bill turns, searching out the voice ...
AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole!
And SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm,
smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic.
AMSTERDAM
My compliments on your exhibition, sir.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you, sir.
AMSTERDAM
It was like watching a dance.
(Bill nods his thanks)
Some great grand goddamned dance. (Bill looks at him more closely)
You know me, sir.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Do I? Are you missing a finger?
Appreciative laughter from the crowd.
AMSTERDAM
No. A father.
The laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger
man.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Do you have a name?
AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
That's a New York name.
(suddenly smiles)
shall we drink to it?
AMSTERDAM
Indeed.
(they drink)
And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Priest Vallon's son?
(Amsterdam nods)
Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man.
AMSTERDAM
Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth what
they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you.
DEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at their
fan-tan ignore this confrontation.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you want, boyo?
AMSTERDAM
I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father.
Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill
his father almost 12 years before.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport.
Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch.
And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his hand
like lightning.
And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses
flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD...
... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table
at Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING.
Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the
Butcher...
... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each
other...
... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action
and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam.
And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he
doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks
the Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time
... and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers.
And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still
arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor
below, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHES
her go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny to
the main floor.
The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with
the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN.
In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike.
JENNY
The Butcher'll kill him if we don't do something.
SHEENY MIKE
It was Amsterdam's own doing. And it'll be our death too if we try to stop
it.
JOHNNY
(finally catching up)
That's the truth.
JENNY
The truth is you don't give a damn about him.
SHEENY MIKE
Yeah, well, if he gave a damn about us he wouldn't have called out the
Butcher in the first place.
Jenny looks at him with contempt, then STARTS into the crowd. Johnny grabs
her ARM but she pushes him off.
On the floor, Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the barely
conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face... then on the other...
REPEATEDLY... until Amsterdam is barely sensible. Bill grabs him by the
hair. Amsterdam's body is slack.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you say? Loin or shank? Rib or chop?
The Crowd YELLS their choices. Jenny tries to PLUNGE through toward
Amsterdam, but a HALF-DOZEN MORTS and WHORES put hands on her and HOLD her
back.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Come on, let me hear you!
(the Crowd yells louder)
You're all talking at once, I can't hear you!
(a near frenzy)
I don't hear the choicest cut! The best, the vital!
(they quiet a little to listen)
The heart. I think I must have the heart!
This is greeted with the biggest CHEER of the night. The newlyelected
Mayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the
slaughter, but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive GESTURE. Even
the Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Come on, look at it! You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator!
(raises his cleaver)
Watch the death blow when it comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!
Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow... and a HAND GRABS
his wrist, STOPPING his arm.
Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher? Bill turns, incredulous, to
look into...
... the untroubled face of Monk Eastman.
MONK EASTMAN
It's been a full evening's fun now, Butcher. It's enough.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You got nothing to do with this, Monk.
MONK EASTMKN
Well I'm the game warden, you might say. I'm telling you this buck's too
young yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
The hell.
With his gigantic strength, Monk actually PULLS the Butcher off Amsterdam
and onto his feet.
MONK EASTMKN
Just settle yourself Bill ...
... and he part SHOVES, part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet.
MONK EASTMKN
... and let the merrymaking continue.
The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam up
off the floor. Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam by
an arm.
MONK EASTMAN
It was his father took me in first, and it's thanks I'm returning now.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Eastman!
MONK EASTMAN
(ignoring Bill)
This squares any debt. Get him out of here.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Monk Eastman!
As the Rabbits CARRY Amsterdam toward the door, Monk finally turns his
attention back to Bill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll have you then!
MONK EASTMAN
Come ahead, Bill. Unless you're wanting to shout me to death.
And Bill comes forward, BRANDISHING his cleaver. Monk Eastman stands his
ground, unmoving, untroubled. Everyone looks on in awe at this contest ...
... except Boss Tweed.
BOSS TWEED
(to Killoran)
If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion. And
more rewarding for all.
Tweed SIGNALS to Bill: STOP. The Butcher sees the signal but can't believe
it. He SHAKES his head. His blood is up. He won't stop.
Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN. Bill KEEPS COMING.
Tweed signals Killoran, who STANDS himself. And, when he stands, every COP
and TAMMANY LOYALIST in the place--a hundred of them anyway--STAND behind
Boss Tweed.
As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting...
... the Natives and their ALLIES now stand, facing the Tammany crew. The
Tammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savage
Five Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, so
different in style and so similar in purpose, SIZE EACH OTHER UP from
opposite sides of the room.
Bill STOPS. The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing. Even the
Chinese STOP GAMBLING. For the first time all evening the room is
absolutely STILL. Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to see
what will happen.
Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES: neither blinks. Then after a moment ... a
very long moment ... a calm, bemused Tweed RAISES his glass.
BOSS TWEED
I only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today... and
an equally bright future for us both.
Another pause. Bill does not look placated. The whole place seems ready to
explode...
... until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet, and RAISES his glass higher.
BOSS TWEED
Will you drink with me, Bill, as a friend? An honored friend.
Bill weighs the proposition... then looks to his men, NODS his head to
call them off. He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast.
The MUSIC begins again. The gambling recommences. Patrons take their
seats. The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door.
Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher.
MONK EASTMAN
If there's one thing I can't abide, it's fighting for free.
He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, DRINKS
DEEP and hands it back to him.
At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Ansterdam starts FLAILING and
fighting by brute instinct. He HITS Jenny, and she goes down. Johnny
grapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help SUBDUE
Amsterdam.
JENNY
Go easy! Go easy. It's over.
JOHNNY
He knew what he was doing, hitting you.
JENNY
Let's get him up.
She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back
to his feet.
JENNY
(Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face)
Therels too damn little of him left to know anything.
They start across Paradise Square, holding him up...
... as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them... all growing
smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the
Five Points...
... and the Bouncer CLOSES the door.
DISSOLVE TO
Another DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so
has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face
still shows the marks of Bill's beating.
Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor,
giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't
even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos
says ....
DON WHISKERANDOS
Someone's here for you.
MONK EASTMAN
That so? What's he look like?
DON WHISKERANDOS
He looks pretty damned sorry.
MONK EASTMAN
(looks at Amsterdam)
Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?
AMSTERDAM
No thanks.
MONK EASTMAN
Face is too sore, eh? I understand.
AMSTERDAM
No. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden.
MONK EASTMAN
We're all even, son. There's nothing more between us.
AMSTERDAM
I'd like it if there was.
MONK EASTMAN
Are you proposing employment?
AMSTERDAM
A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make another
move. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we can
learn from you.
MONK EASTMAN
Boyo, I'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher. I can't learn
nothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either.
AMSTERDAM
The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign over
the Points.
MONK EASTMAN
And Bill Poole's Natives? What will they have to say?
AMSTERDAM
Nothing. They won't have tongues left to speak.
MONK EASTMAN
Don't worry about what theylll have in their mouths. You think about what
they got in their hands.
(beat)
Listen, son... take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your
father. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Anger
spoils an edge.
AMSTERDAM
Then you say no?
Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor
above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like
NOTCHES-
MONK EASTMAN
You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fifty
cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight more
notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodate
you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it on
your own.
AMSTERDAM
Everything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then.
MONK EASTMAN
Fair enough. You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing.
Although I do hold money preferable to all.
(Amsterdam turns to leave)
But I'm sure we'll have news of each other.
AMSTERDAM
Bound to.
As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don
Whiskerandos for another hot towel.
CUT TO
... the incredulous face of Monk Eastman, as he looks at Bill the Butcher.
MONK EASTMAN
And this is your offer?
BILL THE BUTCHER
It's Boss Tweedls offer.
MONK EASTMAN
How do you think we'd sit as allies, Bill?
BILL THE BUTCHER
The only way we could tolerate being near each other would be stretched
out dead.
MONK EASTMAN
My thoughts exactly. Then why are you here? Because you were asked to be.
You were ordered to be. And who would order me among the Natives? You? And
would you follow my orders, even if they was being relayed from William
Marcy Tweed himself?
He EASES himself out of the barber chair. The Butcher TENSES as Monk comes
toward him.
MONK EASTMAN
Dubious and doubtful, my friend. But your offer--pardon, the offer you
bring--is the most generous that's ever been extended. I favor the terms,
if not the personalities. So let us decide the way any Native American
would appreciate. We'll do it the democratic way.
He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there, beside Bill
the Butcher, his arm thrown carelessly around him. PASSERSBY stop in
wonderment as Monk ADDRESSES them.
MONK EASTMAN
Citizens of the Five Points! It seems the Native Americans have come to
trouble. They have grown so weak that now they seek my help. They can pay
any wage I ask. But I ask you now. Even for money, should I carouse and
conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittle
on his chin every time his cock gets hard?
Monk is beaming, the Butcher is appalled. His body tenses like a snake
ready to spring. But the people in the street just STARE- They can't
believe what they've just heard.
MONK EASTMAN
(to Bill)
There. You see. I'm afraid the people have spoken.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll see you again, you bog Irish bastard.
MONK EASTMAN
Well, if it's a fight you want now, Bill, remember to come back with a
bankroll.
Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair. Bill GLARES at the
people in the street. One lock from him starts them moving fast. But they
do not look away from him quite so fast, or at him, either, with quite the
same fear.
CUT TO
The vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated for
the evening. An altar has been hung with bunting; SHIP'S LANTERNS and
CANDLES illuminate the place. The REVEREND SHADRACH RALEIGH GREETS
everyone. The room, already crowded with CELEBRANTS of all ages, grows
quiet as the Dead Rabbits, done up in their party best, show up for the
revelry.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Ah, the Native Americans, is it now?
AMSTERDAM
Are they coming?
JENNY
We don't want a ruckus, minister.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Nor do I. I intended no disrespect. I'd heard the Native Americans were
figures of the greatest prominence here.
AMSTERDAM
Indeed they are, just for the moment. Let them come. Happy to have them.
Everyone's welcome in a house of God, isn't that right, Reverend?
REVEREND RALEIGH
As all are welcome in heaven.
SHEENY MIKE
Ild like to go to heaven. Ild like to go to heaven and bite off Gabriells
ear.
REVEREND RALEIGH
You're still welcome, even with such peculiar appetites.
AMSTERDAM
But if the Natives do come, Father...
REVEREND RALEIGH
I'm not a priest, son ...
AMSTERDAM
... there's no accounting for what may follow.
REVEREND RALEIGH
I'm sure God's hand will guide us in that. Just as He guided you here at
the right perfect time, with a right perfect regent. The young lady with
the sunset hair. Miss ...
JENNY
Everdeane. Jenny Everdeane.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Miss Everdeane. Step forward, please.
Radiant and curious, Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of the
room.
REVEREND RALEIGH
And the evening's regent chooses her evening's partner.
There is much MUTTERING about this from everyone. Someone makes a wet,
farting SOUND.
REVERAND RALEIGH
(unfazed)
Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord.
Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS, the Women
skeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arranged
into a LINE. The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chair
that has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room. Jenny sits
down, facing away from the rest of the guests. She holds a MIRROR in her
hand.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Now. The men, please. One by one.
The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant Sheeny
Mike. There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of the
room, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected in
the mirror. She SHAKES her head.
REVEREND RALEIGH
Next Gentleman, please.
More laughing. The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE. Rejected.
Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each
with the composure of a princess.
Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands
behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's
tense... until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head.
Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he
walks back to the GANG.
Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes
fixed on Jenny.
Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her
head. Yes. Him.
A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out
her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other
COUPLES join them.
AMSTERDAM
So you accept?
JENNY
What?
AMSTERDAM
You accept to be my mort and no one else's.
JENNY
(teasing)
No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got
some of the face the Butcher gave you.
AMSTERDAM
(going along with the joke)
It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around.
JENNY
Maybe you'll look better later.
The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributing
LIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around the
floor.
AMSTERDAM
I will if we're together later.
(she smiles)
And what about after that? After tonight?
JENNY
I chose you just for tonight. If that's not good enough I'll go with
someone else.
She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light FLICKERS on
Amsterdam's face.
AMSTERDAM
I'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you're
ready. No more.
His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny
NODS and they DANCE AWAY ...
... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding
candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study
in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF
YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet.
CUT TO
70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT
In the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door.
JOHNNY
(whispering)
Amsterdam.
(louder; hissing)
Amsterdam!
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
Who is it?
JOHNNY
Me.
AMSTERDAM
Come on in.
JOHNNY
I don't want to come in! You come out.
AMSTERDAM
Just a damn minute.
AMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleep
on the floor inside.
AMSTERDAM
What do you want?
CUT TO
As Don Whiskerandos' hand, holding a razor, travels over the great plains
of Monk Eastman's face. His hand is shaking.
MONK EASTMAN
What's the trouble, Don?
DON WHISKERANDOS
There's someone here.
Monk bestirs himself in the chair, SEES: Bill the Butcher, standing in the
doorway.
MONK EASTMAN
It's just a man of commerce.
Monk settles back in the chair as Bill the Butcher walks into the shop.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You're right enough this time, Monk.
(to Don Whiskerandos)
Go ahead.
(the barber hesitates)
Go on with your work. I'll finish my business.
Don Whiskerandos picks up a pair of SCISSORS and NERVOUSLY starts to TRIM
Monk's hair.
MONK EASTMAN
Come out with it then.
Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified. Bill
nods again, almost vehemently. Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head. Bill
GLARES at him. The Barber takes a STEP BACK. Monk opens his eyes, starts
to size up the situation.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You damn craven, do it!
Bill LEAPS forward, grabs the trembling barber's arm and pushes it toward
MONK...
MONK EASTMAN
(rising from his chair)
What the hell...
...and the scissors, held by Don Whiskerandos and pushed by Bill the
Butcher, meet Monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair. The long
scissor BLADE SINKS into Monkls right eye.
MONK BELLOWS, staggers toward Don Whiskerandos, who shrinks against the
wall. The scissor protrudes from Monk's eye as he RAGES, blinded by blood,
now reaching out for the Butcher
BILL THE BUTCHER
Your eyes was open for that alright. And you still got one to see this.
Bill the Butcher reaches above him for Monk's war club, which hangs on the
wall. He grabs tight hold of it and, with Monk nearly upon him, swings it
viciously at Monk's head. The BLOW sends the scissor FLYING out of Monk's
eye, with the eyeball still attached. It also SMASHES in the side of
Monk's face. He FALLS, still GRABBING desperately for the Butcher...
... who now stands over him, beating him incessantly with the war club.
CAVING his head in. KILLING him.
Don Whiskerandos looks at Bill in a virtual paralysis of terror. The
Butcher lets the CLUB FALL, reaches in his pocket and throws some MONEY at
the barber.
BILL THE BUTCHER
If I was you I'd use that to open in a new location. Consider St. Louis.
The enormity of what he's done is beginning to sink in. He turns to leave
the shop ... but STOPS in the doorway.
Outside, CITIZENS of the Points are staring at the fallen Monk in mute
wonder. They have just witnessed a moment in history.
Bill the Butcher surveys them all silently, then calls out to Don
Whiskerandos.
BILL THE BUTCHER
The war club.
The barber steels himself to CARRY the bloody club to the Butcher, who
hefts it slowly in his hands, in view of all.
He takes a knife from his vest, and CUTS the LAST NOTCH in the club. Then,
slowly...
... he steps down into the crowd, which PARTS before him. He
walks among them in regal splendor, the war club at his side, dripping
gore.
As the crowd falls back, Bill spots Amsterdam, Johnny and some of the
other Dead Rabbits, watching his every mave. He STOPS.
HOLDS OUT the bloody war club in front of him... straight in front of
him... POINTING IT right at Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I promise you, Amsterdam. I promise you.
Then he grins, turns away and walks through the crowd: prince of all he
surveys.
CUT TO
Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a
long table overburdened with food. Seated along both sides of the table is
an array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his Tammany
MINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture
of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn,
enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS who
flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of
amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization.
Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor of
the influential Tribune.
GREELEY
I may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your company,
Mr. Tweed ...
BOSS TWEED
And the pleasures of the company provided you, Mr. Greeley.
GREELEY
...without the Tribune endorsing your politics.
BOSS TWEED
I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other.
Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart.
Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly,
discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS
across the restaurant floor...
... past the Band and the Dancing Giris ...
... to the swinging doors of the kitchen. As he pushes open the SWINGING
DOOR, his face has lost its humor.
CUT TO
A madhouse of activity. WAITERS in black suits, vests and serving outfits
STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works
double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume.
As Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted poultry
off a tray as it's carried out the door.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm not good enough for your table, so I eat where I can. (takes a big
bite)
It's good, what is it?
BOSS TWEED
Pheasant.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Is that like pigeon? I killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste nothing
like this.
BOSS TWEED
You killed a bull this morning. I told you to make an Arrangement with
him, and you come back with his blood on your hands.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(chewing his food)
He insulted me. He aggravated me. I couldn't stand for that, for no one.
BOSS TWEED
You stand for anything if I tell you.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes when
you talk.
As they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are
constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of
WAITERS.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you
ain't earned it.
BOSS TWEED
What did you earn us, killing Monk?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Where'd you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust in
the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got
muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior.
BOSS TWEED
I see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book,
"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out." I followed that law with my own
knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And
when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he
let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both
eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart.
When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman
over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.
BOSS TWEED
(measured, conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill. That's
how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to
plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing
else. But Bill, I'm only saying... I'm counselinm... look in the distance.
You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who the
host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners.
Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Howls these manners?
BOSS TWEED
Fine, if you're hungry.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm always hungry.
BOSS TWEED
I've always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us
together than separate. We'll dine together sometime.
Bill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through
the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way. Boss Tweed watches
him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage.
CUT TO
Later. Everyone's gone except some WAITERS, cleaning up, and Boss Tweed
and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table. Leftover
plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he
PICKS from them.
BOSS TWEED
Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the single
most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--who is
there to take his place?
(as Killoran starts to answer)
Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be
killed, but he must be checked.
KILLARAN
It could be a police matter.
BOSS TWEED
Impossible! Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher
have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that can
be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it must
come from within the Points, not without.
KILLORAN
The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections. That Amsterdam boy has
sand.
BOSS TWEED
That so? The last time I saw him he was under the Butcher's knife looking
like a fine filet. Who else is there?
KILLORAN
Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point. There's
Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none
that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither.
BOSS TWEED
What would that be?
KILLORAN
The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher. He's sworn revenge
for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it forward.
He'll have the skill and power soon enough.
BOSS TWEED
Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring them along, then. Nurture the
Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where they like.
KILLORAN
And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues?
BOSS TWEED
I'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use.
They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied.
KILLORAN
Bill's got to be a lot more than occupied.
BOSS TWEED
I'll hold Bill in check. If he becomes unwieldy ... well, damn it all,
Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of
that, eh?
Boss Tweed gets up from the table. A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights,
filling the room with deep shadows.
KILLORAN
It'd be gratifying, Mr. Tweed. Even edifying.
BOSS TWEED
But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn't have that.
(as he walks away)
I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some of that food
for the canaries.
CUT TO
The midday sun shining through the windows makes the place look tatty and
slightly desperate: this is a place that needs low light and long shadows
to look good.
Amsterdam and Johnny are at a long bar, talking to Mother Joyce, a beefy,
wised-up woman with pornographic tattoos an both forearms.
MOTHER JOYCE
This place is so clean it's the next thing to chaste. And safe as a
convent, too.
AMSTERDAM
From the Natives, maybe. But not from us.
MOTHER JOYCE
You're saying I got to worry about your mob too?
JOHNNY
No worries at all. You throw in with the Dead Rabbits and we'll worry
about the Natives.
Across the room, Jenny is sitting talking to a few of the WHORES, one of
whom is a mixed-blood Eurasian with long black hair named Emma Loss. She
gets up lazily and heads for the bar. As she passes a DRUNK, he reaches
out to grab her. She's used to this, and she knocks his hand away. He
keeps after her.
At the bar, Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled, but pays no
attention: her girls can take care of themselves.
MOTHER JOYCE
(to Amsterdam and Johnny)
And if someone else comes along, do I pay them too?
AMSTERDAM
You only pay us. We see you safe from everyone.
Johnny has been watching the drunk bothering Emma Loss. Without saying
anything to Amsterdam or Mother Joyce, Johnny LEAVES the bar, walks over
to the drunk and SHOVES him away.
JOHNNY
Leave off her. She don't want you. Not even if you could pay her.
EMMA LOSS
Hey, just a minute.
JOHNNY
(to Emma)
He can't pay. I can pay.
AMSTERDAM
(watching this)
Maybe I should offer Johnny as a bouncer for your busy nights.
MOTHER JOYCE
(laughs)
A bouncer! I don't know if he could bounce on a feather bed. He wants to
be a character like you, is that it?
AMSTERDAM
He's got his own ideas. Too full of Tammany, maybe, but he's a fast friend.
Across the room, Johnny is talking to Emma Loss. She NODS and starts to
LEAD him upstairs.
MOTHER JOYCE
But in my trade you go on your instincts. My instincts says to heed you,
and my memory of your father says I'm right. We'll shake on it.
(Amsterdam grabs her hand)
And have one of my best to seal the bargain. Megs!
A lanky blonde, seated across the room near Jenny, bestirs herself.
MOTHER JOYCE
Come here and show my new friend why we're worth special care.
Jenny watches MEGS move toward Amsterdam.
CUT TO
Big enough to contain a half-gutted mattress supported by a rickety bed,
some worn sheets and a few GUTTERING CANDLES.
Johnny undresses as Emma sits on the bed and starts to take off her dress.
JOHNNY
You liked that old man? You would have gone with him?
EMMA LOSS
I like anyone that pays, that's all.
JOHNNY
Tell me what he wanted you to do.
EMMA LOSS
He mostly wanted comforting.
JOHNNY
I never seen hair so black. Can you take the pins out?
EMMA LOSS
It takes so long to do back up.
He sits beside her and starts slowly, almost tenderly, to remove the pins.
79 CONTINUED:
JOHNNY
Did your mother have the same color?
I don't know.
JOHNNY
(as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders)
Lie back, I want to look at you.
(his eyes glide along her body)
What's that mark?
EMMA LOSS
I always had it.
JOHNNY
(touching her lightly)
And there? Is that a scar?
EMMA LOSS
(she looks at her naked belly)
There was a baby. They cut it out.
JOHNNY
And that on your shoulder? That looks old.
EMMA LOSS
Yeah, I got that when I ...
JOHNNY
(interrupting, quiet)
I don't want to know when. Don't tell me about before or what you used to
be, I don't want that.
EMMA LOSS
What about your scars. Do you have scars?
JOHNNY
None I ever seen. Maybe you can find them.
Her hands and mouth cover his body. He closes his eyes.
CUT TO
Another room. Amsterdam and Megs are undressing each other when Jenny
walks in.
AMSTERDAM
Go on. I can see you later.
Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny.
JENNY
What are you doing?
AMSTERDAM
I couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered. It's in the interests of
business. You understand business.
JENNY
Sure I do. But there's something else I still don't understand. At
Sparrow's Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was me?
AMSTERDAM
Yeah. I did.
She HITS him. In the face. Hard. Not a slap. A solid PUNCH. His nose
starts to gush blood. He puts his arm under it to staunch the flow,
keeping his eyes an her.
JENNY
Meantime's over.
AMSTERDAM
Oh fine. That's fine. I'd be celebrating but I'm losing too much blood.
Jenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his
nose.
JENNY
Put your head back.
AMSTERDAM
That don't work.
JENNY
Put your head back I said.
AMSTERDAM
(as she tends to him)
So why so sudden, then?
JENNY
Sudden? Every day I see you and you complain I can't decide. Now I decide,
you say it's sudden.
AMSTERDAM
It's the whore did it, then.
JENNY
Don't flatter yourself.
AMSTERDAM
It's because you're jealous.
JENNY
It's because you didn't lie about hitting me.
AMSTERDAM
Christ, I wish I had. Come here, then.
He reaches to pull her down on the bed.
JENNY
Not here. There's too much past.
CUT TO
The room where Johnny fetched Amsterdam out for the fight. Amsterdam and
Jenny have just made love.
JENNY
It must be morning.
AMSTERDAM
I don't care, I'm not getting up.
JENNY
This is what you meant, then? It's going to be just the same from now on?
AMSTERDAM
What?
JENNY
Every morning I wake up next to you.
AMSTERDAM
Or you don't wake up at all.
JENNY
We only just started in and you're already threatening me.
AMSTERDAM
It's not a threat.
(no teasing now)
It's a declaration of love.
JENNY
I prefer my kind. This kind.
She reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine DIAMOND RING, which
she slips on his finger. Amsterdam reacts with surprise, gratitude and (of
course) suspicion.
AMSTERDAM
What's this? Where'd you get this?
JENNY
You said I was the best thief in the Five Points. But I got
restless. Will you wear something I got?
CUT TO
82 EXT- UPTOWN STREET DAY
A long street of tree-shaded houses. Spacious lawns. North of the Five
Points. Considerably north. This is the first time we have been outside
the Five Points and Paradise Square. The city
rent place.
Jenny and Amsterdam stand near a residence at the end of the street.
Amsterdam, dressed in a suit, can't quite conceal his wonder as he stands
staring at the house.
AMSTERDAM
What is this place?
JENNY
My jeweler's.
She GESTURES for him to follow her and we see now that she is dressed in a
maid's outfit.
JENNY
Come on.
AMSTERDAM
I don't see nobody.
JENNY
That's the best time. They're all having lunch.
CUT TO
As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel. The place is like a
weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals,
of the two- and four-legged variety.
JENNY
These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from
there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the
mission. Pass me the candle.
Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to
see...
... that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation
of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a
better world--or worse. Trophies from many gangs--including the bones and
skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as
if this were a catacomb in Palermo.
Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several
PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of
slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible,
is the name "Maggie Everdeane."
JENNY
We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to
the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought her
back here. Dug this myself.
(beat)
Families. Give here what I gave you.
Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of
Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside
is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING
with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's
grave.
JENNY
She'll keep an eye on this for us. How about some help?
He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones.
AMSTERDAM
You trusting me with your treasure, then?
JENNY
Just take another look at it to remind you. I can always do fine on my own.
Amsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto
Jenny's dirt-covered finger. She KISSES him.
JENNY
What's mine is yours, is that it?
AMSTERDAM
I could use this, too.
From the bag he holds up a small GOLD CROSS.
JENNY
You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh?
Amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to
dig again.
AMSTERDAM
Are you sure we can trust your mother?
CUT TO
BOSS TWEED listens to an angry BILL THE BUTCHER as they walk briskly down
a long marble corridor lined with formal portraits of former Tammany
worthies.
BOSS TWEED
The building and how many?
BILL THE BUTCHER
A dozen at least of my Natives.
BOSS TWEED
The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch alright.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I want at them. All of them, and Amsterdam especial. Now.
BOSS TWEED
Not just now. It's between too late and too soon. They've become a little
too prominent for comfort, but they're still too small for you to soil
your hands. The man who killed Monk Eastman pushing around a mob of
upstarts. It's practically undignified.
BILL THE BUTCHER
To hell with any of that.
Tweed stops under a grand new PORTRAIT of himself.
BOSS TWEED
Very well, and to hell as well with any plans you and I may have for
growth and change and even greater reward. You'll never advance anywhere
beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I don't got to advance anywhere further.
BOSS TWEED
Got to, no. But ought to.
He hands him a fancy embossed envelope.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What's this?
BOSS TWEED
(eyes merry)
An invitation. To dinner.
CUT TO
Better by a little than their place in the old hideout. There's even a
window that throws some LIGHT an the few bits of castoff furniture in the
room... an the bed where Jenny sleeps with her face turned to the dawn
light... and an Amsterdam, who is dressing quietly in the corner. He
checks in his coat Pocket,...finds the gold cross ... and leaves. Jenny
does nat stir.
CUT TO
START CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly
written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the
duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher-
But we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two
lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second,
very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG
MAN.
CLERK
Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription Act.
Keep it somewhere safe.
PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
I'll keep it with me.
There is only one OTHER PERSON standen behind the Prosperous Young Man,
and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous
Young Man heads for the door...
... past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with
draftees who SHOUT at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves.
DRAFTEE 1
Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too.
DRAFTEE 2
Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg.
The Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel
Killoran as he leaves.
PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
Oh, Mr. Tweed, I'd take the time to say proper thanks but...
BOSS TWEED
No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300
exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here
today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced.
The Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler
abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran.
KILLORAN
You see how much they like this damned law? Enforcing it's going to hurt
us in elections.
BOSS TWEED
It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always
treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them.
(to Draftees)
Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of
crisis!
DRAFTEE 4
We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what!
BOSS TWEED
Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is
suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how...
DRAFTEE 5
Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed. But let's see you
fight!
DRAFTEE 6
That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see!
BOSS TWEED
(as he backs off)
Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding.
(to Killoran)
Holy Mother.
Tweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees
snakes down the block and into Paradise Square.
BOSS TWEED
Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill
Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what measures we
can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you
think Amsterdam will do our work for us first.
KILLORAN
He could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern
BOSS TWEED
Not so daunting as this.
(turns to the Draftees in the street)
Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show
half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining
this great struggle...
There is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside.
OUTSIDE DRAFTEE
Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind!
BOSS TWEED
Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days?
CUT TO
It's chaos here, too. The large main room is filled with TELEGRAPH
OPERATORS receiving election returns. There is SHOUTING and CONCERN
throughout the room. Even Boss Tweed shows signs of worry.
BOSS TWEED
I swear that science will be the death of industry.
KILLORKN
The telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can get
the repeaters in and out.
BOSS TWEED
(losing patience)
Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain.
(Killoran looks at him blankly)
Do something!
JOHNNY
If you'll allow me.
They both TURN to see Johnny standing coolly before them.
JOHNNY
There's a scheme we might try.
KILLORAN
You got no place among us, get the hell out of here however you come in.
BOSS TWEED
A moment please, Daniel. One moment.
(to Johnny)
You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam?
(Johnny nods)
And therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here?
JOHNNY
Opportunity. Science and opportunity.
KILLORAN
You got opportunities enough among your own.
JOHNNY
I did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow. And
I like to stay with the advantage.
BOSS TWEED
Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting... or perhaps
you're even saying... that your friend and your gang may be ... well,
lagging behind the great march of history?
JOHNNY
Something like that, yeah.
BOSS TWEED
Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind.
CUT TO
The place has been cleared out for a war council: Amsterdam with a couple
of Dead Rabbits, and Bill the Butcher with a few Natives. They sit at a
round poker table with a green felt top.
JIMMY SPOILS
We say the Square is the place. Let Barnum sell the tickets for a share of
the price...
NATIVE SECOND
(interrupting)
A small share.
JIMMY SPOILS
And the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal.
NATIVE SECOND
Who works the crowd?
AMSTERDAM
Nobody. This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll cut their hands off. After the fight.
NATIVE SECOND
We got to fix positions for everyone so there won't be no other fighting.
I know for fact the Roach Guards has sworn blood against the Black Birds,
and the Forty Thieves don't tolerate the Chichesters.
As these delicate negotiations continue, the only two outsiders in the
place, Mother Joyce and a Bartender, are listening intently on the far
side of the room.
BARTENDER
Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine banquet.
MOTHER JOYCE
My ned's on the boy. He's got the youth, and he's got the hunger.
BARTENDER
Is he so hungry you'll put up a hundred?
MOTHER JOYCE
Two.
CUT TO
Jenny digs out her treasure from her mother's grave, throws open the box,
starts to GRAB all the swag she can and hide it on her person... in her
pockets, under her clothes, anywhere. She takes as much as she can, but
she has to travel fast.
CUT TO
As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees: MEN,
WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS.
BOY
My Daddy don't have to die for you! Why should he fight and die for you?
Jenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs
forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to
pick it up as Rioters rush by her.
CUT TO
The crowded main room of Boss Tweed's domain, jammed with anxious
POLITICOS and OFFICIALS, as well as a harried group of TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
who receive news of the riots from all over Manhattan. There is a huge map
of the city against one wall: the place has been converted from a
political princedom to an operational headquarters. Johnny Sirocco and
Bill The Butcher are there. Other guests include the GOVERNOR, Mayor
Fernando Wood, and a badly shaken Horace Greeley.
GREELEY
They attacked me! I had every sympathy for them at first...
BOSS TWEED
Too much sympathy, Horace. Writing these riots were a rising against
"unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers." The shame!
GOVERNOR
I suspended the draft at noon but the mobs only grew more virulent. It is
a criminal rising of the lowest class, of the Gangsters and rabble who
have been allowed by Tammany to run lawless!
BOSS TWEED
It was Tammany and the rabble that elected you, Governor. And it's Tammany
and the gangs who'll stop it. Isn't that so, Bill?
BILL THE BUTCHER
(nods at Johnny)
I won't say nothin' in front of him. Who knows what business he's here on?
BOSS TWEED
He's here on our business and my invitation. He's already been of great
help. What's the opposition strength, John?
To answer, Johnny yanks back a CURTAIN drawn across a high window. The
view, looking downtown, is one of almost continual ILLUMINATION-- every
place the eye falls, CANDLES burn in sympathy for the rioters.
JOHNNY
Each candle is against you, gents.
MAYOR
"Against you," sir? Don't you mean "us".
JOHNNY
(diplomatic)
Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still claim
part of me.
MAYOR
Which part? Perhaps your heart.
BOSS TWEED
Gentlemen, I'm sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of my
friend here, and by extension, my own judgement. So as proof ... John,
where will the mob go? What will the gangs do?
(Johnny is uneasy about answering)
Go on, tell them what you told me.
JOHNNY
There's no telling about the mob. Or the small gangs. But the Dead Rabbits
... if I was Amsterdam...
BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
As indeed you nearly was. Were.
JOHNNY
... if I was ... I'd figure to take the Rabbits to the Armory.
BOSS TWEED
Would you agree with that, Bill? Wouldn't you do the same? If you were
fighting against the militia instead of beside them?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Beside them? What are you talking... ?
BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory. It cannot fall into
unfriendly hands.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I can't stand with the militia against the people. I could never work the
Points no more if I did.
BOSS TWEED
We're all of us swept up in a great tide of events, Bill. Have you learned
to swim?
From Bill's face, struggling to make sense of this, knowing Tweed's right
but not wanting to believe it, we ...
DISSOLVE TO
... Johnny's face, as Tweed talks to him. It is later, and the Butcher has
left. The activity is still frantic all around, but Tweed speaks in
unhurried tones.
BOSS TWEED
I'm sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job. But after that ...
well, I'm afraid he's grown away from us.
(Johnny looks puzzled)
He shows distressing signs of... shall we say, free-thinking. Crime
flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep
himself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust... well, that you
might. If you can prove yourself further.
109 CONTINUED:
JOHNNY
You already said in front of everyone you trusted me.
BOSS TWEED
In vital things. Would I be talking to you now otherwise? Vital things,
but small things. Are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity?
JOHNNY
Such as what?
BOSS TWEED
Ridding me of Bill the Butcher.
(Johnny is startled)
He may question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you had
the sand to go against him. He'd never expect it. Do you have the sand?
From Johnny's face, struggling to make the right answer, we...
DISSOLVE TO
... Ansterdam's face, as he looks up from preparing a brace of pistols for
the next day's scheme.
AMSTERDAM
Let him in.
Johnny enters the common room of Jaccb's Ladder, where the Dead Rabbits
have gathered to ready themselves. As they work over their weapons and
prepare battle dress, Johnny walks through their midst. They do not
acknowledge him... except for Jenny.
JENNY
Did you miss us, John?
JOHNNY
Not a bit.
AMSTERDAM
(rising to meet him)
Are you here to spy?
JOHNNY
I don't have to spy.
Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they can
talk privately.
JOHNNY
(as they walk)
I know what you're doing. I told Tweed what you're doing.
AMSTERDAM
You don't know what I'm doing.
JOHNNY
You're going after the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
Am I now? Why do you think that?
JOHNNY
'Cause that's what I would do, and you and I think alike.
AMSTERDAM
No more. And it don't seem worth a visit to tell me something you already
think I'm doing.
JOHNNY
There's something else alright. Tweed's arranged to kill Bill the Butcher.
AMSTERDAM
(disbelieving)
Who could Tweed get to do that?
JOHNNY
One of his own.
AMSTERDAM
There's no one around him...
JOHNNY
(interrupting)
Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweed
ain't going to wait around
for you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have a
chance.
AMSTERDAM
Chance of what?
JOHNNY
A chance... a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw what
blood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on the
Armory too.
AMSTERDAM
And what's any of it mean to you?
JOHNNY
It means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still part
of me here. I don't
want to see you lose everything in your life at once.
AMSTERDAM
I'm going to lose nothing.
(beat)
If you believe me, you can stay.
JOHNNY
I got to go.
He turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and LEAVES-
JENNY
So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on the
same side. Does that make the path clear enough to suit you?
From Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we...
DISSOLVE TO
... Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as ...
... the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxing
Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame.
And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the first
time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes
and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and
use. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is not
an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Murder Me? No one's going to murder me.
AMSTERDAM
Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, because
that's the only way you'll ever see it coming.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got no
reason to care about any danger to me.
AMSTERDAM
One reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you, not
Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even you,
Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do
anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You protect me? Get out of here and go to hell.
AMSTERDAM
Fine, so long as I pass you on my way.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Maybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you.
AMSTERDAM
Someone I credit.
BILL THE BUTCHER
That means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I am
Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old
horses at a trough.
AMSTERDAM
You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out of
the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me,
then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street
and the whole Points will be mine.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I relish the thought... just the thought... of cutting you up and opening
you wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how
I'm going to enjoy doing it.
AMSTERDAM
Why don't I make it easy for you, then.
He TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the
entire gang of Natives.
AMSTERDAM
Same as you're making it easy for Tweed.
He keeps walking... through the Natives ... dozens of ancient enemies
glowering at him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Amsterdam!
(Amsterdam looks around)
Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy.
Amsterdam struggles to keep his temper. But he turns and keeps walking
through the enemy camp as we...
DISSOLVE TO
....Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang. All
the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. Then
Jimmy Spoils. Then a few others.
As the group passes, others STAND and walk with them...
... until the whole gang is rallied...
... and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads
under the building.
DISSOLVE TO
As Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past
the graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echo
like repeated rifle shots.
DISSOLVE TO
The whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except for
Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and gang
insignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons.
Frightened FACES--people seeking shelter and safety from the riots--appear
in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts.
As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same
march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father.
Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that day
too.
DISSOLVE TO
The last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdam
walks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before--KICKS it
down. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out.
CUT TO
..a telegram, held in Killoran's hand. He passes it to Tweed.
KILLORAN
It's from the Armory Guards. That's the last before the wire went dead.
BOSS TWEED
(reading, furious)
If the Rabbits are already at the Armory, where the hell is Bill and the
militia?
He THROWS the telegram onto the floor, where it joins a whole SEA of
yellow telegraph forms. They are shin-high; there must be thousands of
them.
KILLORAN
They got to be near.
JOHNNY
So long as they're near, it's alright. The Rabbits can take the Armory,
but they can't hold it. If Bill can get into position, he can make sure
they don't get out.
BOSS TWEED
Alright then, John, you pray to any God you choose that's the fact of it.
If Bill thinks he can best the Natives, that is your opportunity. That is
your moment.
(Johnny hesitates)
Are you a Bible man? The Book says in Revelations, "I saw a new heaven and
a new earth." If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that prophecy,
then the hand of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless.
Johnny looks like he is about to say something, but he stops; looks at
Tweed a moment longer; then nods acknowledgment and leaves.
GOVERNOR
I don't believe he can do it, Tweed.
BOSS TWEED
Oh, I think he can. Whether it's one man against another or a mob against
the city, the mathematics remain the same. You never enjoyed the
enlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor? If you had, you'd know you
can always hire half the poor to kill the other half.
CUT TO
As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly
behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded
everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island.
Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as
Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at
his feet.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Your friend made different friends lately.
AMSTERDAM
Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive?
BILL THE BUTCHER
It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia
can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door.
AMSTERDAM
I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unless
you come with the Dead Rabbits.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You'd lay aside what's between us?
AMSTERDAM
I'm not forgetting where I put it.
BILL THE BUTCHER
If you do, I'll remind you.
(he turns, leaves)
AMSTERDAM
What's your call, Bill?
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm considering where's my better chance.
He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS
it himself and strides out into the street.
CUT TO
Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines.
From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him.
The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS
of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard
conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives.
Amsterdam WATCHES intently.
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what
they're saying. There is still no sound...
... until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDE
with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT.
Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander.
As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's
hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just
been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks,
women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally
stunned soldiers.
Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him.
Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.
AMSTERDAM
Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover!
The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn
enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's
Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY
from the Armory...
... toward the militia.
The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now... and the Armory
doors start to open...
... when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ...
... and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment,
suddenly open fire...on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof
of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof...
... as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or
stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut
down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the
doors. And a few are shot...
... when the doors close before they can get through.
CUT TO
The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. The
Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he
has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Well, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang.
AMSTERDAM
Whose gang might it be?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Not William Tweed's.
Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of the
Armory.
AMSTERDAM
Which way you pointing that?
JIMMY SPOILS
Any way you say. One direction could let us out, the other will let them
in.
BILL THE BUTCHER
They got to come in if we're going to fight them.
AMSTERDAM
Who do you want to fight, Bill?
Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around.
Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining
members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory
stockpile...
... and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of the
cannon...
... which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
(to Bill the Butcher)
See you in the street.
The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage.
Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast... sees no damage
to the front of the building... and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on the
Armory.
HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES ... following
them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory
... SHOOTING straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs HURTLE
through the still-smoldering hole in the wall ...
... and drop twenty feet to an alley below...
... where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia presses
closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory.
Everyone wants to get through that hole.
Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are
carrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONS
them all toward the back of the Armory.
But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body of
Johnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest.
AMSTERDAM
You'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John.
He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others
stand waiting.
He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERING
DOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head... and HURLS
it through the air. Jenny and the others do the same.
His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others,
JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION.
