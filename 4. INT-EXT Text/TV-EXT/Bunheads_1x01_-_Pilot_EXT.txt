      We float over the town at it s glittering best.  From the air 
      it sparkles.  The strip is packed, the sidewalks bustle with 
      hopes, dreams, and excitement.  We PAN DOWN and find 
      ourselves at THE HILTON hotel.  We hear LIVE MUSIC playing.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A beat-up Volkswagon bug zips between cars and into the 
       Mirage  driveway.


      The bug screeches to a halt.  Michelle gets out.  She s 
      wearing tights and a sleek black leotard and a  Love  
      baseball jacket over it.  A young Valet stands there.  

                                  MICHELLE
                          (to valet)
                    So the jacket - sucking up or 
                    classy touch?

                                  OLDER VALET GUY
                    Uh...

                                  MICHELLE
                    Sucking up.  Right.  
                          (she throws the jacket 
                            back in the car)
                    Okay.  I m good.  I m ready.  How 
                    old am I?  I m twenty-nine.  You 
                    buy it?  Cause, I didn t get into 
                    sunscreen till the late nineties.  

                                  OLDER VALET GUY
                    Sure.  Why not.  It s Vegas.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thanks!                                                                                          9.


      She tosses him the keys and runs into the hotel.


      The two story complex looks an awful lot like  Leaving Los 
      Vegas  but not so cheery.  Michelle comes out and leans on 
      the railing overlooking the sad dirty pool and swigs her 
      beer.  DELILAH, a heavily made-up woman in a bad wig, super 
      silver glitter mini skirt, and ratty pink fuzzy slippers 
      passes by with a bucket of ice.                                                                                          12.


                                    DELILAH
                    Geez.  Who died?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Your fashion sense.

                                    DELILAH
                    Well, take that tragic face inside.  
                    I have guests coming over and that 
                    is going to spoil the party.

                                  MICHELLE
                    As long as my face doesn t look 
                    like Chris Hansen your guests will 
                    be fine.

      Delilah sniffs indignantly and goes inside.  Michelle takes 
      another swig of her beer.  We pull back high and wide 
      revealing the colorful lights of the strip blazing in the 
      distance behind the sad apartment complex.  The glamorous 
      life sure looks a long ways away. 


      Michelle walks in, her coat over her costume.  The costumer 
      walks up to her furious.

                                  COSTUMER
                    I swear to God, the next time you 
                    leave this theatre in your costume 
                    you will be fined.  A lot.  I mean 
                    it!  I ll ruin you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Too late.  I got there first.

      Michelle drops down in her chair.  Talia sits next to her.

                                  TALIA
                    Should I ask?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Nope.

                                  TALIA
                    So, where should we go get drunk 
                    tonight?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Someplace close.

      Off in the distance we hear:                                                                                          13.


                                    HUBBELL (O.C.)
                    Excuse me, I was wondering if 
                    Michelle was here yet?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Are you kidding me?  He s still 
                    here?

                                  TALIA
                    He talked about you all night long.
                          (as Hubbell)
                       Michelle s so beautiful, 
                      Michelle s so smart, usually tall 
                    girls are intimidating, Michelle s 
                    not intimidating, she s wonderful. 
                    Dinner was delicious though.  He s 
                    not cheap, this guy.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I can t deal with this now.
                          (gathering up her stuff)
                    Look, just tell him I died and I ll 
                    see him next month.  

      Michelle stands up and turns right into Hubbell.  He holds a 
      large bouquet of flowers and a fancy wrapped box.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (startled)
                    Ahhh!  Hubbell!  You scared me!

                                    HUBBELL
                    I m sorry.  I should ve walked up 
                    slower.  Gosh, you look wonderful.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thank you.

                                    HUBBELL
                    How did your audition go?

                                  MICHELLE
                    It went fine.  Great.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I knew it.  I knew it would.  Here.

      He hands her the flowers and the box.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thanks.  Look, I really need to get 
                    ready for the show, so...                                                                                          14.


                                    HUBBELL
                    Open your present first.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (no fight left in her)
                    Okay.  Sure.

      She opens the box and pulls out a beautiful black velvet 
      watch with diamonds around the face.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (stunned)
                    Oh Hubbell...

                                    HUBBELL
                    Do you like it?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Do I like it?  Who could not like 
                    this?  It s stunning.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I got it wholesale from my friend 
                    Drew who s in the diamond biz. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (looks at the watch and 
                            tears up a little)
                    I ve never gotten anything this 
                    beautiful in my entire life. 
                          (beat, then sadly)
                    My audition did not go great.  It 
                    was a disaster.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I can t believe that.

                                  MICHELLE
                    He didn t even let me dance.  He 
                    just looked at me and said  no .

      Hubbell studies her for a beat.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (gently)
                    Michelle, can I take you to dinner 
                    after the show?  If you like we can 
                    order nothing but dessert.

      Michelle looks at him.  He s awfully sweet.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (smiles a little)
                    Sure.  Dinner would be great.                                                                                          15.



      Michelle s head hang out of an open window.  Her hair blows 
      wildly and last nights make-up is smeared all over her face.  
      She slowly wakes, blinks in the sunlight, and tries to 
      remember where she is.  She glances over and sees Hubbell 
      happily driving.  She lifts her left hand.  A tiny diamond 
      ring glitters on her ring finger.  It s all coming back.  She 
      drops her head back down and stares out the window.

      WE CUT WIDE to see Hubbell s Volvo driving up the California 
      coast as we:  

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                          20.


                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      We push in on a converted barn surrounded by trees and 
      flowers.  Cheery and weathered, a sign outside reads  Falls 
      Dance Academy .  Piano music drifts out of the studio.


      Hubbell s car drives through the streets.


      Michelle bolts out the back door.  The sounds of Fanny and 
      Hubbell arguing waft after her.  She looks around and notices 
      a structure behind the house.  She strolls past the sign 
      announcing  Flower s Dance Academy  and up to the open door 
      and peers in.  Inside she sees Boo working on her arabesque.  
      She s not having much luck.  She teeters and falls.  She 
      tries again.  Sasha and Melanie comes out of the dressing 
      room dressed in their street clothes.    

                                  SASHA
                    Class is over, Boo.

                                  BOO
                    Five minutes.

                                    MELANIE
                    Five minutes is not going to help.

                                  BOO
                          (does another arabesque)
                    How does it look?

                                  SASHA
                    I m starving.

                                  BOO
                    Is my line long?

                                    MELANIE
                    There s a mirror right there.

                                  BOO
                    If I look I ll fall.

                                  SASHA
                    Let s get pizza.  

                                  BOO
                    Just look first.

      The girls look. Sasha shrugs.                                                                                          30.


                                  BOO (CONT D)
                    I don t know what you did.  What 
                    did you do?

                                  MICHELLE
                    You have to square off your 
                      shoulders.

      Melanie and Sasha suddenly notice Michelle in the doorway.

                                  BOO
                    Who said that?  Who s talking?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Your right shoulder s pulled too 
                    far back.  Square it off.

      Boo shifts her shoulder forward.  Her arabesque steadies.

                                  BOO
                    Hey!  It s working!

                                    MELANIE
                          (whispers to Sasha)
                    Who s that?

      Sasha shrugs.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Now lift your leg a little higher, 
                    chin up, and walla.

                                  BOO
                          (whirls around happily)
                    That was so cool.  It was like, 
                    suddenly I could hold it!  

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s how it works. One day it 
                    just clicks.

                                  BOO
                    That was so satisfying.
                          (beat)
                    Who are you?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh, well I am...

      Fanny appears at the door.

                                  FANNY
                    She is my daughter-in-law.  Aren t 
                    you?                                                                                          31.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh...

                                  FANNY
                    Well, at least according to my son 
                    and my son never lies.  
                          (to the girls)
                    They got married in Las Vegas.  
                    Isn t that romantic?  
                          (to Michelle)
                    Did Elvis do the ceremony?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.

                                  FANNY
                    Wayne Newton?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.

                                  FANNY
                    Charo?

                                  MICHELLE

                    through.

                                  FANNY

                                  MICHELLE
                    Michelle.

                                  FANNY

                    my advanced class.  Sasha, Melanie, 
                    Ginny, and Boo.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hey here.

                                  FANNY
                    Now, if you ll excuse us, we have a 
                    lot to do.  
                          (to Michelle)
                    I have decided to throw you a 
                    little  welcome to the family  
                    party tonight.                                                                                            32.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh, that s not...

                                  FANNY
                    I ve already called everyone, told 
                    them to spread the word, you re 
                    welcome.  Of course, you girls are 
                    all invited too.

      The girls seem genuinely pleased.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh no.  You guys don t have to 
                    come.  You ll be so bored.

                                  GINNY
                    No, we won t.

                                  MICHELLE
                    It s just a bunch of old people.
                          (off Fanny s look)
                    Including me.  I m an oldie too.

                                  SASHA
                    Do you not want us to come?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, first of all, I don t know 
                    you.  Second, it s Saturday night.  
                    Don t you have like young people 
                    Saturday night stuff to do?

                                  BOO
                    No.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Really?

                                  BOO
                    Not since the movie theatre closed.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wait.  There s no movie theatre in 
                    this town?

                                    MELANIE
                    It s not so bad.  They open the 
                    skating rink in November. 

                                  GINNY
                    And sometimes Mr. Feldstein forgets 
                    to lock the library door and we go 
                    in and read.                                                                                          33.


                                  BOO
                    Yeah, that s cool.

                                  TINA
                    Or we just hang here. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (beat)
                    You re all screwing with me, right?

                                  FANNY
                    Paradise is a sleepy town.  But we 
                    love it.  And I m sure you will 
                    too.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh huh.  So, I m sorry, how far 
                    away is the nearest movie theatre?

                                  FANNY
                          (to the girls)
                    Okay, girls go home and get pretty 
                    we ll see you back here at six.

      The girls hurry off.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Now, I have to see about some 
                      champagne.  Paradise is dry so I 
                    have to figure out who stockpiles.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Dry?

                                  FANNY
                    Don t worry.  I promise you ll have 
                    something bubbly at your party.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Fanny, I really don t need a party.

                                  FANNY
                    My son just got married. I didn t 
                    get to be at the ceremony so I d 
                    like to be at the party.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Sure.

                                  FANNY
                    You understand?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I do.                                                                                          34.


                                  FANNY
                    You approve?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Of course.

                                  FANNY
                    Because, God forbid I offend you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I am not offended.

                                  FANNY
                    You re not offended that I want to 
                    throw you a wedding party after 
                    missing the wedding?  Oh thank 
                    goodness.  Now you go get changed 
                    and I will see to everything else.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh.  Uh, I don t really have 
                    anything else to wear.

                                  FANNY
                    You must ve packed something that 
                    works.
                          (beat)
                    You must ve packed.
                          (beat)
                    Goodness.  You re not pregnant are 
                    you?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No!  No, no, no.  Not pregnant.  We 
                    just got so carried away in the 
                    moment that I didn t think about 
                    clothes.  Is there someplace around 
                    here that I could buy something? 

                                  FANNY
                      Absolutely.  Just go down the 
                    street here and make a right and 
                    look for a store called Sparkles.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay.  Thanks.  I ll go now.

      She starts off down the street.  Fanny s smile fades as we:

                                                                          FADE OUT:


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                          35.


                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Michelle wanders down the sidewalk staring at the various mom 
      and pop stores, interspersed with crap stores, and the  gone 
      out of business  stores.  Sleepy doesn t describe it.  
      Comatose is more like it.  Michelle sees the big  SPARKLES  
      sign which is actually missing most of its sparkles. 


      The place looks festive.  A banner reading  Congratulations 
      Hubbell  hangs above the front door.                                                                                            39.



      Michelle wanders up.  She hears the girls talking inside.

                                    MELANIE (O.C.)
                    Well, why don t you suck up to 
                    Hubbell s wife?  She can be your 
                    new friend.                                                                                          53.


                                  SASHA (O.C.)
                    God, I can t believe someone 
                    married Hubbell.  Talk about too 
                    many beers.

                                  GINNY (O.C.)
                    What s wrong with Hubbell?


      We PUSH IN on a creaky crumbly but apparently hugely popular 
      dive bar.  Fanny, with Michelle in tow, marches right up to 
      the enormous man perched on a stool outside the door.  He 
      opens it for her like she s the queen.
