      SEAHAVEN is a small town on Florida s Gulf Coast where 
      everyone turns out for high school football games.  The crowd 
      is full of a specific type of woman: 40s, dressed young for 
      her age: too much skin, too much Botox, just too much.  ANGLE 
      ON a banner that reads  Welcome to Cougar Town!   The 
      Seahaven Cougar football team bursts through the sign, 
      TRAMPLING the Cougar mascot.  As the team bounces around the 
      field, we hear Jules  dialogue as narrative V.O.:

                                  JULES (O.C.)
                    You know how they say fifty percent 
                    of marriages end in divorce...

      JULES (dressed appropriately cute) sits with her son TAD (17) 
      and friend/assistant LAURIE KEENAN (28).  Tad is quietly 
      handsome, sarcastic and his relationship with Jules 
      VACILLATES BETWEEN FRIEND AND PARENT.  Laurie is a happy-go-
      lucky townie, but she can stand up for herself.  Jules sees 
      her potential and treats her like a little sister/protege. 

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    ... Around here it seems like 
                    ninety percent.  And I know I m one 
                    of them, but I don t feel like one 
                    of them, you know?

                                  LAURIE
                    Will you look at all these old ass 
                    bitties trolling for action.

      Jules SEES A VERY BIG CHESTED WOMAN.                                                                                      2.


                                  JULES 
                    Aw, Tad, your math teacher, Ms. 
                      Pritchett, got new boobs.  Have the 
                    kids noticed her new boobs?

                                  TAD
                    We have, Mom.

                                  LAURIE
                    Jules, you re old.  You had any 
                    plastic surgery?

                                  JULES
                    I got Botox once, but I didn t like 
                    it.

                                  TAD
                    You looked like Mickey Rourke.  
                    Never again, right?

                                  JULES
                    Sweetie, when a woman says  I got 
                    Botox once but I didn t like it  it 
                    just means that from now on she 
                    only gets a little so she can still 
                    smile and frown.  See?  Happy.
                          (smiles, then frowning)
                    Mad.  Grrr.  Plus, if my waddle 
                    thingy here gets any bigger --
                          (re: skin under her chin)
                    I ll disappear for two weeks on a 
                       vacation  and when I get back I 
                    might talk a little differently but 
                    it will be gone -- Laurie, stop 
                    staring at Ms. Pritchett you ll 
                    make her self-conscious.  She s 
                    obviously not used to them yet.

      Ms. Pritchett is awkwardly trying to flaunt her breasts.

                                  LAURIE
                    I can t help it.  They look like 
                    gorilla heads.

                                  TAD
                    Check it.  Ryan promised me he d do 
                    something during warm-ups.

      RYAN, the quarterback, rifles a pass into the head of the 
      Cougar mascot, who drops.  Tad and Laurie ad-lib cheers (Yes!  
      Outstanding!)  As Ryan points up to them:

                                  JULES
                    He s a good friend.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      3.



      Laurie reads a text as Jules watches Tad talk to friends.

                                  LAURIE
                    Your new realty signs are ready.  
                    I ll put them out in the morning.

                                  JULES
                    Tad s a great kid, isn t he?

                                  LAURIE
                    Yeah.  Can I take his virginity?

                                  JULES
                    Again, no.

                                  LAURIE
                    Come on, I want it.

                                  JULES
                    I m hoping my son s first time is a 
                    little more romantic and a little 
                    less reverse cowgirl.  Besides, we 
                    don t even know for sure that he s 
                    still a virgin.
                          (they both laugh, then)
                    Be nice.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules (in robe) grabs her paper.  Across the street, GRAYSON 
      ELLIS (40s, handsome, closed off, and calmly emotionless) 
      ushers a pretty young CLUB GIRL (23) into a cab.

                                  GIRL
                    I d hook up with you again just for 
                    the jacuzzi tub.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll file that under  classy .

                                  GIRL
                    Call me later, my number is 349--

      He CLOSES the DOOR on her mid-sentence.  The cab leaves as 
      Jules approaches, playfully smiling; she loves torturing him.

                                  JULES
                    Aw, Grayson, that was so sweet.  I 
                    think she might be the one.  What?

                                    GRAYSON 
                    Nothing.  This is how I always look 
                    at annoying people. 
                          (gives same look)
                    This, on the other hand, is the 
                    look I give to neighbors when I 
                    don t give a shit what they think.                                                                                      8.


                                  JULES
                    They re very similar looks.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (walks off)
                    Have a grand morning.

                                  JULES
                          (follows him)
                    You know what drives me nuts?

                                    GRAYSON
                    Great, let s talk more.

                                  JULES
                    How come when a 40 year-old guy 
                    gets divorced and starts violating 
                    sorority girls everyone s like, 
                     Way to go , but you see a 
                      divorced... mature woman with some 
                    hot young thing and it s more 
                      disturbing than the Holocaust?  And 
                    you re not the least bit self-
                    conscious about the age difference.  
                    I mean, don t you get insecure 
                    about your grey hair, your pot 
                    belly, your skin tags-- 

                                    GRAYSON
                    What s a skin tag?

                                  JULES
                    You know, those gross, little, mole 
                    thingies older people get.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t have those, but I m sorry 
                    you do.

                                  JULES
                    I don t have skin tags.

                                    GRAYSON
                    For someone that doesn t have them 
                    you seem to know a lot about them. 

                                  JULES
                    Fine, I have a big one in my 
                    armpit.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I may vomit.  Can I ask you 
                    something personal?

                                  JULES
                    Don t be mean, I can t handle mean.                                                                                      9.


                                    GRAYSON
                    When was the last time you had sex?

                                  JULES
                    I almost got together with my son 
                    last night.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Maybe you just covet what you 
                    pretend to despise.  Maybe what 
                    really  drives you nuts  is that 
                    you couldn t bag a  hot young 
                    thing  if you tried.

                                  JULES
                          (beat, then points at him)
                    Mean.  You don t think I could--  
                    No.  No.  Don t give him the 
                      satisfaction... 
                          (she steps off, then steps 
                            back)
                    The hell with it.  Hey kid!

      As a BOY (15) ON A BIKE looks over, Jules opens her robe 
      flashing him, revealing the RED BRA/PANTIES from last night.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Pow!

      The boy BIKES INTO A PARKED CAR.  Jules turns to Grayson:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Yes!  Suck it!

                                    GRAYSON
                          (looking off)
                    I think he broke his face

                                  JULES
                          (realizing)
                    Right.  Go get some ice.

      As Jules rushes over to help:


                                      END OF COLD OPEN                                                                                    10.


                                            ACT ONE


      STUDENTS GAWK and react as Jules drops Tad off at school.  

                                  JULES
                    I m guessing the kid I flashed goes 
                    to your school.

                                  TAD
                    He does. 

                                  JULES
                    Would it help if I explain to him 
                    what I was going through 
                      emotionally?

      Tad exits the car.  RYAN (17, black, studly quarterback but a 
      good guy) walks up.  As Jules drives off, out window: 

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Tell him I love him, Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    She loves you.

      The class prick, BJ, approaches.  Tad turns to Ryan:

                                  TAD
                    Great, here we go.

                                  BJ
                    Hey Cobb, I heard your mom s got a 
                    porn star body.

                                  TAD
                          (sincere)
                    Thanks, BJ.  That s really nice of 
                    you to say.  I ll let her know. 
                          (to Ryan as they walk off)
                    Does he look confused?

                                  RYAN
                    Mm-hmm.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules walks to a  Jules Cobb Realty  for-sale sign.  It s a 
      VERY SEXY PICTURE OF JULES; LOW-CUT TOP, SULTRY EXPRESSION.                                                                                     12.


                                  JULES
                    What did you do?!  That s not the 
                    photo I picked.  That s from the 
                    night we got drunk on Amaretto and 
                    played dress-up. 

                                  LAURIE
                    I don t care if you fire me.  This 
                    is marketing for Jules.  I m 
                    putting you back out there.  You ve 
                    been divorced for five months and 
                    you re not having any fun.

                                  JULES 
                          (beat, then)
                    I m not, am I?  

                                  LAURIE
                    No.

                                  JULES
                    I want to go out tonight, and I 
                    want to go somewhere where I can 
                    get a hot neck kiss from a handsome 
                    young man.  Preferably while he s 
                    drinking milk.

                                  LAURIE
                    We can do that.

                                  JULES
                    Good.  And I don t care what people 
                    think of me.

                                  LAURIE
                    Yeah, you do.

                                  JULES
                    I know.  It s an issue.  
                          (then, vulnerable)
                    Am I going to be like one of those 
                    cougars at the game -- doesn t 
                    everyone think they look desperate 
                    and inappropriate and just... sad?  

                                  LAURIE
                    Jules, you could never be like 
                    them.  Look how beautiful you are.  

                                  JULES
                          (looks at sign, smiles)
                    Thanks.                                                                                    13.


                                  LAURIE 
                    Friends look out.  It s like when 
                    you finally convinced me that Dale 
                    was a loser and I had to stop 
                    dating him.  What?

                                  JULES
                    You have a giant hickey, and I can 
                    tell it s Dale s because whoever 
                    did it has a tooth missing.

                                  LAURIE
                    Uncalled for.

      They drive off.  ANGLE ON SIGN.  A BOY (14) walks by, does a 
      double take, looks both ways and STEALS IT.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules steps in front of Laurie and walks backwards.

                                  JULES
                    I have to deal with Barb 
                      professionally, my personal life is 
                    none of her--                                                                                    14.


      Right then, Jules TOPPLES OVER backwards.

                                  LAURIE
                    You know you re not coordinated 
                    enough to walk backwards in heels.

      REVEAL Jules facedown in a bush.

                                  JULES
                    I will kill you.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules pulls up to see an old convertible, golf clubs in the 
      back.  Her ex, BOBBY COBB (42), a loser yet somehow  
      disarmingly charming, sits out front.  

                                  JULES
                    What do you want, Bobby?

                                  BOBBY
                    I was hoping I could get a little 
                    advance on my next alimony check.
                          (he follows her inside)
                    C mon, J-bird.  Not a lot of people 
                    are taking golf lessons lately.  
                    I ve got Tad tonight, I d like to 
                    be able to, you know, feed him.


      Jules and Tad walk toward a house.  Jules eats her cuticle.

                                  TAD
                    Can you please not eat your finger?

                                  JULES
                    Give me a break, I m hungry.

                                  TAD 
                    Why do I still have to see a 
                    shrink?

                                  JULES
                    You re a child of divorce, Tad.  
                    Own it.


      Jules and Laurie stand in front of a HANDSOME BLACK BOUNCER 
      with VERY DARK SKIN.

                                  JULES
                    Wow, you are really black.  It s 
                    very handsome on you.

                                    BOUNCER
                    Yeah it is.

      He pulls back the rope.  Laurie enters.  Jules hesitates.

                                    BOUNCER (CONT D)
                    It s okay, you ll be fine.  Go get 
                     em.

      As Jules smiles, takes a deep breath, and enters, we...

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                            ACT TWO


      As Jules EXITS A CAB, she sees GRAYSON with another YOUNG 
      CLUB GIRL (24).  She yells across the street:

                                  JULES
                    Stop having sex with babies!

                                    GRAYSON
                          (calmly to girl)
                    That s my new friend.


      A new day.  The SAME BOY from before CASUALLY WALKS UP AND 
      STEALS ANOTHER ONE OF JULES  SEXY  FOR SALE  SIGNS.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Tad walks along, miserable.  He sees BJ (and idiot friends) 
      waiting for him.  

                                  TAD 
                    Not today, man.  I m warning you.

                                  BJ
                    Calm down, Cobb.  I did you a 
                    solid.  I walked in on my little 
                    brother and caught him with this.
                          (holds up Jules  sign)
                     Hi, Tad, it s me, Mom .  She is 
                    hot.  And guess what all the junior 
                    high boys are doing with these?
                          (holds up sign again)
                     I know, and I like it. 

      WE PUSH IN on Tad s face, flushed with fury.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      TAD BEATS BJ WITH THE SIGN as the others watch.  In between 
      each hit he says the same thing:

                                  TAD
                    You think my mom s hot now?  How 
                    about now?  How about now?

                                                                            BACK TO:


      Tad and Jules get out of the car arguing.

                                  JULES
                    ...Look, I know you and I had a bit 
                    of an awkward moment last night.
                          (off Tad s look)
                    Yeah,  awkward moment , that s what 
                    I m calling it.  Still, there s 
                    never an excuse for violence.  

                                  TAD
                    Junior high boys are stealing your 
                    signs.  Do you want to know why?!  
                    They use them to pleasure 
                      themselves. 

                                  JULES
                          (flattered)
                    Really? 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  JULES (CONT'D)
                          (catches herself)
                    I mean, really?

                                  TAD
                    Why can t you just be a normal mom, 
                    and stop torturing me?

                                  JULES
                          (calling after him)
                    I m allowed to have a life, Tad.

      Tad goes inside.  Grayson approaches having witnessed it all.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Don t worry, he ll be fine.  You 
                    know, as long as you don t sell my 
                    house in the next six years because 
                    thanks to you, that boy s going to 
                    need some work.  Of course, I m not 
                    speaking to you as his doctor.  I m 
                    speaking as your friend.  We re 
                    friends, remember?

      Grayson smiles, pleased with himself.  Jules walks up to him, 
      then unexpectedly PUSHES HIM OVER.  Then, from the ground:

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Did that just happen?

      Tad, watching, yells down from the upstairs window:

                                  TAD
                    Never an excuse for violence, Mom!

                                  JULES
                    Get back in the damn house!

      Tad closes the window and Jules turns to Grayson:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    You know what?  I m not going to 
                    play the  pretend we re friends  
                    game with you anymore.  It s only 
                    fun with someone that you re 
                    actually, maybe sort of becoming 
                    friends with.  Not with a typical 
                    douchebag that gets to walk away 
                    from his marriage scot-free, no 
                      responsibilities, nothing.  Do you 
                    know how scary it is being a single 
                    forty year-old woman?

                                    GRAYSON
                    I want to say yes.                                                                                    30.


                                  JULES
                    Whatever you do, you feel judged by 
                    the world -- you feel judged by 
                    yourself.  And deep down you know 
                    that even if you ever do want to 
                    get married again, it s not going 
                    to happen.  Not when you re fifty, 
                    your looks have faded, and you 
                    can t make babies anymore.  So you 
                    put on a brave face and try really 
                    hard not to think about the fact 
                    that maybe this is all your life s 
                    going to be.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (getting up)
                    You know, my Grandad got a chick 
                    pregnant when he was ninety.

      Jules pushes Grayson down again and marches back to her 
      house.  From the ground, Grayson turns to see Andy pushing 
      the stroller by, drinking coffee.  They speak casually.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Andy.

                                  ANDY
                    Grayson.  She got you twice.
                          (sips coffee, blissful)
                    Ohhh, lord, that s good coffee. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jules pulls her outside and turns, walking backwards.  

                                  JULES
                    I won t let you fall into the same 
                    trap I did.  Kids don t fix things--

      She FALLS into the same bush AGAIN.

                                  LAURIE
                    You never learn, do you?

                                  JULES
                          (face down in bush)
                    Shut up.

      Jules looks up from the bush to see THE SAME BOY from before, 
      STEALING JULES  SIGN.  They lock eyes, then:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Get him!  

      The kid runs off.


      The kid rounds a corner, terrified.  Jules and Laurie follow, 
      NOW CARRYING THEIR SHOES.  They chase him through bushes and 
      across backyards.  The boy tries to climb over a fence but 
      JULES JUMPS AND GRABS HIS FOOT.  The boy panics, drops the 
      sign and flops over.  Out of breath, Jules and Laurie watch 
      him sprint into a nearby house. 

                                  LAURIE
                    We got the sign back.  It s over.

      As Jules reacts:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Tad stands on the curb waiting.  Grayson gets his mail.

                                  TAD
                    I m waiting for a buddy.

                                    GRAYSON
                    That s exciting news.  Looks like 
                    your mom s got a fun night ahead, 
                    too.

                                  TAD
                          (looks in)
                    Yeah, whatever.

                                    GRAYSON 
                    May I tell you something I picked 
                    up on in your sessions?  You re a 
                    selfish little shit.
                          (off Tad s look)
                    Sucks to hear, but you know it s 
                    true.  I mean, come on, does she 
                    really look like she s enjoying her 
                    life?  Still, she s doing what you 
                    want, isn t she?  So I suppose 
                    that s nice.  

      Ryan pulls up.                                                                                    34.


                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Good night, Tad.

                                  TAD
                    You re an asshole.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I know.  I m okay with it.

      As Grayson walks off, Tad gets in Ryan s car, lost in 
      thought.  We see his POV of his mom alone.  WE END ON TAD S 
      FACE RACKED WITH GUILT.  He knows he s a JERK.
