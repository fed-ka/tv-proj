      EXT. FLAGSHIP ROAD.  REDWOOD POINT - DAY (D/1)11

      We're deep in the hills of the northern coast.  TOWERING 
      REDWOODS line the road, making a deep green canyon, along 
      which JANE, LISBON and CHO follow SHERIFF NELSON (50's).

                                  NELSON
                    The girls were last seen leaving  
                      Sullivan's Tavern, one o'clock this 
                    morning.  A truck driver saw their 
                    car around five-thirty and called 
                    it in.  I only have four deputies 
                    and only a couple of 'em have ever 
                    seen a body killed in anger.  If 
                    what we have here is a homicide, I 
                    need help.        

                                  LISBON
                    Just to be clear?  Except in 
                    special circumstances, we don't 
                    help.  We take over.  You need to 
                    be okay with that.

                                  NELSON
                    Oh-kay.  I guess.

                                  JANE
                          (apologetic to Nelson)
                    She's not a morning person.  
                    She'll improve.

                                  LISBON 
                    Names of the missing women?

                                  NELSON 
                    Nicole Gilbert and Kara Palmer.   
                    Local girls.  Both twenty-one.  
                    Work together at the hunting store 
                    in town.  Last night was Nicole's 
                      engagement party.    

      Amidst the deep shade of towering Redwoods, we come upon the 
      crime scene -- POLICE WORK-LIGHTS illuminate an abandoned '92 
      VOLKSWAGEN JETTA, parked off the road in grass and brush, on 
      an uneven patch of land, leaving the vehicle a bit skewed.  
      Both doors left open and trunk open.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)              THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       2.

      CONTINUED:11

      Various Police and Ranger Personnel gathered.  DEPUTY PARKER 
      (40's) and his snuffling BLOODHOUND go around and around the 
      Jetta; seemingly unable to pick up a scent trail.

      Lisbon and Cho don rubber gloves.

                                  LISBON
                    The car was found exactly like 
                    this?

                                  NELSON
                    Yup.  Well, no.  Doors were open 
                    just like that.  We popped the 
                    trunk.  

      JANE'S POV -- Two WOMEN'S PURSES.  CAR KEYS in the ignition.  
      A pink MP3 player hooked up to the stereo.  A VERY LARGE 
      BLOODSTAIN on the driver's seat and more blood pooling in the 
      well of the car.  A pair of high heels.  In the back, there's 
      a lot of one particular brand of cosmetics scattered around.

      Lisbon starts going through the stuff in the car, turns the 
      key in the ignition.  Battery's dead.  

                                  NELSON (CONT D)
                    Yup, dead as a dodo.  No gas 
                    either.  They must have left it 
                    running.

      JANE'S POV -- The hound-dog going in circles around and 
      around the yellow tape that surrounds the car.     

                                  CHO
                          (points out)
                    There's a different set of tire 
                    tracks here that pulled off the 
                    road.  Still fresh.  A truck or a 
                    big SUV looks like.    

      Lisbon has a look.

                                  LISBON
                    Nice and crisp.  Probably the 
                    trucker that reported the car.
                    Make sure forensics gets a mold.  

                                  JANE
                    What's going on with your dog?

                                  PARKER
                    He's confused somehow.  This 
                    behavior?  He's sayin', hey look!

                                  PARKER (CONT'D)
                    This is where they're at!  
                    Gimme a slim jim already! 

                                  NELSON
                    Do you have a better dog somewhere 
                    close by?

                                  PARKER
                    Sir, this is the best dog in the 
                    county.  C'mon now, Dexter.  
                      Everybody's waiting on you.

                                  JANE
                    Did you look under the car?

                                  NELSON
                    Under the car?  Of course we looked 
                    under the car.

      Nelson looks to Parker, who grimaces.  Nelson rolls eyes, 
      deflates.  Shit.  Goes to his knees.  Looks under the car.

                                  NELSON (CONT D)
                    Oh, crap.

      Lisbon and Cho get down to look.  Jane doesn't bother.  

                                  JANE
                    One or two?

      POV -- UNDER THE CAR, a once beautiful girl, now a pale 
      corpse, looks back at us. 

                                  CHO
                    One.

                                  NELSON 
                    It's Kara Palmer.  

                                  JANE
                    So.  Where is Nicole Gilbert?

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. WOODS - DAY (D/1 CONT'D)22

      A SEARCH PARTY of LOCAL COPS and CIVILIAN VOLUNTEERS plus 
      Jane and Lisbon in motion along a dirt logging road.  The 
      Bloodhound is working now that he isn't distracted by the 
      dead body.  Jane and Lisbon are with Sheriff Nelson just 
      behind Parker and his dog.

                                  PARKER
                    Good boy, Dexter.  Got 'er on lock 
                    now.

                                  JANE
                    Is there any way to tell from her 
                    scent trail how fast Nicole is 
                    moving?

                                  PARKER
                    Oh sure.  Dexter's detecting skin 
                    cells?  They fall off your body all 
                    the time at a pretty much constant 
                    rate.  So the faster you move, the 
                    thinner the trail you leave. 

                                  JANE 
                    So are we following Nicole on foot 
                    or Nicole tied up in the back of a 
                    truck?

                                  PARKER
                    I don't know.

                                  JANE 
                    You said you could tell how fast 
                    they were moving.

                                  PARKER
                    Dexter can tell.  I'm just walking 
                    behind him. 

                                  LISBON
                          (to Nelson)
                    Tell us about Kara and Nicole.

                                  NELSON
                    Known 'em practically all their 
                    lives.  Kara was a sweetheart.

                    You'll find no-one round here 
                    who'll say a bad word of Kara 
                    Palmer.  Good churchgoing family.  
                    No trouble at all.   

                                  JANE
                          (in other words...)
                    Meaning Nicole Gilbert was trouble.

                                  NELSON
                    Nicole, well, she's had her 
                    problems.  Drugs and drug related 
                      foolishness mostly.  Theft, petty 
                    fraud.    

                                  LISBON
                    Any violent offenses?  

                                  NELSON
                    No.  She's more of a troubled soul 
                    than a real bad person.  Tough 
                    life.   Mom died when she was 
                    seven.  Dad brought her up on meth 
                    and hot dogs.  He's in prison now.  
                    Drug dealing.  Kara and her family 
                    was pretty much all the stability 
                    Nicole ever had.  

                                  JANE
                    So she and Kara were good friends.  
                    Odd match up.   

                                  NELSON
                    Real close since they were little.  
                    In small towns like this, you don't 
                    choose your friends.  They're the 
                    same age, they're female.  That's 
                    enough.  

      A quartet of PARK RANGERS join the group.  KYLE's their 
      leader.  They're all pookah beads and native American tattoos 
      on bulging muscles under their uniforms.

                                  NELSON (CONT'D)
                    Kyle, boys... Thanks for coming 
                    over.

                    Where d'you want us, Sheriff?

                    What have you heard about this

                                  KYLE 
                    Uh, same as everybody else I guess.  
                    Some badass townie girl got mad 
                    drunk and stabbed her friend to 
                    death, then ran off into the woods.

                                  LISBON
                    Kara Palmer is dead from loss of 
                    blood.  Nicole Gilbert is missing.  
                    Maybe she ran off.  Maybe she was 
                    abducted.  We don't know.  Don't 
                    assume anything.

                                  KYLE
                    Message received and understood, 
                    ma'am.  

      Kyle and the Rangers set off.

                                  LISBON
                    You know her.  Could Nicole have 
                    done this?

                                  NELSON
                    Who knows what others are capable 
                    of?  She sure had built up a lot of 
                    bad karma.  But I don't know.  
                    She's been turning her life around.  

                                  LISBON
                    Bad karma doesn't have an 
                      expiration date.

                    Actually it does, according to 
                      traditional Buddhist teaching.  
                    I'm counting on it.

                    People in town are already saying 
                    it was Nicole did this, but I don't 
                    believe it.   

      Leslie is silent, maybe a little less convinced of Nicole's 
      innocence?

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    She will have to tell me herself 
                    that she did this before I believe 
                    it.  Nicole loved our daughter and 
                    our daughter loved her.  We loved 
                    Nicole almost like she was our own.

                                  LESLIE
                    Almost.  

                                  GEORGE
                    Why?  Why would she kill her?  She 
                    had her troubles the Lord knows, 
                    but she wasn't crazy.

                    Has there been any tension between 
                    them lately?

                    We never met him but once or twice 
                    and he seemed nice enough.

                                  GEORGE

                    the tattoos and the piercings and 
                    all that, don't you?  But Kara 
                    didn't think much of him.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No?

                                  LESLIE
                    Didn't approve.  There might have 
                    been some tension there.

                                  RIGSBY
                    What was her problem with Jason?

                                  LESLIE
                    Just a feeling that he wasn't 
                      trustworthy I guess.  You know.  
                    But Nicole was in love.  She 
                    thought Kara was just jealous 
                    because Kara didn't have a 
                      boyfriend.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Did Jason ever get violent with 
                    Nicole?

                                  LESLIE
                    Not that I heard.  But I wouldn't 
                    be surprised.  Nicole's had her 
                    fair share of that type.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Kara didn't have a boyfriend?

                          (defensive)
                    Kara could have had anyone she 
                    liked.  She had no shortage of 
                    suitors.  But have you seen the men 
                    round here?  It's all drunken 
                      lumberjacks and hippie pot farmers.  
                    Kara had higher standards than 
                    that.

      At a loss, Nelson turns right around as if looking for an 
      alternative plan among the trees.

                    Nicole would have been barefoot, 
                    probably drunk.  It was a dark 
                    night.  No way she covers that much 
                    distance.  Someone must have her in 
                    a vehicle and Dexter lost the 
                    trail.

      Coming down off SIGNAGE to JASON O'TOOLE as he comes storming

                                  CHO
                    We'll do that.  Where is that

                    There's this whole issue with Kara 
                    we have to talk about.  Maybe that

                                  RIGSBY
                    Kara didn't like you.  Kara didn't 
                    think you were good enough for 
                    Nicole.  Thought you were 
                      untrustworthy.

                                  JASON
                    That's funny.  Is this what you do?  
                    You try to get me all upset, so I 
                    look guilty or something?

                                  CHO
                    Does it upset you?  That Kara 
                    didn't like you?  That she was 
                    trying to undermine you?

      Getting toward evening.  Twenty-five Cops, Rangers, Townie

                    Patrick Jane from the CBI wants to 
                    have a word with all of you.

                                  JANE
                    Thank you, Sheriff Nelson.

      Jane takes a beat to scan the crowd and fix their attention 
      on him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Look at me, all of you.  Listen 
                    closely.  I want you all to raise 
                    your hands in the air like this.  
                    Both hands.  You too, Sheriff.    
                    And you, Agent Lisbon.

      Everyone does as they're told because the Sheriff is 
      (reluctantly) doing it.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Good.  Very good.  One of you, one 
                    of you here, killed Kara Palmer and 
                    abducted Nicole Gilbert.  I want 
                    that person to lower their right 
                    hand now. 

      Nobody moves a muscle.  Everybody stares at Jane with their 
      hands in the air, silent.  Awkward.  Jane smiles sheepishly. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)

      FADE IN:

      INT. HOSPITAL. WAITING ROOM - NIGHT (N/1)1010

      Jane, Lisbon, Nelson and a DOCTOR looking through a doorway 
      at Nicole in bed, her head bandaged.

                                  DOCTOR
                    She had a nasty blow to her head.  
                    Moderate concussion.  Her feet are 
                    badly abraded, and she has a lot of 
                    minor scratches and bruises.  Mild 
                      hypothermia.  Physically she'll be 
                    fine in a day or so.  Mentally, 
                    it's another story.  When you 
                    brought her in, she was in some 
                    kind of a psychotic state.  We've 
                    medicated her to take the edge off 
                    that, but she's still in deep 
                    shock.  She has no memory at all of 
                    the events that brought her here.

                                  NELSON
                    That's convenient.  If I just 
                    stabbed my best friend to death, 
                    I'd want to forget too.  Soon as 
                    she's well enough, I'm charging her 
                    and taking her to jail.   

                                  LISBON
                    Sheriff, Nicole's in your custody, 
                    but the CBI is leading this 
                      investigation.  I'll decide when we 
                    file charges.  We don't have the 
                    full facts yet.  

                                  NELSON
                    Facts?  She's carrying what looks 
                    to be the murder weapon, and she's 
                    covered in what the forensic guys 
                    say is Kara's blood.  What more do 
                    you want?

                                  LISBON 
                    Is she well enough to talk to?

      The Doctor looks dubious.

                                  DOCTOR
                    As long as you're gentle with her. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       16.

                                  JANE
                    Have you told her Kara's dead?

                                  DOCTOR
                    No.  We didn't want to upset her.  
                    She's very fragile.

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER1111

      Jane and Lisbon and Nelson enter.  At first, Jane remains in 
      the BG with Nelson while Lisbon's at the bedside. 

                                  LISBON

                    happened to you and Kara.

                                  NICOLE
                    I told the doctor.  I can't

                                  NICOLE
                    My party.  I remember leaving 
                      Sullivan's and getting in the car 
                    with Kara.  You know where my

                    The next thing I remember,

                    No.

      Shivering manically, she buries her head in her pillow and 
      continues to murmur -- 'no no no.'  Lisbon looks to Nelson, 
      he reacts, then Lisbon turns to Jane --

                    I don't know.  I can't see.  It's 
                    dark.  It's cold.  There's a loud 
                    rushing noise.  Like water? 
                      Ssssshhss.    

                                  JANE
                    What happened next?

                                  NICOLE 
                    I don't, I can't remember.

                                  JANE
                    You have to.

      Nicole shivers convulsively.

                                  NICOLE
                    I can't.  I can't!  

      The Doctor and a Nurse hurry in.

                                  DOCTOR
                    What have you been doing to her?

                                  NELSON
                    That's bull right there.  She's got 
                    amnesia, but not so badly she can't 
                    finger someone else for killing 
                    Kara.  Rushing water my ass.

                                  JANE
                    No.  She's telling the truth.  
                    Something happened too horrible for 
                    her mind to handle.  Her memory's 
                    blocked.  

                                  NELSON 
                    Even if that's true, maybe it's 
                    blocked because she killed Kara.

                                  JANE
                    It's possible.  But I don't think 
                    so.  I think she's a victim.  


                                  NELSON 
                    How can you tell?

                                  JANE 
                    I can see it in her eyes.

                                  NELSON
                    Oh well then.  Why didn't you say 
                    so?  It's in her eyes.  Here's me 
                    looking for facts.

                                  JANE
                    Why would she kill her best friend?  
                    What's her motive?

                                  NELSON
                    Why do women kill other women?

                    Could've been fighting over Jason.  
                    Though he's no Brad Pitt.

      Jane doesn't think Jason has anything to do with it, so his 
      thoughts are elsewhere...

                    It rained hard for a good few hours 
                    last night.  Only when Nicole 
                      reappeared, she was still covered 
                    in blood.  So...    

                                  LISBON
                    She must have been under good cover 
                    when it rained.  She must have been 
                    indoors.

      Lisbon takes out her phone.

                                  NELSON
                    She was hiding.

                                  JANE
                    Or she was a captive.  Probably 
                    near the river, hence the sound of 
                    rushing water.

                                  LISBON

      INT. SHERIFF'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY (D/2)1818

      CLOSE ON THE MONITOR:  An AMATEUR VIDEO.  Grainy, handheld, 
      unfocused.  Friends, bar patrons, laughing, drinking, 
      celebrating the union of JASON AND NICOLE.  

      They talk to each other, to the camera.

      We PULL BACK to reveal Lisbon, Jane, Cho and Van Pelt 
      watching ON THE SCREEN.

                                  VAN PELT
                    How's Jason's alibi look?

                                  CHO
                    Alibi's solid.  Several people saw 
                    him passed out at the bar.  

      ON THE MONITOR:

      We now recognize Kara.  Laughing.  Beautiful.  An angel 
      indeed.  Her arm around Nicole.  We see the joy between such 
      good friends, the love that connects them...

                                  JANE
                    Damn.  Nelson was right.

                    About what?

                                  JANE
                    Look at Jason's camera work.  He's 
                    torn between Nicole and Kara.

      WE SEE what he means ON-SCREEN -- the video camera constantly 
      moving between the women.

                                  CHO
                    So he had a thing for Kara, maybe.  
                    It's no proof of a motive unless 
                    Nicole knew about it.

      ON-SCREEN Nicole and Kara kiss each other.

      Jane's steps out into --            THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       26.


      INT. HOSPITAL. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS2424

      Kyle the Ranger has stepped between Jason, drunk and mean, 
      and the Cop guarding Nicole's door.

                                  KYLE
                    Everybody take it down a notch.

                                  JANE
                    What's going on?

                                  COP
                    He was trying to sneak into her room.

                                  JASON
                    I was trying to visit my girl.  
                    I was walking right in. 

      JANE'S POV - Looking back into the room.  Nicole can't see 
      what's going on outside, but she's absolutely terrified.   
      Jane shuts the door.

                                  JANE
                    Nobody's allowed to see her right now. 

                                  KYLE
                    Have you got any weapons on you, 
                    Jason?

      Jason tries to push past the Cop and Kyle.  The Cop tries to 
      put him in an arm-lock, but Jason wrestles free.  Kyle steps 
      in to help, and together he and the Cop subdue Jason and cuff 
      him.  Jane closes the door as they are carrying Jason away, 
      still struggling in a silent determined redneck way.

      Jane takes Nicole's hand.  She's white as a sheet.

      He pulls up the chair, with his foot so that he can sit down 
      next to her without letting go of her hand. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Nicole, what was it in particular 
                    that scared you just now?

                    I don't know.

      INT. BAR. MEN'S ROOM - DAY2626

      As RULON FARNES (40's) takes a leak, turns to find Rigsby and 
      Cho blocking his way.  Rulon is a huge bear of a man in the 
      slightly eccentric garb of the Ron Paul voting, UFO spotting, 
      NRA badge-wearing kind of trucker, and a belligerent drunk.

                                  CHO
                    Rulon, we need to talk with you 
                    about Kara Palmer.

      They flash their BADGES.  Rulon laughs, zips up, and launches 
      himself at them. 

      INT. BAR. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS2727

      Van Pelt waiting outside the men's room, reacts to the SOUND 
      OF A FRACAS coming from inside the men's room.  She hesitates 
      for a second, reluctant to enter the men's room, then pushes 
      in through the door.

      INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS2828

      Van Pelt enters to find Rigsby on the floor stunned and Rulon 
      with Cho in a headlock.  Van Pelt doesn't miss a beat, takes 
      two steps and kicks Rulon in the balls.  Down goes Rulon in a 
      heap on top of Cho and Rigsby.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Jane sitting in a chair, waiting for Nicole to wake up, 
      gazing at the buzzing fluorescent ceiling light.  An IV drips 
      by her bed.  Somewhere close by O.S, a PIANO begins to play.  
      Random chords and notes resolve into a simple but plangent 
      rendition of 'Fur Elise.'

                                                                    QUICK CUT TO:

      This is the kind of cozy small town hospital which shares 
      space with a senior's assisted living facility.  So just down 
      the hallway form Nicole's room, an OLD LADY in a dressing 
      gown plays a BATTERED OLD UPRIGHT PIANO, while other SENIORS 
      play cards, etc.

      Jane answer in a daze.

                    What?  Yes?  Okay.  I'll be there. 

      He pockets the phone.  Then takes a moment to compose 
      himself.  Nicole is sleeping peacefully.            THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       29.


      INT. SHERIFF'S HEADQUARTERS. INTERVIEW AREA-NIGHT(N/2)3535

      Cho and Van Pelt are with Rulon.  

                                  CHO
                    So, how is it you know Kara Palmer?

                                  RULON
                    This town is on my regular run.    
                    I stop here to eat.  Hunting 
                    store's next to the diner.  Walked 
                    in there one day and those tight 
                    little buns caught my attention. 
                    So hey, boy meets girl.  I go over 
                    and start a conversation. 

      Van Pelt chafes.  This man is repulsive.

      Jane enters quietly, sits in BG.  Beside him; a BOX LABELED 
      EVIDENCE.  As Jane rummages through the high heels, the 
      cosmetics, the MP3 Player...

                                  CHO
                    What did you talk about?

                                  RULON
                    I told her I'd give her ten dollars 
                    to sit in my lap.  She said no.  
                    But she said no like I was low-
                    balling her.  Not like no to the 
                    general principle.  So I've been 
                    courting her you might say.  When I 
                    come through here, I stop by and 
                    give her free stuff.  

                                  VAN PELT 
                    What did you expect from Kara in 
                    return for the free stuff?

                                  RULON
                    I gave her a lot of stuff.    
                    I'm thinking eventually, some form 
                    of sexual congress.

                                  VAN PELT
                    And what did you get?

                                  RULON 
                    I disgust you, don't I?

      Rulon looks awkward...

                                  RULON
                      Two-ninety, something like that. 
                    It's none of your business. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    You expected sexual favors from

                    God she was beautiful.  There's 
                    nothing more beautiful than a 
                    beautiful woman is there?  Music 
                    maybe.  A perfect melody.  But what 
                    else is as powerful?  

                                  CHO
                    What did you get from Kara?

                                  RULON
                    Nothing at all, so far.  In France 
                    they would call her a coquette.  
                    But I had high hopes for the 
                    future.  There's always hope.

                    Yes there is.

      Jane exits the room.  Van Pelt and Cho exchange a glance. 
      What made Jane leave?   But they cover it nicely.

                    Jane, you want to have a crack at

                          (almost shouting)
                    Let him go.

      Lisbon pulls out the earbuds.

                    You're such policemen.  Yes.  Let 
                    him go.  Set him free.  He's 
                    telling the truth.

                    You know this how?

                                  JANE
                    He liked Kara.  So why would he 
                    kill her and kidnap Nicole?  
                    Doesn't make sense.  And he blushed 
                    when he lied about his weight.  
                    A man without guile.  Innocent.  
                    And Kara is not quite as innocent 
                    as she's been painted.

                    An honest creep, whose stuff she 
                    took, knowing what kind of a man he 
                    was. 

                                  LISBON
                    Free eyeliner doesn't make her a 
                    whore.  And a blushing man, 
                      embarrassed by his weight hardly 
                    makes him innocent.  It makes him 
                    sensitive about his weight.  Hey, 
                    is that Kara's MP3 player?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                    I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was 
                    a sacred thing.  I'll put it back

                    You can go.  Sorry for the

      Rulon looks a little disappointed.

      INT. CBI SEDAN - NIGHT3939

      Parked along a stretch of highway, Lisbon and Rigsby sit, 
      fixed on a TRUCK ahead.  On the backseat is a computer with a 
      TRACKING GRAPHIC.  The truck pulls up to a BAR and parks.  
      The side of the truck reads EARTHLY PURE COSMETICS.  Even 
      from a distance, the figure of Rulon is easy to spot climbing 
      out of the truck and waddling into the bar.

      Rigsby starts searching the car.

      Rigsby comes up with a ketchup sachet, and considers, but 
      discards it.  Lisbon leans her seat back to settle in for a 
      long wait.  Listens to the WHOOSH of CARS PASS...            THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       35.

                    Hey, Nicole.

      She opens her eyes.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (quietly)
                    You want to get out of here?

      Nicole nods.  Jane hands her a bag.  Pulls out the contents.  
      Sweats.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Put these on first.  Quick as you 
                    can.

      INT. HOSPITAL. HALLWAY - NIGHT4141

      In front of Nicole's hospital room is the same Uniformed Cop.  
      Jane comes out of Nicole's room.

      ...And lifts the peaked cap deftly from the man's head, as if 
      it were his job to do so.

                    Hey.

      Jane disappears round the corner.  The Cop feels compelled to 
      follow.  Jane reappears a beat later.  He leaves the cop's 
      cap on his chair, leads Nicole from her room, dressed now, 
      and they hasten away together.          THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       35A.

                    You have to.  Wherever you go, 
                    until you know the truth of what 
                    happened, you'll be haunted.  Until

      Then Jane lets silence hang.  Lets Nicole gaze at the ribbon 
      of road unspooling and listen to the music.

      Nicole grows pale, restless.

                                   NICOLE

                    Yes!  Yes.  How did you know that?

                    keeping from you.  But she had to 
                    tell you.  She had to be honest.

                    I'm gonna be sick.

      Nicole's eyes go wide as she remembers what happened next.

      EXT. FLAGSHIP ROAD - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT4545

      Nicole spills out from her seat.  Kneels beside the car.    
      An emotional wreck.  Dry heaves.  Kara yells from inside the 
      car.

                    Nicole, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.

      Nicole and Kara are momentarily blinded when they are 
      abruptly bathed in the HEADLIGHTS OF A TRUCK that pulls up,

                    Get in the car!

      Nicole stands up, turns to the MAN approaching, she squints.  
      The light still preventing US or her from seeing him.

                    Hey Mister, are you looking for a 
                    good time?  Because my friend here 
                    is a cheap whore.  She'll be happy

                      Pineapple.  He smelled of 
                      pineapple.

      INT. ABANDONED RESORT LODGE - NIGHT6868

      Lisbon frowns.

                                  LISBON
                      Pineapple?  What the hell go --

      She sees Kyle react, and, oh damn.  Lisbon's eyes go wide for 
      an instant as she remembers where she just smelled pineapple.

    END FLASHBACK

7070INT. ABANDONED RESORT LODGE - NIGHT 

      Lisbon and Kyle look at each other.  DOES HE KNOW THAT SHE 
      KNOWS?  She tries to act normal, while moving slowly for her 
      gun.  Kyle's armed too, and still not quite sure. 

                                  LISBON
                          (carefully to phone)
                    Okay.  Good.  Listen.  Tell Rigsby 
                    to go help Teresa.  I'm at the 
                    Eagle Pine Resort off Route Six.    

      Lisbon drops her phone into her jacket pocket without turning 
      it off.  Uses one finger to unsnap her holster guardstrap.  
      Kyle has his hand on his gun.  It's a gunfighter type 
      situation. 

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Kyle, let's stay calm and think 
                    this through.

      Lisbon and Kyle stand off -- neither wanting to be beaten by 
      a faster draw.  

                                  LISBON
                    I don't want to have to shoot you. 
                    But I do need to take you into 
                    custody for killing Kara Palmer.  
                    What are we going to do about that?

                                  KYLE
                    It's not like I set out to hurt 
                    her.  I just wanted to talk to 
                    Nicole.   

                                  LISBON
                    Before she ran off to get married?

                                  KYLE
                    I've noticed her around town for a 
                    long time.  I didn't want her 
                    marrying that guy Jason.  She was 
                    too good for him.   

                                  LISBON
                    Please, Kyle.  I really truly don't 
                    want to hurt you.

                                  KYLE

      A split second in suspense and then, simultaneously, they go 
      for their guns, and duck for cover.  Neither gets a clear 
      shot and they retreat away from each other, FIRING.

      INT. JANE'S CAR - NIGHT7474

      Jane can only listen.  The SOUND of the FOREST and GUNFIRE 
      over the phone.  Then silence.  He can't just do nothing...

      Lisbon and Kyle are concealed from each other at opposite 
      ends of the big dark room.

      INT. RESORT LODGE - A MOMENT LATER7777

      Kyle peeks out from behind a book shelf, gun in hand.  Ducks 
      back.  When he does so, Lisbon emerges from cover long enough 
      to slide her cellphone across the floor to the other side of 
      the room. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST       "Redwood"       SALMON 8/21/08       50.

      She takes a deep breath, girds herself, waits...

                          (over cellphone)
                    Lisbon, be careful! 

      BLAM BLAM BLAM -- Kyle blasts away at the cellphone. 

      While Kyle's attention is on the cellphone, Lisbon sprints 
      from cover and GETS OUT THE FRONT DOOR before Kyle can react.

      Kyle follows her, RUNS TO THE DOOR, jacking a new magazine 
      into his gun.  Pausing in the doorway to see which way she's 
      gone, a gun is placed at his temple.

                                  LISBON
                    Drop it.

      Kyle hesitates.  Maybe he should go for broke.  Another gun 
      is placed against the other side of his head, by Rigsby. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Really.  Drop it.

      Kyle drops the gun.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT'D)
                    On your knees, hands on your head.

      Kyle obeys.  Rigsby downs him and cuffs him.

      Lisbon sits down, suddenly very tired.  

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                          (over cellphone)
                    Lisbon!  Lisbon!  Are you alright?  
                    Lisbon!  Lisbon...

      EXT. SHERIFF'S HEADQUARTERS. PARKING LOT - DAY (D/3)7878

      It's a wet down.  With the help of local UNIs, Jane, Lisbon, 
      Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt load up the CBI Suburban and Sedan.  
      Nicole finds Jane...

                                  NICOLE
                    Was hoping I'd find you here.

                    We're about to hit the road.

      Nicole gives Jane a hug.  In the BG George Palmer EXITS the 
      Sheriff's Headquarters carrying the BOX of EVIDENCE.

                      Eventually you'll remember the good 
                    stuff.

      Nicole nods, wanting to believe that.  George approaches, 
      goes to Lisbon.

                                  GEORGE

                    Bye.

      George and Nicole walk off.  Jane and Lisbon walk back to the 
      CBI vehicles, kind of blue.  Lisbon looks for a cheery 
      subject...
