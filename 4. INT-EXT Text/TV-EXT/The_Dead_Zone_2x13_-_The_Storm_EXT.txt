          The Cruiser parks, BRUCE alone inside, and we can hear
          the car radio tuned to a news station before he turns off
          the engine...

                        ...a few clouds... maybe a widely
                          scattered sprinkle or two...
                        nothing to spoil our Fourth of
                        July weekend...

          That's all and he's out, moving toward the administration
          building... a light roll of thunder brings his attention
          to --


22HIS POV - THE SKY (STOCK)

            scattered clouds but not overcast... an interesting sky...
          one cloud though looks kind of ominous... a thunderhead...


  33RESUME BRUCE

          as he grins and shakes his head...

                                        BRUCE
                                (to himself)
                        If you don't like the weather in
                        Maine, just wait a few minutes.



          Rolling thunder.          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - TEASER - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE     4.



          Modern, not old fashioned.  As Bruce pulls in to fill
          up... and they get out of the car...

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't you go wander off.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (waving the cane)
                        Where am I going to wander off
                        to?

          Johnny enters the cafe as Bruce pumps the gas...



          As they come out... but Johnny is not the usual Johnny -
          he's not into this... he doesn't want to be a hero... he
          feels more like a victim than a hero...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, this better be on the level
                        because if you're just trying
                        to...
                                (get out of the

    20CONTINUED:20

          But he can see that Johnny is in a dark place... genuinely
            concerned... the internal pain that Johnny has been
          containing for months is moving to the surface...

                                        JOHNNY
                        How many times do I have to see
                          something like this?  How many
                        people have to die in my mind
                        before I go crazy? 

          Bruce looks at him... and now Johnny makes eye contact
          with him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why do I have to live with these
                        things?  I'm a human being.

          It's all said quietly, painfully, lost... seeking answers
          where there are none.  Bruce sees the pain his friend is
          in... tries to reassure him -- compassionate --

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, you may have just saved lives
                        back there...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quiet, to himself)
                        Too many lives to save.  Too many
                        lives I can't save.  

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, John... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't... do this anymore.  I
                        can't have these visions in my
                        head any more.

          He moves to the car.  Bruce isn't sure what to do next...
          quietly --

                                        BRUCE
                        So what do you want to do, John? 
                        I mean, about the storm.  

          A long beat as Johnny struggles with the weight of the
            responsibility... Bruce understands he needs to lead him
          here...

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Look, there's an airfield a few
                        miles west of here... it's just a
                        little out of our way... we need
                        to find someone tied into the
                        weather service... warn them,
                        don't you think?

                                (he waits for a
                                  response, doesn't
                                get one, grabs his
                                cell)
                        Come on, get in.  We'll backtrack
                        this way later.  I'll call the
                        others to let them know we'll be
                        late.

          Johnny opens the car door to get in... a chip planted
          firmly on his shoulder... a chip against the fates, even
          against God...

                                        JOHNNY

                        You're driving. 





          staying tight on them as they exit the car... Bruce and
          Johnny fight the wind and hail (and don't get seriously
          wet)... and duck inside the culvert, grabbing on to
          whatever they can...


  2626ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE CULVERT

          the chaos of the storm around them... out of breath...

                                        BRUCE
                        My car... I can't see my car...

          Suddenly from straight overhead... the cruiser comes
          crashing down from the sky right on the front bumper...
          smashing and crunching up like an accordion just yards
          away...

          On their reactions...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Bruce walking along the rural highway... the
          sound of a car... it's approaching... they wave their
          arms...

                                        JOHNNY & BRUCE
                        Hey... wait... slow down...

          The car passes without slowing down...

                                        BRUCE
                                (to the unseen driver)
                        Thank you, thank you very much. 
                                (beat)
                        That's five, five 'good' people
                        who looked right at us and made a
                          conscious decision to ignore us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, well we're officially
                          hitchhikers now.  A lot people
                        won't pick up hitchhikers.

                                (not really serious,
                                using it to make his
                                  point)
                        No this is your fault.  You've
                        lost the karma, man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh sure, blame my karma. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You have turned your back on the
                        world and the world is turning
                        its back on us.

          Another car approaches... not a car... a Winnebago...
          they signal it to stop... it passes, then hits the
            brakes... so hard they squeal... Johnny and Bruce run to
          the car...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't hear you giving my karma
                        credit, man.

          As they reach the Winnebago, the window rolls down to
          reveal a housewife in her forties, we'll call her FLO...
          driving is her husband, MITCH, and there are two kids,
          eight and ten, MITCH JUNIOR and FIONA.

          Dana comes out of the cabin, carrying a folding chair...
          she's wearing a conservative and yet snug and sexy two

                                        DANA (CONT'D)
                        Now that you're finally out of
                        the kitchen.  
                                (moving past her, to
                                  others)
                        Phone lines are down... I couldn't
                        get through to the office...

                                        WALT
                        There's your storm...

                                        SARAH
                        What about cell phones?

                                        PURDY
                        Sorry.  One of the blessings of
                        the retreat -- there's no reception
                        up here.

          As Dana opens the chair and lays down, staring at the
          dead fish...

                                        DANA
                                (re: the fish)
                        Are these edible?



          As the Winnebago moves toward the gas station/cafe... 
          half the cafe has been flattened, the other half is barely
          hanging together... there is debris everywhere... it looks
          like... well, it looks like a tornado has been there...


  3131ANGLE ON THE WINNEBAGO

          as it pulls to a stop... and Johnny and Bruce get out,
          followed by the McMurtrys...  there are downed power lines
          fritzing... smoke...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call 9-1-1.  Better keep the kids
                        inside the van... 

          The parents acknowledge... John moves with a purpose toward
          the wreckage...

                                        BRUCE
                        John, be careful... you've got
                        live power lines...

          Bruce trails as Johnny moves carefully to the creaky
            structure... Johnny moves closer and touches the debris...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT TWO - 5/12/03 - 2nd WHITE  29.

          A DZ SOUND EFFECT... Push to Johnny as he realizes --

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are people in there... and
                        they're alive...  

          Johnny moves around the precarious structure...  Bruce
          follows him, almost loses his footing on debris... the
          McMurtys react...

                                        MITCH
                        Stay here. 
                                (just in case something
                                  happens)
                        I love you, mother.

          Kisses her on the cheek and rushes to help Johnny and
          Bruce... Johnny starts to duck down into an open space
          and pulls debris out of the way... the others move in to
            assist...


          ANGLE

          as they quickly clear their way to a basement door... and
          find five people huddled there... safe... but scared and
          hearts beating...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Anybody hurt?

                                        MANAGER
                        No... as soon as I heard the
                        freight train coming... I started
                          thinking about what you said and
                        moved everyone to the basement...

                                        BRUCE
                        Freight train?

                                        MANAGER
                                (out of breath)
                        That's what it sounded like...
                        only we don't have no tracks out
                        here...  

          As they move out of the dangerous structure... it collapses
          behind them...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT TWO - 5/01/03 - GREEN      30.


  31A31ASOME TIME LATER

            Emergency vehicles are now on the scene... fire trucks,
          an ambulance...  Medics are attending to the Manager and
          his people... finding Mitch Jr. and Fiona by the Winnebago,
          both paying no attention, he's still Gameboying it, she's
          still bobbing her head to the MP3... and now, moving to
          Mitch and Flo.

                                        MITCH
                        Johnny, we'd love to stay but
                        this is just a little too exciting
                        for the missus and me... we're
                        heading down south to Graceland
                        next...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for your help, Mitch.

          Johnny feels a hand touch his arm... he looks at Flo who
          smiles bashfully... pulls it back...

                                        FLO
                        Sorry, I had to do it... everyone
                        at home will ask if I touched  
                        Johnny Smith...  

                                        MITCH
                        So?  What'dju see...?

                                        FLO
                        Mitch, stop.

                                        MITCH
                        No.  What'dju see...

                                        FLO
                        I don't want to know.  Unless
                        it's really bad of course.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw a safe trip.

          The McMurtrys climb back into the Winnebago... wave good-
          bye... as they pull away, Johnny and Bruce look over and
          see --


          NEW ANGLE - TONI GETTING OUT OF A SMALL TRUCK

          She's just arrived... looking at the damage, stunned... 
          she moves to the back of the truck where some weather
            equipment is set up, including a laptop computer with
          wireless internet connection to get images while on the
          road... moving over to her --

                        How's your algorithm?

                                        TONI
                          Embarrassed.  I don't understand
                        it... it never showed up on the
                          radar... nothing on satellite
                          coverage... 

                                        BRUCE
                        Are these satellite pictures taken
                        in intervals?

                                        TONI
                                (nods)
                        Every fifteen minutes.  Radar
                        every six minutes.  I guess it
                        could have happened between
                          intervals... although this kind
                        of damage... it's hard to believe. 
                        Based on the visual evidence, I'd
                        almost want to guess an F-3
                          event... except... well I hate to
                        use the word 'impossible' twice
                        in one day...

                                        BRUCE
                        Except what?

                                        TONI
                        In its entire recorded history,
                        Maine's never had an F-3.

          Johnny and Bruce react... thunder rumbles... they look
          up... Toni looks to Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are your systems showing
                        now?

          Looking at portable radar screens, data analysis readouts
          [see: www.nssl.noaa.gov/wrd/msd/wdss.html]... on a laptop
          she has open...

                        this area is at twelve...

                                        BRUCE
                        What's that mean exactly?

                        It means there's a sixty-two
                        percent chance this storm will
                        result in additional tornado
                          activity.

          But a few heavy drops of rain have started falling again...
          we can see splats on the truck, the roadside... Johnny
          looks up and opens his palm to feel the rain and as...

          FILLED WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING... AND WE'RE THROWN
          AROUND AND SPEEDING THROUGH CLOUDS... AT INCREDIBLE
          SPEED... FOR MILES... AND THEN JUST AS SUDDENLY, WE'RE

                        They're in danger.  We have to
                        warn them.  There's still time.

                        Lot of tourists up there this
                          weekend.  But phone lines all

                        out by the storm.

          They hustle into the truck and as they take off pan up to
          the sky to see threatening lightning crackle between

          And I'm feeling we should keep the weather threatening
          for most of Johnny's journey now... not rain but a
            dangerous looking sky... full of electricity...

          They move toward the cabin... but Sarah's eyes say she's
          not at all sure about the drift of the conversation they

                                        JOHNNY
                        A storm that doesn't show up on
                          radar... like the storm in '95...
                        a storm that seems to be following
                        us... you said it yourself...

                                        BRUCE
                        John, a joke... that's all it
                        was...

          Bruce is a spiritual man and he even considers what Johnny
          says for a moment but he just can't bring himself to buy
          it - after all, the coincidences really could be
            coincidental - they aren't so out of the ordinary.  Almost
          to bolster his own beliefs --

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Toni, tell him that storms don't
                        have minds of their own.

                                        TONI
                        Storms don't have minds of their
                        own.  Of course, I still wouldn't
                        go out with Bobby Tucci if he
                        called.

                        Okay, I'm reading a weak rotational
                        couplet at 21-0-6 UTC... not
                        good...

                          Bruce... if we left... if we drove
                        in the opposite direction, maybe
                        we could draw the storm... I know
                        you'll say it's crazy but...

                                        BRUCE
                        ...it's crazy...

                        away from...

                                        BRUCE
                        John... okay, I've seen some
                        strange things around you... but
                        what you're saying... it just
                        doesn't... it's the weather...

                          environment...

                        We're five minutes from the
                          retreat.

          He drives... Johnny looks straight ahead... internal
            confusion in his eyes...



          As Johnny comes outside, in this incredible storm and
          stares at --          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT FOUR - 5/12/03 - 2nd WHITE  54.


  6161THE MONEY SHOT... THE FULL FUNNEL OF AN F-3 TORNADO IN

                        I'm a science teacher... and I'm
                        the first to admit... that the
                          universe is full of things that
                        I'll never understand... of...

                        Is that to scare me?  Or is it
                        just a... a... random wind shear? 
                        Because... honestly?    I can't
                        even begin to accept the notion
                        that you've been sent here like...
                        like... the whale was sent to
                        swallow Jonah... to teach me some
                        kind of lesson... I'm sorry, I
                        just... can't... I can't conceive

                        So now I'm helpless again... what
                        power do I have over a storm,
                        over fate, over destiny?  None.

          He takes a deep breath, tells himself to get on with it...
          and gets to the bargain...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        But if it will help... and believe
                        me I can't believe I'm saying
                        this... if it will save my
                        friends... and anyone else on
                        this lake today... I can tell you
                        one thing about the universe that
                        I do understand now... and that's
                        my place in it... and I will accept
                        that.  If you will spare them... 

          The tornado seems to be inches from Johnny as we intercut
          between him and it... and without resolving anything...

          FADE IN:


          is out.  It looks like a perfect day.  We don't see the
          house.


  6868CLOSE ON THE LATCH TO THE STORAGE CELLAR

          Sun shining on it... someone inside is trying to break
          out... and after a couple of hard rams from inside... the
          screws of the latch give way and the door opens...

          Walt leads the way out with Bruce... Sarah, Dana, Toni
          and Purdy follow... and react as we widen to see...

          The cabin is nothing but rubble... surrounded by a wide
          path of destruction... trees down everywhere... amazingly
          the cars that brought them - if we can see them from here -
          have been spared.

          It is a stunning revelation and these people are
          emotionally shaken... not only by the house... but the
          thought that Johnny has been torn limb from limb...

          is lying face down, arms splayed, unconscious or asleep

            gently...


          HIS EYES SNAP OPEN

          and he takes a sharp breath as though waking from a
            nightmare... sits upright... heart pounding... he's dirty,
          has scratches on his face... shirt torn... he looks at
          his hands and touches himself... as though to reassure
          himself that he's whole...

          A tear rolls down her cheek.  Johnny looks at her a

                        Montrachet while we waited.

          We can hear sirens in the distance... the group moves
          apart to check out the awesome damage, leaving Johnny and

                                (to Johnny)
                        We could use you in the national
                        weather service.  You don't need
                        a job, do you?

                                        BRUCE
                        He already has one.

          And as she walks back toward her truck, we pull back and
          up...

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do I get all those people out
                        of my house?

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
