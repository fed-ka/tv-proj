  CLOSE ON a well-muscled back.  WIDEN to REVEAL SPARTACUS, 
  Sura's binding beneath his shackled wrist as TWO GUARDS lead 
  him to the cliff.

  BATIATUS

  stands waiting for him, looking out across the parched 
  mountains.  The Guards shove Spartacus forward.  A beat.

                                        BATIATUS

                        No, Dominus.

  Batiatus finally looks over, pinning Spartacus with hard 
  eyes.

                        Yet you dishonor me.  An agreement

                        submit to gladiatorial training!

                        for your dear precious wife!  But 
                        your haste bested you.  Defying

  PUSH IN on Spartacus as his jaw sets in resolve, the 
  background BLURRING ANGRILY as it TRANSITIONS US TO --



  The punishing sun beats down on the parched earth. 
  Gladiators train, sweat dotting their hardened bodies. 
  CAMERA FINDS CRIXUS and VARRO, intensely sparring, their 
  muscles bulging with each vicious blow. TIME SLOWS as

  SPARTACUS

  enters the square in shackles, led by Barca and Ashur. His 
  brow set, the crimson and ash veneer inviting stares from 
  Gladiators who have lowered their swords to gawk at the 
  walking dead man.

  Crixus spits in contempt. Varro tenses, taking in the 
    information. Doctore cracks his whip.

  The men resume training. Doctore recoils his whip, eyeing 
  Spartacus with stern regret as he s shoved next to KERZA, 
  also smeared with ash and blood. A tense beat as they 
  exchange looks.

  As we SMASH CUT, the SCREAMED DECLARATION is QUICKLY 
  REPLACED BY THE SOUND OF --



  The SUN blazes in the sky. ADJUST DOWN to find a MERCHANTS  
    THOROUGHFARE buzzing with activity. The ARENA looms in the 
  background beyond the mouth of the alley.

  LUCRETIA

  stands impatiently in front of a jewelry cart full of 
  hanging necklaces, earrings, bracelets, etc. Beads of sweat 
  dot her fair skin as she struggles against the heat. Naevia, 
  equally wilted, stands by her side.

  RAMEL, the jeweler from 103, holds the emerald necklace to 
  his eye, inspecting the piece.

  Solonius bows to Lucretia, moves off. Lucretia glares after

  The Gladiators train under the blazing sun. Sweat courses 
  down their rippling muscles, streaking filth from torsos. 
  Wooden swords CLASH against battered shields.

  SPARTACUS

  watches from across the square where he sits on the parched 
  earth.  Eyes distant and increasingly hollow, hand rubbing 
  his wrist where Sura's binding once resided.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        I always wondered how you acquired 
                        the name.

  Crixus stops, glares at Ashur.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You have words of purpose, speak 
                        them.

  Ashur forces a smile.

                                        ASHUR
                        I was merely curious.  The gift I 
                        procured for you -- did it satisfy 
                        its intended?

                                        BARCA
                        Gift?

                                        ASHUR
                      An opal necklace, of the finest --

  Crixus  foot shoots out, kicking Ashur s bad leg out from 
  under him. He goes down hard, grunting in pain. Doctore 
  glances over, turns away.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your tongue rattles too freely in 
                        your mouth! Secure it, or see it 
                        join that useless leg of yours.

  Ashur deferentially backpedals.

                                        ASHUR
                        Apologies. The question was born of 
                        goodwill, I assure you.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Fuck your good will in the ass.

  Crixus moves away with Barca in tow. Ashur s eyes darken 
  with hatred as he painfully rises.

                                        BARCA
                        What necklace does the shit speak 
                        of?

                                        CRIXUS
                        It s nothing. Let it pass.

  Barca s eyes narrow.

                                        BARCA
                        You mad fuck. A trinket for 
                        Lucretia s pet, wasn t it?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

                        Rest your mind. I am of no interest 
                      to Naevia.

                                        BARCA
                        Nor her to you, if you favor your 
                        cock attached to your balls.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Barca!

  Barca turns to Batiatus, who stands on the other side of the 
  gate separating the Mess Hall from the stairs leading to the 
  villa.

                                        BATIATUS
                        See to Spartacus! I want him ready 
                      to fight before the sun falls.

                                        BARCA
                        Yes, dominus!

  Barca heads for Spartacus.

                                          BARCA(cont'd)
                        Rise, dog! More death awaits!

  Spartacus painfully rises, the motion WIPING US TO --



  Shafts of MOONLIGHT illuminate the square. Batiatus steps 
  out from the shadows with a dazed Spartacus in tow. Batiatus 
  stops, turning to Spartacus with a warm smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The promise is kept.

  Batiatus indicates the edge of the cliff. Spartacus looks 
  over, his eyes filling with wonder and relief as he sees

  SURA

  standing there with his back to him, the full, lush moon 
  caressing her diaphanous white gown. (The same one from 
  Spartacus  vision/memory in episode 102.) Her hair and dress 
  flutter in the warm breeze. 

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura...

  She turns, a gentle, sad smile gracing her perfect face. 
  Spartacus rushes to her, tears streaking his cheeks. He 
  takes her in his arms, kissing her, a drowning man finally 
  blessed with air again.

                                        SURA
                                  soft)(
                        I will always be with you...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

  Behind them, the MOON DARKENS with clouds, turning BLOOD 
  RED.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        Even in death.

  Lightning FLASHES in the sky. Spartacus eyes it with 
  confusion and worry.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        The rains are coming...

  He turns back to her, freezes in horror. TEARS OF BLOOD fall 
  across her cheeks.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura --

                                        SURA
                        Save me.  Before they wash 
                        everything away...

  THUNDER BOOMS. RAIN begins to fall. Drops land on Sura s 
  gown -- but it s not water. It s BLOOD. They streak Sura s 
  white gown, her hair and face dripping with it. Spartacus 
  falls to his knees in front of her, equally bloodied, 
  screaming to the heavens in agony and loss.

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  Batiatus steps out in his dressing gown, drawn by the sound. 
  There is no rain of blood. No Sura. Only Spartacus in the 
  moonlight, losing his mind. Batiatus stares for a beat, then 
  heads back into the villa, his body WIPING US TO --



  The dead body of Drunkard #1 crashes to the sand, landing 
  beside the body of Drunkard #2. Ashur inspects the bodies 
  with a torch for light. Batiatus favors his bloody side as 
  he rails at Barca. Barca s arm drips blood, his wound not 
  yet addressed.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You, my protector! And here I stand 
                        bloodied!

                                        BARCA
                        I did not see there was another.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You must see all when my life is 
                        the balance! Ring your crown with 
                        eyes, or have the two you possess 
                        ripped from your fucking skull!

                                        ASHUR
                        Their flesh carries a brand, 
                        Dominus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Of what origin?

                                        ASHUR
                        Unfamiliar. But certainly the mark 
                      of a slave.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A slave? They send common slaves to 
                        kill Batiatus!

  Batiatus erupts, viciously kicking the dead bodies. 
  Goodfellas by way of Tony Soprano.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Common... fucking... slaves?!

  He tires, takes a moment to catch his breath and resumes his 
  calm.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Discover their master. I wish to 
                        have words with him.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  Batiatus' eyes turn cold with malevolent intent as he sweeps

  Doctore leads Spartacus into the moonlit square.  Batiatus 
  stands waiting, a gleaming GLADIUS gripped tightly in his 
  hand.  Spartacus eyes the sword as he stops in front of his 
  master, knowing his fate. And accepting it.  A long beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My wife believes you are cursed by 
                        the gods. I m inclined to agree.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You ll find no argument.

                        The rational course would be to end 
                        your miserable life. Before it 
                        further infects mine.

  Spartacus offers no resistance to the idea.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        A promise was made. You would find 
                        Sura --

                                        BATIATUS
                      -- if you died in The Pits. Yet 
                        here you stand, alive.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      As do you.

  A long beat. Batiatus  fingers tighten on the sword and -- 
  he suddenly turns it around, offering it to Spartacus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The promise is kept. I will 
                        continue the search for her.

  Spartacus regards the handle, surprised to find SURA S 
  PURPLE BINDING tied round it. He takes it, unsure of the 
  meaning.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You saved my life. Gods or not, a 
                        debt that demands repayment.
                                to Doctore)(
                        He s to rejoin the gladiators for 
                        training as soon as he s able.

  Batiatus walks off. Doctore graces Spartacus with the 
  faintest of smiles, then follows after Batiatus. Spartacus 
  stands alone, awash in the moonlight. Sword in hand. Hope 
  growing in his heart. A gladiator once more.


  BLACKOUT.
