A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous
low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19"
television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO
BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a
distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see
that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice
sheet in an otherwise featureless land.
A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.
CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN
Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are
dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we
squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting
foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They
continue toward us, the wind beating against them,
CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before
them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.
FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES
As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in
the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the
men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their
quarry.
CUT TO:
In a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids.
RISING UP out of the hole to REVEAL the parched dirt
patch where THREE KIDS are running away from us, as fast
as their feet will take them. Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT
(five floorplans to choose from, including the model
home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND
appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.
CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the
surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the
distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.
As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing
but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the
landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.
Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling
into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING. CAMERA DROPPING
AGAIN as the lead engine pulls up. FIREMEN are hopping
off, moving to the hole the boys dug.
LOW ANGLE UP FROM BELOW GROUND LEVEL, IN THE DUGOUT
HOLE
TWO firemen carrying a ladder clamber down PAST CAMERA,
THREE OTHERS appearing on their heels. The other two
firemen clamber down, too. THE CAPTAIN at the edge of
the hole watching them. Holding a radio.
FIRE CAPTAIN
This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've
got a rescue situation in progress...
CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF
NEIGHBORS:
Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends.
They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen.
Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking
at:
A MED-EVAC CHOPPER
Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at
high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the
neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just
over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard
scrabble.
The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE
PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA
PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The
Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire
Captain watches this, then stares toward --
DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the
chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him
in route.
BRONSCHWEIG
(over the chopper)
Keep those people back. Get them out
of here.
FIRE CAPTAIN
(to his men)
Move them all back.
(dogging Bronschweig)
I sent four men down after the boy.
They're not responding.
Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's
making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie
is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed
QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad.
Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good
look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.
ANGLE ON CHOPPER
As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid
shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes
flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop
wash blowing:
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper
bank away, then turns his look to:
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are
rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks
like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE
UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these
vehicles.)
RESUME BRONSCHWEIG
As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off.
FIRE CAPTAIN
What about my men?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
(brusquely)
We're doing all we can.
And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the
MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles,
scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what
the hell's going on. Watching the first of many
REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel
carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him.
Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.
HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The
sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing
we are:
The chopper is banking over the side of the building,
preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI
AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND
appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK
LATER.
The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is
thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT
IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.
Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority,
approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps
up.
FBI AGENT
We've evacuated the building and been
through it bottom to top. No trace of
an explosive device or anything
resembling one.
S.A.C. MICHAUD
Have you taken the dogs through?
FBI AGENT
Yes, sir.
S.A.C. MICHAUD
Well, take them through again.
This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat
weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud
does not register this attitude, though. Something else
has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the
edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what
he sees now.
On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI
AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA
CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C
Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like
what he sees. And what he sees is:
Special Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading
onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too,
is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her
cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for
something. Dialing the number of:
SCULLY
Mulder -- it's me --
MULDER (FILTER)
Where are you, Scully?
SCULLY
I'm on the roof.
MULDER (FILTER)
Did you find something?
SCULLY
(impatiently)
No. I haven't.
MULDER (FILTER)
What's wrong, Scully?
SCULLY
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm
hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to
be honest, what I'm doing here.
MULDER (FILTER)
You're looking for a bomb.
SCULLY
I know that. But the threat was called
in for the Federal Building across the
street.
MULDER (FILTER)
I think they have that covered.
WE ARE TRACKING WITH SCULLY.
SCULLY
(impatience)
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat
is called in, the logical purpose of
providing this information is to allow
us to find the bomb. The rational
object of terrorism is to promote
terror. If you'd study model
behavioral pattern in virtually every
case where a threat has turned up an
explosive device. If we don't act in
accordance with that data -- if you
ignore it as we have done -- the
chances are great that if here
actually is a bomb we might not find
it. Lives could be lost --
Scully, engrossed in her own argument, realizes she's
been the only one speaking for the last short while. She
stops walking.
SCULLY
Mulder...?
MULDER
What happened to playing a hunch?
Scully almost JUMPS out of her own skin. The voice has
come not over the phone, but from two feet away where:
ANGLE TO INCLUDE AGENT MULDER
Standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit.
Cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth.
Clicking his cell phone off. Moving out.
SCULLY
Jesus, Mulder...
MULDER
The element of surprise, Scully.
Random acts of unpredictability. If we
fail to anticipate the unforeseen or
expect the unexpected in a universe of
infinite possibilities, we find
ourselves at the mercy of anyone or
anything that cannot be programmed,
categorized or easily referenced...
Mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he
sails his sunflower seeds into the air. Dusting his
hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a
moment.
MULDER
What are we doing up here? It's hotter
than hell.
And he's on the move. Scully moving to catch up.
NEW ANGLE
Mulder is moving toward the stairs, Scully catching him.
Mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps.
SCULLY
I know you're bored in this
assignment, but unconventional
thinking is only going to get you into
trouble now.
MULDER
How's that?
SCULLY
You've got to quit looking for what
isn't there. They've closed the
X-Files. There's procedure to be
followed here. Protocol.
MULDER
What do you say we call in a bomb
threat for Houston. I think it's free
beer night at the Astrodome.
Scully gives him a look. It's no use. She reaches the
door first, grabs the knob but... it won't open. Turning
to Mulder.
SCULLY
Now what?
MULDER
(suddenly nervous)
It's locked?
She wiggles the knob again.
SCULLY
So much for anticipating the
unforeseen...
Scully squints into the sun, staring at Mulder. But he's
quick on the draw, and realizes what she's up to. He
grabs for the door and... it opens. Looking to Scully
whose hard look of mock-scolding has become a smirking
smile.
SCULLY
Had you.
MULDER
No you didn't.
SCULLY
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
And that's how it continues as they re-enter the
stairwell, the door slamming shut behind them.
CUT TO:
UNMARKED FBI VANS, CARS are pulling up out front.
Agents in windbreakers are exiting, moving at a run to
the building. Among them S.A.C. Darius Michaud. Moving
to:
ANGLE ON SCULLY
Exiting the building. Behind her, WORKERS are beginning
to stream out of the building, as well as the young
FIELD TRIPPERS. Michaud meeting up with Scully
mid-plaza. As the windbreaker Agents move past them,
entering the building.
S.A.C. MICHAUD
Where is it?
MOVING WITH THEM now, back toward the building. As FIRE
TRUCKS are pulling up out in the street out front.
Suddenly this has the distinct feel of a situation
veering out of control.
SCULLY
Mulder found it in a vending machine.
He's locked in with it.
CUT TO:
The last of the building occupants are being hauled off
in CITY BUSES which have moved in curbside. As these
buses pull away, so do the fire trucks that have
positioned themselves out front. And the police squad
cars. As Mulder and Scully exit the front door. Moving
quickly, until Mulder hits mid-plaza and slows. Scully
not realizing this for a few steps, then turning.
SCULLY
What are you doing?
(off his non-response)
Mulder --
One last windbreakered Agent is exiting. Moving past
them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for
Mulder and Scully.
LAST AGENT OUT
All clear.
Mulder has stopped and is looking back to the building
now as Scully hustles back the few steps separating
them.
MULDER
Something's wrong.
ANGLE OVER THEM TO THE WAITING CAR
As the Last Agent Out's car zooms away. Leaving only
their car and the man driving it: a WINDBREAKERED
AGENT.
WINDBREAKERED AGENT
What's he doing?
The plaza is desolate now, void of life.
MULDER
Something's not right...
SCULLY
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Scully is pulling him now. Pulling him toward the car
and the obviously impatient Windbreakered Agent.
SCULLY
There's no time!
CUT TO:
Mulder has relented now, against his better instincts.
Moving with Scully to the car, faster as they go. The
Windbreaker Agent standing in the open door of the
driver's side. Getting in behind the wheel...
CUT BACK TO:
Mulder and Scully getting in the car. TRACKING BACKWARDS
with them now as the Agent driving pulls away, getting
only thirty, maybe forty yards when: the BOMB DETONATES
and the building EXPLODES. And this is no fatwa symbolic
little terror strike. This is Oklahoma City. Or do we
say, Independence Day.
REVERSE ANGLE ON CAR
As all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up,
slamming into the corner of a parked car. The air so
quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city
has been destroyed.
RESUME BUILDING
As the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still
floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging
on every floor. That most of the front of the building
has been torn away and we can see right into many
floors.
RESUME ANGLE ON CAR
Where it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air
is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of
the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with
glass. Moving to the front passenger door, opening it
for Scully.
MULDER
(with darkest irony)
Next time you're buying.
HIGH ABOVE the U.S. capital, the entire beltway. With a
LEGEND, to establish.
LOWER AND TIGHTER NOW
On the J. Edgar Hoover Building, FBI Headquarters.
Descending low on the three-sided monolith and its large
interior courtyard. As another LEGEND appears, under:
WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge...
CUT TO:
Mulder has found a place against a wall, between two
dumpsters. Jerking around in surprise at the sound of a
VOICE.
WATCHFUL MAN'S VOICE
That official FBI business?
MULDER
(startled)
What?
ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE MAN FROM THE BAR
He's not far from Mulder. His name is KURTZWEIL.
KURTZWEIL
Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the
same thing in Dallas.
Mulder's weirded out as the stranger moves to him un-
threateningly.
MULDER
How's that?
KURTZWEIL
Standing around holding your yank
while bombs are exploding.
Kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this.
MULDER
Do I know you?
KURTZWEIL
No. I've been watching your career for
a good while. Back when you were just
a promising young agent -- before
that.
Mulder stares at this man as he finishes, zipping up.
MULDER
You follow me out here for a reason?
KURTZWEIL
Yeah, I did.
Kurtzweil unzips his own pants now. There is a moment;
one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure
what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving
himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes
this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But
Kurtzweil hails him again.
KURTZWEIL
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin
Kurtzweil.
MULDER
I know the name. Why?
KURTZWEIL
Old friend of your father's.
Kurtzweil continues peeing. Knows this got Mulder's
attention.
KURTZWEIL
Back at the Department of State. We
were what you might call fellow
travelers, but his disenchantment
outlasted mine.
(beat)
I never believed in the Project.
Mulder stares at Kurtzweil now. He's being toyed with.
He turns, opens the door into the bar. As Kurtzweil gets
a little louder.
KURTZWEIL
Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't
know about the Project. Your father
died for it. Your sister was taken
because of it.
Kurtzweil finishes nature's call. Zips up. Heads after
Mulder.
CUT TO:
The street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to
the curb.
MULDER
And what's that?
KURTZWEIL
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or
intended to defuse the bomb.
MULDER
(rhetorical disbelief)
He just let it explode.
KURTZWEIL
What's the question nobody's asking?
Why that building? Why not the Federal
Building?
MULDER
The Federal Building was too well
guarded.
KURTZWEIL
No. They put the bomb in the building
across the street because it DID have
federal offices. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency had a provisional
medical quarantine office there. Which
is where the bodies were found. But
that's the thing...
Mulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling
over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from
Kurtzweil.
KURTZWEIL
...the thing you didn't know. That
you'd never think to check.
Mulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil.
KURTZWEIL
Those people were already dead.
MULDER
Before the bomb went off?
KURTZWEIL
That's what I'm saying.
Mulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment.
MULDER
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran
of the bureau --
KURTZWEIL
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's
loyal to know their way around Dallas.
They blew that building to hide
something. Maybe something even they
couldn't predict.
MULDER
You're saying they destroyed an entire
building to hide the bodies of three
firemen...?
KURTZWEIL
And one little boy.
Mulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the
window.
MULDER
I think you're full of shit.
KURTZWEIL
Do you?
Kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from
the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL,
watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should
also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play
the scene out on him.)
CUT TO:
The moon is rising over the horizon, across the
curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush.
When FLYING OBJECTS cross between it and us, their forms
unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth.
But they are moving towards us, SILHOUETTES in the
background of the moon.
They move silently, their size INCREASING as they move
closer. And then we hear them, moments before they
arrive at our position, UNMARKED HELICOPTERS just
overhead. Hugging the ground as they blast across the
dark Texas night.
The field where the kids had been digging has been
transformed into some kind of worksite.
A LARGE WHITE DOMED TENT has been erected over almost
the entire patch of ground, surrounded by the CARGO
TRUCKS that we saw earlier, and more unmarked vans and
trucks. There are men in black fatigues moving about,
and scientists in haz-mat suits.
As the UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS bank overhead. Coming
in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents. CAMERA
MOVING TOWARD one of the helicopters as it lightly
touches down and its black door swings open. A man
stepping out, and as CAMERA PUSHES UP INTO HIS FACE we
recognize him as The Cigarette Smoking Man.
The figure that we've come to know as an assassin and a
model of modern self-interest and amorality. One of the
central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth
from the American people about the existence of
extraterrestrial life.
Something known only as: "The Project."
He walks out from under the whirring prop, just far
enough to get a flame from his lighter, to get a
cigarette lit. As we:
CUT TO:
A LEGEND appears: WASHINGTON D.C., DUPONT CIRCLE. 4:00
AM. The street is fairly empty, save for a garbage truck
picking up the stacks of green garbage bags laid out on
the sidewalks. Then A TAXI turns off a main street,
MOVING TOWARDS US.
The taxi pulls over and Mulder exits, starting up the
steps of a walk up where the door is open.
Mulder starting up the street when he notices:
MULDER'S POV
Kurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments. He's
staring at Mulder, nodding furtively to him. Then
stepping back.
RESUME MULDER
Slows, then speeds up.
Mulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway, finding
Kurtzweil tucked a few yards in.
KURTZWEIL
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows
I'm talking to you.
MULDER
Not according to the men in blue.
KURTZWEIL
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual
battery of a patient? I've had my
license taken away in three states.
MULDER
They want to discredit you -- for
what?
KURTZWEIL
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man.
Because I know too much about the
truth.
MULDER
You mean that apocalyptic trash you
write? I knew your name was familiar.
I just didn't know why.
KURTZWEIL
You know my work?
MULDER
(pointedly)
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in
bigoted ideas about race or genocide.
I don't believe in the Elders of Zion,
the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg
Group or in a oneworld Jew run
government --
KURTZWEIL
I don't either, but it sure sells
books.
He says it with an ironic smile. Causing Mulder to turn
and start off. But Kurtzweil hurries to grab him, to
prevent this.
KURTZWEIL
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I,
Agent Mulder?
MULDER
How?
KURTZWEIL
I picked up the historical document of
the venality and hypocrisy of the
American government. The daily
newspaper.
MULDER
You said the firemen and the boy were
found in the temporary offices of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Why?
KURTZWEIL
According to the newspaper, FEMA had
been called out to manage an outbreak
of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar
with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
MULDER
It was a deadly virus spread by field
mice in the Southwest U.S. several
years ago.
KURTZWEIL
And are you familiar with FEMA? What
the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's real power is? FEMA allows
the White House to suspend
constitutional government upon
declaration of a national emergency.
To create a non-elected government.
Think about that.
(beat)
What is an agency with such broad
sweeping power doing managing a small
viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
MULDER
Are you saying it wasn't such a small
outbreak?
Kurtzweil is getting intense now.
KURTZWEIL
I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.
They are both given a start when a POLICE CRUISER rolls
by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. It rolls
past as the two men tuck in tighter.
MULDER
What was it?
KURTZWEIL
When we were young men in the
military, your father and I were
recruited for a project. They told us
it was biological warfare. A virus.
There were rumors about its origins.
MULDER
What killed those men?
KURTZWEIL
What killed them I won't even write
about. I tell you, they'd do more than
just harass me. They have the future
to protect.
MULDER
I'll know soon enough.
KURTZWEIL
(worked up)
What killed those men can't be
identified in simple medical terms. My
god, we can't even wrap our minds
around something as obvious as HIV.
We have no context for what killed
those men, or any appreciation of the
scale in which it will be unleashed in
the future. Of how it will be
transmitted; of the environmental
factors involved.
MULDER
A plague?
KURTZWEIL
The plague to end all plagues, Agent
Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet
war. The systematic release of an
indiscriminate organism for which the
men who will bring it on still have no
cure. They've been working on this for
fifty years. While the rest of the
world was fighting gooks and commies
these men have been secretly
negotiating a planned Armageddon.
MULDER
Negotiating with whom?
KURTZWEIL
I think you know. The timetable has
been set. It will happen on a holiday,
when people are away from their homes.
When our elected officials are at
their resorts or out of the country.
The President will declare a state of
emergency, at which time all federal
agencies, all government will come
under the power of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. FEMA,
Agent Mulder. The secret government.
MULDER
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
KURTZWEIL
Something's gone wrong -- something
unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and
dig. Or you're only going to find out
like the rest of the country, Agent
Mulder. When it's too late.
Kurtzweil turns, starts off. Mulder stares after him.
Then:
MULDER
How can I reach you?
KURTZWEIL
You can't.
Mulder moves to catch up to Kurtzweil, pulling out his
cell phone. Kurtzweil stops, turns. Truly and intensely
paranoid. Mulder makes him take the cell phone.
MULDER
No calling Hawaii.
Mulder turns and moves back out onto the street.
CUT TO:
The domed white tent is still in place, the fleet of
trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned. Several
large sound-dampened generators still hum away, but the
work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who
didn't have access to the tent.
CUT TO:
A CHILD'S SCREAM OF JOY. ENGLISH CHILDREN are playing
tag or some kind of children's game in the
well-manicured garden of a man who the CAMERA FINDS IN
F.G. -- the man we have come to know as THE
WELL-MANICURED MAN. He is also a member of the syndicate
running "The Project", though his venality is cloaked in
civility and statesmanship. Right now he's watching the
children from the back steps of his mansion, charmed by
their game. When he is called by someone o.s.
VALET'S VOICE
Sir -- you have a call.
The Well-Manicured Man turns to see:
HIS VALET
Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past
the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to
rise and fall.
CUT TO:
A discreet Town Car pulls up out front an understated
building in a better West End neighborhood. A driver
exits coming around for the Well-Manicured Man who is
already exiting, moving to the building. As a LEGEND
appears: KENSINGTON, LONDON: 8:01 PM.
CUT TO:
AGENT SCULLY
She stands against a backdrop of Texas flatland,
squinting into the sun. Shaking her head.
SCULLY
I don't know, Mulder...
We are:
WIDE ANGLE REVERSE, TO INCLUDE MULDER, standing in the
middle of a park, replete with jungle gyms, playground
equipment. All brand spanking new. They are standing
right where there had once been a hard scrabble, parched
and barren little field. Where the earthen hole had been
dug by the young boys. And what had later been the site
of so much activity by the group of scientists. But
where there's now a park, thick green grass covering the
parch of ground, including the spot where the hole had
been.
SCULLY
He didn't mention a park.
MULDER
This is where he marked on the map,
Scully. Where he says those fossils
were unearthed.
SCULLY
I don't see any evidence of an
archeological or any other kind of
digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm
drain.
Mulder scans the area, confounded. Shaking his head as
they walk.
MULDER
You're sure the fossils you looked at
showed the same signs of deterioration
you saw in the fireman's body in the
morgue?
SCULLY
(nodding)
The bone was porous, as if the virus
of the causative microbe were
digesting it.
MULDER
And you've never seen anything like
that?
SCULLY
No.
It didn't show up on any of the
immunohistochemical tests --
Mulder is listening to all this while looking down at
his feet:
MULDER
This looks like new grass to you?
SCULLY
It looks pretty green for this
climate.
Mulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of
turf. He digs around, lifting up a corner of a new
square.
MULDER
Ground's dry about an inch down.
Somebody just laid this down. Very
recently, I'd say.
SCULLY
(looking off)
All the equipment is brand new.
MULDER
No irrigation system. Somebody's
covering their tracks.
They both turn, looking at something that's caught their
attention on the street where their rental car is
parked. Three kids, all of whom we recognize from
earlier. Stevie's "friends".
Tooling down the street on new BMX bikes. Reacting to
Mulder's loud WHISTLE. This stops them, staring at
Mulder blankly across the distance.
MULDER
Hey!
They don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the
sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them.
SCULLY
Do you live around here?
2ND BOY
Yeah.
As the Agents approach.
MULDER
You see anybody digging here?
The kids don't answer quickly.
2ND BOY
Not supposed to talk about it.
SCULLY
You're not supposed to talk about it?
Who told you that?
3RD BOY
Nobody.
MULDER
Nobody. Same nobody who put this park
in? That new equipment...
(off the boys guilty looks)
They buy you these bikes?
The kids shift uncomfortably.
SCULLY
I think you better tell us.
2ND BOY
We don't even know you.
SCULLY
Well, we're FBI agents.
2ND BOY
You're not FBI agents.
MULDER
How do you know?
2ND BOY
Cause FBI agents wear like suits and
goofy ties. And dresses like my mom
wears to church. Like on that one
show.
Mulder and Scully pull their badges. The kids' mouths
drop.
MULDER
Maybe you've been watching too much
TV.
3RD BOY
They all left twenty minutes ago.
4TH BOY
Going that way.
The kids all pointing in the same direction.
As Mulder and Scully's rental car RACES by at high
speed.
CUT TO:
Mulder slows down to a stop. They've come to a three-way
intersection in the middle of absolutely nowhere that
offers them three choices. The car sits idling for
several beats.
HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance on a long, dusty
stretch of road. GROWING as they approach, then coming
to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f.g.
Where a LINE OF FENCEPOSTS, BARBWIRE blocks their path.
As the car brakes, the passenger door opens and Scully
exits. A hot Texas wind blows. A dog is BARKING
somewhere. Scully walks into the headlight wash, looking
at a sign on the fence.
After a moment, the driver's door opens and Mulder
exits.
MULDER
Hey, I was right about the bomb,
wasn't I?
SCULLY
This is great. This is fitting.
REVERSE ON SCENE
On the fence sign, painted in crude letters, are the
words: SOME HAVE TRIED, SOME HAVE DIED. TURN BACK -- NO
TRESPASSING.
MULDER
What?
SCULLY
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in
eleven hours for a hearing -- the
outcome of which might possibly affect
one of the biggest decisions of my
life. And here I am standing out in
the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing
phantom tanker trucks.
MULDER
We're not chasing trucks, we're
chasing evidence --
SCULLY
-- of what exactly?!
MULDER
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go
off, to hide something: bodies
infected with a virus you detected
yourself.
SCULLY
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they
haul oil in tanker trucks -- they
don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
MULDER
Yeah, well they may this one.
SCULLY
What do you mean by haul?
(off his reaction)
What are you not telling me here?
MULDER
This virus -- it...
(afraid to say)
SCULLY
Mulder --
MULDER
It may be extraterrestrial.
SCULLY
I don't believe this. I don't fucking
believe this.
(reaching her limit of
impatience)
Y'know, I've been here... I've been
here one too many times with you,
Mulder.
MULDER
Been where?
SCULLY
Pounding down some dirt road in the
middle of the night. Chasing some
elusive truth on a dim hope, only to
find myself standing right where I am
right now: at another dead end --
As she says this A BELL starts to sound. A flashing
light hits Mulder and Scully. They both turn to see:
HIGH ANGLE OVER A RAILROAD CROSSING SIGN
Sitting all by its lonely self. No swinging arms or
gate. Just one little sign between Mulder and Scully and
their car.
CAMERA PANNING to the light of a locomotive speeding
toward us.
WIDE ANGLE OVER TRACKS TO MULDER AND SCULLY
They move toward their car, but the train is coming
fast. Mulder and Scully stop and wait, watching the
train. As the engine breaks frame, eclipsing Mulder and
Scully from view. And as it passes by we see TWO VERY
FAMILIAR WHITE TANKERS loaded piggyback atop flat bed
cars.
The train, which is not much longer than this, passes.
And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The
lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard
accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection
that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after
the train, we:
DISSOLVE TO:
The rails come up a grade where they appear out of a
long bending turn. Exiting the mountain pass near the
summit of the mountain. And now HEADLIGHTS appear,
bouncing toward us. It's Mulder and Scully's rental
chugging up the grade.
And now pulling to a stop as it REACHES CAMERA. Then the
car doors open and Mulder and Scully exit. Putting
jackets against the cold desert night. Running over the
gravel on the rail bed into sharp f.g.
SCULLY
What do you think it is?
MULDER
I have no idea.
They start out toward it anyway, whatever it is. But the
image that we see next might cause us to ask the same
question.
REVERSE ANGLE -- MULDER AND SCULLY'S FORMER POV
The Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their
way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great
plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT
GLOWING WHITE DOMES.
It is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the
impression that the domes are floating.
It would give the distinct impression of
otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller
glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found
the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the
TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes.
CUT TO:
SLOWLY CRANING DOWN as Mulder and Scully move through
the low scrub of the high desert. Moving towards us as
CAMERA CONTINUES ITS SLOW CRANE DOWN, REVEALING in f.g.
the tops of CORN STALKS (yes, corn stalks.) What is the
perimeter edge of:
REVERSE CRANE DOWN (TO MATCH)
Acres and acres of corn fields, laying out before us in
the dark night. Running all the way to the WHITE DOMED
TENTS in the b.g.
Mulder and Scully enter the perimeter edge, disappearing
into:
TRACKING WITH Mulder and Scully as they move through the
field.
SCULLY
This is weird, Mulder.
MULDER
Very weird.
SCULLY
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be
growing corn in the middle of the
desert?
MULDER
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop
containers out there.
CONTINUE TRACKING as they move through the tall uniform
rows.
ANGLE BEHIND THE AGENTS
Shooting down the long straight rows. CRANING UP to
REVEAL DOMES once again. Like space ships that have
landed.
CUT TO:
OPPOSITE PERIMETER OF THE FIELD OF CORN
The Agents exit the edge of the crop field. They have
come upon the glowing tents now. Tall and pillowy
against the dark sky.
There is no evidence of anyone about. No sound, no
signs.
Mulder and Scully stand at the edge of the field for a
moment. Then move cautiously across an open area to one
of the domes.
CUT TO:
Scully and Mulder comes blasting out themselves now, but
they haven't even had time to catch their breaths when
they react to MOVEMENT. Something coming at them in the
night.
THEIR POV'S - STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROWS OF DOMED TENTS
Where BRIGHT BEAMS BLAST ON, moving fast toward them.
The RUSHING WHIR of the turbine engines of the unmarked
choppers. The bright beams skimming across the ground
toward Mulder and Scully, traveling right along the
edges of ends of the white domed tents. Threatening to
spot the Agents, unless they -- RUN.
And they do -- bolting just as the beams and the
helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments
before. Running to:
HANDHELD
Running flat out now, knocking away the stalks and
leaves that block their way.
Following and leading shots.
POVs and Tracking shots.
And chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only
cover they've got. As:
ANGLE JUST OVER THE TOP OF CROPS
The unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead, their
BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS searching and cutting through the
cornrows. As the Agents zig and zag just out of the
discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their
heads.
REVERSE ON CHOPPERS
Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and
swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers.
The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down
so as to reveal anything hidden within.
The bright spots making sure that nothing might escape
detection.
LOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY
as she runs up INTO FRAME. She's lost sight of:
SCULLY
Mulder?!
ANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER
As he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name.
MULDER
Scully?!
RESUME SCULLY
Reacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time
to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to
take flight again. As one of the choppers appears
overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in
a path moving straight toward her.
CAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft.
PASSING CAMERA to the left, as the chopper passes CAMERA
RIGHT.
CUT TO:
TRACKING FAST WITH MULDER
Beating his way through the corn like Bomba through the
jungle.
Matching this action, as Mulder runs toward us. When one
of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an
intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder
and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder
down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn,
sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading
RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US.
CUT TO:
NEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD
Where Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a
quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the
chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam
narrowly missing Mulder.
NEW ANGLE ON MULDER
Running the corner of the field, looking frantically
down each corn row until he comes to a stop. No sign
of:
MULDER
Scully?!
Mulder reacting to the sound of her response:
SCULLY
(distant o.s.)
Mulder!
NEW ANGLE ON SCULLY
She's exiting the field behind him. Running toward him,
and when she gets to him they both break into a run
across the desert. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM as they sprint
away.
FOLLOWING THEM until they both start to slow. Slowing to
a stop in the darkness. Turning to see:
THEIR POV
The helicopters have disappeared.
RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
Reacting to this.
SCULLY
Where'd they go?
MULDER
I don't know.
Then they both turn again and continue running. As fast
as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff
where their car is parked.
Where Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness,
until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up
from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their
car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but
the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and
over but it won't kick.
As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE
BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff,
appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind
the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as...
...Mulder gets the car started, throwing the
transmission in gear and spinning the tires. As they
head off back in the direction they came, without their
lights on. As they do this, the black chopper continues
to hover for a moment, then BANKS OFF AND AWAY. Into the
night.
Mulder and Scully speed off in the opposite direction.
As we:
DISSOLVE TO:
Mulder busts out the back door, chasing Kurtzweil.
MULDER
Kurtzweil!
Kurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity.
KURTZWEIL
You'd be shit out of luck if not for
me. You saw what you saw because I led
you to it. I'm putting my ass on the
line for you.
MULDER
Your ass? I just got chased across
Texas by two black helicopters.
KURTZWEIL
And why do you think it is you're
standing here talking to me? These
people don't make mistakes, Agent
Mulder.
And with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder
to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly
Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him.
MULDER'S POV
Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only
see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear
he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the
figure slides away and disappears.
ANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING
We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face
we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder
coming out of the vending room, not long before the
building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now,
disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to
find:
MULDER. He stands staring up, but only for a moment
until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction
Kurtzweil disappeared in.
CUT TO:
The Paramedics bang out the front door, stutter-stepping
the gurney down to the walk, to their EMT VAN which sits
at the curb with the LIGHT BAR FLASHING. Mulder
following close by.
MULDER
She said she had a taste in the back
of her throat -- there was no
pre-existing allergy to bee-stings --
the bee that stung her may have been
carrying a virus --
2ND PARAMEDIC
A virus?
1ST PARAMEDIC
Get on the radio, tell them we have a
cytogenic reaction, we need an advise
and administer --
They get her to the back of the vehicle, guiding the
gurney in with experienced hands. Scully's eyes are on
Mulder as she's slid into the brightly lit interior.
The 1st Paramedic blocks Mulder somewhat as he steps
toward the van, anticipating that he's going with them
to the hospital. But the doors are closing on him before
he gets an opportunity.
FOLLOWING MULDER around to the driver's side of the van
now, moving to the driver's window where THE DRIVER can
be seen in the rear view mirror, his eyes watching
Mulder.
ON MULDER
A moment of vague recognition -- a catch in his step.
RESUME
As Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window
where se see again the man from the vending room, who
was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN
pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
The glass shattering.
RESUME MULDER
Throwing himself away backward, but the bullet catches
him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side
of the van. He goes down to the ground -- as the
paramedic van accelerates fast away.
LOW ANGLE REVERSE ON MULDER
Lying in the street, his head bleeding profusely. While
in the b.g., A SECOND AMBULANCE IS SPEEDING TO THE
SCENE. As it skids to a stop and TWO NEW PARAMEDICS jump
out, we:
DISSOLVE TO:
A MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE JET is taxiing down an alley off
the main runway where a 747 is speeding toward takeoff.
The private jet turning TOWARD CAMERA and nosing into
f.g.
NEW ANGLE ON TARMAC
Where MEN IN FAMILIAR BLACK FATIGUES are unloading
something from an unmarked cube truck that is also
familiar: the very high tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER,
with its monitors and gauges, its oxygen tanks and
refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
system. The inside of the container is covered with a
thin layer of frost, through which we can see AGENT
SCULLY.
She lies as if in a state of paralysis, but a blink of
her eyes is enough to tell us that she is... alive.
TRACKING WITH THE MEN moving the container. As they
hustle it to the waiting jet. As The Cigarette Smoking
Man is descending the steps of the plane onto the
tarmac. Watching as the container is moved to the cargo
hold and loaded inside.
The hold is closed and the jet engines wind back up. As
the Cigarette Smoking Man reboards the aircraft and it
taxis away.
FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK
A FIGURE appears at the end of the alley, moving toward
us. It could be Mulder from this distance, but as the
figure comes closer we recognize him as Kurtzweil.
Moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him.
Jumpy.
He takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading
into the bar (established), reaching for the knob.
Opening it, finding the Well-Manicured Man standing
there.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin
Kurtzweil?
KURTZWEIL
Jesus Christ.
Kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man.
Backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an
ambush.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
You're surprised. Certainly you've
been expecting some response to your
indiscretion.
The W.M.M. steps out of the doorway, following
Kurtzweil.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent
Mulder, you have your good reason.
It's a weakness in men our age; the
urge to confess.
(stopping his walk)
I forgive you that.
Kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery.
Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright
and civil man.
KURTZWEIL
What are you doing here? What do you
want from me?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
You must try to understand, what I'm
here to do is only to protect my
children. You and I have but short
lives left. I can only hope the same
isn't true for them.
On this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the
direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM
until HEADLIGHTS hit his face.
REVERSE ANGLE
A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him.
Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively
trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its
headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the
W.M.M.
CUT TO:
Where a figure is coming down the street toward us.
Running, it's Mulder, going balls out. Running to the
entrance of the bar and yanking open the door.
Mulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope.
The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense
look.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
(with quiet force)
You have precious little time. What
I've given you the alien colonists
have no idea exists. You hold in your
hand the power to end the project.
MULDER
How?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
The vaccine you hold is the only
defense against the virus. Its
introduction into an alien environment
may have the power to destroy the
delicate plans we've so assiduously
protected for the last fifty years.
(beat)
Or it may not.
MULDER
What alien environment?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her
science can save the future.
MULDER
What about you?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
My life is over.
(beat)
Go.
Mulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M.
points the weapon he's still holding at him.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Go now!
And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back
over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back
into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later...
THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the
ground.
ANGLE ON MULDER
The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its
contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with
COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE.
Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the
envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running
as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he
disappears.
As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we
hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The
same sound that opened our story.
Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a
horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between
the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We
are:
Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on
the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND
appears, to establish.
CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR
Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed
insect.
LOW ANGLE on the great white expanse. Across which a
snow tractor is moving. PANNING with the vehicle to...
Mulder's snow tractor, where the first tractor stops,
its headlights trained on Mulder's ride.
A beat, then the discovering machine moves out again,
following the tracks that Mulder has left, which brings
it STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA. As it passes us, we can see
the DRIVER and the Cigarette Smoking Man sitting in the
cabin. As we:
CUT BACK TO:
Where Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is
streaming out of all the ducts now. The ice and snow
above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the
blasting all.
CUT BACK TO:
We can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN
are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their
carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles.
A small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a
rush. Heading off in various directions.
CAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his
tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last
drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow.
He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip
of some emotion conflicting with duty.
The Man who shot Mulder inside the tractor now, throwing
open the door for the CSM.
MAN WHO SHOT MULDER
C'mon. It's all going to hell.
He climbs up onto the vehicle, gets in and closes the
door. And the vehicle pulls away as we:
CUT BACK TO:
The hot air blasting from the ducts is causing the ice
pack above to melt and collapse.
CUT TO:
As the ice tractors head away in all directions from the
domed structures. A misty fog now emanating from the
seams of the domes. Heat and condensation.
CUT BACK TO:
Scully's head and arms push up through the vent where
Mulder first entered. The ice and snow surrounding it,
which had created the bubble structure, have melted and
fallen. So that above Scully's larger hole has opened up
to the surface. The air is full of condensation,
swirling around them.
ANGLE FROM ABOVE - THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ICE
Where, through the swirling steam we see Mulder push
Scully clear of the vent. Climbing free himself now.
When the surface they are upon SHUDDERS AND QUAKES. As
if it has come unloosed, destabilized.
And with this comes A MIGHTY FORCE OF STEAM from the
vent Mulder and Scully just crawled from. Blasting up
past them with terrible HISSING FORCE. Causing Mulder to
throw Scully away from its superheated energy.
Pulling her up the now climbable embankment created by
the melting snow; pulling her toward the surface of the
ice sheet.
CUT TO:
Where a wide radius of steam rises from similar and
regularly spaced holes in the ice sheet, defining a
circular structure beneath. The White Domed Tents of the
ice station are in the center of this, dwarfed by the
enormity of the melting radius.
RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
Mulder pulling her up the softened and collapsed snow.
The hot steam blasting up with hideous force behind
them. The sound DEAFENING.
NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY
Pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind
them in the distance the ICE STATION can be seen through
the atmosphere of condensed air. When suddenly the ice
beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away,
caving in to the center of the radius. Which is what
begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that
spreads out to where Mulder and Scully are standing.
Causing Mulder to realize:
MULDER
(over the din)
We've got to run!
She is weak, but is able to find her footing. Dragged
behind Mulder as the ice behind them begins to break
away, falling down into an ever-expanding center and
sending up magnificent geysers of steam created by the
superheated surface below.
WIDE ON SCENE
Mulder and Scully running AT CAMERA just ahead of the
collapsing center. The mass of ice around them beginning
to break up. Steam vents erupting instantaneously
everywhere.
CUT TO:
HIGH ANGLE ON SCENE
A black dome is becoming visible through the giant
circle of steam, in the ever-widening center hole that
Mulder and Scully are running from. Which is chasing
them to the edge of the radius.
CUT TO:
ANGLE FOLLOWING MULDER AND SCULLY
As Mulder struggles to pull Scully fast enough to
outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind
them. Large chunks falling and bouncing off the
superheated surface below, blown back up like water
being dropped onto a hot skillet.
CUT TO:
EXTREMELY HIGH AND WIDE
The Agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning
ice and steam. As it cascades away in three hundred and
sixty degrees. From here the deafening sound if absorbed
into the vastness, tricking us of the reality of the
massive movement of frozen material down below.
CUT TO:
ANGLE LEADING MULDER AND SCULLY
As Scully loses her footing, falling to the ground.
Mulder dragging her back up to her feet, though,
maintaining forward momentum. While behind them the
thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice
is moving in on them.
And then suddenly -- MULDER AND SCULLY are gone!
The radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a
few feet beyond where they disappeared. The violent
upheaval of snow abating but slightly. Beat, beat...
THEN THE AGENTS APPEAR AGAIN. Thrust upward by a RISING
BLACK PRECIPICE which catapults them off its leading
edge. As they fall the distance to the sheet of ice
below.
CUT TO:
LOW ANGLE ON ICE SHEET
Where the Agents hit hard on the ice sheet. The rain of
ice chunks pounding all around them. As the monolithic
wall of the craft continues to rise.
Mulder trying to get to Scully in this hail of debris
which he shields his face from.
WIDE ON LEADING EDGE
Rising faster now out of the earth as it begins to
increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it
carried. Until the bottom of the edge of the wall
appears, lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater
that held it.
CUT TO:
EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON SPACE SHIP
Where now we see the scope and shape of the ship, which
is breathtaking. The domed center sloping off to a
gentle gradient, which is the surface that Mulder and
Scully were running on. The ship is now slowly rotating
as it moves upward in a gently rising hover.
Mulder and Scully are on the ice sheet below.
RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
Scully face down on the ice. Mulder lifting his head
when THE HEAVY SHADOW of the ship comes over them.
Looking up from this position to see:
THE SPACE SHIP
Moving slowly, laterally just overhead. Thunderously
rumbling. The dark detail of its underside visible in
this angle. As it continues to rise, the shadow passing
over Mulder and Scully.
CUT TO:
NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY
Scully is still face down on the ice, as Mulder watches
the ship's shadow cast over Mulder's SnowCat which is
still parked in the distance. Moving up and off.
The ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it
rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT.
Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for
several moments during transformation. Then it
disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which
dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is
gone.
MULDER
Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back.
He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His
whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to
lose consciousness.
Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we
might believe that this is the way it might end. Out
here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to
death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the
same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness
of this literal end of the world.
Then Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's
alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting
slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she
coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her,
unaware of his condition or even where she is.
SCULLY
(weakly)
Mulder...
There is no answer. Scully struggling to pull herself
out from under the weight of his body. Rolling over so
that her face is opposite Mulder's now. Seeing that he
has lost consciousness. Finding the strength to roll him
over, so that she can cradle him and warm him.
HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON THIS SCENE
With the Snowcat a short distance away, Mulder and
Scully in each others arms. The way it should end.
FADE TO BLACK
Silence. Longer than we would like. Long enough to make
us nervous, then certain, then angry. Then...we FADE UP
a prelap of the sound of a CRACKLING FIRE.
FADING UP ON:
TRACKING LOW WITH MEN IN FATIGUES, moving along the
perimeter of the corn field as they set fire to the corn
stalks with small handheld butane burners. While other
Men in Fatigues are moving between the rows dousing the
furrows with accelerant.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sky aglow with orange flames as the crops burn to
the ground. We hold on this shot, PRELAPPING the sound
of:
JANA CASSIDY'S VOICE
... in light of the report I've got
before me; in light of the narrative
I'm now hearing...
We are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in
the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder
sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There
is no one else around.
Until the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through
the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park
bench.
CLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
They do not speak for several moments. A quite tension
as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling,
exhaling. Then:
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Congratulations on your survival. Your
life is worthless now, I hope you know
that.
MULDER
And yours?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
(derisive)
You think you've stopped it. What I've
worked for fifty years to create. You
haven't stopped it. You can't stop
it.
(takes a drag)
You're just one man.
MULDER
You're wrong.
WIDE ANGLE
Mulder rises from the bench heading TOWARD CAMERA. The
CSM rising, watching him.
As Mulder continues toward us. ADJUST TO REVEAL Agent
Scully in the f.g. Mulder moving to her as the CSM
watches from the distance. Their eyes meet, an unspoken
restored bond exchanged in this moment. Before Mulder
takes Scully by the arm, leads her off. Leaving the CSM
standing alone in the distance. As we:
DISSOLVE TO:
TRACKING LOW WITH A PAIR OF FEET
The wearer of them sporting peasant sandals. We realize
shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy
ground, that the foliage in the near b.g. is corn. And
that the person we are tracking with is passing row
after row of stalks.
CAMERA RISING AS IT TRACKS
REVEALING A TUNISIAN MAN dressed in peasant clothes. He
is carrying a piece of paper. Moving with hasty purpose.
Stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn
where CONRAD STRUGHOLD is coming toward him. Making his
way between rows of stalks. The Peasant waits patiently
as Strughold approaches, handing him the piece of
paper.
Strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance
reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight
narrowing of his eyes.
He looks up at the Peasant and says something to him in
Tunisian Arabic. Said as command, which causes the
Peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came.
Strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper
slightly and drops it. Moving off down the same corn row
in which he approached.
CAMERA DROPPING TO THE GROUND where we find the paper on
which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we
cannot read the words: X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE
ADVISE. STOP.
CAMERA RISING NOW. Rising up past the stalks. Where we
can still see Strughold walking. RISING UP AND UP to
reveal ACRES AND ACRES OF CORN. Many times more than we
had seen previously. Stretched out across the Tunisian
Desert, ending only where THREE WHITE DOMES stand on the
distant horizon.
Off this image we FADE OUT.
