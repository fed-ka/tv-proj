                    She even ate a candle that smells*
                    like chocolate chip cookies.  So...*
                    are you okay?*

                                      SABRINA
                    I'm fine.  It's stupid.  I'm just...
                    One of the deli guys is having a
                    Halloween party tonight and Wyatt
                    was supposed to come into town for
                    it and now he's not.

      Sabrina squats down to stock a lower shelf.  Jimmy squats*
      down as well.*

                                      JIMMY
                    Wow.  That's kinda messed up.  

                                      SABRINA
                    Yeah, I know, right?  He says he has
                    to study, which I understand, but
                    he's known about this for weeks so
                    why didn't he study earlier?  

      Sabrina moves to another shelf.  Jimmy follows her.*

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah.  That's what I would've done. 
                    You know, if I went to college and
                    had a girlfriend.  I'm single and I
                    live here in town.  You don't think
                    he's cheating do you?

                                      SABRINA
                    What?  No.  It's not a big deal,
                    it's just, Halloween's one of my
                    favorite holidays.  We were supposed
                    to go as Batman and Robin and now
                    I'm just Robin.  I'm gonna look
                    stupid.  Whatever, it's not your
                    problem.  Thanks for letting me vent.

      Sabrina grabs a box and crosses off.  Behind Jimmy we see*
      Marcus and Javier ride down the aisle on their bike.  Jimmy*
      crosses off.*

      We're over some items on a shelf as Sabrina stocks the shelf. *
      Jimmy appears behind her.*

                                      JIMMY*
                    You know, I'm hitting a few parties
                    tonight myself.  In fact, I happen
                    to have a Batman costume from last
                    year so if you wanted me to, I don't
                    know, put it on and stop by the deli
                    guy's party I could.  Maybe stand
                    near you so you don't look stupid.

                                      SABRINA
                    I don't want you to change your plans
                    for me.  It's okay.  What are you
                    dressing up as tonight?

      Jimmy realizes he has to come up with something quick.

                                      JIMMY
                    A sponge.

                                      SABRINA
                    A sponge?  Like Sponge Bob Square
                    Pants?

                                      JIMMY
                          (that would be silly)
                    No.  
                          (beat)*
                    I mean, maybe.  That one, or a
                    different... well known sponge. 
                    It's still in the works.  I'd almost
                    rather be Batman.  It's supposed to
                    rain tonight and the sponge could
                    end up being a hazard if I have to,
                    you know, get somewhere fast.  

                                      SABRINA
                    Well, okay.  If you don't mind
                    switching I'd love to have a Batman.

                                      JIMMY

      FADE IN:


      Jimmy comes in the front door.  Virginia is sitting on the*
      couch painting her toenails.  Hope is in her playpen.*

                                      JIMMY
                    I need you to make me a Batman costume
                    and I need you to watch Hope tonight. 
                    I'm going to a party.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Can't do it.

                                      JIMMY
                    Which one?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Neither.  I promised I'd take nine-
                    year-old Maw Maw trick-or-treating. 
                    You can make your own Batman costume
                    but I used most of the black fabric
                    turning an old dress into a cat
                    costume for Maw Maw.

      Maw Maw enters wearing a "cat costume" backwards.  The low
      cut back is revealing her bra and the long skinny tail that
      Virginia sewed on the back is now in front.

                                    MAW MAW
                    I'm ready to go, Mommy.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Good Lord.

                    It's on backwards, sweetheart.  Come
                    with me.  

      Virginia takes Maw Maw by the tail and leads her back to her*
      room.*

      Through the fridge we see Burt taking cartons of eggs out of*
      the fridge and putting them on the table next to a twelve
      pack of beer.  Jimmy enters.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, can you watch Hope tonight?

                    Not really, no.  But I don't have
                    any other choice.

      Burt starts to load himself with the eggs and the beer.

                                    BURT
                    Sorry.  I'm forbidden by her father
                    to be near her on Halloween.  Besides,
                    I got plans.  I'm going egging.

      Burt exits.

                                      JIMMY

                    the "C" word.  Five and a half hours
                    later he came back for me.

                    This is baby food?  What a waste. 
                    This is delicious.  It's like meat

                    Just the dust.  Underneath it's a
                    regular chip.

      Javier licks the dust off the chip and hands it to Marcus.  

                                      JAVIER (CONT'D)
                    There.  Regular chip.

    He looks at it.

                                      MARCUS
                    I don't even know if she has teeth. 
                    What if she chokes on it?

                                      JAVIER
                    Chew it up and spit it into her mouth
                    baby bird style.

                                      MARCUS
                    That's gross.

                                      JAVIER
                    It's not gross.  Birds do it. 
                    Besides, I already licked it.  What
                    difference does it make if you chew
                    it up?

      Marcus shrugs and starts to chew the chip.  The phone rings
      and Javier answers it.

                                      JAVIER (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


    We intercut with Jimmy in the corner of the party trying to
      talk over the noise.  In the foreground of Javier's shot we
      see Marcus walk back and forth deliberately chewing the chip.

                                      JIMMY
                    How's it going?

                                      JAVIER
                    Good.  We're feeding the baby.  How's
                    the party?

                                      JIMMY
                    Great.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    She's really mad at her boyfriend. 
                    I think she's looking to get back at
                    him.

                                      JAVIER
                    That's fantastic.

                                      JIMMY
                    Alright, well I was just checking
                    in.  If she wakes up in the night
                    and seems hungry there's more food
                    in the pantry.

      Marcus leans over to spit the food in Hope's mouth.  Javier
      grabs him by the shirt and pulls him back.

                                      JAVIER
                    Okay, if we run out of food we'll
                    look there.
                          (to Marcus)
                    The pantry.

      Marcus swallows and goes to look in the pantry.

      Back at the party, the song "White Night" by the Postelles
      starts to play.  Jimmy sees Sabrina looking at him from across
      the room.  A little drunk, she moves to the music.    

                                      JIMMY
                          (into phone)
                    And when she goes to bed make sure
                    she has her favorite--  

      Sabrina crooks her finger at Jimmy to come join her.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    I gotta go. 

      Jimmy hangs up the phone.  Sabrina throws an imaginary fishing
      rod at Jimmy.  He acts like he's hooked and she starts to*
      reel him towards her.  Once he gets to her they start to
      dance.  We jump cut as the two dance and have a great time. 
      They do a lot of fun cute dance moves like the "Pulp Fiction"
      eye thing and others.  At a certain point, Jimmy turns around
      and finds himself face-to-face with another Batman.  Only
      this Batman is dressed in a much cooler costume that he looks
      great in.   

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)

                                      WYATT
                    Jimmy!

      Sabrina sees him as well.

                                      SABRINA
                    Wyatt!

      Sabrina jumps into Wyatt's arms as Jimmy watches.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing here?

                                      WYATT
                    Surprise.  Gotcha!  You didn't think
                    I was really gonna stand you up on
                    Halloween did you?

                                      SABRINA
                    Yes!  I can't believe you're here. 
                    Tonight is going to be awesome!

      They start dancing.  Jimmy tries to slink away but Sabrina
      grabs him.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Hey.  You're with us tonight.  You
                    don't think I'm gonna ditch my friend
                    just because my boyfriend showed up?

                                      JIMMY
                    It's okay.  You don't have to--

                                      WYATT
                    Come on, man.  Let's party.

      They all start to dance.  Jimmy dances way less
        enthusiastically than he did before Wyatt's arrival.

                                                                                FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      The party is still going on.  Jimmy walks down the hall.*

                                      JIMMY
                    Sabrina?  You back here?  I think
                    I'm gonna take off.

      Jimmy comes in the bedroom and sees that Sabrina is passed
      out on a tall pile of coats that are on the bed.  An odd guy
      dressed as a referee, FELIX, is drinking a beer from a straw*
      and staring at her.*

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    What's going on?

                                      FELIX
                    Nothing.  I'm just staring at her. 
                    I didn't brush her face gently with
                    my bare feet.

      Wyatt enters.

                                      WYATT
                    Oh, man.  She's out, huh?

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, I think so.

                                      WYATT
                    I told her to go puke two drinks
                    ago.  

                                      GARTH (O.S.)
                    Wyatt, let's go man!

                                      WYATT
                    A bunch of guys I went to high school
                    with want me to go to another party. 
                    I was gonna bring her but...  Would
                    you mind keeping an eye on her?  

                                      JIMMY
                    You're asking me to stay here with

                                      FELIX
                    How 'bout you guys both go to the
                    party and I'll keep an eye on her?

                                      WYATT
                          (shoots Felix a look,
                          then to Jimmy)
                    Look, I'm asking you to stay here
                    with your passed out friend.  Sabrina
                    says you guys have been hanging out
                    a lot lately.  Which I'm totally
                    cool with, by the way.  I appreciate
                    you keeping her out of trouble while
                    I'm at school.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Okay.  Yeah.  No problem.

                                      WYATT
                    You're a good guy, Jerry.

      Wyatt pats Jimmy on the shoulder and exits.  *

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't believe this.  He sees me as
                    no threat whatsoever.  How is he so*
                    sure I won't take advantage of her?

                                      FELIX
                    Are you going to take advantage of
                    her?

                                      JIMMY
                    No.  Of course I'm not going to take
                    advantage of her.  

                                      FELIX
                          (beat)
                    Will you let me take advantage of
                    her?

                                      JIMMY
                    No. 

                                      FELIX
                    Sounds like he left her with the
                    right guy.

      Felix grabs his coat, pulls it out from underneath Sabrina
      and exits.

                                                                                  CUT TO:      Raising Hope         1ARY06      "Happy Halloween"23.

      Jimmy sits on the floor leaning against the bed drinking a
      beer.  He's got a six pack next to him.  Sabrina is still
      passed out on the coats.  We time lapse as people come in
      and take their coats and Jimmy drinks more and more beer.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy stumbles in the front door with a slightly awake but
      very groggy Sabrina hanging on to him.  She looks around.

                                      SABRINA
                    No, don't take me in here.  I hate
                    haunted houses. *

                                      JIMMY
                    It's my house.  It's not haunted. *
                    My dad says it was built on an Indian*
                    burial ground but now I think he*
                    just said that so I'd hug him.*

    As Jimmy goes to put her on the couch she falls on top of*
      him.  Now face to face, she looks into his eyes. 

                                      SABRINA
                    Thanks for coming to the party
                    tonight.  I had a lot of fun with
                    you.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh.  No problem.  I had a lot of fun
                    too.      Raising Hope         1ARY06      "Happy Halloween"25.

                                      SABRINA
                    Come here.  

      Sabrina grabs Jimmy and they kiss.  Jimmy is in shock at
      first and then he enjoys it.  They break.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Wow.  That was amazing.

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah.

                                      SABRINA
                    Where did you learn to kiss like
                    that?  You better not be cheating on
                    me, Wyatt.

      Sabrina passes out.  Jimmy slinks out from under her and
      exits down the hallway.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy, not wearing a mask, enters to find the only thing in*
      the crib is a note.

                    Dude, Javier got a booty call.  And
                    if you remember, I didn't want to do
                    this in the first place.  It's cool
                    though.  I took Hope to the fire
                    station.  You've got until six a.m.
                    to go get her back.

      Jimmy looks at the clock.  It's 5:55.  Oh shit.  Burt sticks
      his head in the room.

      Jimmy enters and frantically looks for his keys.  Burt follows

                    She's at the fire station.  Those
                    idiots dropped her off there and
                    must have thought I would have been
                    home sooner.  I only have five minutes
                    to get her back.  Where are my keys?

                    You can't drive.  You've been
                    drinking.

                    You're right.  You drive.

                    So how was the party?

                    It started good.  Then it got bad. 
                    And then it got really good again. 
                    I kissed her.

                    Yeah.  Only she was really drunk and
                    she thought she was kissing her
                    boyfriend.  But apparently I'm a
                    better kisser than him so that's
                    good.

                                    BURT
                    You're welcome.  You got that from
                    your dad.  I'm a really good tongue
                    kisser.

      Jimmy notices something on the crib sheet.  *

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    That's weird.

                                    BURT
                    What?

                                      JIMMY
                    The sheet has drool on it and it's
                    still wet.  If she was at the fire
                    station for the last six hours, how
                    could this still be wet?

                                    BURT
                    Maybe the roof is leaking.

                                      JIMMY
                    It's not raining and the ceiling is
                    dry.

                                    BURT
                    Huh.  Maybe she spit up an ice cube.

      Jimmy looks over to Burt for a beat who purposely isn't
      looking back at him.

                                      JIMMY
                    What did you do?

      Burt looks at him for a beat.

                                    BURT
                    Okay, I think you're gonna laugh
                    about this.

      CHYRON: EARLIER THAT NIGHT

    We hear sirens.  Burt runs in the house holding a carton of
      eggs and quickly shuts the door behind him.  He ducks and
      looks out the window as a cop car goes by.  He turns to see
      Marcus and Javier watching TV.  

                                    BURT
                    What's up?

                                      JAVIER
                    We're baby-watching the baby.  

                                    BURT
                    Get out of here.

                                      MARCUS
                    I know.  Can you believe it?  I wanted
                    him to drop her at the fire station
                    but it turns out we're actually good
                    at this.  

                                      JAVIER
                    I sang her to sleep with a medley of
                    slow Beatles songs.  Marcus did the
                    whistling part for Blackbird.  It
                    was beautiful.  You would have cried,
                    Burt.  

                                    BURT
                    I bet.  So Jimmy's not home yet?

                                      JAVIER
                    No.

      Burt gets an idea.

                                    BURT
                    Oh, this is gonna be good.

      Burt is looking out the window.  He spots something and runs
      down the hallway.

                    He's coming.  He's coming.

      Burt, Javier and Marcus watch as Jimmy comes in the front
      door with a drunk Sabrina and carry her to the couch.  Burt
      quickly writes a note as Javier climbs out the window and
      Marcus hands Hope to Javier. *

      Burt puts the note in the crib while Marcus shuts the window*
      from the outside.  Burt hides behind the door as Jimmy enters*
      and sees the note in the crib.  As Jimmy reads it, Burt sneaks*
      out into the hallway and then back in the room.*

                    I lashed out.  Hug?*

      Burt puts his arms out.*

                                      JIMMY
                    Get out.

      Burt gets up and crosses to the door.

                                    BURT
                    Okay.  Fine.  Be mad.  But you can't
                    take back that hug.  That was a great
                    hug.  

      Burt exits.

      Jimmy is sleeping when we hear thunder crack.  Hope starts
    to cry and Jimmy crosses to the crib.

                    It's alright.  It's just thunder. 
                    That's the sound of Mommy knocking
                    something over in heaven.  Probably
                    a liquor store.

      Jimmy picks her up.  Thunder cracks again and she holds on
    to him tight.       Raising Hope         1ARY06      "Happy Halloween"32.

                    Whoa.  Okay, it's okay.  Wow. 
                    Somebody's holding on tight.  Wow. 
                    That does feel good. 

      Jimmy holds her for a beat and waits for the thunder again. 
    It doesn't happen.  He makes a thunder sound out of the corner
    of his mouth.  She holds on tight again.  Jimmy enjoys it. 
    He understands what Burt was talking about.  The song, "Leaves
    In The River" by Sea Wolf starts to play and continues during
      the next few scenes.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      From above, we see Sabrina sleeping on the couch.  The song
      slowly fades out as we push in on her peaceful, beautiful
      face as she sleeps.  After the music is completely stopped
    we linger on her for a beat.  Then she turns to the side and
      pukes on the floor.
