            We are running at Warp 7 to 
            rendezvous with the science vessel 
            S. S. Tsiolkovsky... 

      2    FULL ON WHITE DWARF (OPTICAL) 

        with the S.S. Tsiolkovsky in orbit. Then the Enterprise 
        appears and moves in to join the research vessel.

            ... which has been routinely 
            monitoring the collapse of a red 
            supergiant star into a white 
            dwarf. What has brought us here 
            is a series of strange messages 
            indicating something has gone 
            wrong aboard the research vessel. 

 
        The Tsiolkovsky still drifts in space. The Enterprise 
        is nearby. Over this:

            are downloading the research 
            information gathered on the 
            collapsing... 

      18   CLOSE ANGLE ON DWARF STAR (OPTICAL) 

        looking somehow strange, unstable, although we'd see 
        no surface movement at this range. 

                PICARD (V.O.) 
              (continuing) 
            ... star nearby. I am concerned 
            at being in such close orbit, but 
            the Tsiolkovsky's research 
            records... 

 
        as before. 

 
        The dwarf star in view too.

            Captain's log, supplemental. I 
            am concerned that away team member 
            Lieutenant La Forge has been taken 
            to Sickbay. The report: "unusual 
            behavior."

            The strange contaminant that led 
            to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky 
            crew is now aboard the 
            Enterprise... and our Engineering 
            Section has been commandeered by 
            young Wesley Crusher...

        No movement at all.                 STAR TREK: "The Naked Now" - REV. 7/1/87          37. 
 
 
        As before with very slow (at this distance) flaring from 
        the star.

            It is no longer an inconvenient 
            childish prank. Young Wesley 
            Crusher...

            Admittedly a victim of the 
            Tsiolkovsky "infection"... 

 
        as a tractor beam appears. 


        In the midst of a great flaring surface explosion, slow 
        at this distance but obviously enormously powerful. 
 
 
        still tied by the tractor beam, motionless. Riker's 
        voice reveals the strain he is under.

            Ship's log, First Officer Riker. 
            The star has begun disintegrating. 
            Enterprise will be destroyed 
            unless it can be moved out of the 
            path of the star material 
            hurtling... 

 
        It is large, irregularly shaped, moving very fast as it 
        was hurled off the star's surface with more power than 
        a hydrogen bomb. To gain a sense of size, it should 
        BLOCK OUT A WHOLE SECTION OF THE STARFIELD as it PASSES 
        CAMERA. 

                RIKER (V.O.) 
              (continuing) 
            ... toward us. Our only hope is 
            for Lieutenant Commander Data in 
            the time we have left, to regain 
            his senses and reconnect engine 
            power to the Bridge. 

 
        hurtling through space -- too fast. 

 
        with the star material looming large as it rushes down 
        upon them. 

 
        The Tsiolkovsky now begins drifting to one side, 
        beginning to spin clear with the Enterprise moving away 
        from it. 

        (OPTICAL) 

        The mass of material crashes into the Tsiolkovsky. Her 
        warp and impulse engines EXPLODE SIMULTANEOUSLY on 
        impact in a mighty BLAZE OF LIGHT. But Enterprise is 
        accelerating out of trouble. 


        Accelerating into WARP SPEED. 

                        FADE OUT. 

                                  THE END
