 
  A passenger boat sleeks along a river. 
 
A small island sandbar sits in the middle of the river.  
Flickering candlelights from a slum flicker in the  
  background. 
 
A JAPANESE BOATMAN oars onward. 
 
JAPANESE DAY LABORERS ready for a night on the town fill 
the boat. The men whisper, talk and LAUGH amongst 
  themselves. 
 
A DRUNK JAPANESE MAN with glittering eyes blankly stares 
ahead. 
 
  CHRISTOPHER KARGES, a 55-year-old AMERICAN, sits among them  
wearing a shabby old coat.  
 
Much of the dialogue in this film is delivered very slowly, 
eerily so, and at the speed we would expect from backwards 
country folk. All of the people speak in Japanese-accented  
English. 
 
The location is Japan sometime in the late 1800's. A  
couple of the Laborers look at Christopher: the stranger in  
  a strange land.  
 
                              LABORER 1 
                Stranger, is true you're all hung 
              like horses? 
 
                              LABORER 2 
              Guess he's had a taste of our 
              women and likes it. 
 
Vulgar LAUGHTER, and Christopher turns back to the  
  approaching islet.  
 
Years ago back in America, Christopher would have been too 
proper of a man to respond but by now he's way past caring. 
He's a traveling nobody. He's a man who has loved. A man 
like all men with fond memories and burdened with regrets. 
 
The boat cuts through the dark water. 
 
  Suddenly, a shock rolls through the boat. They've hit 
something. 
 
Reaction shot of Christopher.  
 
                              LABORER 1 
              What happened?

    Laborer 2 SCREAMS. 
 
    A young woman's corpse drifts past. 
 
                              BOATMAN 
                    (as if he's seen this 
                      too many times before) 
              Another floater. 
 
    To his own displeasure, the boatman takes a bamboo pole 
    pushes the dead woman's body far away. 
 
    Her long hair coils around the pole. 
 
                              BOATMAN (CONT'D)  
              She's heavy as lead. Probably 
              with child. 
 
    A hand reaches out from the water and quietly grabs the 
    side of the boat. It's a female hand! 
 
    The boat puddles along again. 
 
    The laborers pour their sake in the river to purify the 
    scene. 
 
                              LABORER 2 
              Rest in peace. 
 
    In the middle of the sandbar island, Christopher spies the 
    paper lanterns of the red light district and its country 
    whorehouses. 
 
                              LABORER 1 
              Boys, my nose is a tingling with 
              the smell of fancy face powder! 
 
    The men revive to their lively selves. Okay, so men do 
    think with their dicks. 
 
    The female hand that hugged the rails of the boat gently 
    disappears into the water. 
 
    A lamp light draws near. 
 
 
 
    Paper lanterns line the street festively illuminating the 
    front of a house of ill repute. 
 
    The latticed windows of the establishment. 
 
    The men size up the situation looking over the goods for 
    sale inside as if they were at a cattle auction. 
  3 


    JAPANESE PROSTITUTES dangle their hands out the windows 
    propositioning the men. The features of every last one of 
    them reek of a bottom barrel whorehouse. None of them are 
    particularly attractive. They're either too fat, too old, 
    too young, have massive ears or inbred faces like the boy 
    in DELIVERANCE. 
 
    A mix of close-up of these women all with their reasons for 
    being there and their own complexes. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              Yoshi! Yoshi, I missed you!  
 
                            MAN 
              You're looking as fine and ready 
              as ever. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 1 
              I had an itchin' to see you.  
              Every time I see you, I just  
              wanna... mmm! Get on in here, 
                handsome.  
 
    Entering with a grin on his face and the whore cuddling up 
    to his side, they head for the back bedrooms. 
 
      Christopher wanders on past. 
 
    Upon seeing this stranger in a strange land, the girls are 
    surprised but reach out their hands. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              You in the fancy clothes. I'll 
              take you to heaven and back. The 
              door is open if you know what I  
              mean. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 3 
                Stranger, you're not half bad 
              lookin'. And honey...I'm lookin'. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 
              Get a gander at the size of his 
              nose. Big nose, big hands, big  
              feet, big...  
 
    One WOMAN squats on the floor away from the others stretching 
    out their hands and calling out with their lovely sing-song 
    voices. 
 
    She has a lovely profile, much too lovely for this place. 
    But she is distant, not welcoming, and appears afraid of 
    something. 
 
    The MADAM OF THE HOUSE scolds her. The woman obstinately 
    refuses.  4 


    The Madam of the House slaps the woman's face and leaves. 
 
                              PROSTITUTE 2 (CONT'D) 
              How about it? Let's see if you're 
              as well equipped downstairs. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I am looking for someone. I 
              wonder if you ladies can help me  
              find her... Her name is Komomo.  
 
    The name has an immediate effect. They fall SILENT all at 
    once. 
 
      Christopher studies their faces hoping for a hint. 
 
 
      3 FLASHBACK 
 
    to Komomo's smiling face. The picture of innocence. 
    Everything that is good and pure. Non-judgmental and 
    loving. 
 
 
 
    BACK TO CHRISTOPHER 
 
    A TOUTER solicits Christopher. He's missing his nose from 
    syphilis. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              Hey, what are you? Dutch? 
              English? American? 
 
      Christopher nods. 
 
                              TOUTER (CONT'D) 
                I thought so. Well, you'd better 
              get a move on or it'll be 
              morning. What is done here is 
              best done in the dark. Every man 
              that comes here is looking for 
              the same thing. Come to stick it 
              betwixt a girl's legs, didn't ya? 
              Well, the ladies at my house are 
              the finest. You can't go wrong. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              I'm looking for a girl. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              I have lots of girls. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER  
              A girl named Komomo.   5 


 
    The ladies of the night are watching Christopher. The Tout 
    looks at the girls, who hush, then back to Christopher.  
 
                              TOUTER  
              Never heard of a girl called 
              that. She is not on this island. 
 
                              CHRISTOPHER 
              Then I guess it's time for me to 
              leave.  
 
    He starts to go. 
 
                              TOUTER 
              Not tonight you won't. No boat 
              until mornin', mister. You have  
              to spend the evening somewhere,  
              so it might as well be here. Come  
              on in and rest your bones. Pick 
              any Missy you please. I'll give 
              you a good price... and a better  
              lady.  
 
      Christopher points to the woman crouched down in the back.  
 
                              TOUTER (CONT'D)  
                Excellent choice! You sure know  
              how to pick them. 
                (lowering his voice) 
              She's very special girl.  
                (whispers, grinning  
              through rangy teeth)  
              As long as you come short of  
              killing her, she'll let you do 
                anything. 
 
    The touter takes Christopher by the arm and drags him into 
    the whorehouse. 
 
 
 
    Komomo sits near a lone tree in the hot summer  
    heat waiting for someone. We hear the cicadas chirping. 
    Could this be the time of her first trick as a whore? 
 
    She sits holding a pinwheel trying to catch the wind as she 
    searches for her own direction in life. She flutters around 
    lost in this kind of play. She finds the wind and smiles 
    into the camera.  
 
                              CHRISTOPHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              She was a sad, beautiful but most  
              of all...unfortunate. But I loved  
              her all the same. I had made up 
              my mind to take her back home  
              with me to America. I promised to  
              come back to her, but when I  
              returned she'd been sold off to 
              another bawdy house. I roamed  
              this land searching for her,  
                following any hint or clue for  
              her. Along the way, I've washed  
              away the filthy sludge from this 
                god-forsaken land and seen the  
              blank, empty faces of other  
                unfortunate women along the way.  
              I'm exhausted. But not too tired 
              to wonder what in the hell I am  
              doing in a place like this.

    9 ANGLE ON BEAUTIFUL KOMOMO  
 
    A shot of Komomo dissolves to one of a blue-eyed young 
    girl. 
 
 
 
    We see a nagekomi-dera, literally throw in temple, which is 
    much different from a standard Buddhist temple. It is  
    Komomo's abandoned, impoverished potter's grave.  
 
 
 
    Komomo's grave untended and laid in waste.

    A YOUNG GIRL (10) blows on a pinwheel. The left side of her 
    face is stiff and cramped. It's the woman as a child. 
 
    The girl picks Chinese lantern plants and wild 
      chrysanthemums. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              None of the other kids would play  
              with me because of my face. I was  
              all by myself. But it was easier  
              than being taunted and made fun  
              of.  
 
 
    21 THE VILLAGE OF DROUGHT GULCH 1- IXT. A DESOLATED TEMPLE 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Everyone in town detested me. But 
                a Buddhist priest showed me 
                kindness. 
 
    The young girl peers at a storybook of pictures of sinners 
    suffering in hell. 
 
                              BUDDHIST PRIEST 
              Pretty scary, huh?   14 


                               MORE  
                              BUDDHIST PRIEST(CONT D) 
              These drawings were made with  
              real blood. Listen to me now:  
              if you do bad things, you'll go  
              straight to hell. If you want to 
              go to heaven, you must do all good  
              things.  
 
    The young girl stares at the pictures. It's a drawing of 
    the dead squirming in pain for all eternity. 
 
 
 
    The mother and the enthralled little girl walk to the river  
    carrying buckets. 
 
                              MOTHER 
              Oh, sweetheart, my parents were  
              filthy rich. You should have seen  
              us when I was a girl. We had bags  
              of rice stacked head high in our 
              garden. We used to play on top of 
              them. We had a big pond, too,  
              with carp swimming all around. 
              One time, my father went to Kobe 
              and brought me some Western 
              candy. They were blue and red and 
              yellow all wrapped so fancy. 
 
                            GIRL 
              Wow. I wanna eat candy like that  
              someday, Mamma.  
 
                              MOTHER 
              One day you will. When you grow 
              up, I hope you'll leave this 
              village. You'll be happy!  
 
 
 
    The suffering father makes his way to the river under the  
    vast dark sky, takes a look up into the clouds above, and steps 
    into the water and sinks to the bottom, taking his  
    own life.   15 


 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              He didn't wanna cause us any more  
              trouble. Dadda died in that  
              river.  
 
 
 
    The mother and child discover the corpse floating in the 
    river. They break down WEEPING. 
 
 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.)  
              My momma tried her damndest but 
              couldn't make a living with a 
              child around. 
 
    The ten-year-old girl is taken away by a man. He pulls 
    her by force dragging her away. 
 
    Her mother sees her off in tears. 
 
                              MOTHER 
                    (calling out to her)  
              You'll be happy, I promise! 
              Always keep your chin up. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              From here it's the same old 
              story. I was bought and sold from  
              place to place and finally wound 
              up on this island.  
 
 
    27 WOMAN'S FLASHBACK - THE WHOREHOUSE 1 
 
    The whorehouse at night. The woman squats in her usual 
    place back away from the window and the other whores 
    calling out to the men. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Being a 'daughter of joy' is a 
              living hell. This place is 
                something out of the pictures I 
              saw in that book at the temple.  
              The pictures drawn in blood.  
 
 
    NEAR THE RIVER 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Our shack was built right on top  
              of a cursed area. Folks said it 
              was the crossroads where goblins 
              and bad spirits roamed.  
 
 
 
    A newborn baby is thrown into a river. 
 
    The woman's mother is the one doing the throwing. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              Momma wasn't a midwife. She 
              worked with babies but was more 
              of a 'specialist'. I'm sure you  
              have the same practice in  
              America, right?  
 
    The mother gives an expressionless stare as she watches the  
    dead fetus float down stream. 
 
 
    The mother exits the shed. She heads for the river right in 
    front of her staggering the whole time. 
 
    She throws the newborn baby into the river. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              You asked for the truth. Yes...I 
              was dumped in the river and left  
              to die, too.  
 
 
    LATER 
 
    The mother comes to the river to dispose of another aborted 
    child. 
 
    She HEARS the sound of a baby CRYING. 
 
    REVEAL SHOT: A CRYING BABY behind the reeds. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              But two days later, I was still  
              alive and kicking. 
 
    The mother can't believe her eyes. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)  
              Momma made up her mind to raise 
              me. 
 
 
 
    A young girl blows on a pinwheel, then places it in its  
    place next to several others, in memory of another baby  
    that will meet its fate at the time of its birth.  
 
    The left side of the young girl's face is stiff and  
    cramped. 
 
    The girl picks Chinese lantern plants and wild 
      chrysanthemums. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              As long as I can remember I 
              helped momma with her work.  
 
  31 


 
    The girl scurries to the river's edge, and dumps the fetus  
    in the river. 
 
    The FETUS MOANS as it floats down stream. 
 
    It suddenly opens its eyes.  
 
    The girl is startled with fear. 
 
    The fetus keeps it eyes on the girl as it washes down 
    stream. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              To this day, I still wonder what 
              it was looking at.  
 
 
 
    The mother and the little girl walk carrying buckets. 
 
    YOUNG BOYS from the village throws rocks at them. 
 
                              YOUNG BOY 1 
              Baby killer! 
 
                              YOUNG BOY 2 
              Beggar! 
 
                              YOUNG BOY 3 
              Freak!! 
 
                            ALL YOUNG BOYS 
              Freak! Freak! Freak! 
 
                              MOTHER 
              Go away, you little brats!  
 
    A rock HITS the girl and she drops the bucket. 
 
    The young boys SCREAM and scatter. 
 
    The girl says nothing and reaches to pick up the dead 
    fetus. 
 
 
 
    The father stumbles along the riverside, besotted by sake.  
 
    The girl suddenly jumps out from the underbrush brandishing 
    a wooden hammer. 
 
                              FATHER 
              Y-you. 
 
    He gets WHACKED on the back of the head making his escape. 
 
    Another blow is brought down upon his brains from behind. 
    Life and brains are running out the jagged hole in the back 
    of his head.  
 
    There's MOVEMENT on her SCALP: a RUSTLING in her hair.  
 
    With a final, victorious SCREAM, the girl grabs his head in  
    her hands, and drowns him in the river.  
 
    ANGLE - THEIR REFLECTION IN THE RIVER  
 
    An image of her OLDER SISTER with misshapen hair vaguely  
    reflects in the river, behind the horrified face of the  
    drunken, dying father.  
 
 
    RESUME SCENE   34 


 
 
    The father floats face down in the river. 
 
    As she watches him drift away, there is MOVEMENT behind  
    her.  
 
 
    - DAY  
 
    The ten year old girl is taken away by a man who she's been  
    sold to. They pull her by force dragging her away.  
 
    Her mother watches her daughter being taken away with an  
    expressionless face. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              I had nothing. Only this hole 
              bound for hell. Trading it to 
              make my living was only natural.  
 
 
    LATER 
 
    The mother discovers her crying baby. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              The fear of being possessed by  
              these twins would have scared 
              anyone. Momma brought us back  
              that day because she feared being 
              cursed. 
 
 
 
    The little girl unties her hair by a deserted riverbank. 
 
    Her sister pops out. 
 
    She sings a song in a very CHILDISH VOICE. 
 
 
 
    The little girl hides in the reeds, waiting to ambush her  
    drunken father, who is weaving unsteadily down the road.  
 
                              SISTER 
              Kill, kill, kill, kill. 
 
    The little girl whips out a wooden hammer. 
 
                              FATHER 
              Y-you! 
 
    She violently smashes the hammer into his head, over and  
    over.  
 
                            GIRL 
              Die, die, die, die! 
 
 
 
    After killing her father, the face of her twin sister 
    reflects in the river. 
 
    Her twin happily LAUGHS. 
 
                              WOMAN (V.O.) 
              It turned out that Momma and  
              Dadda were brother and sister.  
              People found out and ran them out 
              of town. While begging their way 
              across the country, they escaped  
              to this place. My sister and I  
              were cursed long before coming  
              into this world.
