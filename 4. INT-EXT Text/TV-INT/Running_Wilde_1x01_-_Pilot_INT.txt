                                TRUDY
                  My name s Trudy, I m 12 years old --

    A young girl (Trudy) fixes her hair then steps out of the 
    tent...


    Emmy and Trudy are there.  Andy Weeks, Emmy s environmentalist 
    boyfriend enters.  He s a mid-western white man.  

                                ANDY
                  Well, they re scouting. In six months 
                  this will be nothing but oil rigs. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  That s Andy -- My mom s fiance.  He 
                  considers himself an eco-terrorist.


                                ANDY
                  Don t worry, I sent a little surprise 
                  package to the company headquarters -- 
                  see how they like getting  covered in 
                  oil.   (to self)  I hope I put the 
                  right postage on that.  (off look) 
                  On the other hand you could...make a 
                  personal plea?

                                EMMY
                  No.  That was a lifetime ago.  I 
                  would never give him the 
                  satisfaction.  (then) Unless he 
                  sought me out first

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  See what I mean?  For a generous 
                  person she can be pretty selfish.                                                                                      3.



    Close up of Steven Wilde - rich, entitled, and currently 
    staring straight ahead while driving 800 miles per hour.

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  This is Steve Wilde.  And unlike us, 
                  he has everything.  

    We see a ridiculously thin car rocket past the camera at 
    blinding speed as parachutes deploy.

                                TRUDY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  He has the world's fastest land 
                  car...


    Close up of Steve, equally focused, but somehow calmer.

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  ...the world's slowest land car...

    Time-lapse photos show a large vehicle with an eye slit 
    crossing the finish line.  A bearded Steve emerges.

                                TRUDY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Tons of beautiful women.  

    Three photos.  1.)  Restaurant:  Steve is with a beautiful 
    woman while ogling a pretty waitress nearby.  2.) Nightclub: 
    Steve is now on a date with the waitress from the previous 
    shot, but is ogling out the Diana Ross impersonator on stage.  
    3.)  Restaurant:  Steve looks disappointed as he eats dinner 
    with a proud bald black man with great cheekbones.

                                TRUDY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  And his family owns Wilde Oil. 

    We see the logo for Wilde Oil, along with the slogan  We ll 
    Clean Up Tomorrow! 

                                TRUDY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Yet deep down I think he s lonely. 


    Steve looks out the window, lost.  Migo stands nearby.  (Migo 
    is late thirties -- Sancho Panza to Steve s Quixote.  Speaks 
    with a slight accent, he tries to encourage Steve to grow as a 
    person, but he s not going to lose his job over it.)  

                                MIGO
                  Is this about the contest?                                                                                       4.


                                STEVE
                  No, I just -- Okay, yes, so I thought 
                  I could dance -- but, no, it s just 
                  that I ve barely gotten any RSVPs to 
                  my award banquet.  It s almost like 
                  everyone thinks I m just giving the 
                  Humanitarian award to myself.

                                MIGO
                  You are. 

                                STEVE
                  Or that I m not deserving of a it. 

                                MIGO
                  You re not. 

                                STEVE
                  But I guess that s just my father s 
                  voice in my head.

                                MIGO
                  No, that was me.  

                                STEVE
                  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say... 
                   when did Dad start rolling his r s?  

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  Migo helps take care of Steve.  Sort 
                  of like my mom does with the tribe.

                                MIGO
                  You know, maybe you d feel better if  
                  instead of thinking about what you 
                  have, you think about what others 
                  don t have.

                                STEVE
                  Hey.  That does make me feel better.  
                  I mean, I ve got more than them. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  ...and about as successfully. 

                                MIGO
                  Well, it is what I said.

    We hear a buzzer.  Steve notices a monitor.  On the monitor we 
    see an extreme low angle shot of a man on a horse at the gate.  
    This is Steve's Oxford accented "frenemy" FA'AD Shaoulian.  

                                FA AD
                  Permission to enter, my friend?

                                STEVE
                  Permission granted, Fa ad!                                                                                      5.


                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  And that s Steve s neighbor, Fa ad.  
                  They re always trying to one up each 
                  other.

                                STEVE
                  (to Migo) He s flaunting his new 
                  horse.  Get my new horse!  The big 
                  one! 

    Migo takes off in one direction as Steve runs in the other, 
    ripping off his coat and putting on his helmet.

                                STEVE (CONT D)
                  Mount me!  Get me mounted!   

    We see shots of Steve running calling to servants intercut 
    with dramatic partial shots of hooves galloping.


                                FRAU
                  My Steven is hurting... 

    Reveal Frau Stellvertreter, (Austrian accent, late sixties, 
    bright red hair) watching the interaction on a security 
    monitor. She rushes out.  We see photos as Trudy explains:

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  She used to be his nanny, but you 
                  know how some monkeys never learn to 
                  swing from trees because their 
                  mothers wait too long to teach them?   
                  That s the kind of monkey Frau is.                                                                                      7.


    PHOTO of four year old Steve in the bow of a boat in an indoor 
    swimming pool -- Frau holds the oars. PHOTO of Steve as a 
    teenager helps his date onto a speedboat (the  atta  boy ).  
    Frau sits at an outboard engine.  PHOTO OF Steve and Frau 
    jumping from an airplane.  Steve is strapped to her stomach. 


    Migo looks through National Geographics.  He comes across a 
    photo of a Ticunan tribe at the center of which stands Emmy.  


    Migo drives next to Steve.  In the back of the limo a small 
    horse sticks its face through the pass through.  

                                STEVE
                  Does this look like a baby horse to 
                  you?

                                MIGO
                  It s a really small horse.

                                STEVE
                  But a small adult horse?  Or small 
                  because it's a full sized horse that 
                  is still a baby?  
                                (MORE)                                                                                    10.

                                STEVE (CONT'D)
                  Because it s so trembly.  And it 
                  seems like it doesn't know anything. 

                                MIGO
                  Well, it's never too late for any of 
                  us to develop wisdom.  It s kind of 
                  like you -- I mean, tonight might 
                  just be a night that pushes you to 
                  want to ask more of yourself.    

                                STEVE
                  Its breath is so milky. 

    Steve's phone vibrates.  He reads it.  

                                STEVE (CONT D)
                  "Father."  It's my father.  (into 
                  phone)  Hello!  I'm looking forward 
                  to seeing you at my award tonight... 
                  No, I know I didn t earn it... or 
                  anything!  Good one.  No, it s not 
                  supposed to mean anything.   I m 
                  just... Happy to just to hear your 
                  voice.  (upbeat)  a-HA! 

    Steve hangs up, devastated.  After a moment.  

                                MIGO
                  Yes, now that I think about it it is 
                  definitely an adult horse.  Yes, this 
                  is a pony that has seen much of the 
                  world.  

                                STEVE
                  I hate its baby guts.  (Then 
                  rallying)  Hey let's get rid of this 
                  thing and go for a drink. I m not 
                  going to know anyone at this thing 
                  anyway. 

                                MIGO
                  One never knows what sort of 
                  surprises await one who attempts to-- 

                                STEVE
                  You re beginning to bug me, Migo.

                                MIGO
                  I ll tie him to that yield sign.


    Emmy has parked in front of a dry cleaner.  Trudy waits in the 
    car as we see Emmy at the counter and hear her faintly.                                                                                    11.


                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  My mother and I meanwhile had stopped 
                  to pick up a dress.  

                                EMMY
                  Thank you so much... my housekeeper 
                  dropped it off and she always forgets 
                  the ticket.  


    Trudy eyes her mother who wears the new dress.  

                                EMMY
                  It belongs to a rich person.  And 
                  we re going to return it.  Look, all 
                  anyone here cares about are 
                  appearances and I don t want him to 
                  see me and think I m a total failure.  
                  (then)  You know, I m doing it for 
                  the tribe.

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  I wanted to point out what a 
                  hypocrite she was being, but I wasn t 
                  exactly one to talk.

                                EMMY
                  How do I look.

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  She looked great.

    Trudy makes a so-so sign.  Emmy gives her a cock-eyed look.  
    Trudy smiles.  


    The door opens and Steve and Emmy tumble in, locked in an 
    embrace.  They paw and rip at each other moaning how much 
    they ve missed one another, etc. when Emmy puts a stop to it.

                                EMMY
                  Oh, God, what am I doing?  This is 
                  wrong.  I m not here for this.  I 
                  need something. 

                                STEVE
                  Oh, come on, we both know that wasn t 
                  your knee.

                                EMMY
                  I m engaged to a wonderful man. 

                                STEVE
                  (Gamely covering.) a-HA!     

    They part.  And Steve helps her out of the room.

                                EMMY
                  In the Amazon.  We re currently 
                  working together in Ecuador trying to 
                  preserve a wonderful tribe called the 
                  Ticuna.  They re very poor.

    Steve makes a sad face.                                                                                     15.


                                EMMY (CONT D)
                  But their village sits on a giant oil 
                  deposit.  It s oil your father would 
                  love to get his hands on.  That s why 
                  I m coming to you.  

                                STEVE
                  (puts it all together)  Ah-sooo. 

                                EMMY
                  Soo... you ll call him?

    But Steve is already on the phone.  Emmy looks delighted.

                                STEVE
                  Steven Wilde for Steven Wilde please.  
                  Well, perhaps he will if he knows I m 
                  calling with a tip about a monster 
                  oil lake sitting under some poor 
                  tribe that needs some cash-- (to 
                  Emmy, off her protest)  Oh, don t 
                  worry, Emmy, we re all going to wet 
                  our beaks on this one.  

                                EMMY
                  No, Steve!  He knows.  It s his 
                  company that s driving these people 
                  off their land.  

                                STEVE
                  Oh.  Well, that s a real beak dryer.    

                                EMMY
                  No, Steve, you have to tell him not 
                  to drill there. 

                                STEVE
                  (getting it)  Oh.  Yeah, see.  I 
                  can t do that.  See I m currently 
                  getting the bulk of my income from my 
                  father so if I ask him to stop making 
                  money -- well, I think it just sends 
                  a very mixed message.  He calls me a 
                  good for nothing as it is. 

                                EMMY
                  So, I guess you don t really care 
                  about charity after all. 

                                STEVE
                  Charity?  Oh, did you want... money?

                                EMMY
                  I don t want your money.  I want you 
                  to help me.  Isn t that what being a 
                  humanitarian is all about?                                                                                    16.


    Emmy gestures to a nearby banner that says  Wilde Oil s 
    Humanitarian of the Year, Steven Wilde. 

                                EMMY (CONT D)
                  Wait... Is this award from Wilde oil? 

                                STEVE
                  Yeah.  But, Wilde Oil gave money away 
                  in my name.   And not just for the 
                  tax write off.  Also because I really 
                  wanted an award.

                                EMMY
                  You don t do charity for an award, 
                  Steve.  The point is to do good for 
                  nothing.  That s what I do.  But your 
                  dad s right, that s what you still 
                  are.  Good for nothing. 

    Emmy turns and starts off.  Steve desperately calls after.

                                STEVE
                  I saved a horse today! 

                                EMMY
                  (turns back)  You did?

                                STEVE
                  I'm going to.  I know where we left 
                  it.

    Emmy turns and exits.  Steve is devastated.  Frau approaches.

                                FRAU
                  Don t listen to her.  She s jealous 
                  of you.  Now go, get your award.

                                STEVE
                  No, she s right.  I am good for 
                  nothing.  I m a shallow immature man 
                  who thinks a little plaque is going 
                  to make me happier than actually 
                  accomplishing anything meaningful 
                  with my-- Oh, my God it s huge!

    The epiphany was short lived for Steve has noticed the 
    enormous door-sized plaque being wheeled onto the stage.

                                STEVE (CONT D)
                  Fa ad will feel a holocaust of envy!

    Frau smiles, relieved as Steve bounds for his award.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    17.


                                      ACT THREE


    Emmy and Trudy are driving in the Subaru.  

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  We d been in the car for a while 
                  before my mom actually told me what I 
                  already knew.  

                                EMMY
                  He's not going to help the tribe. I 
                  should have never let myself think we 
                  might still have something. (off 
                  Trudy s look)  That s right -- I used 
                  to care about him.


    Steve enters his home and crosses to his bar.

                                MIGO
                  I know.  You forget, my mother was 
                  one of their seven housekeepers.                                                                                    18.


                                STEVE
                  They were truly rich.  They had seven 
                  housekeepers.

                                MIGO
                  That many? 

                                STEVE
                  And she was my only friend.  We even 
                  shared our birthdays. 


    An elaborate child s birthday party is underway.  SEVEN YEAR 
    OLD STEVE is being feted in grand style.  A baby elephant is 
    brought out for him. 

                                STEVE (V.O.)
                  Of course our fathers hated each 
                  other.  They were always competing.

    A moment later an adult elephant is brought out for SEVEN YEAR 
    OLD EMMY.  Steve is thrilled, and pushes his friend Emmy 
    playfully.  She pushes back.  They laugh. 


    Emmy s telling the same story. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  My mom meanwhile was telling me the 
                  story I d heard before, too. 

                                EMMY
                  The more they tried to keep us apart 
                  the closer we became.


    A huge cake is being enjoyed by all the kids.  NINE YEAR OLD 
    EMMY finds a bracelet in her piece.  NINE YEAR OLD STEVE 
    coughs up a key that he d eaten from his.  Everyone claps as 
    Frau points to a Vespa.  Emmy looks upset.  

    Steve gives her the key to the Vespa.  She looks happy and 
    pushes him.  He pushes her back.  Now Frau looks upset. 


                                EMMY
                  Finally my father moved us away.  I 
                  was so mad I didn t speak to him for 
                  a year. Of course I didn t know...                                                                                    19.



                                STEVE
                  ...My father had driven him out of 
                  business.  They were broke.  Then 
                  after college (chokes on bar mix) 

                                MIGO
                  I ve got it.  After college you ran 
                  into her in Mexico on Spring Break. 


                                EMMY
                  ...and then some stuff happened...

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  Gee, I wonder what that was. 

                                EMMY
                  And I asked him to join me in the 
                  Peace Corps, and he was unsure, but I 
                  told him how helping others had made 
                  me happy. I wasn t a snob anymore.  


                                MIGO
                  And for the first time in your life--

    Steve finishes a glass off water.

                                STEVE
                  --I felt like I was worth something. 
                  I liked sacrificing!


                                EMMY
                  And I never saw him again...                                                                                     21.



                                STEVE
                  (upbeat)  And that s when Dad bought 
                  me my first speedboat. 

                                MIGO
                  Hey, is this the same speedboat that 
                  you ended up flipping...

                                STEVE
                  (shamed)  While showing off for 
                  Kiefer.  


                                EMMY
                  Anyway, at least I was able to walk 
                  out on him this time.  And didn t 
                  take his money.  Not that it wouldn t 
                  be nice to fly home instead of drive 
                  for two weeks, or even sit in a 
                  restaurant -- but hey, we re doing 
                  okay, right, kiddo?  We're doing 
                  okay?

    Emmy turns to see Trudy eating head first out of Emmy s purse. 

                                EMMY (CONT D)
                  I ve got to ask Steve for that money.


                                STEVE
                  No, I can t lose her again.  I have 
                  to win her back.

                                MIGO
                  Well, maybe you could rectify her 
                  tribe problem 

                                STEVE
                  Easy for you to say except for the 
                  word rectify.  How? I can t offer 
                  them money.  And gifts?  I don t even 
                  know their sizes. 

                                MIGO
                  I mean how they re losing their home. 

    Steve considers, then has an epiphany.


    Steve falls into the limo and lands at the feet of Trudy.

                                STEVE
                  Emmy?  (then)  What are you doing 
                  here?  Oh, right, you don't speak and 
                  I m not a mind reader. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  As it turns out he was half right.  

    Steve leans away to open the door when Trudy finally speaks. 

                                TRUDY (CONT D)
                  I can t go back to the jungle.  I 
                  need your help. 

    This has stopped Steve midway through opening the car door.  

                                STEVE  (V.O.)
                  Okay, but if you let anyone know I 
                  can read minds the deal's off.

    Steve tumbles out of the car.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    27.


                                        ACT FOUR


    Steve and Trudy are there.  Migo stands nearby.

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  I finally was able to explain to 
                  someone why I d stopped talking. 

                                TRUDY (CONT D)
                  Everything with her is about helping 
                  the needy.  I thought maybe if she 
                  thought I couldn t speak she d 
                  finally try helping me. 

                                STEVE
                  Oh, it s just like Frau.  Everything 
                  she does is for me.  It s like  let 
                  me do something for me! 

                                FRAU (O.S.)
                  Yummies for the little runaway?

    Frau approaches with milk and cookies.  Trudy lights up, but 
    Frau places them in front of Steve.

                                FRAU (CONT D)
                  Next time you tell Frau before you go 
                  sneaking off with Migo.  Honestly, 
                  you're going to turn this hair gray!

    Frau exits.  Steve slides the cookies to Trudy. 

                                TRUDY
                  Look, I can't do puberty in the 
                  Amazon...  and I thought, maybe you 
                  could help me convince my mom that I 
                  have to stay here or something. 

                                STEVE
                  Yeah, your mom is not fond of me.  

                                TRUDY
                  Look, people tell you a lot of things 
                  when they think you can t repeat 
                  them.  And my mom does like you.  She 
                  just thinks you re selfish.  But I ve 
                  got a plan to make her think you re a 
                  great guy.  Do you have a friend that 
                  you can ask to act like a doctor.

                                STEVE
                  Hm.  Friends are kind of the weakest 
                  part of my portfolio.                                                                                      28.


                                MIGO
                  This might not be a good idea.  Rich 
                  people, they re not such good liars.  

                                STEVE
                  We don t really ever have to.
                  We get to say things like  no, I 
                  don t remember you  ...or  I side-
                  swiped your car,  or  I won t be 
                  coming to your party because you have 
                  unattractive friends.   

                                MIGO
                  Hey, maybe that s why you don t have 
                  any friends.  

    Steve considers.  Could be. 

                                TRUDY
                  But you know I can speak now.  So you 
                  have to lie -- if my mom finds out 
                  I ve been faking she ll take away-- 
                  well, I really only have that one 
                  thing.  But I like that thing!  It s 
                  like... my favorite thing.  

                                STEVE
                  Well... I guess if it s for a thing. 


                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  And so Steve asked the closest thing 
                  to a friend that he could find, and 
                  called my Mom to say he d found me. 

    Steve is there as Emmy rushes in.

                                EMMY
                  How is she?  Where is she?

                                STEVE
                  She's in the parlor room with the 
                  doctor. 

                                EMMY
                  Oh my God, is she okay?

                                STEVE
                  (Chuckling)  Oh, he's not that type 
                  of doctor.  (then)  He s a 
                  psychiatrist and no she s not. 

                                EMMY
                    A psychiatrist?  Is this about her 
                  not talking?  She's just going 
                  through a phase.                                                                                    29.


                                FA AD (O.S.)
                  I completely concur. 

    Fa'ad has entered with Trudy.  He wears a white duster that 
    kind of looks like a lab coat and holds The Audubon book of 
    birds under his arm.  Emmy runs and hugs her.

                                FA'AD
                  Hello, I m Doctor. (Flirting)  Your 
                  daughter didn't tell me you were so 
                  beautiful.

                                STEVE
                  Well, I'm sure she didn't tell you 
                  anything, did she, Doctor Fa ad?

                                FA'AD
                  Not in so many words.

                                STEVE
                  But zero words, though, right?

                                FA'AD
                  (Turns away speaking stiffly)  This 
                  child cannot be moved.  She is on the 
                  verge of a severe pathology.

    Reveal Fa'ad is reading off notes in his Audubon book.

                                FA'AD (CONT D)
                  She has no sense of herself.  Perhaps 
                  it comes from having no 'real' 
                  home... My suggestion?  You should 
                  enroll her in an American school.  

     He snaps it shut and turns back to them. 

                                STEVE
                  Doesn t Beverly Hills Jr. High have 
                  an excellent program for dumb kids?

                                FA AD
                  The best and the dumbest, but of 
                  course one can t attend without 
                  living in Beverly Hills proper.

                                STEVE
                  But sure they could live with me -- 
                  for a while, don t you think?  

    A long pause.  Fa ad sneaks a clumsy look at his crib sheet.  

                                FA AD
                  This child cannot be moved!

    Steve is thrown by the out of sequence comment.                                                                                      30.


                                STEVE
                  But doesn t Beverly Hills Junior High 
                  have a program for that?

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  They were both horrible liars.  They 
                  clearly had no experience.  And 
                  obviously I couldn t jump in. 

                                FA AD
                  Your daughter didn t tell me you were 
                  so beautiful. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  They were pulling out lines that I d 
                  nixed in rehearsal, like;

                      STEVEFA AD
    Well, Doctor Magazine says Thank you, Doctor.
    you re the best in the world. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  And just as quickly they jumped to 
                  the end.

                      FA ADSTEVE
    Any time.Thank you for coming by.

                                FA AD
                  (starts out, then)  Any time? 

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  But for some reason, my mom didn t 
                  notice.  Maybe because she didn t 
                  want to go back to the jungle either. 

                                EMMY
                  I don't know, I'm supposed to live 
                  here because of some doctor that -- I 
                  can t even afford to pay. 

                                STEVE
                  I took care of that.  And he s not 
                  "some" doctor.  He s one of the most 
                  ethical and respected men working in 
                  the medical profession today.

    Through the window (and unseen by Emmy) we see Fa'ad cross 
    through on his tiny horse pulling something on a leash.  After 
    a moment we see the leash is attached to the tiny horse that 
    used to be Steve s.  

                                EMMY
                  Okay, but we re only staying long 
                  enough to see if this brings Trudy 
                  out of her shell.                                                                                     31.


    In the background we now see that the leash following the tiny 
    horse is pulling the giant humanitarian plaque on a wagon.


    Emmy is led into the elegant room.  She takes it in.  The soft 
    bed.  The sheets.  She clearly misses it.  She takes a look 
    around, then jumps into the bed.  Steve enters with roses.  
    She gets up, embarrassed.

                                EMMY
                  What are you doing?

                                STEVE
                  I just want this to feel like it s 
                  your home.  That s all.

                                EMMY
                  Oh.  Well, thank you.  That s sweet. 

    Migo appears with a small bag that says  Antacids.  Steve 
    quickly grabs them and shoos him away before she notices.

                                EMMY (CONT D)
                  But I don t want to get used to this. 

                                STEVE
                  No.  You deserve it.  Look, I m sorry 
                  I said what I did before.  You ve 
                  sacrificed so much -- and plus-- 
                  eleven foundations.

                                EMMY
                  I might have stretched the truth on 
                  that.  It s a lot harder to help 
                  people than you think.  Twenty years 
                  of doing this and all I ve gotten is 
                  a little worn around the edges. 

                                STEVE
                  But you ve tried.  I ve never even 
                  done that. I ve just never had any 
                  reason to.  I d love to have edges.  
                  Look at these hands.  No callouses.  
                  I ve never had to lift a thing.

    Emmy steps closer.  She takes his hand and runs her finger 
    over it.  It s an intimate moment.

                                EMMY
                  What about this?                                                                                    32.


                                STEVE
                  (a moment then) Golf.  A game I play 
                  every day with my so called friend 
                   Fa ad.   The only person I know who 
                  also has never had a job and has 
                  never accomplished anything. 

    Emmy pulls back a little. 

                                EMMY
                  He s never had a job?

                                STEVE
                  He s not even ashamed of it.  I mean 
                  talk about a (instantly, recalling) 
                  DOCTOR!  But  Doctor  is more of a 
                  career than a job, don t you think? 

    Trudy appears at the door, unseen.  

                                EMMY
                  You lied to me.  How dare you take 
                  advantage of me like that.  Of her.  

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  Steve was going to tell her it was my 
                  plan and that I could talk.  

                                STEVE
                  (finally)  You re right.  I m sorry.  
                  It was selfish of me.  

                                EMMY
                  It always is. 

    Steve turns to see Trudy.  He looks at her and shrugs, but 
    Emmy has already grabbed her hand and taken her away. 


                                EMMY
                  How dare he.  How DARE he.  I never 
                  want to see him again.  He s just as 
                  self involved and oblivious-- 

                                TRUDY
                  It was my idea, okay Mom?  I asked 
                  him to do it. 

                                EMMY
                  Now you re going to defend him?  
                  Fine, let me hear it.  Let me hear 
                  why it s okay that he took advantage 
                  of a twelve year old girl who -- I 
                  KNEW YOU COULD TALK! 

    She pulls over.                                                                                     33.


                                EMMY (CONT D)
                  What is this?  What are you doing?  
                  Why haven t you talked?  

                                TRUDY
                  Because you don t listen!

                                EMMY
                  When have I ever not listened to you?

                                TRUDY
                  How many times have I said I don't 
                  want to live in the jungle.

                                EMMY
                  Well, everyone says that.  The tribe 
                  says that.

                                TRUDY
                  That's because nobody wants to live 
                  there!   So, I thought I d make my 
                  point the way you did with your 
                  father. (off her look)  You didn t 
                  speak to him for a year. 

                                EMMY
                  Honey.  That s just an expression.  
                  Like  what nice weather we re 
                  having. 

                                TRUDY
                  (pointedly)  I ve never heard that 
                  expression. 

                                EMMY
                  So, what, you re saying you want to 
                  stay with Steve?  A man who only puts 
                  himself first. 

                                TRUDY
                  Not this time.  He took the blame for 
                  this even though he knew it would 
                  mean losing you as a friend.    

                                EMMY
                  Yeah... so why would he do that?

    Emmy contemplates this.


    Steve is there with Emmy and Trudy. 

                                EMMY (CONT D)
                  Why d you do that?                                                                                     34.


                                STEVE
                  I didn t want her to get in trouble.

                                EMMY
                  But what did you get out of it?

                                STEVE
                  Nothing.  (then, realizing)  I did 
                  good for nothing!  (pushes her) 

                                EMMY
                  You did good for nothing!  (pushes 
                  him back)  So maybe you re not a lost 
                  cause after all.  

                                STEVE
                  Does that mean you ll stay?

                                EMMY
                  Well, my fiance wasn t happy about 
                  it, but he trusts me.  And I don t 
                  have much of a choice.  My daughter 
                  wants to go to school here.  

                                STEVE
                  Great.  And maybe you can find a new 
                  charity.  Something around here.

                                EMMY
                  Oh, I already have.  Instead of 
                  helping a few poor people, I m going 
                  to make one rich guy help a lot of 
                  poor people.

                                STEVE
                  I love it!  And I have a great idea 
                  for the rich guy.  Kiefer Sutherland.  
                  He owes me a boat.

                                EMMY
                  It s you, Steve.  But I m going to 
                  have to undo a lot of entitlement 
                  that s been ingrained in you for a 
                  long time.  So if you re not game for 
                  it.

                                STEVE
                  I can t see a single bad thing coming 
                  from this.


    On the monitor we see Emmy and Steve s conversation play out.   
    As we pull back we first come to a pair of hands angrily 
    brushing out a bright red wig.  We pan to the window and see 
    Andy, watching as well.  Then his box explodes.  Frau throws 
    the wig on and then picks up the phone.                                                                                     35.



                                STEVE
                  Sounds like Frau has popped the 
                  champagne. 

                                EMMY
                  Then we re staying.

                                TRUDY 
                  Oh, boy!  I ll go get my thing!

    Trudy runs off.  Emmy moves in on Steve, flirtatiously

                                EMMY
                  I m going to make you a better 
                  person.  

    Steve nods, then moves in too.

                                STEVE
                  Okay, but I won t lie. I ll be trying 
                  to make you a worse one. 

                                EMMY
                  (playfully)  Maybe once you convince 
                  me you really have become a 
                  humanitarian.

                                STEVE
                  Okay, so I am going to have to lie.

    We pull out from the giant, but somehow now homey mansion.

                                TRUDY (V.O.)
                  And that s how I went from a village 
                  to a kingdom.  And maybe finally 
                  found my own tribe.  Things were 
                  finally going to be easy.

    We find Andy, covered in oil, still watching through the 
    window.  Red lights approach and we see him running and 
    slipping and trying to save his own, now very dark, skin. 

                                TRUDY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Except for Andy who received the 
                  beating of his life from the Beverly 
                  Hills Police Department.
