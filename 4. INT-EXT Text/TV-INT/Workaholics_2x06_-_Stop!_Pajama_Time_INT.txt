      In the B.G. we notice BLAKE creeping through the office 
      carrying a bunch of brown-bag lunches and coolers.

                    I m thinking about getting a new

      ANGLE ON Blake, he quickly ducks down, heads out.

                    was a prop from Alien:

      Jillian, SMOKING, sweaty and going through the fridge.  The 
      guys enter.

                                  BLAKE
                    Hey, Boss.  How s life at the top?

      Anders SIGHS audibly, annoyed.

                          (stressed)
                    Well, I can t find my Uncrustables, 
                    I have to fire five people and my 
                    butthole is sweating like a mother.

      Anders  skin is red and irritated at the collar of the 
      onesie.

                                  ANDERS
                    Very nasty, but Alice is letting 
                    you fire people now?  Seriously?

                                    JILLIAN
                    Five people.  End of today.  What s

                    Why are you doing that?

                    Alice was gonna do it today, but 
                    then she got the flu and it has to 
                    be done today otherwise we re going 
                    to be over budget in Q4, I don t

                    And I shall play the part of the

                        ...OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!

      Adam finally dies.  Blake kneels down beside him and shuts 
      his eye.  Beat.  Adam jumps up, dusts off. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    So you get the basic idea, right?

                                    JILLIAN
                    Thanks guys.  That was really helpful.   

                                  BLAKE
                    You can do this.    

                                  ADAM
                    Good luck.  

      The guys head out.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Adam?  One more thing.  

      Adam comes back.

                                  ADAM
                    What s up?  You want to go over it 
                    one more time?  

                                    JILLIAN
                    You are... fired. 

                                  ADAM
                    Good.  Very good.  That was great.

                    You re fired.  For real.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Adam is on his feet stalking back and forth in front of 
      Jillian and Blake.

                                  ADAM
                    Is this a joke?  Because it s 
                      brilliant.  It s a brilliant joke, 
                    but a very dumb thing to do for 
                    real.  So if this is for real, it s 
                    dumb.

                                    JILLIAN
                    It s for real.

                                  ADAM
                    How many times have I saved your 
                    life, Jillian?

                                    JILLIAN
                    I don t know--

                                  ADAM
                    Never!  Thank god.  I thought we 
                    were work friends!  And you just 
                    say it like, like a cold-blooded 
                    robot!

                                    JILLIAN
                    I m just doing what you told me--

                                  ADAM
                    Oh, that s rich.  That.  Is.  RICH!

                                  BLAKE
                    Adam, relax.  It s probably just a 
                    mix up.  Why would they fire one of 
                    their best salesmen?

                                  ADAM
                          (in Jillian s face)
                    Triple true.  It s a mistake.  
                    Besides Alice is the only one that 
                    can really fire anyone and until I 
                    hear it from her mouth, I ain t 
                    going NO WHERE!





                                                                              (CONTINUED)          Workaholics - Firing Squad - Network Draft - 12/13/10        18.

                          (tearing up)
                    This is exactly what I didn t want 
                    to happen.  Now I m gonna get 
                    fired.

                                  ADAM
                          (backing off)
                    Jillian, no one is getting fired.  
                    Get Alice on the horn and let s fix 
                    the sitch.  Uation.

                                    JILLIAN
                    But she said only to call if it s a 
                    real emergency.

                                  ADAM
                    Is this an emergency?

      Adam hockey checks the water cooler into the wall.

      Jillian quickly jumps on the phone and dials Alice.

                                    JILLIAN
                          (into phone, terrified)
                    Alice, hi this is-- ...No, things 
                    are great.  Was just wondering 
                    about this whole firing thing.  
                    What if they unfire themselves? ... 
                    No, I haven t even started.
                          (pepping up, smiling)
                    ... Oh really?  No, that s great 
                    news.  Terrific!  Thanks so much, 
                    Alice.  Buh bye.

      Jillian hangs up, grinning.

                                  ADAM
                    So she s letting me slide.  I knew 
                    it.  Can t get rid of the eye-
                    candy.  Mama needs her snacks.

                                    JILLIAN
                    No, she s coming in to fire people 
                      personally, which lifts a huge 
                    weight off my shoulders, but also, 
                    about that, I am so sorry, Adam.

                                  BLAKE
                    Uh boi.          Workaholics - Firing Squad - Network Draft - 12/13/10        19.



      Anders dances before most of the office in their onesies.  
      Doing step by step Bollywood dance moves.  He wears one of 
      those decorative belts with bells and the collar rash has 
      spread to his face and one eye is irritated.

                                  ANDERS
                    Wrists, 2-3-4.  Hips, 2-3-4.  Now 
                    stop, and crank, 4.  Wind like a 
                    snake and crank, 4...

      Adam and Blake arrive.

                                  ANDERS (CONT D)
                    Finally.  Find a spot in the back 
                    and try to keep up.  We re going 
                    over lyrics in a second.

                                  BLAKE
                    Yo, take five,  cause Adam s about 
                    to be fired.

      This catches Ders off guard, but doesn t shock him.

                                  ANDERS
                    What?!

                                  ADAM
                    I was on that list of people for 
                    Jillian to fire.

                                  ANDERS
                    I m sorry to hear that, but the way 
                    you act around here, I can t say 
                    I m surprised.

                                  ADAM
                    Are you talking about my character

                                  ANDERS
                    Alright, I don t normally do this, 
                    but if you can get this dance 
                    routine down, COLD, I ll give you 
                    the front spot and you ll wow your

      Jet Set and the other co-workers exit.

      Ders turns to Adam, but he s walking off.

                                  BLAKE
                    Tough love isn t what he needs

                    My dad says tough love is all there 
                    is.

      Blake exits, bummed.


      Alice snorts nasal spray.  Adam is pleading his case.

                                  ADAM
                    ...So I guess the lesson here is, 
                     What if I did kill myself because 
                    you fired me?   Pretty heavy stuff, 
                    I know.  But I didn t.  So why 
                    don t we put all this behind us and 
                    get to work?  I know I m itching 
                    to.

                                  ALICE
                    Adam, you re fired.  You can t talk 
                    to people on the phones like you 
                    do, not while you represent this 
                    company.

                                  ADAM
                    But they almost usually deserve it 
                    and besides that, I m an amazing 
                    salesmen.  I ve had the Top Gun hat 
                    for like five weeks.  I m amazing.

                    Congrats you re a better salesman

                    listen to some of these  amazing  
                    calls.

      With a few key strokes, Alice plays recordings of Adam s 
      naughty calls from her computer.

      AUDIO CLIPS: Of different calls with Adam making threats, 
      funny accents, phone sex, etc.  Not professional at all.

                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    You re a girl.  So let me ask you, 
                    what does it feel like when a 
                    tampon goes in?  I tried once.

                    Between you, me and this phone 
                    line, I am high as fuck right now.


      Anders and Blake are at a loss.

                                  BLAKE
                    This ain t right man.  It ain t 
                    right.

                                  ANDERS
                    As much as I don t want to admit 
                    it, Adam s sales are pretty 
                      impressive.  This budget cut 
                    doesn t make sense.  He s worth way 
                    more to the company than his 
                    salary.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s just plain rude.

                                  ANDERS
                    What would Rudy do...?

                    I m gonna say this because I feel

                          (sing-song)
                    I want to sleep inside of you.

      Alice hits STOP.  Adam realizes that he s out of control.

                    but I know I was good.  You gotta

                    No, I don t, but you were our best.

                                  ADAM
                          (stops, sincerely)
                    Doy. ... Uh doy.

      Before Adam can exit he s stopped by Anders and Blake, 
      HOLDING their onesies.

                                  ALICE
                    He s fired.  There s nothing you 
                    can say.  Or do.  Please don t do 
                      anymore... stuff.

                                  ANDERS
                    Alice, we know you had to trim the 
                    budget and we re here to help.  If 
                    you cut the Top Gun, you cut us 
                    too.

      Anders and Blake lay their onesies down on Alice s desk (a la 
      the film Rudy, when Rudy s teammates give the coach their 
      jerseys to let Rudy play).

                                  ALICE
                    If that s what you want to do, 
                    fine.

                                  BLAKE
                    We re not the only ones that feel 
                    this way.  Come on in, guys.

      RUDY MUSIC PLAYS as Blake signals and Jillian, Montez, 
      Waymond, and everyone else in the office walks in and lays 
      their onesies down on the desk in a quiet respectful way.

      Alice is stunned.  She looks at the stack of onesies and 
      takes a deep breath, which causes her to COUGH.  She s 
      exhausted.

                                  ANDERS
                    Adam s the Top Gun, a once in a 
                      generation talent.  People respect 
                    his results.  They look up to him.

                                  BLAKE
                    Like it or not, he s the real 
                    leader around here, tied with 
                    Anders.

                                  ALICE
                    Fine, he can stay.  He s not the 
                    only one we caught having phone 
                    sex.

      Home Girl naughtily bites her bottom lip as the guys cheer.

                                  THE GUYS AND JILLIAN
                    Yes! / Alright! / Nice.

                                  ADAM
                    Fuck yes!  Fuck yes!
                          (off Alice s look)
                    Heck yes.  Heck yes.

                                  ALICE
                    Everybody out.

      People start to shuffle out.

                                  ADAM
                          (to all)
                    Thanks for the support, guys.

      Bill (same guy Adam fucked with before to show how fun it is 
      when Alice is gone) turns to Ders.

                                  BILL
                    You said we were just turning in 
                    the onesies--

                                  ANDERS
                    Sh-sh-sh- Shut up.  Shut up.

      No one hears this.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Alice, I m sorry I couldn t come 
                    through earlier, but I think I m 
                    ready to be a cold-blooded robot.

                                  ALICE
                    Jillian, your armpits are a mess.  
                    Go switch tops, I ll handle the 
                    firing.

                                  ANDERS
                    Ooh can I do a ride-along?  Just to 
                    observe.  Learn your ways.

                                  ALICE
                    Fine, let s go, stretch.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          Workaholics - Firing Squad - Network Draft - 12/13/10        28.

      CONTINUED: (3)

                                  ANDERS
                    Yes!  I just gotta do one thing.  
                    I ll be right there.


      The guys reflect on the wild day.  Ders tosses Adam the Top 
      Gun hat.

                                  ANDERS
                    When I thought you were dead, I 
                    pictured you in a little coffin 
                    with that hat on and--  ... Welcome 
                    back, dude.

      Ders gets out his cell.

                                  BLAKE
                    Just needed some tough love, right?  

                                  ADAM
                    Hey, good luck with those fires.

      Ders is on the phone, puts his finger up, politely mouths 
       Shut Up. 

                                  ANDERS
                          (into phone)
                    Hey, Dad. ... Just wanted you to 
                    know that I get to help fire some 
                    people today. ...  Oh, yeah, 
                    sure...
                          (to guys)
                    He put me on hold.

                                  BLAKE
                    Awwww, he s holding you.

      Ders likes that idea, but the sweet moment is interrupted.

                                  ADAM
                          (into phone)
                    Hello, sir.  It s your lucky day 
                    because I ve got a deal--  ... Well 
                    FUCK YOU TOO, YA DUMB IDIOT!!!

      Anders and Blake roll their eyes at each other and then a 
      SCREAM is heard from the break room.          Workaholics - Firing Squad - Network Draft - 12/13/10        29.



      A co-worker has discovered Sigourney Beaver folded into the 
      dishwasher, dripping with steaming hot water.  Blake pokes 
      his head in the door. 

                                  BLAKE
                    You ever seen Alien: Resurrection?

                                                                          FADE OUT:
