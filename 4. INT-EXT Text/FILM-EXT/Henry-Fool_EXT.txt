A garbage truck roars by and...
Simon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny
and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old.
The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to
go punch out at the time clock.
Moments later.
He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer.
He begins to relax. This is his quality private time.
Then he hears something and looks up.
He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances
and sees...
Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having
sex.
Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then...
WARREN
(to Amy)
You want some?
Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up.
Simon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as...
Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The
boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt.
Simon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast
is clear, then returns just in time to see...
Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her.
The pipe falls from the young girl's hand.
Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her.
Simon's mouth falls open in awe.
But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees...
The amazed garbage man; caught.
Amy starts screaming insanely.
Simon runs for his life.
Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase
him away.
Moments later.
Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house.
He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach
and spits, sickened.
He looks up, though, and sees...
A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing
there in the street watching him.
Simon tries to smile at her.
But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.
He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering
his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill,
he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.
Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting
dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.
FAY
God, I wanna get fucked.
Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.
FAY
You OK?
Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks
back at his sister.
Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.
FAY
See ya later.
Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he
seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks
his head, sits perfectly still and listens.
He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a
giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.
Titles begin.
Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky,
the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally,
he focuses on...
The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.
Music starts.
He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the
pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on
the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of
the music over the scene.
Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...
Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...
The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.
Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens
his eyes and sees...
A man approaching. The music swells up full.
Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in
wonder at...
This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak
striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a
windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled
tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.
Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.
Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.
Titles finish.
Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the
house.
Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood
and then down at Simon.
HENRY
Get up off your knees.
He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off
towards his new home.
Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to
his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying
the suitcases.
Later that day.
Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing
garbage.
That evening.
Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of
soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and
tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside
and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture
of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the
edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and
torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit
it back into the book.
He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites
his lip and tries again.
He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and
looks back over his shoulder to see...
Amy throws a bottle at his head.
Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his
neck.
Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out
of the puddle and smacking him in the head.
Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which
she sets aflame with her lighter.
Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the
ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him.
Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch.
Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence,
while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.
Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the
rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming
torch in his face.
SIMON
(weakly, unheard)
One of you is gunna lose an eye.
Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline. Simon pulls himself
to his feet as she splashes him with fuel. Warren is waving
the torch deliriously above his head.
SIMON
(screaming)
One of you is gunna lose an eye!
Warren stops.
Amy steps back and lowers the gas can.
Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses
and continues...
SIMON
One of you. I promise.
Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which
is too hot to handle. He drops it.
Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused.
Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his
hands and stares straight at Warren.
SIMON
You can set me on fire. But one of
you is gunna have an eye torn out of
your head. I promise.
Warren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps
back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks
away.
Warren looks back at Simon, troubled.
He hangs there still, glaring at him.
Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands.
Amy looks ill.
WARREN
Fuck.
AMY
Take me home.
Next morning.
A thirty-year-old cocktail waitress named Vicky walks up and
stops when she sees...
Warren, sitting back against the side of World of Donuts,
smoking a joint and thinking about his future.
She sighs and approaches.
VICKY
Hey, Warren, are you a registered
voter?
WARREN
Bug off, Vicky!
Unruffled, she hands him a flyer.
WARREN
(reading)
'Saving America From Itself.' What
the fuck is this?
VICKY
It's everything you need to know
about the upcoming elections and
congressman Owen Feer and all the
really good things he wants to do
for our country.
He tokes deeply, then...
WARREN
Oh yeah, like what?
VICKY
He wants to win back this country
for us Americans, Warren, and restore
some kind of cultural-moral standard
to our way of life.
Warren looks over the flyer, then reconsiders Vicky.
WARREN
What time's your kid go off to school?
VICKY
(carefully)
Nine o'clock.
WARREN
How about I come over and visit you
later?
Vicky sighs, troubled. She adjusts her waitress uniform and
looks mildly offended.
VICKY
Well, I don't know, Warren. I mean...
Warren gets up, too.
WARREN
Come on. I mean it. I'm trying to
change.
Vicky is hard-pressed. She wants to believe him, but knows
better. She thinks about it while...
Henry passes by and approaches the store.
Moments later.
Henry and Simon come outside...
SIMON
She's clinically depressed.
HENRY
Yeah, and what's that mean?
SIMON
(thinking, then)
I guess it means it's not her fault.
Henry wanders out to the road, checking his wallet, then...
HENRY
(sighing)
You ever think of leaving?
SIMON
Here?
HENRY
Yeah.
SIMON
To go where?
HENRY
Out there. You know, into the world.
Where ever.
Simon looks off, thinks it over and slowly nods.
SIMON
Yeah, I guess.
HENRY
(reciting)
'Opportunity will step away and make
room for a man to pass it by.'
SIMON
Is that from your book?
HENRY
No. I found it in a fortune cookie.
He pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of
his pockets and shows it to Simon.
SIMON
Can I read your confession?
HENRY
No. Not yet. Soon. We'll see.
SIMON
Is it almost finished?
HENRY
(puffing himself up)
Well, you know, Simon, a piece of
work like this, it's... A vocation
like ours... You can't put a fence
around a man's soul. What I'm trying
to achieve, it's... Well, it takes a
lifetime really. It's a life's work.
(looking around)
But soon. Don't worry. I'd appreciate
your feedback. I gotta go. See ya.
He hurries away around the corner. Simon walks back to the
house and stops when he sees...
A plain-clothes policeman, Officer Buuel, drive up and park
before the house.
Simon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on
Henry's door. He, of course, gets no answer.
Moments later.
Simon follows Henry out into the street and over towards
World Of Donuts...
SIMON
Henry, wait up!
HENRY
I am not a rapist!
But Henry stops short, seeing...
Officer Buuel enter World of Donuts.
HENRY
Shit. Come on, this way.
And he runs down the street in the opposite direction. Simon
hangs back, but then follows...
Warren is stopping people on their way in and out of World
of Donuts.
WARREN
Excuse me, miss, are you a registered
voter?
MISS
Oh God, really I don't know.
WARREN
Well, I'd like to give you some
information about Congressman Owen
Feer. This man is gunna make a big
difference in the lives of every
American in the years to come...
MISS
Thanks, sure. I gotta go, thanks.
A man, Bill, steps up...
WARREN
Pardon me, sir...
BILL
Fuck off!
WARREN
Right.
Warren stands back and loosens his tie. He looks over at
Pearl age seven, who is sitting outside the store.
WARREN
What time's your mother get off work?
She doesn't respond. He shakes his head and approaches. He
sees Fay exit the store...
WARREN
Fay, are you a registered voter?
FAY
(stopping)
Don't you dare talk that way to me!
And keep your hands off my brother.
Pearl, what are you doing here?
WARREN
I'm watchin' her.
Fay figures it out and approaches.
FAY
You and Vicky get back together?
WARREN
I gotta regular job now and
everything.
She lifts a flyer and reads.
FAY
I saw this retard on TV this morning.
WARREN
He's gunna be the next president of
the United States of America, Fay.
FAY
Keep dreamin' Warren. The guy's a
Nazi.
WARREN
I like him!
FAY
Gimme a light.
WARREN
(lighting her cigarette)
He's a decent man. He takes
complicated issues and totally
simplifies them. And I appreciate
that.
FAY
You still sell dope?
WARREN
No. You know what the problem is
with this country, Fay? Me. I'm the
problem. We live in a culture of
poverty and crime, where the work
ethic is undermined and male
responsibility is made irrelevant.
She studies him a moment more, lost, then shakes her head
and helps the child off the car.
FAY
Come on, Pearl, let's go play at my
house.
WARREN
She gives you any trouble, Fay, you
just let me know.
Moments later.
Warren straightens his tie and looks over to see...
Simon stagger up.
Warren shakes his head in dismay and approaches. Simon
steadies himself against the wall of the building.
WARREN
Jesus Christ, Simon, you're letting
yourself go to hell! You read that
flyer I gave you?
SIMON
What?
WARREN
Simon, wake up and smell the coffee,
huh! It's up to guys like you and me
to help create a better tomorrow!
Simon is lost.
Same time.
WARREN
(to Vicky)
Why would I steal a computer from
the campaign office?
VICKY
I'm not saying you did, I'm just
saying one was and since you do have
this criminal background...
Whack!!! He slaps her...
WARREN
(pointing)
Don't judge me!
Simon runs out of the store and limps away towards home as
Buuel storms out in pursuit. Simon tries to run, but Buuel
catches him easily.
BUUEL
Look, I know you know him. People
have seen you around together.
Simon ceases to struggle, but shakes himself free and stands
looking down at his feet. Buuel stands aside and watches
him a moment, then reaches in his jacket and brings out his
badge.
BUUEL
I'm his parole officer.
Simon studies the badge and waits a little, before asking...
SIMON
What did he do?
BUUEL
I'm not supposed to talk about that
stuff with people.
SIMON
He's my. Friend.
Buuel pauses, then puts away his badge and looks around the
parking lot.
BUUEL
Mr Deng says you're some sort of a
poet, or something.
Simon doesn't corroborate this. He looks away and readjusts
his sling. Buuel scratches his head, satisfied and prepares
to leave. But first...
BUUEL
You tell Henry to call me -- Officer
Buuel -- pronto! Or they're gunna
chuck his ass straight back into
jail! Got it?
Simon shrugs.
Buuel waits a moment, then steps away and gets back in his
car. Simon watches as the parole officer drives away and
passes...
WARREN
Vicky, look I'm sorry.
VICKY
Don't you even come near me!
Simon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls
into the station. Excited and determined, he gets on.
Later.
Simon dumps his poem in a trash can, pauses, then enters the
subway.
Moments later.
Henry steps out of the store and stops when he sees Amy
standing there, pouting. He looks away and sighs. Amy picks
at the fabric of her stockings and bites her lip.
AMY
Henry?
Henry smokes.
HENRY
Yeah.
AMY
What kind of... Well, I mean... What
kind of... perverse things would you
do to me?
It's more than he can stand. He holds his head.
HENRY
Take a powder, cupcake.
AMY
No, really.
HENRY
Evaporate!
Crushed, she breaks out in tears and flees.
Same time.
Simon drags Mary out the kitchen door and into the yard,
looking desperately for help. He reaches the street, her
limp body hanging grotesquely before him, and looks helplessly
up and down the block.
DISSOLVE TO:
Simon, Henry, Mr Deng, Fay, Gnoc and Buuel stand with Father
Hawkes at the grave.
FATHER HAWKES
Let us pray. Lord, grant that peace
be within reach for our friend, Mary.
May the pain and confusion she endured
on earth be fought through in the
after life, so that she may enter
the Kingdom of Heaven and live in
the light of God. Amen.
He sprinkles holy water on the coffin and they all drop
carnations at the grave. Simon and Fay remain there looking
down at the coffin. Henry waits for them a few yards away,
wishing he could help, but feeling out of place.
Simon is back working on the garbage truck. He collects
garbage and throws it in the truck as Henry, who is just
along for the ride, hangs from the side of the truck and
pulls the lever whenever Simon tells him to.
HENRY
So I was a janitor! So what?
SIMON
But Angus James said he didn't even
know you!
Henry shrugs and qualifies...
HENRY
Well, I mean, we weren't like bosom
buddies or anything. But we used to
talk sometimes. In the elevator. In
the morning. He said he liked my
ideas. Being a janitor's a good job
if you're a writer. Especially the
night shift; all that time to think
and develop my ideas.
SIMON
Do it.
Henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed.
SIMON
Anyway, he hated my poem.
HENRY
Well, what the hell does he know? He
wouldn't know a vital piece of
literary art if it came up and bit
him in the leg. To hell with him!
He's not the only publisher in the
world!
SIMON
But nobody likes it.
HENRY
(smokes)
It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded
in his own land. Remember that.
SIMON
Do it.
Henry is about to pull the lever again, but sees something
in amongst the garbage...
HENRY
Hey, look, treasure!
Henry steps down and leans over into the garbage. Simon joins
him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray
piece of machinery.
HENRY
What is this?
SIMON
Brass maybe. Some kinda copper.
HENRY
It's a ring. Jewelry.
SIMON
I think it's a gasket. A fitting
from off of that old refrigerator
over there.
Henry puts it in his pocket, satisfied and Simon jumps on
the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away.
Henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction, but stops
when he sees Pearl age seven.
Henry comes up the street with Pearl age seven on his back.
He walks into Vicky's yard and finds Warren lifting weights
in the garage.
HENRY
Hey, Warren, I found Pearl wandering
around by the garbage dump.
WARREN
He lost.
HENRY
Who lost?
Warren rests. He sits up on the bench and takes a toke off
the joint he has waiting.
WARREN
Congressman Feer.
HENRY
(realizing)
Oh. Well, you know. Somebody's gotta
lose.
WARREN
What's the fucking use. You make
sacrifices. You try to be a decent
human being. Try to contribute
something meaningful to society. And
what happens? They lose to a bunch
of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups.
I don't give a shit anymore. People
deserve what they get.
Henry pauses, then leads Pearl age seven towards the house.
Warren lies back down and continues his lifting.
Simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street
and pauses in front of his house. He jumps down and the truck
barrels away.
Moments later.
Angus emerges and has to fight his way through the throng of
excited adolescents. He reaches his limo and gets in. But he
pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd.
Simon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming and
shouting for autographs. Angus shakes his head, impressed.
Evening.
Henry stalks along, all fired up. Simon tries his best to
keep up with him.
HENRY
I've let myself down, Simon! I've
let myself be caught in the bloody
maw of banal necessity! How did I
get here? How did this happen to me?
I'm going to be somebody's father! I
need time to think. To write. Time
to finish my 'Confession'! I can't
work for a living! It's impossible!
I tried once. My genius will be wasted
trying to make ends meet!
He collapses extravagantly.
HENRY
This is how great men topple, Simon.
Their hearts are in the right place
too much of the time! They get
sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How
could I have been so careless!
SIMON
Henry, please, let me read the
'Confession'.
HENRY
No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all
washed up. I'm finished!
SIMON
Angus James is convinced my poem is
going to make him incredibly wealthy.
He'll read your book and seriously
consider publishing it. If I ask him
to. I'm certain.
Henry glances back at his friend, digesting this. He thinks
it over, then...
HENRY
Really? You really think so?
Having finally got through to him, Simon comes forward,
anxious to help Henry.
SIMON
I'll insist he publish the
'Confession'.
He paces back and forth, thrusting out his chest, for the
first time in his life displaying something like pride or
arrogance.
SIMON
(adds)
Or I won't let him publish my poem.
Henry sits there watching Simon, impressed with this evidence
of increased self-esteem. He realizes the profundity of the
gesture.
HENRY
You'd do that? You'd do that for me?
Simon stares off into the distance.
SIMON
You saved my life.
Henry is moved. He stands and comes forward. He grabs his
friend by the shoulders and turns him around.
HENRY
Do you realize what you're saying?
SIMON
(pausing)
I owe you everything.
Henry steps away, considering, then looks back at Simon and
extends his hand.
HENRY
OK.
Simon smiles. Henry smiles. They shake hands.
Henry stands outside, watching his door.
Henry paces, drinking and smoking nervously.
Buuel, Hawkes and Mr Deng sleep sitting up as Henry talks
to himself. Fay leans out the back door and interrupts him.
He looks at her, but says nothing. She sighs and goes back
inside: turning off the lights.
Simon steps out of Henry's apartment and sees Henry asleep
on the back stoop.
Simon stares into a glass of water. Fay sits ten feet away,
waiting. Finally...
FAY
It's really that bad?
SIMON
It's terrible.
Henry and Gnoc load Fay into the van. The van pulls out.
Seven years later.
Fay bangs out of the kitchen door with her seven-year-old
son Ned. Frazzled and overworked, she grips a loaded laundry
basket to her side as she sits Ned down on the curb and points
at him.
FAY
Play!
The kid sits still, obviously guilty of some unspeakable
mischief, as Fay storms back into the house. He looks around,
bored, then brightens up when he sees...
Henry, coming up the street, hanging from the back of a
garbage truck.
Same time.
Fay comes out of the house and looks for her son.
FAY
Ned!
She comes out to the street and looks around.
FAY
Ned!
Fay comes up looking for Ned and sees...
Pearl, age fourteen, come out of Vicky's House. She is
fourteen years old now. Warren steps out the door and grabs
her by the arm. She shakes him off. He slaps her.
She runs down the steps and glares back at him.
WARREN
(pointing at her)
I'm warning you, Pearl!
Pearl turns defiantly away and walks into the street.
Later (evening).
Henry staggers out of the back door of the Inferno and comes
across Mr Deng sitting against the wall of the store, watching
the basketball game on a small TV. World of Donuts vibrates
with loud music.
HENRY
Who's winning?
MR DENG
Nobody.
Henry gestures to World of Donuts...
HENRY
What's going on in there?
MR DENG
We gotta have rock 'n' roll shows
these days, Henry. The poetry readings
just don't pay the bills no more.
HENRY
What did I tell you! It was just a
fad. I told you that! I told everyone!
MR DENG
Did you hear about Simon? It was on
the news today.
HENRY
Yeah yeah yeah. So what? A Nobel
Prize. Anybody can get one of them
these days. That's the problem, with
this world, Mr Deng... Nobody's got
any standards anymore. You seen Fay?
MR DENG
You better sleep in my office tonight,
Henry. She was very angry. You've
gotta let her cool off.
HENRY
I can't sleep in there with that
racket!
MR DENG
Suit yourself.
Henry considers his options, then...
Henry staggers away, limping. He comes to the intersection
at the end of the block and doesn't know which way to run.
Panicked, he looks round, holding his arm to his chest. He
runs towards the highway.
Ned approaches the subway station and climbs the stairs to
the platform.
Moments later.
Ned runs up the stairs to the elevated platform just as a
train pulls into the station. He runs down a few cars and
hops in as the doors slide open.
Twenty minutes later.
He comes up out of the subway on to the street, looks around.
A taxi pulls up. Simon and Ned climb out and Laura leans out
of the window.
LAURA
Promise me you'll be on that plane
at seven, Simon.
SIMON
I'll see you in Stockholm.
They kiss. The taxi pulls away. Simon comes down beside Ned,
takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear.
The kid takes off.
Simon looks over at World of Donuts and sees Gnoc waiting
there at the door.
Gnoc leads Simon out through the kitchen. A band is seen
doing a sound check, inside.
Buuel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned.
Simon gives Buuel his passport.
Buuel nods and leaves.
Hawkes and Gnoc open the cellar doors.
Ned runs along the street and stops at the police car. He
points down the street with great urgency. The cops jump in
their cars and take off. He then looks over at...
Fay, leaving the house with Henry's suitcase.
Same time.
Buuel backs his car into the alley behind World of Donuts.
Stepping out of the car he hands Simon back the passport.
Simon checks it and then looks up to see...
Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside. Coming out
into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on
his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with
difficulty.
HENRY
Gotta light?
Ned does. He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights
his dad's cigarette.
Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses. Finally...
HENRY
Take care of your mom and don't start
trouble you can't finish.
Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands
before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across
her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently
and waits for his last line of crap.
HENRY
I love you, Fay.
FAY
(rolls her eyes)
Yeah, well, tough.
But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses
her passionately on the mouth.
Moments later, they all help Henry into Buuel's car and
Simon gets in behind the wheel. The doors slam shut and Simon
steers the car slowly up the alley. Henry gazes out at Fay
running along beside the car with the rest of the
neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying...
Simon pulls up at the curb and jumps out. He helps Henry
climb out and together they enter the terminal.
Moments later.
The plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline
representative runs straight for it, calling back over her
shoulder to Henry...
AIRLINE REP
This way, Mr Grim! This way!
Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs
back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his
shoulder at...
Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal.
He stops and waits.
Simon raises his hand in farewell and...
Henry raises his in reply.
Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent
amongst the roar of the runway, says...
SIMON
(unheard)
Run.
And Henry understands. He lowers his hand, waits just a
moment, then turns and looks out at...
The airplane. The airline representative is shouting at him
from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie-
talkie.
He glances back once more at Simon. Then...
Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself
towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with
every step he takes.
