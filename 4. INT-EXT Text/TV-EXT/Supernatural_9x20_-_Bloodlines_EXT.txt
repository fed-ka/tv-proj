      SUPER: Chicago, Illinois

      Sweeping shots of the Windy City take us to...


                                    JULIAN*
                    A lot more.*

      And he HEADS FOR THE DOOR.  Saul s SURPRISED-- the Hell?*

                                  SAUL
                    Where you goin , Old Yeller?

      Julian responds with a SMIRK as he EXITS.  OFF SAUL-- uneasy--


      ENNIS and TAMARA leave-- he s holding her hand, pulling her 
      forward.  EXCITED.  Ennis has got an IDEA.

                                  TAMARA
                    Ennis-- where are we going?*

                                  ENNIS
                    That place wasn t us.


      Ennis and Tamara.  At a BUS STOP near the restaurant.  He s 
      jazzed, she s confused.

                                  TAMARA
                    So you dragged me to a bus stop... *
                    why?*

                                  ENNIS
                    We met at a bus stop.  First day of *
                    fifth grade-- you had your hair in *
                    braids, and I couldn t take my eyes *
                    off you.*

      Tamara MELTS at that.  Aw.  Ennis looks her in the eye.  *

                                  ENNIS
                    Tam, I don t wanna do this the same *
                    cheesy way everyone else does, and-- *
                    this is us.  So...

      He goes for the RING-- and Tamara realizes what s happening.  
      She puts her hands over her mouth.  TEARS welling up. 

                                  TAMARA
                      Ohmigod...

      This is IT--

      BANG!  A sound from the DARK ALLEY behind.  A door slamming.  

      Ennis looks up-- to see SAUL burst from the darkness!  Tamara 
      SCREAMS, as Saul stumbles to the pavement in front of them. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  7.

                                  ENNIS
                    Call 911!

      Tamara goes for her phone, as Ennis kneels next to Saul, whose 
      eyes are hollow-- voice cracking-- staring up at Ennis--

                                  SAUL
                    David... I m so sorry...

                                  ENNIS
                    David?  Who s David?

      BANG!  Another sound.  TAMARA whips around-- to see a DARK *
      SHAPE sprinting through the shadows. *

      MONSTER POV:  Locked in on Saul.  Closing FAST-- Tamara s  *
      BETWEEN the predator and its prey!

      Tamara SCREAMS and Ennis whips around, as-- BAM!  The FIGURE *
      THROWS Tamara aside.  She hits the wall with a WET CRUNCH--*

      And Ennis is moving-- charging the thing-- *

                                  ENNIS*
                    Tamara!*

      The figure wheels, slashing at Ennis with its claws-- *
      SHREDDING HIS JACKET and knocking him to the ground.  Hard.*

      ON ENNIS.  On the pavement.  Ears ringing.  Vision blurred.  *
      He looks left to see--*

      The FIGURE crouched over Saul.  It raises a hand tipped with *
      SILVER CLAWS... and PUNCHES THROUGH THE SHIFTER S CHEST!  *

      The thing rips its hand back, DROPS Saul s CORPSE to the *
      ground, and turns-- VANISHING into the dark alley, as--*

      Ennis stumbles to his feet, moving for TAMARA...*

      Who lays against the wall.  A smear of RED staining the brick *
      behind her head.  Jaw slack.  Eyes lifeless.  Ennis reaches *
      out.  Touching her face.  Begging...

                                  ENNIS
                    No... please no... no!

      But Tamara s DEAD.  And OFF ENNIS-- his world ripped apart--

                                                                          BLACKOUT.

                                        ACT ONE


      Loyola University in Chicago.  Nice day.  To establish.      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  11.



      DAVID (in his NORMAL FORM) walks across the quad.  BZZT!  His *
      PHONE.   Home  again.  David answers-- annoyed--

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah?
                          (beat, going pale)
                    Margo-- slow down.  What do you 
                    mean?  What about Saul?


      ENNIS moves down the sidewalk, in Chicago s Englewood *
      neighborhood.  Past cramped rowhouses-- junkies-- dealers.  *

      Englewood has a 40% poverty rate, and 881 violent crimes a *
      year.  This is where Ennis grew up-- what shaped him.  *


        A MOTORCYCLE pulls up in front of an upper-middle-class 
      TOWNHOUSE, and... DAVID takes off his helmet.  *


      Three quick, 8MM MEMORIES:*

      - YOUNG DAVID (6, we saw him in the PHOTOS) and YOUNG SAUL *
      (13, ditto) playing hoops on a portable basket.  *

      - The kids messily eating ice cream.  Laughing and grinning.*

      - David sitting on the stoop.  Saul next to him-- one arm *
      draped protectively over his younger brother.*      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  14.



      The place is a CRIME SCENE.  Police tape, etc... ENNIS steps *
      into frame, gaze darting to the spot Tamara died-- blood 
      still visible on the wall.  Ennis looks away.  Too painful.*


      Ennis moves down the corridor.  Slow.  Wary.  And finds a *
      SECURITY DOOR on the back of the restaurant.  Hmmm...*      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  16.



      SAM and DEAN emerge from the alley, heading for the IMPALA.  *
      Ennis is right behind.

                                  ENNIS
                    Hold up.  I m coming with you.  *

                                  DEAN*
                    Wrong.  Keep your nose outta it.  *
                    We got this covered.  *

                                  ENNIS*
                    Really?  The Flannel Brothers, from--*
                          (re: the Impala s plates)*
                    Ohio?  And you got this?  Come on, *
                    you don t know this city.  I do.  We *
                    can help each other out here.*

                                  DEAN*
                    We re from Kansas.*

      He climbs in.  Sam shoots Ennis a sympathetic look--*

                                  SAM*
                    Ennis, what we do?  It s not fun, *
                    man.  It s dangerous, and messed *
                    up, and-- just stop, okay?  Before *
                    you get hurt.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  20.

      CONTINUED:2828

      He s SYMPATHETIC, but that s final.  The boys climb in to the *
      IMPALA, and it PEELS OUT, leaving Ennis-- pissed-- behind.*


      BANG!  Ennis BURSTS out the front door.  Pedestrians dot the *
      street-- but David s nowhere to be seen--*

      Or is he?  Ennis scans the crowd-- but he knows that David *
      could have shifted into ANY ONE of these people.  The monster *
      got away.*

      OFF ENNIS-- FUCK!--*

                                                                          BLACKOUT.*

                                      ACT THREE


      A walled estate, with vast, tree-lined grounds.  The oldest *
      of old money. 


      We pull back from the TOWERING WALLS-- to find THE IMPALA 
      parked just up the road.  DEAN is behind the wheel, while SAM *
      scopes out the estate.

                                  SAM
                    So Julian Durant pays to see Saul s 
                    corpse-- and he lives in a friggin  
                    castle.  Who is this guy?

      As they talk, we MOVE FURTHER BACK to find-- ENNIS, rounding *
      the corner.  On the case.  He spots the IMPALA, and FREEZES.  *
      Ennis knows that car.*

      ON ENNIS.  Mind racing-- what to do?-- then--*


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  30.

      CONTINUED:3838

      Something flashes in the corner of his eye, and Ennis turns-- *

      To see a SHAPE perched on top of the stone.  The FACELESS *
      FIGURE from our teaser!  He watches it GOES OVER THE WALL.*

      And OFF ENNIS-- knowing exactly what he has to do--*


      VIOLET stands outside, quietly hating her brother.  Herself.*

                                  BUTLER (O.S.)
                    Ma am?

      Widen to reveal the BUTLER (50s).  Violet doesn t look back.*

                                    VIOLET*
                    You can drop the act, David.

      Beat, then-- DAVID enters frame.  Shifted to his normal form.

                                  DAVID
                    How did you--*

                                  VIOLET
                    I know you.*

      And she does.  There s HISTORY here.  *

                    Is the real butler alright?

                                  DAVID*
                    He s resting.  Tied up.  In a closet.*
                          (re: his suit)*
                    And mostly naked.*

                          (not amused)*
                    You shouldn t be here.

                                  DAVID
                    You think I wanna be?  Vi-- it s *
                    about Saul.

      And Violet knows how close David and his brother were.

                                  VIOLET
                    I heard, I-- I m so sorry.
                          (beat)
                    Julian didn t kill him.

                    One, Julian doesn t want it 
                    stopped.  And second-- how?  You re 
                    a runaway and I m a... bitch.  We 
                    don t matter.

      And she really BELIEVES THAT.  David snaps--*

                                  DAVID
                    What happened to you?  Since when

                    Since when do you let your dad sell

                    You think I had a choice?

                    You did!  Union Station.  Midnight.  *
                    You had a choice.  You--

                    I loved you, Violet.

      And there s that history.  Violet flinches.  Stung.

                    You re the one who said we should

                    set the time, the place, and I was 
                    there.  Where were you?

      Violet turns away, TEARS welling-- and we ANGLE UP to reveal--

      Our FACELESS FRIEND perched on the roof.  It TENSES--

      BAM!  And ATTACKS.  Slamming into David-- throwing  him to 
      the ground.  Violet spins-- sees THE THING-- sees DAVID.

      Violet SPRINTS across the lawn, MONSTER right behind.  CUT TO-

      MONSTER POV: Locked on her.  Gaining fast.

      WHAM!  DAVID tackles it from behind!  The two crashing to the 
      ground!  

      David tries to FIGHT-- but the figure pins him to the dirt.  
      Breath raspy.  SILVER CLAWS digging into David s flesh.  
      BURNING HIM.  Then--

      BLAM!  A bullet cracks past the thing s shoulder.

      We pick up on David staring at the empty bit of ground.  Ennis *
      stands behind, not quite sure what s going on, then--*

      A RUSTLE in the brush, Ennis wheels around-- as SAM and DEAN *
      emerge.  Guns up.*

                    Who s her?  Who are you?*

      As Sam speaks, Dean peers through the brush-- to see GUARDS *
      patrolling the grounds.  They heard the shot too. 

                        DEANENNIS
      We gotta go.  Like, now.His name s David Hayden.  
                                                  He s a shapeshifter.

                    Wait-- you re tellin  me Five *
                    Monster Families run Chicago?*
                          (then)*
                    What is this, Godfather with fangs?*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Like I said, we can help each *
                    other.*

      Then-- a SIREN wails in the distance.  The police are on *
      their way.  Sam and Dean trade a look, then-- *

                                  SAM*
                    Get in.*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  34.

      Ennis nods, and our boys glance to DAVID, who has a phone at *
      his ear.*

                                  DEAN*
                    What about the Transformer over *
                    there?*

      Before Sam can respond-- David moves to them.*

                                  DAVID*
                    She s not picking up her phone.*

                                  SAM*
                    The girl?  She a shifter too?*

                                  DAVID*
                      Werewolf.*

                                  DEAN*
                    Kinky...*

      Ennis steps in.  That siren s getting CLOSER...*

                                  ENNIS*
                    She s got a phone on her?*

                                  DAVID*
                    Always.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    We could trace the signal.*

                                  SAM*
                    Maybe.  What s her number?*

                                  DAVID*
                    Take me with you, and it s all *
                    yours.*


      The IMPALA pulls up in front of a an abandoned, rundown *
      factory, in an abandoned, rundown, INDUSTRIAL part of town. *
      DEAN steps out, holding up his PHONE-- scanning the structure.*

                                  DEAN*
                    Signal s coming from that craphole.*

      Ennis and David move to follow him-- Sam blocks their path.*

                                  SAM*
                    Stay here.*

      Ennis fixes Sam with a hard look-- voice soft, but strong.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Sam-- Tamara was everything to me.  *
                      Everything.  So if the son of a *
                    bitch that killed her is in there?    *
                    No way in Hell you re keeping me *
                    out.  No way.*

                                  DAVID*
                    I m coming too.*

      And he s just as determined as Ennis.  Dean approaches-- *

                                  DEAN*
                    What s up?  *

      ON SAM.  Studying David and Ennis.  Feeling for them.*

                                  SAM*
                    They re going in with us.*

                          (dry)*
                    Awesome.*

      He and Sam start gearing up-- David and Ennis take a moment.  *

                                  DAVID*
                    Thanks for-- you know.  And about *
                    your girlfriend, I m--*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Yeah-- same about your brother.*
                          (beat)*
                    He talked about you, at the end, *
                    you know.  He said:  David, I m so *
                    sorry. *

                                  DAVID*
                    For what?*

      But Ennis doesn t know.  Dean returns, tossing them weapons--*

                                  DEAN*
                    Let s roll.*


      The IMPALA sits parked up the road, SAM, DEAN and ENNIS 
      milling around it.  Watching-- DAVID walk VIOLET home.  

                                  DAVID
                    You okay?

                                  VIOLET
                    I will be.  Are you?

                                  DAVID*
                          (beat)*
                    I ll get back to you on that.*

      Violet nods-- it s been a night...*

                                  DAVID
                    He said he was sorry.  Those were *
                    Saul s last words:  David, I m so *
                    sorry.   But he never did anything *
                    to me.*
                          (off Violet)*
                    You knew Saul-- why would he say  *
                    that?

      ON VIOLET.  A SHADOW crosses her face, as we FLASHBACK TO--*


      ON VIOLET.  Remembering.  David s talking--

                                  DAVID
                    ...even after I left the family-- I 
                    knew if things got bad, Saul would 
                    always have my back.  So... what *
                    did he mean?

      Violet knows how much Saul meant to David-- she takes a 
      CONFLICTED BEAT.  And swallows the truth.  

                                  VIOLET
                    I don t know.  I should go.

      David reacts to that-- frowning-- not what he was hoping for--

                                  DAVID
                    Right.  Sure.  Guess that s what 
                    you do best.

      ON VIOLET.  She takes a moment.  Conflicted.

                                  VIOLET
                    David?

      He glances up-- and VIOLET KISSES HIM.  Aggressively.  
      Passionately. Drawing a touch of blood.  

      And DAVID KISSES HER BACK, as the Hunters trade a look-- *

      The two part.  And Violet hurries away-- embarrassed, 
      vulnerable.  Leaving David hot, bothered, and CONFLICTED.


      TAMARA S FUNERAL.  Modest.  Simple.  A picture of her smiles 
      over the casket, as it s lowered into the ground.  

      ENNIS stands next to SAM.  DEAN, and COSTA are there as well, *
      along with a few other MOURNERS and a PASTOR.  Then--

      Dean s PHONE BUZZES-- the caller ID reading  Crowley .  He 
      steps away, as we FAVOR ENNIS.  Fighting back emotion.  *

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:


      The service is OVER.  Ennis says goodbye to the mourners, *
      lots of hugs and tears, then-- COSTA approaches, pulling *
      Ennis aside.*

                                  COSTA
                    What happened last night?*

                                  ENNIS
                          (going cold)
                    What do you mean?*

                                  COSTA
                    I called, you don t answer-- I go *
                    by your place, but you ain t home--*
                    wanna tell me where you were? *

      Ennis looks away-- nope.*

                                  COSTA*
                    Ennis-- we talked about this.  You *
                    gotta focus on the Police Academy-- *

                                  ENNIS*
                          (fire in his eyes)*
                    Screw the Academy.  There s more *
                    important things out there.

                          (pissed)*
                    Like what?*

      But Ennis is already walking away...*

      ON SAM AND DEAN.  Having a HUSHED CONVERSATION.

                                  SAM
                    ...you want to leave?  Dean-- this 
                    city s crawling with monsters. 

                                  DEAN
                    I don t want-- Crowley s got a line 
                    on Abaddon.  This is our shot, Sam.

      There s FIRE in his eyes-- as previous episodes have shown us 
      Dean is totally, RECKLESSLY committed to taking Abaddon down.

                                  ENNIS (O.C.)
                    You re going?

      The boys turn, to see Ennis.  Sam eyes Dean for a beat, then-- 

                                  SAM
                    There s something we have to do.

                                  DEAN
                    We ll call in some other Hunters-- 
                    pros-- and download them on the 
                    monster mob.  All of it.

                                  ENNIS
                    I could--

                                  SAM
                    No.  You got what you wanted, okay?  *

                                  DEAN
                    You done good, kid.  Really.  But do *
                    yourself a favor: stay out of this *
                    life.   Cause trust me, you get in *
                    too deep?  There s no getting out.*

      They move away.  And OFF ENNIS-- knowing he can t do that.*


      Pedestrians fill the sidewalk, heading home.*

                                  DAVID (V.O.)*
                    There s millions of people-- *
                    literally millions-- walkin  around *
                    in the dark.  With no idea what s *
                    really going on.*

      As he speaks, a MAN bumps past a WOMAN.  She frowns, annoyed-- *
      and we FOLLOW THE MAN.  He wears a FEDORA and coat, but we *
      can still see the TATTOOS on his face.  He s a DJINN.*


      Sam and Dean roll out of town, in the IMPALA.*

                                  DAVID (V.O.)*
                    This town is thin on good guys.*


      VIOLET stands.  Lost in thought.*

      Violet raises a hand and, slowly-- elegantly-- CLAWS rise *
      from her fingers.  She s getting back in touch with her INNER *
      MONSTER.*


      ENNIS emerges, and we PAN UP-- to see Chicago.  Glittering *
