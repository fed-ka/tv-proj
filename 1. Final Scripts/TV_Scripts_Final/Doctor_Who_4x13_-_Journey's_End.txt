11INT. TARDIS - NIGHT

      DONNA, ROSE, CAPTAIN JACK, flinching from the light, staring -

      FX: FULL LENGTH on THE DOCTOR, his head still a volcano,
      as he swings round, aims both arms together - both still
      channelling the golden energy - pointing across the room,
      downwards - so the energy shoots out like a gun, hitting -

      FX: the HAND-IN-JAR, bubbling like crazy - the whole jar
      shuddering as it's blasted by GOLDEN LIGHT -

      CUT TO closer on Donna, Rose, Jack, watching...

      FX: MID-SHOT Doctor, schwup!, energy rips away, STOPS!

      And there's the Doctor.  Blinking.  Same as ever.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Now then.  Where were we?

                                                                            CUT TO:

22EXT. STREET NEAR SARAH JANE'S - NIGHT

      FX: behind the car, a HARD CRACK OF WHITE LIGHT (exactly
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
      like Rose's in ep.12 sc.10) and standing there -

      MICKEY SMITH and JACKIE TYLER!  Both with SCI-FI GUNS -
      FX: they fire, BLAM! BLAM!, one shot each -
        www.thewriterstale.com

      FX/PRAC: one! - two! - the DALEKS explode!

      And silence.  Sarah getting out of the car, staggered.

                                      SARAH JANE
                      ...Mickey?

                                      MICKEY
                    Us Smiths gotta stick together!

                                      JACKIE
                    Jackie Tyler.  Rose's mum.  Now
                    where the hell is my daughter?!

                                                                            CUT TO:

33INT. TORCHWOOD HUB - NIGHT

      GWEN & IANTO firing like mad, ready to die...

      Until they stop.  Lower guns.  Puzzled.  Eh..?

      FX: the REVERSE.  The DALEK in the doorway...  Just frozen. 
      And, like dots, suspended in the air, BULLETS.

      Gwen walks forward...



                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4 - Episode 13 - Shooting Script - 18/02/08    page 2.

      FX: CU on her as she steps closer to the BULLETS, just
      hanging in the air.  She pokes a floating bullet...

      FX: small RIPPLE in the air, an invisible wall hanging
      between the inside of the Hub, and the Dalek & bullets.

                                    GWEN
                    What the hell..?

                                                                            CUT TO:

44INT. TARDIS - NIGHT

      FX: THE DOCTOR kneeling by the HAND-IN-JAR, which is still
      boiling with GOLDEN ENERGY.  He blows on it, like cooling
      a cuppa, and the energy fades.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    There now, d'you see - used the
                      regeneration energy to heal myself,
                    but as soon as that was done, I
                    didn't need to change, I didn't
                    want to, why would I?, look at me! 
                    So!  To stop the energy going all
                    the way, I siphoned off the rest
                    into a handy bio-matching
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
                      receptacle, namely, my hand, that
                    hand there, my handy spare hand!
                          (to Rose)
                    Remember, Christmas Day, Sycorax,
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    lost my hand in a swordfight? 
                    That's my hand!  What d'you think?

                                    ROSE
                    ...you're still you?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm still me. 

      And she runs to him!

      She hugs him.  He hugs her.  The biggest hug.  Laughing.

                                      DONNA
                          (to Jack)
                    You can hug me, if you want.
                          (he smiles)
                    No, really, you can hug me.

                                                                            CUT TO:

55INT. TORCHWOOD HUB - NIGHT

      IANTO at a terminal, GWEN just running up to join him:

                                      IANTO
                    It's a Time Lock!

                                      IANTO (CONT'D)
                    The ultimate defence programme,
                    Tosh was working on it, I thought
                    she never finished it, but...
                          (at terminal)
                    She did!  The Hub's sealed off in
                    a time bubble, nothing can get in!

                                    GWEN
                    But that means we can't get out. 

                                      IANTO
                    Nope.  Not without unlocking that
                    Dalek.  We're trapped inside. 
                    It's all up to Jack, now.

      HIGH SHOT, leaving them, as Gwen & Ianto look up...

                                    GWEN
                    Jack, and that Doctor of his...

99EXT. BIG WIDE STREET - NIGHT

      FX: with the FOUR DALEKS grouped a distance back, the TARDIS
      is surrounded by a horizontal circle of BURNING WHITE LIGHT
      around its midriff.  Like it's been hoop-la'd.

                                      DALEK 1
                    Temporal prison initiated!

1010INT. TARDIS - NIGHT

      LIGHTS GO DOWN!  Sound of power dying.  Not complete
      darkness, but shadowy and spooky.  THE DOCTOR frantic -

                    They've got us!  Power's gone! 
                    Some kind of chronon loop -

      - as the Tardis lurches, all stumble -

                                                                            CUT TO:

1111EXT. BIG WIDE STREET - NIGHT

      On DALEK 1, gliding backwards a little -

                      Transferring Tardis to the Crucible.

      CUT TO a good distance away.  SARAH JANE, MICKEY & JACKIE
      just running up, in an alley, in shadows, hidden, seeing -

      FX: surrounded by 4 DALEKS, the HOOP-OF-LIGHT-TARDIS lifts
      up into the air, a few feet, then accelerates - PAN UP as
      it whooshes into the sky, becomes a dot, gone.  In whispers:

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Those teleport things, can we use
                    them?  If they've taken the Doctor
                    to the Dalek spaceship, then that's
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
                    where we need to be -

      Mickey takes his ep.2.13 yellow-pendant from his pocket -

                                      MICKEY
                    It's not just a teleport, it's a
                    Dimension Jump - man, this thing 
                    rips a hole in the fabric of space -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    But can we use it?!

                                      MICKEY
                    Not yet, it burns up energy, needs
                    half an hour in between jumps -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Then put down your guns.

                                      MICKEY
                    Do what?!

                                      SARAH JANE
                    If you're carrying a gun, they'll
                    shoot you dead. 

      And without waiting, deep breath, she steps out alone,
      into the middle of the street, with her hands up -

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    Daleks!  I surrender!

      The Daleks turn to face her.

                    then they've got Rose.

      Both resigned, putting down their guns.  Mickey gives his
      a kiss.  Then they both step out, hands up.

1212INT. JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

      MARTHA's got the INDIGO PROJECT, tapping numbers into the

      the laptop: SECURITY LEVEL RED.  FRANCINE behind her.

                                      MARTHA
                    We've lost contact with the Subwave,

                    and the Tardis.  So it's up to me!

                    What are those numbers?

      Martha stands, starts hoisting on the Indigo Project.

                                      MARTHA
                    Grid references.  Now Jack's
                    explained the base code, I know
                    how this teleport works.  I think. 
                    But you stay indoors, there's no
                    Daleks on this street, you should
                    be all right, just keep quiet.

                                      FRANCINE
                    But where are you going..?

                    I'm a member of UNIT.  And they
                    gave me the Osterhagen Key.  I've
                    got to do my job.
                          (upset)

      CU MARTHA on the ground.  Dazed, blinking, recovering.

      GRAPHIC: GERMANY, 60 miles outside Nuremberg.

      Martha stands, looks round.  It's dark, dense forest; not

                    There's a massive Dalek ship, at

                                      DONNA
                    You said all these planets were
                    like an engine.  But what for?

                    Rose?  You've been in a parallel
                    world.  And that world's running
                    ahead of this universe.  You've
                    seen the future.  What was it..?

                                    ROSE
                    The darkness.

                                      DONNA
                    The stars were going out.

                                    ROSE
                    One by one.  We looked up at the
                    sky.  And they were dying.  And at
                    the same time, the walls between
                      dimensions started to unravel. 
                    Cos we'd been building this travel
                    machine, a Dimension Cannon, so I
                    could...  Well...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                          (smiling)
                    What?

            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
                    So I could come back.
                          (he grins)
                    Shut up.  But all of a sudden, it
                    started working.  Cos the dimensions
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    were starting to collapse.  Not
                    just our world, not just yours,
                    but the whole of reality.  Even
                    the Void was dead.  Something is
                      destroying everything.

                                      DONNA
                    But in that parallel world...  You
                    said something about me.

                                    ROSE
                    The Dimension Cannon could measure
                    the Time Lines.  And it was weird,
                    Donna.  They all seemed to
                      converge...  On you.

                                      DONNA
                    But why me?  What have I ever done? 
                    I'm a temp.  From Chiswick!

      Now, slow track in to DONNA, dialogue fading in b/g; again,
      she's staring into space.  Lost in thought.

      Hearing...

      The heartbeat...

      Closer and closer on Donna...

      (This dialogue fading away b/g:)

                                      CAPTAIN JACK
                    What about your Dimension Jump?

                    Needs twenty minutes to recharge. 
                    And anyway.  I'm not leaving.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    What about your teleport?

                                      CAPTAIN JACK
                    Went down with the power loss.

                          (beat)
                    Donna?

      She snaps out of it.

                                      DONNA
                    Yeah.

      He thinks she's just scared:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm sorry.  There's nothing else
                    we can do.

                                      DONNA
                    Yeah, I was just...  I know.

      Psyching themselves up:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    So!

                    It's been good, though, hasn't it,
                    yeah?  All of us, all of it.

                    Right.  Blimey.

      And he turns, they walk down the ramp...

      THE DOCTOR opens the door...

      She stops.

      Eyes glaze over.  Staring.

      Hearing, again...

      In her head...

      The heartbeat...

3737EXT. CASTLE, GERMAN FOREST - NIGHT

      MARTHA steps out on to a rough track.  Heading towards...
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
      A CASTLE.  Standing on its own, above the forest. 

      As she walks closer...  A voice calls out:
        www.thewriterstale.com

                                    OLD WOMAN
                    Hier ist niemand.  Was immer Sie
                    wollen, gehen Sie fort.  Lassen
                    Sie mich in Ruhe.

      The OLD WOMAN's hostile, standing on the path.

                                      MARTHA

                    I went to London.  Long time ago. 

                                      MARTHA
                    Thought this place was supposed to
                    be guarded.

                    But when der Albtraume came from
                    the sky...  They went home to die. 
                    But not you, I think..?

                                      MARTHA
                    I've got a job to do.

      And she walks past the old woman, heads inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:

3838INT. CASTLE - NIGHT

      Inside, it's dark, bare.  MARTHA knows what to do, goes
      straight to an internal wall.  Pulls a wooden table and
      chair away from it.  Then takes down a picture, off the
      wall. Behind it: a sci-fi PALM PRINT READER.  Martha places
      her palm over the screen.  It glows, beeps -

      During this, the OLD WOMAN stays in the doorway.  Talks to
      Martha; Martha keeps her back to her, focused on the job.

                                    OLD WOMAN
                    London, in those days.  To see it! 
                    So much glamour.  That's what they
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
                    said, glamour.  And I was so young.
                          (pause)
                    I heard the soldiers talking. 
                    Many times.  They would speak of
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    the Osterhagen Key.
                          (pause)
                    I think London must be changed
                    now, yes?  But still.  The glamour.

      - and on the beep, a DOOR slides open in the wall.  Opening
      into a metal box; a LIFT.

      And Martha hears a click.  A safety catch.  Looks round.

      The Old Woman is pointing a Luger at her.  Scared.

                                    OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    You will stop.  You will not go.

      But Martha remains utterly calm.  Fixed.

                                      MARTHA
                    I've got no choice.

                                    OLD WOMAN
                    I know the Key.  What it does. 
                    Sie sind der Albtraum.  Nicht die
                    anderen, Sie!  Ich sollte Sie
                      umbringen, am besten gleich jetzt!

                                      MARTHA
                    Then do it.

      And Martha just steps into the lift.

      The Old Woman lowers her gun, defeated, shaking.

                                    OLD WOMAN
                    Marta.  Zur Hoelle mit Dir.

      As the door closes on her, quieter:

                                      MARTHA
                    I know.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Commence disposal.  Incinerate!

      A PANEL in the wall slides open.  Then the PALLET slides
      in, Jack's body disappearing through, gone.  Panel closes.

                    Disposal completed.

      Both Daleks glide away.

      Pause, slow TRACK IN to the closed panel, and...

      Jack slides it open!  Poking his head through.  RED LIGHT
      behind him.  He's gasping; it's hot in there!

                                                                            CUT TO:

4141INT. LIFT/OSTERHAGEN STATION ONE - NIGHT

      Lift door opens...

      MARTHA's taking off the Indigo Project, shoves it down as
      she steps out into OSTERHAGEN STATION ONE.  Small room,
        claustrophobic, lined with COMPUTER BANKS, like a compact
      version of the OUTER RADIATION ROOM, 3.11.  One chair, one
      desk.  On the desk, a panel, to fit the Key.

      One wall: 4 TV SCREENS, labelled CHINA, ALASKA, ARGENTINA,
      LIBERIA.  All showing static.  Martha clicks a comms button.

                    Because he dares not.  Out of shame. 

      The Doctor just silent.  Which Davros loves.

                    a brand new creation.  An event! 
                    So unique that the Time Lines were

                    This would always have happened; I
                    only helped, Doctor.

      them a good 20 feet away, good distance).  At the Doctor.

                                    ROSE
                    ...but hold on.  This is the
                    parallel universe, right?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You're back home.

                                      DONNA
                    And the walls of the world are
                    closing again, now the Reality
                    Bomb never happened.  It's a
                      dimensional retroclosure - see, I
                    really get that stuff now!

                                    ROSE
                    No, but I spent all that time,
                    trying to find you.  I'm not going
                    back now.

                    But you've got to.  Cos we saved
                    the universe at a cost, and the
                    cost, is him.
                          (ie, Doctor #2)
                    He destroyed the Daleks.  He
                    committed genocide.  He's too
                    dangerous to be left on his own.

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    You made me.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Exactly.  You were born in battle. 
                    Full of blood and anger and revenge.
                          (to Rose)
                    Remind you of someone?  That's me,
                    when we first met.  And you made
                    me better.  Now you can do the
                    same for him.

                                    ROSE
                    ...but he's not you.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    He needs you.  That's very me.

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    I look like him.  Think like him. 
                    Same memories, same thoughts, same
                      everything, except...  I've only
                    got one heart.

                                    ROSE
                    Which means..?

                                    THE DOCTOR #2
                    I'm part Human.  Specifically, the
                    ageing part.  I'll grow old.  And
                    never regenerate.  I've only got
                    one life, Rose Tyler.  I... could
                    spend it with you.  If you want.

                    You'll grow old... at the same

                    But it's still not right.  Cos the

                    And I'm him! 

      Rose looks at them both.  And takes control.  The two

                                    ROSE
                    All right.  Both of you.  Answer

                    my life, what was the last thing

                    And you.  Doctor.  What was the

      And he smiles.  He leans in close.  Gentle.

      And he whispers.

      It's the most powerful moment; he steps back again, he and
      Rose just staring at each other.  Awestruck.  Dazzled.

      Then suddenly, on impulse, she leans forward, pulls the
      Doctor down by the lapel -

      And kisses him!

      And that's all the original Doctor needs to see.

        Heartbroken.

      Donna knows it too, glancing at him.

      Then the Doctor turns, goes into the Tardis, Donna following -

      Rose & Doctor #2 separate only as they hears the door slam -

                    No, please, no, no, no...

      But she falls unconscious; he catches her, lowers her down.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The doorbell is ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing.  WILF
      bounding down the hall, happy -

                                    WILF
                    That must be her!

      He opens the front door -

      In the street, the TARDIS.  But Wilf sees only THE DOCTOR,
      stooping down, DONNA unconscious at his feet.  Desperate:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Help me.

      CU DONNA, on her bed, unconscious, still clothed.

            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
      THE DOCTOR stands above her.  Calmer.  WILF in the doorway.

      The Doctor turns and goes.  Closes the door, darkness.

      Low light.  THE DOCTOR sits with WILF and SYLVIA.  Wilf so
      sad; Sylvia less forgiving, as he explains:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    She took my mind, into her own
                    head.  But that's a Time Lord
                      consciousness.  All that knowledge. 
                    It was killing her. 

                                    WILF
                    But she'll get better now..?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I had to wipe her mind, completely. 
                    Every trace of me, or the Tardis,
                    anything we did together, anywhere
                    we went... had to go.

                                    WILF
                    All those wonderful things she did -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I know.  But that version of
                    Donna.... is dead.

                    Cos if she remembers, just for a
                    second, she'll burn up.  You can
                    never tell her.  You can't mention
                    me, or any of it.  For the rest of
                    her life.

                                      SYLVIA
                    But the whole world's talking about
                    it, we travelled across space.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And it'll just be a story.  One of
                    those Donna Noble stories.  Where
                    she missed it all, again.

                                    WILF
                    But she was better, with you.

                                      SYLVIA
                    Don't say that.

                                    WILF
                    But she was.

                                    THE DOCTOR
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
                    I just want you to know...  That
                    there are worlds out there, safe
                    in the sky, because of her.  That
                    there are people, living in the

                    Noble, a thousand million light
                    years away.  They will never forget
                    her.  While she can never remember.
                          (pause; upset)
                    And for one moment.  One shining
                    moment.  She was the most important
                    woman in the whole wide universe.

                                      SYLVIA
                    She still is.  She's my daughter.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Then maybe you should tell her
                    that, once in a while.

      And suddenly - DONNA walks in.  As normal as can be.

                                      DONNA
                    I was asleep!  On my bed!  In my
                    clothes!  Like a flippin' kid,
                    what d'you let me do that for?
                          (to the Doctor)
                    Sorry, don't mind me.  Donna!

      And she's gone.

      Silence.  Wilf dismayed.  Then, cold:

                    As I said.  I think you should go.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Um.  Donna.  I was just going.

                                      DONNA
                    Yeah, see ya -

      During that, on the Doctor.  Taking a last look at her.

                      Atmospheric disturbance.  Still,
                    it'll pass.  Everything does.  Bye
                    then, Wilfred.

      The Doctor walks into the rain; Wilf stays in the doorway.

                                    WILF
                    But, Doctor..  What about you,
                    now?  Who have you got?  I mean,
                    all those friends of yours...

                    They've all got someone else. 
                    Still.  That's fine.  I'm fine.

                    You can't ever tell her.

                    No, but...  Every night, Doctor.  
                    When it goes dark.  And the stars
            DW4 - Ep 13 - Blue
                    come out.  I'll look up.  On her
                    behalf.  I'll look up at the sky,
                    and think of you.

        www.thewriterstale.com
      So simple, so heartfelt, that the Doctor could cry.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...thank you.

      And before he loses it, he walks away.

      WIDE SHOT, the Doctor walking to the Tardis.  In the rain. 
      Wilf just a silhouette in the doorway.

      The Doctor goes inside.

      Stares into space.  As though remembering....

      But then.  Back to normal.  Forever.

      Then he looks up at the Time Rotor.  *

      Lost in thought.

      Deep breath.   Move on.  He starts wandering, all the way*
      round the console.  Flicking switches.  Recovering himself.*

      And all alone.*
