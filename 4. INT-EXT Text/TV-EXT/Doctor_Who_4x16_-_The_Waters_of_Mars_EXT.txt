      folded-up rotary washing line.

      CLOSER: this is YURI KERENSKI, 27, the Base Nurse; happy,
      smiling, bit of an innocent.  He's fixing a bit of tech.

      up, red sky behind him.  His POV - 

      FX: HIGH WIDE SHOT revealing the Mars Base.  Classic design,
      one central DOME, 6 surface TUNNELS radiating out, like
      spokes of a wheel, to 6 smaller DOMES; except one spoke is
      longer, and leads to an upright SHUTTLE, very like the
      real Space Shuttle, pointing skywards, held against a
      scaffolding gantry.  Nearby, as part of the Dome, include
      the TECH AREA from sc.4 & 8.  All sitting on a rocky, red
      landscape.

      The Doctor delighted!

      A GUN stabs into his back.  Click! 

      The Doctor puts his hands up in surrender.  Turns round...

      And is confronted by GADGET, a Wall-E-type 3ft tall robot
      probe on tracks.  Despite being in advance of anything
      today, it looks low-tech, dented and abused.  Gadget has
      two arms, complete with skeletal hands.  From its body
      hangs a full selection of tools - a tool for every job. 
      It regards the Doctor with big camera-lens eyes.  Aiming

      scared of him.  Runs away, following Mia, into the night.

      Leaving Adelaide and the Doctor alone, in the snow.

                    Saved some little people.  But

                    That's for me to decide.  Now,
                    you'd better go home.

                    All locked up, you've been away. 
                    Still, that's easy.

      He points the sonic screwdriver at the house, whirrs.

      The clunk of locks; it's open.

      He whirrs again, at the upstairs.

      One upstairs light comes on.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    All yours.

                                      ADELAIDE
                    Is there nothing you can't do?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Not any more.

      And she turns away from him -

      Runs to her house.

      Stops by her door.

      And as she turns to look back at him.

        SLOW-MOTION.

      THE DOCTOR, still watching her, in the snow, standing tall,
      so confident, so proud.  Unstoppable.

      And in slow motion, she turns to her door.

      As she steps inside, just a glimpse -

      She's taking her blue-metal gun out of her holster.

      The door closes.

      CUT TO the Doctor.  Still in slow-motion, he turns away
      from the house, to walk back to the Tardis.  In the snow,
      and the night, in perfect command.

      And then REAL-TIME SLAMS BACK IN, as -

      Bang! 

      From the house.  A fast, blue flare in a darkened window.
                                                          Tale

      Then silence.

      On the Doctor - CU, slam into FLASHBACKS, as in sc.12 -

      FLASHBACK: the photo of Adelaide, unchanged.  Slam into
      the date of death, unchanged: 2059.

      Intercut with CU Doctor, his horror -

      Fontana Brooke.  First Lightspeed Ship.  Proud heritage.

      Time slamming back into place.

      The Doctor, defeated.

      Hold on him: shattered, all this sudden arrogance draining
      away.  He's collapsing inside.  Sinks to his knees.

      CU on him.  His grief. 

      Music, filling this moment.  Haunting, soaring.  But then,
      gradually, realise...

      The Doctor can hear this.



                                                                (CONTINUED)Doctor Who 4   Episode 16   SHOOTING SCRIPT  09/02/09    page 71.

      It's a song.

      And old, familiar song.

      He looks up...

      A good distance away...

      An OOD.  Ood Sigma.  Surrounded by snow and Ood-song.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    ...I've gone too far.

      Ood Sigma just stares at him.

      The Doctor stands.  Calls out:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Is this it?  My death?  Is it time?

      A flurry of snow, and...

      The Ood has gone.  No one there.

      The Doctor recovering.

                                                          Tale
      Looks back at the house.  So sorry. 

      Then walks to the Tardis, head bowed.

      Steps inside.

      FX: the grind of ancient engines, and the Tardis melts
      away, into the snow and the dark...
