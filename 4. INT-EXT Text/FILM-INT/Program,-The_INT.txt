Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by
reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.
WINTERS
(keeping his cool)
No, we're just a young team on the
verge. We'll be back in a major bowl
next year.
Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-
splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his
locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes
danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly,
a sense of repressed anger off it.
ALVIN
Good throw, Joe. It was there.
JOE
So was half their team.
(trailing off)
Shit, another Christmas at home.
ALVIN
Next year, man. Next year we sell
out. Next year we dominate.
ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN
still fielding questions.
REPORTER #2
You still need a deep threat or a
breakaway back to go with Joe Kane.
What are you gonna do to address
this need?
COACH WINTERS
(a little edgy)
Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you
guys for a start.
As Winters gets up to go, we hear:
WILSON (V.O.)
I'm not gonna lead you into the fog
here, Sam...
CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind
his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN
HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.
CHANCELLOR WILSON
I'm concerned about our Program.
It's always been a source of pride
to our students and alumni, but two
straight so-so seasons are having a
damaging effect on our fund-raising,
both public and private.
WINTERS
(half-joking)
Then stop raising the entrance
requirements on me. We never could
have gotten Alvin Mack in here under
the new guidelines.
CHANCELLOR WILSON
As Chancellor, my first responsibility
is to the academic interests of this
University.
Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed
to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is
marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is
$400,000,000.
WILSON
At a time when we're committed to a
400 million dollar building program,
alumni donations are down 15% the
last two years. Because they've also
voiced their displeasure to their
legislators, we can expect a
corresponding drop in state funds.
HOWARD
The Athletic Fund is suffering too.
Season tickets sales are off,
merchandising's slow...
WINTERS
You layin' all this at my door?
There's been a recession on.
CHANCELLOR WILSON
Yes, but the heaviest drop has been
from the big donors, the 100,000
dollar club. These people are
recession proof. They sit in my box
every game, and they're much more
generous when we're ranked and going
to bowl games. Two of them, as you
know, are on the Board of Regents,
including the Chairman.
WINTERS
What are you trying to say to me,
Grant? After 12 years, my job's in
jeopardy?
CHANCELLOR WILSON
I'm not prepared to discuss your job
right now; I just want you to be
aware of the situation. The alumni
and the legislature are unhappy and
they vote with their checkbooks. I
don't pretend to be an expert on
football, Sam, and I'll deny that
this conversation ever took place,
but I do know we need to win next
year.
Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and
CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to
a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY
of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.
CLAYTON
(ignoring the effigy)
Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary
and player profiles are in your
briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow
in Philly with this kid Darnell
Jefferson.
Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton
fear an outburst, a display of rage.
WINTERS
Looks like I've lost weight.
That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch
up.
CLAYTON
This kid's the gamebreaker we've
been lookin' for.
MUSIC STARTS. TITLES BEGIN.
A Boeing 737 roars into the night sky.
COACH CLAYTON (V.O.)
Had a 108 yard kickoff return against
Taft. Michigan's been down to see
him twice.
Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL
JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room.
Other boys of various ages and color look in from the
adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip,
the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.
WINTERS
Darnell, you have the potential to
start for us as a freshman. That 108
yard kickoff return you made against
Taft? One of the greatest runs I've
ever seen a high school player make.
Now, Michigan is set at tailback for
two years. You won't play till you're
a junior. With Joe here gettin' you
the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right,
you'll be All-American with us as a
Sophomore.
REVEREND WALLACE
Yes, but I'm really more concerned
with Darnell's education. He came
here late. He's got some catching up
to do.
WINTERS
Believe me, education is the first
priority in our program. That's why
all the players are smarter than me.
After all, a football coach is smart
enough to understand the game, but
dumb enough to think it's important.
This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended
to.
Two rooms. Dirt floor. Two-foot Christmas tree on an apple
cart. Alvin Mack's MOTHER opens a Christmas present as Alvin
and his TWO SISTERS look on. It's an ENGRAVED LIONSHEAD
DOORKNOCKER, the kind you'de find on the door of an affluent
home. The inscription reads THE MACK'S. Alvin's mother thinks
it's beautiful, but isn't sure what to do with it.
ALVIN'S MOTHER
It's real pretty, Alvin.
ALVIN
When I turn pro, I'll get you the
house to go with it.
Winters' daughter LOUANNE, 20, is on the phone with her
father. Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured,
somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador. She holds a hopelessly
out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas.
LOUANNE
(lying)
It's real nice, Dad.
Winters sits on the bed, eating Chinese take-out, the phone
cradled in his neck, talking to Louanne.
WINTERS
I knew you'de like it, Lou. Merry
Christmas. Put some fresh flowers on
your Mom's grave for me. I'll be
home in a couple days.
Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, FRANK, watching
the bowl game he would have been in, had E.S.U. won their
last game. His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods
in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been
drinking beer, their empties scattered around. Frank tosses
Joe an Iron City beer.
FRANK
Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn't
think we'de see you here this
Christmas, little brother.
JOE
You won't next year.
JOE'S FATHER
(getting up)
Yeh, well we won't rent your place
on the couch.
As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty
beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree.
We see that the whole tree is covered with cans.
Darnell talks on a pay phone in the hall.
DARNELL
You're from E.S.U?
GIRL'S VOICE
Yeh. I was just sittin' here by the
fire doin' my homework, and decided
to give you a call. See how you're
doin'.
We see who Darnell is talking to: AUTUMN HALEY, beautiful
black girl, stylish, long straight hair, definitely not
street.
AUTUMN
Coach Winters has been telling me
about you. I'm looking forward to
seeing you when you come to visit.
I'll be your guide. You are coming
to visit aren't you?
We PULL BACK and REVEAL Autumn in an office with 15 other
telephones, a coed on every one. ASST. COACH MYERS supervises
with a clipboard of names and numbers.
A dorm devoted exclusively to football players. Luxurious
lounges, study halls, saunas, recreation and media rooms.
Spacious living quarters. A world unto itself.
Joe and Bud usher Darnell into his room.
JOE
Here's your room. If you need anything
call the hall manager.
Darnell looks around, taking it all in. He tries to be cool,
but this is easily the nicest room he's ever had.
JOE
See ya later. Freshman Placement
test tomorrow at nine. McKinnley
Hall.
Joe and Bud start down the hall. Darnell turns back into his
room, then starts to pace off it's dimensions, heel to toe.
Joe and Darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous
among them is Louanne Winters. Joe and Darnell give her a
nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players
wait: Bud Lite, BOBBY COLLINS, good-looking, silver-tongued
ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and STEVE LATTIMER,
heavily muscled, surf-punk defensive end. Between them is a
large pitcher of beer.
BOBBY
Uh, oh, the Lead Dog is back. There
goes my cover of the media guide.
JOE
Hey, Bobby, Lats, how ya doin? This
is Darnell Jefferson, freshman
tailback.
DARNELL
How ya' doin'?
BOBBY
I was hopin' you'de have rolled your
bike or somethin'. Nothin' serious,
just enough to keep you out for the
season.
JOE
(pouring himself some
beer)
No such luck, Backup Man. But I'll
try to engineer a few blowouts. Get
you get some mop-up time.
(studying Lattimer)
Shit, Lats, you look buffed, man.
You put on some weight?
LATTIMER
35 lbs. Spent the summer in the gym.
I'm tired of watchin' you guys play.
I intend to start this year.
BUD
You get any bigger, you can play
offense.
LATTIMER
Yeh, but don't I have to get dumber
too?
Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it.
Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a
surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He
gives her the "just a minute" sign.
BUD
You still seein' Louanne?
BOBBY
Yeh. Now and then, when the tide
rises. Don't want her to think this
is some kind've exclusive deal.
JOE
Coach finds out you're nailin' his
daughter, you'll be playin' dorm
ball.
BOBBY
I'll bail before that. Besides, this
is what he gets for not startin' me.
Bobby laughs and heads over to Louanne's table, as Joe pours
himself another beer.
Alvin enters the bar, goes to Joe's table, plops a copy of
Sports Illustrated down in front of Joe.
ALVIN
Hey, man, you seen this?
On the cover is a picture of Joe and ONE OTHER QUARTERBACK,
TIM WAYMEN. The coverline reads, HEISMAN HOPEFULS: THE YEAR
OF THE QUARTERBACK.
ALVIN
(ribbing Joe)
You must be some very bad-ass
motherfucker.
Joe stares at the cover. He's more stunned than elated.
JOE
Jesus...
LATTIMER
What? You didn't know?
JOE
I knew there was gonna be an article.
I didn't know it was gonna be on the
cover.
ALVIN
Shit, we do all the work. You get
all the pub. Too bad we're not allowed
to hit you in practice. Be fun to
kick the shit out of a Heisman Trophy
Candidate.
JOE
I guess you'll have to wait till we
get to the pros.
ALVIN
(to Darnell)
Beer boy, get me some.
DARNELL
Are you serious?
ALVIN
Does it look like I'm serious?
Joe drains his beer, pours another. Lattimer starts to read
form the article.
LATTIMER
Listen to this. "E.S.U. has a solid
nucleus returning, but the
Timberwolves, coming off two
disappointing seasons, will only go
as far as the strong right arm of
Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take
them." That right, Joe? You gonna
lead us to the promised land?
JOE
I'm gonna lead... but can you follow?
Muted chuckles, but set faces. The challenge accepted. Joe
chugs his beer, pours another.
Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are
scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in
test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts
to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the
clock, goes on to the next page.
The football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The
Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking
very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U.
greats arranged on the Wall of Honor.
Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation
punctuated with laughter.
A door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes
immediately. Coach Winters walks in. The Upperclassmen break
into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join
in.
WINTERS
Good to see you again, gentlemen.
(catching sight of
Darnell)
Jefferson, either take off the earring
or put on a dress.
The upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off
his earring.
WINTERS
I wanna talk a little about what
we're trying to do here. There are
many highly respected people who
feel football is about preparation
for life.
The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of
the football cannon.
WINTERS
These people are full of shit. You
see, football is not like life.
(pause)
It's better. More exciting, more
intense, more fun. In life, people
are always wondering how they measure
up; whether they're getting ahead or
fallin' behind. In football, you
know. Every week you get a chance to
show what you're made of, a chance
to demonstrate the physical and
personal qualities that all those
poor bastards who can't play this
game are left to agonize about.
Spreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football
player.
WINTERS
Last year we didn't make enough of
those chances. Last year everyone
felt we let the school down. Fuck
the school. We let ourselves down.
(pointing to the Wall
of Honor)
We let down a great tradition, a 120-
year-old Line of Champions.
The smiles are gone. Lots of set faces now. Shame. anger,
retribution.
WINTERS
Any football program worth the name
is a special brotherhood, an elite
corps of warriors, a select group of
knights. That first time our starting
unit takes the field, the first time
we huddle up; that's our inner circle,
that's our Round Table. If I were an
upperclassman, I'd be real nervous
about my seat, cause we got some
very talented new-comers this year.
Guys who want a place at the Table.
(producing Darnell's
trophy from behind
the podium)
This is the trophy one of our
freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as
a Pennsylvania State High School
First Team All-American. You know
what this says to me?
The freshmen are hanging on every word.
WINTERS
Not a god-damn thing.
He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half,
shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog.
The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen.
WINTERS
(to the freshmen)
Everybody here was a high school All-
American.
(to all the players)
Whatever any of you have done before
is out the window. We're startin'
over. Ground zero. The Table is empty.
Are you ready?
The upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. We go to the
freshmen. They're not so sure.
SMASH CUT TO:
Winters, mad as hell, is berating his assistant coaches who
are sitting, cowed in his office.
WINTERS
I see tackling, but I don't see
hitting. I see effort, but I don't
see ferocity. What do you think,
they're gonna motivate themselves?
Football's just a game to most of
these kids. This is our program, our
livelihood. It's our job to make
them care as much about it as we do.
Make them hate me if you have to.
It'll bring them together, give them
a focus. So get off your butts and
put the fear of God in these guys.
Dead tired players toweling off, dressing. The trainer's
room is crowded with aching, cramped-up, contused players.
Across the way, Lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight
room. Clayton and Humes consider this from outside Winters'
office.
CLAYTON
Shit, Lattimer's an animal all of a
sudden. Benchin' 450. He's gotta be
on somethin'.
HUMES
What, steroids? Why do you always
think my guys are juicin'?
CLAYTON
I don't know... he's on the punt
team for three years, then gains 35
pounds of rip in one summer and an
attitude to go with it.
Winters, who's heard all this, comes by.
WINTERS
We're not doctors, gentlemen. The
NCAA has testing programs for this.
Let's let them worry about it.
(to Clayton)
Besides, it's not that hard to put
on 35 pounds in a summer, if you
really hit the gym.
Winters walks on into his office. Clayton nods, realizing
this subject is now closed.
Darnell walks in, wrung out from the day's practice, stumbles
to the bed where he sees something that stops him - lying
there is his PENNSYLVANIA STATE ALL AMERICAN TROPHY. Coach
Winters actually smashed a replica. A smile appears on
Darnell's tired face.
For football players only. Bud Lite moves through the
cafeteria line.
BUD
What you got tonight?
CAFETERIA WORKER
Choice of three entrees. Shrimp,
lasagna, T-bone steak.
BUD
Tough choice. I'll take all three.
CAFETERIA WORKER
What a surprise.
ANGLE ON DARNELL
at another table with Alvin and several other black players.
Lattimer is the only white.
DARNELL
When do they give ya the scores on
that Placement Test?
LATTIMER
Who cares? I flunked it three times,
before I got in.
ALVIN
Long as you're in the program, they'll
get you through. Maybe not with a
degree, but they'll keep you eligible.
Just don't do nothin' embarrassing
they can't cover you for.
LATTIMER
Hell, they even give Alvin copies of
his tests in advance. He sells 'em
for a hundred bucks a pop to people
in his class. 'Course he's gotta
have somebody read 'em to him.
ALVIN
Fuck you, doughboy. I can read. See
that shoe?
(points to his shoes)
That says Nike.
DARNELL
I still don't wanna flunk that test.
I wanta get a degree.
ALVIN
What do you think, nigger? You're
gonna be on the Supreme Court? All
you need to know is how to sign an
N.F.L. contract.
Darnell's stung by this. He'd like to think of himself as
capable of more.
Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise
visitor to the training table. All the players wearing
baseball caps, quickly doff them. Winters is angry.
WINTERS
What's the matter with you guys?
You're supposed to be a team. Winning
depends on thinking and acting and
going to war together. But you don't
even eat like a team. You eat like
two teams. A white one and a black
one. What do I have to do? Make out
a seating chart? Now get up. Move
around. Mix it up. Now!
The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up
and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe.
DARNELL
(mock introduction)
Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I'm a
young black man.
JOE
Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane,
Caucasian. So what doya think a that
new Garth Brooks album?
DARNELL
I love that motherfucker.
Coach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables
are integrated now.
WINTERS
That's more like it.
He turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to
drift back to their old tables.
Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various
aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out
of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and
looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE
SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage
of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe
leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in.
JOE
How ya' doin'?
CAMILLE
Fine.
JOE
Little late to be workin' out, isn't
it?
CAMILLE
(with a little edge)
Only time I could get in here when
the football team wasn't usin' it.
JOE
(trying to get a rise
out of her)
Well, if it wasn't for the football
team, might not be a weight room to
use. You tryin' to firm up a little,
or what?
CAMILLE
(unfazed)
Don't need to firm up. I'm
strengthening my knee. Had
arthroscopic surgery.
JOE
Had my knee scoped once too. When
you're finished here, maybe we could
get a yogurt, compare scars.
CAMILLE
Sorry, I don't date football players.
They're all full of themselves. I
saw you on the cover of Sports
Illustrated, so you're probably worse
than most.
JOE
That's real open minded of you. So
you won't consider doin' anything
with me?
CAMILLE
No.
JOE
Well at least tell me what happened
to your knee. What'd you do? Fall
outa your convertible?
Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's
going to fire on him. Wrong.
CAMILLE
You know, there's maybe one thing
I'd do with you.
JOE
What's that?
CAMILLE
Tennis. I'll play tennis with you.
Camille starts to walk away.
JOE
Tennis. You mean now? It's raining.
SMASH CUT TO:
CAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT
smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with
the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a
world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting
every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins
watch, amazed.
We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless
dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the
line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting
a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return.
Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends
it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving
again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille
puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost
knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence.
Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.
CAMILLE
Thanks for the game, Heisman. You
took it really well.
And she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her,
pissed.
JOE
What's this Heisman crap?
Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve.
JOE
I didn't say anything about being a
Heisman candidate. I don't go around
strokin' myself about it. So what's
this shit you're givin' me?
CAMILLE
I... I'm sorry... I just figured you
were probably kissin' yourself in
the mirror every morning.
JOE
You figured wrong.
Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him.
CAMILLE
So what do you want, an apology? I
just gave you one.
JOE
I want a rematch.
CAMILLE
A rematch?
JOE
Some other sport. I took my beating.
You owe me one. Either that or we go
out.
Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike
least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.
CAMILLE
I'll think about it.
Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. Joe walks
off in the other direction. Bud Lite and Bobby follow.
BOBBY
Real good date, Joe. Remind me to
take her out.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor.
ADVISOR SMITH
Darnell, I've reviewed your placement
test and I'm afraid you failed to
meet our entrance requirements in
two areas.
DARNELL
What does that mean? I can't play
football?
ADVISOR SMITH
No. It means you're going to have to
take some remedial classes, what we
call "zero level" courses.
Specifically Math 0 and English 0.
Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of
his academic standing.
ADVISOR SMITH
You won't get college credit for
them, but they will help you prepare
to take the Placement Test again at
the end of the quarter. If you pass
at that time you'll be able to
officially enter the university and
take college level courses. You'll
still be able to take an American
History survey course, but it won't
count on your record until you pass
the Placement Test. But first things
first. To start, I'm approving a
tutor for you.
DARNELL
A tutor? I don't need no tutor.
ADVISOR SMITH
Any tutor. And yes you do.
A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic
Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the
Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also
present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center
of all this attention.
HOWARD
I think both Joe and the university
are best served by a straightforward
Heisman campaign. Nothing too
gimmicky.
BRAVER
We've compiled a mailing list of
around 1300 opinion makers;
newspapers, football writers, and
sports anchors. First we send them a
packet on Joe and his achievements.
Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff;
commitment to academics, charity
work, etc. Then we update it each
week with a postcard. Heisman voters
hate opening envelopes.
Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.
JOE
I haven't really done any charity
work...
BRAVER
You're gonna start. We've got some
things lined up.
NICHOLS
Unfortunately, because we weren't in
the top 20 last year, we only have
one network T.V. game to give Joe
national exposure. Although it's a
good one; Michigan. But we'll also
be taping all our other games and
buying satellite time. That way we
can produce our own highlight package
and interview pieces and send them
out to T.V. stations all over the
country for their sportscasts.
WINTERS
Any questions, Joe?
If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not
to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign?
Still it's a megaton of pressure.
JOE
Ah, no... I just... you really think
I got a shot to win this?
WINTERS
Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing
for the program. Publicizes the
school, gives a boost to recruiting,
and it's a great thing for you. Jumps
up your draft position, the size of
your first contract, everything.
It's a hell of an opportunity.
NICHOLS
All you gotta do is back it up on
the field, and we have no doubts
about that, cause we know "Kane is
Able."
Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase
"Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a
rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about
all this.
Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to
get to sleep.
The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and
answers it.
CAMILLE
Hello...
ON JOE
JOE
This is Joe Kane. What did you decide?
CAMILLE
(still drowsy)
What?
(looking at the clock)
It's 3:00 in the morning.
JOE
I wanta know what you decided.
CAMILLE
I don't know... I couldn't think of
any other sports I could beat you
at.
JOE
Then I'll pick you up tonight at
6:00.
He hangs up.
CAMILLE
What?
Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She
becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see
Darnell.
DARNELL
Hey, Autumn.
AUTUMN
Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?
DARNELL
My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya
know, just to get me over a couple
rough spots.
(showing her a paper)
I saw your name on this list. I
figured if you couldn't keep my
attention, nobody could.
AUTUMN
I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already
been assigned. You're gonna have to
find somebody else. I'm tutoring
Scott Sherman.
DARNELL
Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters
to switch us.
AUTUMN
Coach Winters wouldn't do that.
DARNELL
Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect
than Sherman.
(pointing across the
way)
He's a lineman on the scout team.
Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough,
SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn
can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.
Darnell sits down across the table from her.
DARNELL
C'mon Autumn, you could teach me
some real erudition.
AUTUMN
(trying to whisper,
pissed)
Will you stop using those big words.
It sounds ridiculous.
DARNELL
(serious about this)
What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself.
I learn a new word out of the
dictionary every day. Mendacious,
pejorative, antithetical,
commensurate...
AUTUMN
And you don't ever use them right.
Pretending to be smart is not the
same as being educated. Or erudite.
It's just a con. And it makes you
sound stupid, no matter how big a
prospect you are.
Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His
customary bravado melts away.
DARNELL
O.K... even more reason for you to
be my tutor. You already taught me
something.
Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal.
She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having
trouble being angry about it.
ALVIN MACK
At another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR
reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman
and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP.
Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's "Who Do
You Love" on the jukebox. Camille and Joe are sitting in a
booth. Joe putting away the beers.
CAMILLE
You come here a lot?
JOE
Now and then. Why?
CAMILLE
It's not exactly a campus favorite.
This is almost like hidin' out.
JOE
I like places where nobody knows me.
This too low-rent for you?
CAMILLE
No, my dad owned a place like this.
JOE
Your dad? You mean he owned a chain
of these?
CAMILLE
Not everybody with a Southern accent
has their own plantation. My dad
could never afford to send me here.
I learned to play tennis on public
courts. Mighta been able to play pro
someday, if I hadn't hurt my knee.
JOE
So you're just a scholarship jock
like me.
CAMILLE
Yeh. You disappointed?
JOE
No, I've just never been out with a
jock before.
CAMILLE
Is that what we're doin' here? Goin'
out?
JOE
I don't know. What doya think?
Joe gets up, takes Camille's hand and pulls her to her feet.
They dance to a slow song.
CAMILLE
I think you're crazy for jeopardizing
your scholarship and a pro future by
jumping motorcycles off of highways.
JOE
Just tryin' to keep my edge, Camille.
The other guys look to me cause they
think I'll do anything. I lose that,
I'm just another guy, and we all get
our ass kicked.
CAMILLE
I don't know, Joe. You scare me.
Joe roars in on his motorcycle. Parks. Starts inside. Finds
himself face to face with a very unhappy Coach Winters.
Winters holds out his hand.
WINTERS
The keys.
Joe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his
motorcycle keys.
WINTERS
I told you, as long as you're in
this program, you don't take
unnecessary risks off the field. A
man in contention for the Heisman
Trophy should be able to remember
that.
Joe nods, contrite. Winters just walks on off.
Autumn is tutoring Darnell, checking her lesson notes.
AUTUMN
O.K., using the things we worked on
yesterday, I want you to write a two
or three page essay on some aspect
of your life. Something other than
football.
DARNELL
Like what?
AUTUMN
Your father, maybe. You could write
about your dad.
DARNELL
Don't know that much about him. He
was off in Detroit workin' in a car
plant when I was born. Got laid off,
tried to rob a jewelry store to get
us some money. He died in prison.
Some kinda heart problem.
Autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. She tries to
press on gamely.
AUTUMN
How about your mother?
DARNELL
She was always workin'. Usually two
jobs. Comin' home one night she
stopped to get us some root beer.
Got caught in a gang crossfire. Shot
three times... died on the way to
the hospital. You want me to write
about that?
AUTUMN
(blown away)
No...
DARNELL
Good, 'cause none of it's true.
Autumn jumps up.
AUTUMN
(raising her voice)
Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible
thing to do to somebody. That's not
funny. That's sick.
Autumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down.
DARNELL
Had ya goin', didn't I?
AUTUMN
(soft library voice)
No you didn't. You just... How could
you make up somethin' like that?
DARNELL
(contrite now)
Sounded more interesting than the
truth. My mom took a vacation to
Chicago when I was 12. Never came
back. Don't know who my dad was.
Autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth.
AUTUMN
Who took care of you?
DARNELL
I started hangin' with the J.B.M.,
gang-bangin'... Did some time in the
Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin'
football on a juvenile probation
team. Took me in, got me into high
school. Only reason they accepted me
was 'cause I could play football.
Sorta like here. Football saved my
life. I'd be nowhere without football.
Autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in.
AUTUMN
Well, then... maybe you could write
about football this once.
DARNELL
Yeh, o.k... thanks.
(pause)
I've seen a lotta shitty things in
my life, Autumn. That's why I know
when I see somethin' good.
Autumn knows this is no line. He means it. She's seeing him
with new eyes. Moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity,
and more than a little taken by his regard for her.
ON ALVIN
across the room with his tutor.
TUTOR
Let's review the chapter I read you
yesterday. Which two city states
fought in the Punic Wars?
ALVIN
I dunno. Detroit and Buffalo.
TUTOR
C'mon, Alvin. You're gonna be tested
on this.
A video projector projects various football formations on
the wall.
WINTERS
Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi
State's offensive set. 2nd and 2 on
our 24. What defense are you in?
ALVIN
Eagle. Zipper. Hero. Unless the set
back shifts into the I.
WINTERS
Good.
(slide changes)
How about here? 3rd and 7.
ALVIN
Okie. Thunder. Lion.
WINTERS
What's your assignment?
ALVIN
Kill the Quarterback.
(slide changes)
Hit the tight end so hard his
girlfriend dies.
(slide changes)
Kill everybody.
MUSIC UP - MONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS
Autumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math
book. As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her. Autumn
quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw
Darnell's attempt. Darnell laughs.
A group of football players sits in the back of the class.
As the HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures at the board, Darnell
furiously takes notes. Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity,
leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football
out of Darnell's left hand. Darnell, Scott and two other
FRESHMAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS spring out of their seats,
scrambling after the loose ball. The prof and the other
students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under
chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball.
Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it.
He and the others quickly return to their seats. The prof
looks at Darnell aghast.
DARNELL
Sorry... I lost my football.
Joe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball.
Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a
fist in triumph. Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket
and stomps around.
Several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board
in the hall. The starting lineup for the first game has been
posted. Darnell traces his finger from the designation
TAILBACK over to the name RAY GRIFFEN. He drops his eyes,
obviously disappointed.
Lattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board. He
finds his name posted as a starting defensive end. Punching
the air, he dashes out of the building.
LATTIMER
Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the
table. Whooo!! Yes!!
The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a
circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles. Coach Winters
addresses the assembly.
WINTERS
As the veteran players know, we have
Pride Night every year before our
opening game. It's a chance to get
to know each other better, share
some thoughts, and bring us closer
together as a team. So to start off,
I'd like each player to tell the
others in his group what he likes
best about football and then what
he's most proud of off the field.
I've asked some of the seniors to
lead it off. Gentlemen.
ANGLE ON LATTIMER IN HIS CIRCLE
LATTIMER
I don't know... It's the battle. The
goin' to war with the other guys.
Hangin' together.
The team walks through several plays. They wear coats and
ties, but no socks. Their ankles are taped.
LATTIMER (V.O.)
Bein' different from everybody else.
Havin' our own dorm, stayin' in hotels
the night before games. Settin'
ourselves apart.
Before the game. An NCAA OFFICIAL gives Lattimer a little
test tube to urinate in for his drug test. Lattimer goes
into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back
of the tank, where a VIAL OF CLEAN URINE is taped. He pours
it in the test vial.
LATTIMER (V.O.)
Havin' a chance to be somebody. To
do somethin' that people look up to
you for. Your strength and your
courage. Not everybody can play
football. We're the lucky ones.
DARNELL
The thing I'm most proud of myself
for?
Darnell listening to a Walkman, is going through a pregame
ritual by his locker; pivoting from leg to leg, switching
the ball from arm to arm.
DARNELL (V.O.)
Just that I'm here. That I'm not
dead or in jail.
JOE
The great thing about football is
you can lose yourself in it.
Joe sits off in a corner by himself, his head back against
the wall, staring out into space, the only movement the
rhythmic tapping of his feet.
JOE (V.O.)
There's no time to think, to worry,
to have doubts. Everything else fades
away. You just move and react.
ALVIN
The best thing is when you dominate.
That feeling when you hit a guy real
good, really stick him, and you hear
that little moan.
Alvin, his ass-kicking game face on, walks over to where
Lattimer is finishing decorating his face with Indian war
paint. They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his
mouth. Alvin spits into it. Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's.
Darnell can't believe this shit.
ALVIN (V.O.)
You know it's killin' him, but you
feel great. It's just him and you,
and he's the one that's hurtin'.
We move in on the burning ferocity of Alvin's eyes and
SMASH CUT TO:
The Players are bunched together in the tunnel, slapping
pads, yelling encouragement. Winters waves them forward.
They start to run down the tunnel.
PLAYERS P.O.V.
CAMERA runs with the players as the light at the end of the
tunnel becomes larger and brighter. Crowd NOISE becomes louder
until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the
light and 95,000 VOICES ROAR. AND ROAR! AND ROAR! This is
Big Time College Football.
E.S.U. announcer BRAD HARVEY and colorman, HARMON SLOAN are
holding forth.
HARVEY
Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den
where the E.S.U. Timberwolves, led
by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open
their season against the tough
Mississippi State Bulldogs under
head coach Jackie Sherrill.
A reception of some sort for the players is in progress.
Darnell, looking a little lost, fills his cup from a punch
bowl. A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.
ALUMNUS
Good to see ya in there, Darnell.
Way to hold on to that pigskin.
As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat
pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised,
he goes over to Alvin.
DARNELL
Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar
bill.
ALVIN
Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred
once you're startin', depending on
how you play.
DARNELL
But we're not supposed to get any
are we?
ALVIN
Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a
month scholarship money. And the NC
double assholes won't let us have
jobs, so you take your money where
you can get it.
(taking Darnell's
envelope)
I'll keep it for you, till you see
the light. Shit, they oughta be payin'
us anyway. Athletic Department gets
3 million just for goin' to a bowl
game.
Joe sits alone on his bed watching T.V. He's being interviewed
in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face.
REPORTER (V.O.)
This performance today -- two
touchdown passes, another you ran
in. Where do you think this puts you
in the Heisman race?
Joe hates this question. We go to the screen.
JOE
(uncomfortable)
I really have no idea. That's up to
you guys.
ANGLE ON SCREEN
The image changes to ESPN anchor CHRIS BERMAN in the studio.
BERMAN
Now let's turn to our Heisman watch.
(does the pose while
remaining seated)
We begin with Sports Illustrated
cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led
his team to an impressive victory
this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues
to raise Kane, he may well be Able
to dust off a large space on his
trophy shelf. Although the real test
will come in four weeks against
Michigan and their Heisman hopeful,
Tim Waymen.
Joe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door. No answer.
Knocks again. Nothing. Disappointed, he turns and walks away.
The post-game victory party is in full swing. All the players,
their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking,
celebrating. Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching
the action.
BUD LITE
I don't know, I never seem to make
out at things like this.
Bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne.
BOBBY
You don't make out anywhere. Or did
you finally break the snatch barrier
this summer?
BUD LITE
Fuck you, Bobby.
(realizing Louanne's
there)
Excuse me, Louanne.
ANGLE ON DARNELL
sitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on
Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor. Alvin notices.
ALVIN
Forget it, nigger. No chance for you
there.
DARNELL
Why not?
ALVIN
Griffin's goin' to medical school.
She likes that light-skinned
respectable shit. You're just her
ghetto toy.
Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where
Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays.
DARNELL
(to Autumn)
Can I have this one?
RAY
I don't think so.
DARNELL
What are you so worried about? You
haven't lost your starting job yet.
Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand.
AUTUMN
(turning to Ray)
Just one.
Ray reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance.
Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them
as they move around the floor. They try to pretend they're
just having a nice little chat.
AUTUMN
(whispering)
Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a
good time to push things. You're
putting me in an awkward position.
DARNELL
Yeh, well, I got a little
encouragement along the way.
AUTUMN
That kiss... it was just... a kiss.
DARNELL
Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn't
be standing here now, everybody
thinkin' I'm a stupid asshole, if I
didn't know you meant it. I wanna
see you, Autumn. Not in study hall.
Not like your student. Like somebody
to be taken seriously.
AUTUMN
I do take you seriously, Darnell,
but I'm still with Ray. I can't just
go paradin' around town.
DARNELL
I don't need to go paradin'. We'll
go someplace different. Someplace
nobody'll see us.
She looks at him a long beat. She doesn't need this
complication, this conflict, but she can't say no.
AUTUMN
God, why am I even considering this?
The song ends. Ray moves in to reclaim her.
RAY
(to Darnell)
All caught up on your arithmetic?
Darnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove.
DARNELL
Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12
carries.
Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by
Joe and Bud Lite, step between them. Darnell shrugs them off
and leaves the party.
JOE
(to Bud Lite)
Just what we need, a little team
unity.
Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio.
RAY
I'm gettin' a little sick of this
asshole, Autumn. I don't like you
hangin' out with him. It's
embarrassing.
AUTUMN
I don't hang out with him. I tutor
him.
RAY
Then have him get another tutor.
AUTUMN
I can't do that. I made a commitment
to help him pass his qualifying exam.
I can't bail out on him now.
RAY
What the hell difference does it
makes? They'll grease him through no
matter what he does. Nobody's ever
gonna see his graduation. Don't tell
me you're falling for this guy. He's
just another gang-banger with speed.
AUTUMN
I just said I wanted to help him.
What are you more afraid of, losing
your girl or your position?
RAY
Maybe you oughta think about what
you're in danger of losing.
AUTUMN
Maybe I will.
Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party
too.
The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few
of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's
knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in
thought.
JOE
Maybe she's out with some guy.
BUD
Who? Camille? I don't think she's
the type to screw around on ya. Shoot
ya, maybe...
JOE
It wouldn't be screwing around. It's
not like we're going together.
Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table
across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He
stares back at her. She doesn't blink.
Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around
the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There
are few other skaters at this hour.
DARNELL
Yes, I figure the key is to go places
only white people go. Next time we'll
go bowling.
Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating
it's closing time.
DARNELL
Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never
believed a guy who was supposed to
be an athlete would skate that bad,
but now I know.
They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble
over to a bench, begin to unlace.
AUTUMN
Thanks, that was fun, sort of.
DARNELL
You were pretty good for the first
time.
AUTUMN
Well, it's not really my first time.
My dad took me skating once.
DARNELL
He used to play ball for E.S.U.,
didn't he?
AUTUMN
Yeah, how'd you know that?
DARNELL
I saw his picture on the Wall of
Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you
didn't get his thighs.
She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to
kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips.
DARNELL
Make sure you mean it this time.
She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall
into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone
in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go
out.
Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes.
Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes
out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his
waist. Both are surprised to see the other.
JOE
What are you doin' here?
CAMILLE
Couldn't sleep.
JOE
I was just sweatin' out some of the
beer.
Camille just nods. Long, silent pause.
JOE
I didn't go home with her. I thought
about it... but I didn't.
CAMILLE
You drink too much.
JOE
Yeh.
He turns, starts toward the door.
CAMILLE
Why didn't you?
JOE
Why didn't I what?
CAMILLE
Go home with her?
JOE
I don't know... I guess I figured
maybe there was somethin' goin' on
between you and me.
Camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then
gets off the bike and walks toward him.
CAMILLE
Then why'd you pick her up in the
first place?
JOE
I was drunk... I needed some company.
CAMILLE
(angry)
Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a
real far-ranging discussion with
Sheri.
JOE
I mean, ya know, physical company...
I was... I just needed to pounce on
somebody I guess.
Camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around
Joe's waist, leaving him naked.
CAMILLE
Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I
good enough to pounce on?
Camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's
totally thrown by this reaction in her.
JOE
Well, you're more conservative...
classier... you're not that kinda
girl...
She snaps the towel again, backing him against the training
table.
CAMILLE
(insulted)
How do you know? You've never slept
with me.
She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.
CAMILLE
What makes you think she's such a
great ride?
(climbing up on top
of him)
I'm prettier, my legs are longer...
(pulling down her
leotard)
I've got better tits.
(exasperated)
Why would you go to her, when you
have me?
JOE
I didn't know I had you.
CAMILLE
(softer, leaning close)
Well you do.
He looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his.
They fall into a long, white-hot kiss.
Joe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically.
Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top.
CAMILLE
(between kisses)
You shoulda looked for me at the
library, or don't you ever go there?
JOE
(rolling back on top)
I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political
Science. I just don't go there on
Saturday nights.
CAMILLE
(rolling back on top
again)
I have a paper due Monday. What'de
she do? Sit on your lap or just give
you the nail-me stare?
JOE
Shut up, Camille.
Joe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them
off the table and out of sight.
Some 100 students are taking a history test in blue books. A
T.A., checking attendance, walks up to Louanne. She's uneasy
as the T.A. checks his chart.
T.A.
What's your name?
LOUANNE
Bobby Collins.
T.A.
Can I see your I.D.?
Louanne knows she's in deep trouble.
A high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to
run simultaneous views of different positions during the
same play. A grim-looking group of assistant coaches
approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the
images on the screen.
CLAYTON
Coach, we, ah... got a problem with
Bobby Collins.
WINTERS
Yeh...
CLAYTON
He talked... a friend... into taking
a test for him and got caught. They
had a new T.A. in there...
WINTERS
What's the penalty?
CLAYTON
Well, the rules say automatic
expulsion for both of them.
WINTERS
Fortunately, we've got friends on
the Board of Regents. I think we can
beat this if we really go to bat for
him. We got Mack off when he turned
in that other guys term paper.
(shaking his head)
But what kinda idiot would do
something like that?
CLAYTON
Well, I guess Bobby figured he was
gonna flunk...
WINTERS
I don't mean Bobby. I mean what kinda
guy would be dumb enough to take a
test for him?
CLAYTON
Uh, well... it wasn't a guy.
WINTERS
A girl? Typical Collins. He must
have banged her until she couldn't
think straight. Who was it?
CLAYTON
(barely able to get
it out)
It was... Louanne.
Winters' face goes dead.
Winters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne.
WINTERS
Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so
stupid?
LOUANNE
I... he was behind, he needed help.
I'm sorry. I just...
WINTERS
Sorry! You're sorry! You've destroyed
my credibility at the University, my
authority with the players... Christ,
it looks like I'm running a dirty
program. And Collins of all people!
What the hell's the matter with you,
Louanne?
LOUANNE
(crying)
I don't know... I thought he... loved
me...
WINTERS
Loved you? He loves anything that
winks back, the little rat bastard.
And what are you gonna do for school
now? I use my influence to get you
back in, it'll stink to high hell.
The press'll crucify me.
LOUANNE
I'll get in someplace.
WINTERS
God, Louanne, I told you to stay
away from my players. That was my
cardinal rule, stay away from the
damn players...
LOUANNE
They've always been good enough for
you. Good enough to devote your life
to. Why aren't they good enough for
me? Or are they too good?
WINTERS
You're changing the subject, Louanne.
We're talkin' about you breakin' the
rules.
LOUANNE
Didn't you ever break the rules just
a little? Didn't you tell me once
that 90 per cent of the schools obey
the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per
cent go to bowl games? Was that just
a joke?
She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his
eyes and slumps down on the couch.
Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms
in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected
test down in front of him.
AUTUMN
You seen this? You got a D on your
math test.
DARNELL
Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had
some trouble on this last part...
AUTUMN
We went over that last week, Darnell.
What is this time we spend in here?
Just a joke to you? I don't even
think you've been listening to me.
DARNELL
I've been listening to you, baby...
AUTUMN
Don't call me baby. I thought you
wanted to learn. But if all you wanta
do is fake your way through, then
get another tutor to waste time with.
DARNELL
C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good
time, and now you're gettin' all
nuts behind this. It's just one test.
AUTUMN
So far, it's the only test. I want
you to study this whole chapter. By
yourself, without me here. When I
come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready
to do problems based on it.
DARNELL
Whatever you say, Teach.
(big grin)
I don't wish to be cast in a
pejorative light, so I'm dedicating
myself to achieving on a level more
commensurate with my abilities.
She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He
looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's
embarrassed and deeply worried.
The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's
strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a
BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately
the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.
BUD LITE
Coach'd probably shoot ya lower.
Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is
Coach Winters.
He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding
his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to
hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at
Bobby a beat, then.
WINTERS
You all played a fine game on
Saturday. Take the day off.
With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain
silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.
Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs
and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her
things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs
her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek.
Hits the floor.
Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters
doesn't invite him to sit.
BOBBY
Listen, Coach, I just want you to
know I'm really sorry about this
whole thing with Louanne. I was real
glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to
junior college here...
WINTERS
(cutting him off)
Shut up.
Bobby does. Instantly.
WINTERS
I could easily take your case to the
Board of Regents. You've had no prior
infractions and I could argue that
you were under abnormal pressure.
(pause)
But I won't. You embarrassed me, you
embarrassed my family, you embarrassed
the program. As of now, you are no
longer a member of this university
or it's football team. Clean out
your locker.
Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief.
There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally,
dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.
Joe is being interviewed by DALLAS PERRY on a local television
show.
JOE (V.O.)
The hype on T.V., tryin' to get
somethin' goin...
Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone. A video
spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape.
BRAVER (V.O.)
It makes you seem a little nervous.
Like the pressure might be getting
to you.
Steve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium
behind him.
ZABRISKIE
Well, it was everything we expected
it to be. Fine performances on both
sides of the field.
Players undress and shower in relative silence. No joy here.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
The edge in the much ballyhooed battle
of the quarterbacks would probably
have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen
who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran
for another. Joe Kane accounted for
three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had
that crucial interception in the
waning moments. And that proved to
be the difference.
The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters
enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead
against the wall, the water coursing over him.
The post-game party. Not as raucous as after the opening
game victory. A few players are dancing, but most are sitting,
drinking, commiserating.
BUD LITE
(to Alvin)
Anybody seen Joe?
ALVIN
Not yet. Probably out with Camille.
Haven't seen Darnell either.
Lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named LESLIE.
They're kissing softly, light necking. Lattimer starts to
unbutton her blouse. She begins to demur.
LESLIE
I think we better get back downstairs.
LATTIMER
No, Leslie, we're just getting to
know each other.
LESLIE
(starting to get up)
No, I think...
Lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed.
She's starting to get a little scared.
LATTIMER
C'mon Leslie, you didn't come up
here to stop now.
He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for
the door. Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs
her again, throws her violently on the bed. She screams.
LATTIMER
What were you doin'? Leadin' me on?
He gets on the bed, kneels above her. She starts to struggle.
He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked,
she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her
around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her
some more, throws her to the floor. Picks her up again, when
suddenly the door BURSTS OPEN and Bud Lite and Alvin race
in.
LATTIMER
(throwing Leslie on
the bed again)
Get outa here!
Bud Lite and Alvin charge Lattimer, try to wrestle him down,
but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull. Two
other players charge in and finally all four are able to
shackle Lattimer. He continues to struggle a bit, then gives
up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.
BUD
This is it, man. No more 'roids.
This shit has gotta stop.
Lattimer breaks down and cries.
Joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca-cola.
He stares at the larger than life cardboard stand-up of
himself. He takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket.
The phone rings. He looks at it a beat, then walks out of
the room.
Camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling Joe. She
listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.
Winters sits at the main console replaying the game-ending
interception over and over. The phone rings.
WINTERS
Hello, yeh... What?!
The rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on
in Winters' office. All the assistant coaches are there.
CLAYTON
It looks like this will blow over.
The girl's father is a big booster,
contributed a lotta money. So he
said they won't go to the press.
WINTERS
He said that? The father?
CLAYTON
Yeh, he's not exactly happy about
all this, but he doesn't wanta hurt
the program.
WINTERS
We're still gonna have to suspend
Lattimer.
HUMES
What for? There aren't any charges.
Nobody outside the program knows
about this.
WINTERS
He's outa control, Lyle. We can't
ignore this anymore. I don't know
what pisses me off more -- that he's
juicin' or that he's doin' such a
shitty job of hidin' it.
HUMES
He's never tested positive. If we
suspend him without proof, he could
sue us for jeopardizing his draft
status, his pro career.
WINTERS
Yeh, but we can't sit and wait till
he kills somebody. I hate to lose
him as much as you do, but we gotta
clean him up before he does somethin'
that lands the whole program on
probation. Plus, we have to take
some action or the girl's dad is
gonna start havin' second thoughts.
I don't care how many checks he's
written.
CLAYTON
So what do we do?
All eyes go to Winters.
WINTERS
Bring him down here.
Close on a contrite, but shaken Steve Lattimer.
LATTIMER
Three games? Why so many?
WINTERS
You oughta be grateful I didn't
suspend you for the whole year.
Lattimer nods, he knows it's true.
LATTIMER
What are you gonna give as the reason?
WINTERS
We'll say you've got a hamstring
pull.
LATTIMER
(relieved)
Thank you, Coach.
WINTERS
Don't thank me. During those three
weeks, you better kick the roids,
cause when you come back I'm gonna
personally test you before every
game. No N.C.A.A. shit either. I'm
gonna watch the piss go into the
bottle. You got that?
LATTIMER
(barely audible, shamed)
Yes, sir.
WINTERS
Start practicing your limp.
Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back,
with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are
down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of
TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS.
JOE
Coupla real college heroes, huh?
Tearin' up the town.
DARNELL
First time I ever lost a girl and a
game on the same day. Guess I never
really had the girl.
Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving
him the once over and a little smile. Joe smiles back, not
really interested. Debbie's BOYFRIEND notices.
BOYFRIEND
You know that guy?
DEBBI
Not really...
BOYFRIEND
Then why you smilin' at him?
DEBBI
I don't know... he looks like that
E.S.U. quarterback guy. Joe, what's
his name?
BOYFRIEND
So what? So you go and smile at him?
The boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to
Joe's table.
BOYFRIEND
You been lookin' at my girlfriend?
JOE
(a little drunk himself)
I don't know. Which one is she?
BOYFRIEND
Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime
quarterback. The one who choked his
ass off today. You got nothin' better
to do then look at my girlfriend?
Joe says nothing.
BOYFRIEND
Hey, Heisman, I'm talkin' to you.
You too good to talk to me?
JOE
I'm not even interested in talkin'
to you.
BOYFRIEND
You think you're a bad ass? You think
my girl's hot for you? Take your
pads off, you're just another pussy.
Joe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him
away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone
as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the
boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the
floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in
his shoulder.
DARNELL
(grabbing him)
C'mon we gotta get outa here.
Joe's driving, Darnell's holding on. Suddenly we hear SIRENS.
Joe sees flashing lights in the rear-view mirror.
JOE
Oh shit...
Winters is asleep. The phone rings. He picks it up.
WINTERS
What is it now?... Oh Jesus...
Joe sits across the desk from Winters, just the two of them.
JOE
The guy went for me first. What was
I supposed to do?
WINTERS
Doesn't make any difference. It made
the papers, all the wire services.
The guy had to go to the hospital.
Worst of all they got you on drunk
driving. You had a blood alcohol
level .50 above the legal limit. We
can't smooth that over, Joe. It'd
look like we were sprayin' Pledge on
bird shit. We had to agree to send
you to Rehab.
JOE
Rehab? I'll be a god-damn joke. You
can't do this to me.
WINTERS
It was the only way we could get
them to drop the assault and D.W.I.
You go to trial on those, we lose
you for a year, and risk NCAA
investigation. C'mon, lotsa athletes
have been through Rehab.
JOE
Not in the middle of the season. Not
in the middle of a Heisman campaign.
WINTERS
You'll only miss four games. You'll
be back in time for the last one,
Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get
there. Plus, you've still got your
senior year.
JOE
Yeh, but what will I come back as?
What kinda player?
WINTERS
Don't worry, you'll still be the
Man. You'll still be the leader of
this team.
Joe doesn't believe it, but he manages a nod, as he gets up
to leave.
JOE
I'm sorry, Coach.
WINTERS
These things happen.
Joe walks on out, Winters watches him go, then slams the
desk in anger. Drained, he sinks back in his chair.
WINTERS
Fuckin' kids.
Joe finishes packing his bags. He sees a picture of Camille
on the dresser. Picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in
the trash. He carries his Heisman cardboard standup into the
shower, pulls out a match and lights it. He watches it catch
fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. We
hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile.
Joe is shown into his room. Bare. One cot. One dresser. He
drops his bag, sags onto the bed.
ALVIN (V.O.)
Four fuckin' weeks?
A tired and depressed group of E.S.U. football players undress
after practice. Bud and Alvin sit in their pads, Lattimer
standing in street clothes. Bud softly sings "Don't Cry For
Me Argentina."
ALVIN
Shit, the defense is gonna have to
pitch shutouts now...
(to Lattimer)
and you're gone for 3. What the hell
did you take that shit for?
LATTIMER
Nobody seemed to mind when I was
knockin' people's dicks in the dirt.
ALVIN
I bust chops too. I don't have to
get all fucked up.
LATTIMER
Not everybody has the ability you
do, Alvin. You do what you have to
do to play.
ALVIN
Well, you're not playin' much now
are you? Shit, whole fuckin' season
down the drain.
The seven members of the BOARD OF REGENTS sit on one side of
a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle. On the
other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President
of the Faculty Senate, EDWARD LEARNIHAN, Academic Advisor,
ARTHUR SHANE, President of the Student Body, RICHARD FOWLER,
and Galen Howard. Fowler is addressing the board.
FOWLER
Therefore, I respectfully submit
that Bobby Collins should not be
given special treatment just because
he's a football player. Would a
regular student get a reinstatement
hearing if they'de been caught
cheating? Nobody's talking about
letting the girl who took the test
back in.
Winters could kill this kid.
LEARNIHAN
I think it's also instructive to
look at some of the courses this
young man has taken. Beginning Golf,
Voice and Speech Improvement...
SHANE
I'd like to point out that Mr. Collins
was still on schedule to get his
degree.
LEARNIHAN
(pointing to Collin's
transcript)
In what, Swimming Pool Management?
CHAIRMAN
Would you like to respond, Coach
Winters?
Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the
odious nature of what he has to do.
WINTERS
I don't know much about all this
other stuff, but I do know the
punishment should fit the crime.
Cheating's bad, but I don't think it
deserves a life sentence. Here's one
of those athletes who takes college
level courses, who wants to graduate.
I think Bobby Collins made a big
mistake, but he's already been
suspended for several weeks. He's
served his time. I think he deserves
a second chance.
LEARNIHAN
Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second
chance and since he's had 5
incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still
reads at a fourth grade level. You're
using his body to make money for the
Athletic Department -- you, yourself,
are making three times what the
Chancellor is -- but obviously no
one is making an effort to see that
this kid gets an education.
WINTERS
He's helpin' to pay for your physics
lab too. If you're willin' to go
without a new office, maybe I could
hold him out a few games. Save his
body.
CHAIRMAN
Gentlemen...
SHANE
Alvin was way behind in school when
he got here. You can't make up for,
in four years, what it took 18 to
create.
LEARNIHAN
Then he should never have been
admitted in the first place. It's
not fair to other students who worked
hard to get here.
HOWARD
Is it fair to exclude kids who come
from inferior schools? You hold
everybody to the same standards,
you're discriminating against the
poor kids.
WINTERS
Most of my players are farm boys,
inner-city kids. Football is their
deliverance.
LEARNIHAN
Deliverance from what? A valid
education?
WINTERS
You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin
out, you take away their futures. In
Alvin's case you probably cost him a
couple million dollars in the pros.
LEARNIHAN
But this is not a football vocational
school. It's an Institute of Higher
Learning.
WINTERS
Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000
people showed up to watch a kid do a
chemistry experiment?
CHAIRMAN
Gentlemen, please, let's get back to
the business at hand, Bobby Collins.
As you know, I played football here.
And I remember how hard it was to
practice and then study when you're
dead tired. So I have some sympathy
for this young man. But I never
cheated, so the real question is his
character. Since you know him better
than anyone else in this room; and
having talked to him and observed
him over the last several weeks, do
you feel he's learned his lesson? In
other words, can you vouch for his
character?
Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.
WINTERS
(it's killing him)
Yes, sir, I can.
Bobby Collins breaks into a wide, triumphant smile.
Bobby Collins walks in prior to practice. His teammates gather
round, slap him on the back, high five etc. Winters watches
from his office, disgusted.
Coach Winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his
upcoming opponent -- it's like he's looking through it though,
his mind elsewhere, something boiling up inside him. Suddenly,
he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces.
His hand bleeds. He doesn't care. He just sits there and
seethes.
Camille's on the phone.
CAMILLE
Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer.
I'd like to speak to Joe Kane.
Joe is aimlessly flipping cards toward a wastebasket. A NURSE
knocks on his door.
NURSE
You've got a phone call. A Camille
Schaeffer.
Joe says nothing, not wanting to deal with this.
NURSE
She says she's your girlfriend
JOE
I don't want to talk to her.
NURSE
You sure?
JOE
Yeh.
The nurse leaves. Joe gets up, goes to the wall, and starts
pounding it with his right hand.
NURSE (V.O.)
I'm sorry, he doesn't wish to speak
to you right now.
Crushed and angry, Camille hangs up.
Bud Lite is watching television. Louanne enters on her way
to Bobby Collins' room, carrying an armload of neatly-pressed
laundry. But Lite gets up to bar her way.
BUD
Hey, Louanne, how ya' doin?
LOUANNE
Fine, Bud, ya know. Goin to J.C.,
hopin' to get back in here next year.
Just came by to give Bobby some
laundry I did for him.
BUD
You two seein' each other again?
LOUANNE
Yeh, he was even talking about us
gettin' a place off campus together,
until he got reinstated. I don't
know how I woulda told my dad.
Bud just nods blankly. Louanne starts to head for Bobby's
room.
BUD
Ah, Louanne...
(pained to say it)
I wouldn't go in there right now.
LOUANNE
Why not?
Bud doesn't have the heart to tell her. She finally realizes
Bobby's with another girl.
LOUANNE
Ah. Guess I'm pretty stupid when it
comes to men. I never learn, do I?
BUD
I think maybe men are just stupid
when it comes to you. If you ever
feel like, ya know, just talkin'
sometime, gettin' a beer -- let me
know. My schedule's pretty open.
LOUANNE
Thanks, Bud
(handing him the
clothes)
Give him these, will ya?
Bud nods. Louanne, fighting back tears, walks back down the
hall with as much dignity as she can muster.
Winters comes to the door, hesitates, walks in and finds Joe
huddled on his bed. Shivering.
WINTERS
Get up. I wanta talk to you.
Joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up.
WINTERS
Don't sit up. Stand up. If you can.
Joe gets unsteadily to his feet. He feels sick. Winters
reaches out to shake hands. Joe does not reciprocate. Hides
his right hand behind his body.
WINTERS
What's the matter, Joe? You won't
shake hands with me.
(Joe is silent)
You don't want me to see your hand,
do you?
(more silence)
So I guess what I heard was true,
huh? You been poundin' the walls
with your passin' hand, right?
(silence)
I tell you what, Joe, you want to
hit somethin', hit me.
Joe doesn't move.
WINTERS
I said hit me. I'm the one who put
you in here. Don't hit the damn wall.
It ain't the wall's fault. Hit me!
Go on, hit me right now!
Joe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it.
WINTERS
Who else you wanta hit, huh? you're
daddy maybe? Cause he's a no-show
prick? Well, I'm a daddy, too, and
not a very good one at that. So just
hit me instead! I'll take your daddy's
beatin' for him. Go on, you want to.
Hit me, damnit!
Joe shakes his head.
WINTERS
(pushes Joe in the
chest)
Hit me! I'm not gonna leave you alone
until you hit me.
(shakes Joe by
shoulders)
The guys'll thank you. They've always
wanted to do it. So do it now, damnit!
Do it!
Joe sinks to his knees. Winters stares down at him, then
kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away.
WINTERS
O.K., Joe, it's o.k. I guess I need
it more than you do.
(pause)
You gotta quit beatin' up on yourself.
Let me see that hand.
Joe reveals his hand. It's barked and cut, but not badly
swollen.
WINTERS
It's o.k.
(playfully)
You can still throw with it, you
fuckin' mook.
(pause)
Look, the nurses say this is the
toughest time for you right now. I
thought I'd stick around a little,
case you wanta play some cards, pick
a fight with the wall again,
whatever...
JOE
You don't have to.
WINTERS
Yes I do.
Lattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia. He
carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into
his toilet. Syringes, vials and bottles of pills all tumble
into the water. He flushes.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sun shines through the window. Joe wakes up, raises up,
looks over at Winters who is asleep in a chair. Winters
rouses. Joe gives him a little smile, he's allright. Winters
gives him a nod of approval.
MUSIC UP. BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS
detailing the Timberwolves progress over the next four games.
ON FIELD
1) Players shaking hands at midfield after the game. The
scoreboard reads E.S.U. 14 Boston College 10.
2) Darnell in study hall, with his new tutor concentrating
on her explanation, applying himself.
ON SIDELINE - DAY
3) Steve Lattimer, in street clothes, paces the sidelines,
jumping up and down in frustration, his hamstring bandaged
to sell the injury ruse. He catches himself, gets back on
his crutches. A newspaper fades up through the shot. It reads
"Wolves Offense Fires Blanks in 13-0 Loss to Texas."
4) Darnell sits in a cafe, drinking coffee and studying. Ray
comes in, his arm around a co-ed, MONICA. They buy a pastry
and leave, not having seen Darnell. Darnell ponders this a
second, goes back to studying.
5) A group of patients is gathered around a T.V. set in the
Rehab Center, watching a pre-game show. One goes to Joe's
room, where Joe's lying on his cot.
PATIENT
Hey, Joe, don't you wanta watch the
game? It's on cable.
JOE
No thanks.
Joe leans back, staring at the ceiling.
ON T.V. SCREEN
6) Sportscaster DALLAS PERRY is holding forth on the local
evening news.
PERRY
E.S.U. on the strength of a 62 yard
touchdown run by freshman Darnell
Jefferson, squeaked by the North
Carolina Tarheels today, 14 to 13,
keeping their bowl hopes alive.
8) Darnell, alone in the library, late at night, studying.
9) Lattimer, carrying his gear bag, walks into the locker
room. His teammates come over to shake his hand, slap him on
the back, welcome him back to the team.
MUSIC ENDS
Joe sits on his bed listening to the E.S.U. broadcast.
HARVEY (V.O.)
E.S.U. hoping to get past a tough
Iowa Hawkeyes team in their last
game before the return of star
quarterback, Joe Kane.
We move in on Joe's face, as Harvey is heard on the radio in
the b.g.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Oh, boy, this does not look good,
Harmon. They're bringing the
stretchers out...
Joe's eyes close. He knows what this means.
Coach Winters faces the press.
REPORTER
Why do your teams seem to nose dive
at the end of the last couple seasons?
COACH WINTERS
This was a tough loss, but this ain't
any nose dive. We've had some key
players out, but if we win next week,
we'll still win the conference and
go to a major bowl on New Year's
Day. I mean, I know you guys can't
write, but I thought you could at
least count.
Alvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated. He's
still a little groggy from anesthetic. Coach Winters stands
beside him.
WINTERS
You look good, Alvin.
ALVIN
Yeh, I feel o.k.
WINTERS
Any of the guys been down yet?
ALVIN
They called.
WINTERS
Hell, you know how football players
are about hospitals and injuries.
ALVIN
Yeh.
Several beats of silence. Then:
ALVIN
I'm never gonna play again, am I?
WINTERS
Doctors aren't always right, Alvin...
but I just want you to know... you're
the best defensive football player I
ever coached.
Alvin nods. Winters comes forward, hugs him around the head,
gives him a smile, walks out. Tears brim in Winters eyes as
he leaves. Alvin's head goes back against the pillow. Tears
aren't brimming here. They're rolling down his cheeks.
MUSIC BEGINS
WINTERS
I know you had a difficult time.
Michigan is easy, right? Bourbon is
tough.
JOE
Scotch.
They share a laugh. Winters pulls out two sets of round trip
airline tickets.
WINTERS
I got somethin' for ya. Coupla round
trip tickets. Go see your dad. Get
it cleaned up.
Joe takes the tickets, just looks at him.
LATTIMER
(on the phone)
I'm gonna have to take a test with
the coach right there. You sure you
got somethin' better than blockers?
DEALER (V.O.)
Much better. This guy is foolproof.
See ya Saturday.
Lattimer hangs up, picks up a HYPODERMIC. Stares at it a
second, sweat beading on his forehead. Then plunges it an
inch deep into his thigh. Pulls it out, sits on the bed a
beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously,
biceps bulging.
MUSIC ENDS
The coach is facing Ray and Darnell across his desk.
WINTERS
I wanta do something different for
this game. Try to maximize our speed,
but keep you both in the lineup at
the same time. Ray, I'm moving you
to fullback. Darnell, you're startin'
at tail.
Ray is stunned, Darnell elated, but neither says a word.
WINTERS
Ray, you'll be carrying the ball
less and blocking more, but they'll
still have to respect your running
and pass-catching ability. Not
everybody can make a transition like
this. You think you can handle it?
RAY
(tight lipped)
Yes, sir.
WINTERS
Good. We can't afford any hang dogs.
Darnell is up late again, studying at one of the tables. He
hears footsteps, becomes aware of the presence of another
person. He looks up to see Autumn.
DARNELL
Hey, Autumn. How's Ray?
AUTUMN
Don't know. Haven't seen him since
the night I saw you. He'd been goin'
out.
DARNELL
Monica Lambert.
AUTUMN
You knew? Why didn't you tell me?
DARNELL
Didn't wanta win you over that way.
Silence. Darnell looks back at his books.
AUTUMN
I just wondered how your studying
was comin'. You ready for tomorrow?
DARNELL
The test? I hope so. I been workin'
pretty hard.
AUTUMN
Good...
(sitting down)
I talked to my dad last night.
DARNELL
Oh, yeah? How's he doin?
AUTUMN
Fine. We talked about you.
DARNELL
What did you say?
AUTUMN
(eyes brimming)
I told him I'd gone out with you...
I told him I wished I could still go
bowling.
Darnell gets up and pulls her to her feet. He hugs her.
MUSIC BEGINS
Darnell is bent over his test booklet. He writes furiously,
stops to think, starts writing again.
Lattimer lies on a table, a CATHETER TUBE going into his
side. A DOCTOR'S AIDE supervises. Lattimer's dealer is there.
LATTIMER
What's this doin?
DEALER
Takin' doped urine outa your bladder
and puttin clean back in. Call it an
oil change.
Coach Winters watches unknowingly as Lattimer pees the
catheterized urine into a cup.
MUSIC ENDS
The team is gathered around. Conspicuous among them is
Lattimer, who's painted his face like a skeleton. Coach
Winters is whipping them up with a pre-game rant.
WINTERS
Gotta get it done today, boys. Gotta
ring that bell. 60 minutes. 60 minutes
of mean. No prisoners. No mercy.
Nothin' but snot bubbles. Gotta ring
that bell, gotta ring that
Championship bell.
LATTIMER
(shouting)
Ding Motherfucking Dong!!
Pumped to the gills, the E.S.U. team explodes in yells and
races out into the tunnel. The YELLING continues OVER and
mixes with the CHEERING OF THE CROWD as:
Alvin sits alone in the "living room", listening to the E.S.U.
game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate. His
mother mends a pair of jeans in the b.g.
HARVEY (V.O.)
So the Wolves defense has held after
the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets
will opt for the field goal. Around
a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away,
it's long enough. And good! Georgia
Tech jumps out on top 3-0.
Alvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from
Alvin. There's none.
A discouraged bunch of E.S.U. players drag into the locker
room. Some swear, some bang their lockers.
LATTIMER
C'mon guys, we're only down ten.
Let's get our fuckin' shit together.
Darnell marches over to Ray's locker.
DARNELL
You missed that block on purpose,
didn't you, asshole.
RAY
You're full of shit. You fumble, you
try to blame me.
DARNELL
It's Autumn isn't it? That's what
this is all about.
RAY
The hell with Autumn. You just can't
take a hit.
Infuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging.
Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging,
trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several
players manage to pull them apart. Coach Winters charges
over.
WINTERS
Don't tell me who started it. I don't
care. All I care about is this
football team. We win together. We
lose together. So whatever your
problem is, get over it. I don't
want any more of this shit.
Understand?
DARNELL AND RAY
Yes, sir.
WINTERS
As for the rest of you guys. Here's
what I think of the way you played.
Winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange
Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating
a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The
players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this.
WINTERS
(pointing toward the
Yellow Jackets' locker
room)
They're laughin' at you over there.
Makin' plans for the evening. They
never dreamed it'd be this easy. You
guys are nothin' but bugs splattered
on their windshield. You better stock
up on potato chips, 'cause you're
gonna be watching a lotta T.V. on
New Years Day.
Winters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate
their mistakes. Winters goes over to Joe.
WINTERS
Get warm, Joe. You're startin' the
second half.
Joe nods, excited but uncertain. Winters moves on to Ray
Griffen.
WINTERS
By the way... don't let me see you
miss anymore blocks.
ALVIN
(softly to himself)
All right, defense. Let's get evil.
Kill 'em all, let the paramedics
sort 'em out.
Joe brings the Wolves up.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35. 17
seconds left. Kane barking signals.
Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away
from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he
fires a bullet down the sideline. Ray Griffen catches it and
goes out of bounds at the twelve.
ANGLE ON SIDELINE
Joe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more
time outs, as the refs move the chains.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Field goal here ties it, but a tie
may not get the Wolves into a bowl.
Tough decision for Winters.
WINTERS
(to Joe)
You want me to send in the kicking
team or you think you can handle it?
JOE
Give me the ball.
WINTERS
O.K., let's do 24 inside slot, left
blue lightning.
ON FIELD
Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as
the crowd's roar goes off the charts.
JOE
(in huddle)
O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue
lightning. Let's put the women and
children to bed, and go lookin' for
fuckin' dinner. On 2.
He starts the wolf howl. The others join in, howling for all
they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break
the huddle.
The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the
Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at
the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.
JOE
This one's for you, Dad.
Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi." We
go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.
The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing
everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks
up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player.
Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher
breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime
as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble
up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.
Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern
and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one
tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back
for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between
defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen,
Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open
space that Darnell is heading for.
The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker.
Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close
on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral.
Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes
between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch,
landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls
over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This
time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.
ANGLE ON STANDS
Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes
crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost
wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing
none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob
Darnell.
Alvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches
off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be
a part of again. We leave him staring off into an uncertain
future.
The Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory,
congratulating each other. Conspicuous among them are the
Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman
of the Board of Regents.
CHAIRMAN
Looks like the Timberwolves are back.
Probably brought the library with
them.
CHANCELLOR
Hope so.
(turning to Galen
Howard)
Give my sincere congratulations to
Coach Winters.
HOWARD
He'll be delighted.
The Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund
football field and starts advancing the ball.
FAT CAT ALUMNUS
15,10, touchdown!
This brings applause all around.
