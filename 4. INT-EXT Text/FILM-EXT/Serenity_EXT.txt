It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.
GIRL
Now that the war's over, our
soldiers get to come home, yes?
TEACHER
Some of them. Some will be
stationed on the rim planets as
Peace Enforcers.
BOY
I don't understand. Why were the
Independents even fighting us?
Why wouldn't they look to be more
civilized?
TEACHER
That's a good question. Does
anybody want to open on that?
GIRL
I hear they're cannibals.
ANOTHER BOY
That's only Reavers.
ANOTHER GIRL
Reavers aren't real.
ANOTHER BOY
Full well they are. They attack
settlers from space, they kill
them and wear their skins and rape
them for hours and hours --
TEACHER
(in Chinese)
(CALMER)
It's true that there are...
dangers on the outer planets. So
let's follow up on Borodin's
question. With all the social and
medical advancements we can bring
to the Independents, why would
they fight so hard against us?

3.
RIVER
We meddle.
TEACHER
River?
RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
a good two years younger than the other kids.
RIVER
People don't like to be meddled
with. We tell them what to do,
what to think, don't run don't
walk we're in their homes and in
their heads and we haven't the
right. We're meddlesome.
TEACHER
(gently taking her
STYLUS)
River, we're not telling people
what to think. We're just trying
to show them how.
She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead
It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.
V0
7.
ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.
SIMON
Get on!
He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
holding one of the cables --
THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)
Stop.
The action freezes.
THE OPERATIVE (0.S.)
(CONTINUING)
Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.
The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon
and River on the gurney just before it rises.
f t o
THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)
(CONTINUING)
Stop.
There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
wear. He is in:
We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
flying past the window.
Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens.
We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.
The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:
JAYNE
What are we hoping to find here
that equals the worth of a turd?
MAL
Alliance payroll. There's peace
enforcing squads stationed all
about this quadrant. Can't use
credits out here -- they got to
pay their boys in cashy money.
Which once a month rests here.
ZOE
Something about stealing from the
Alliance just warms a body like
whiskey in winter.
JAYNE
(cocks his gun)
Shiny. Let's be badguys.
Mal turns back to River.
MAL
You ready to go to work, darlin'?
RIVER
There's no pattern to the pebbles
here, they're completely random.
I tried to count them but you
drove too fast. Hummingbird.
MAL
(never mind)
Right. Great. Let's go.
A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
looking at the trading station a few buildings away.
SON
Repeater.
WOMAN
Did sound summat like gunblast...
Maybe you aught run tell Lawman...
She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man.
Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His
clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness.
A blade blurs through frame...
26.
The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --
MAL
Zoe take the wheel --
JAYNE
You see 'em? Anybody see 'em?
1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.
YOUNG MAN
Take me with you!
MAL
Get in the vault with the others --
YOUNG MAN
I can't stay here! Please!
MAL
It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
pure. It disappears over the rooftops.
YOUNG MAN
PLEASE!
28.
MAL
Drive!
Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
chest, slumps down dead.
ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
right abreast of our gang.
ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
to swarm into it.
The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.
JAYNE
How come they ain't blowing us out
of the air?
MAL
They wanna run us down. The up-
close kill.
River is squashed down on her back, being very small.
RIVER
They want us alive when they eat
us.
JAYNE
Boy, sure would be nice if we had
some grenades, don'tchya think?
Mal says nothing, keeps firing.
ZOE
Wash, baby can you hear me?
VO
29.
ZOE
Reavers.
WASH
(BLANCHING)
ZOE
We're not gonna reach you in time.
WASH
Just keep moving, honey. We're
coming to you.
As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others.
Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the
air from the skiff and S} NK! Goes through Jayne's leg.. The
harpoon grips the leg and pulls --
Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing
him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter --
MAL
Grab on!
Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the
two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.
JAYNE
I won't get et! You shoot me if
they take me!
Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne --
JAYNE
(CONTINUING)
Well don't shoot me first!
J
30.
Mal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more...
The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot.
V0V
The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal
hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room.
JAYNE
(CONTINUING)
Rutting pigs! Where's --
And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it.
Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off
it than the smaller crafts.
WASH
(to Zoe)
Get some distance on 'em. You come
to the flats, I want you to swing
round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.
The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks.
WASH (O.S.)
(in Zoe's ear)
Okay, baby, we've talked this
through...
ZOE
Talkin' ain't doin'.
She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about,
fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff.
WASH (O.S.)
Don't slow down!
31.
ANGLE: THE SKIFF
As it heads for the mule --
ANGLE: THE MULE
As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The
Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --
Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
oncoming skiff, tearing it apart --
Inara looks out at the mountains. The space she's in
resembles a Tibetan monastery, if slightly more opulent.
Widen to see she is with SHEYDRA, a somewhat older Companion,
the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink.
SHEYDRA
The girls. They've learned more
from you these last months than
the rest of us could show them in
two years.
INARA
They're very sweet. But they're
not Companions.
SHEYDRA
(WRYLY)
You've no hope for them? Junk the
lot, start anew?
J
38.
INARA
On Sihnon we started training at
twelve. Years of discipline and
preparation before the physical
act of pleasure was even
mentioned. Most of these girls --
SHEYDRA
They're all of good family, the
highest academic standards --
INARA
Control. Was the first lesson.
And the last and these worlds are
not like the Central Planets.
There is barbarism dressed up in
the most civil weeds. Men of the
highest rank who don't know the
difference between a Companion and
a common whore. It's unsafe.
SHEYDRA
All the more reason the girls look
to you. You came out here alone,
before the Alliance ever thought
to establish a House this remote.
You've seen so much. You're a
figure of great romance to them.
4d INARA
Great romance has nothing to do
with being a Companion, Sheydra.
You should know better.
SHEYDRA
I'm not the one who had a torrid
affair with a pirate.
Inara nearly spills her drink.
INARA
A who? With a what?
SHEYDRA
(SMILING)
It's the talk of the House. The
girls all trade stories in the
dorms at night.
INARA
I didn't... have a pirate...
J
39.
SHEYDRA
In one of the stories you make
love in a burning temple. I think
that's my favorite.
INARA
(SITTING)
This is unbearable. Captain
Reynolds is no pirate; he's a
petty thief. And he never laid a
finger on me. All he ever did was
rent me a shuttle and be very
annoying.
(mutters in Chinese)
SHEYDRA
A year on his shuttle and he never
laid a finger on you. No wonder
you left.
INARA
(BRIDLING)
I left because -- go away. We're
no longer friends. You're a
stranger to me now.
SHEYDRA
104 I do love to watch you boil.
Don't worry. The stories will
fade. And your Captain Reynolds
has probably gotten himself blown
up by this time.
INARA
(looking away again)
Yes. That would be just like him.
Serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of
other, equally disreputable ships. The place is filled with
every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable.
The ramp is open and everyone is filing out, ready to hit the
town. Kaylee is talking to Simon, who has River in hand.
KAYLEE
Don't talk to the barkers -- only
the captains.
(MORE)
40.
KAYLEE (cont'd)
You look the captain in the eye,
know who you're dealing with.
40 SIMON
 I wish there was...
Since he doesn't know what to say, she rattles on:
KAYLEE
You shouldn't aughta be so clean.
It's a dead giveaway you don't
belong, you always gotta be tidy.
Don't pay anybody in advance. And
don't ride in anything with a
Capissen 38 engine, they fall
right out of the sky.
SIMON
Kaylee.
She turns and heads off. Simon starts in the other
direction, but River looks after her and the others.
SIMON
(CONTINUING)
River... do you want to stay with
them?
4 RIVER
It's not safe.
SIMON
No, I fear it's not safe anymore.
He's heading off and doesn't hear:
RIVER
For them.
We see two sleek warships glide silently into frame, followed
by a third, bigger ship. This is the operative's vessel, and
10 it is everything Serenity is not: sleek, predatory, icy cool.
The camera swoops in at a sparking ion cloud, then through
the cloud at a barren, metallic satellite moon. Then further
in to reveal a sprawling -- and completely empty --
communications complex. Giant satellite dishes everywhere.
We see the camp: a few shacks and a working mine, as our
group come down to it, greeted by a few miners, including an
eight year old boy that rushes to Kaylee...
ANGLE ON: A CANNON mounted at the edge of town. The guy
manning it sees them arrive, also goes to greet them.
Mal approaches Book on the edge of a rise overlooking the
town. Mal has a bowl and chopsticks. Book is finishing:
V0
BOOK
Forgive what you can, and send me
on my path. I will walk on, until
you bid me rest.
MAL
Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd.
BOOK
(lighting a cigar)
It's prayer for the dead.
MAL
Then I really hope it ain't for me.
BOOK
It's for the men River might have
killed in that bar.
MAL
Weren't River that did it, you
know that. Somebody decided her
brain was just another piece of
property to take, fenced it right
Vd up.
BOOK
You got a plan?
MAL
Hiding ain't a plan?
BOOK
It'll do you for a spell, and the
folks here'll be glad of the extra
coin...
MAL
.but they'll be coming.
Alliance is after this girl with
a powerful will. I look to hear
the tromp of their boots any
moment.
V0
59.
BOOK
You won't.
(off Mal's look)
This isn't a palms-up military
MW run, Mal. No reports broadwaved,
no warrants... much as they want
her, they want her hid. That
means Closed File. Means an
Operative, which is trouble you've
not known.
MAL
I coulda left her there.
BOOK
Not your way, Mal.
V0 MAL
I have a way?
(THINKS)
Is that better than a plan?
BOOK
You can play the thug all you
want, but there's more to you than
you're ever like to 'fess.
MAL
You just think that 'cause my eyes
is all sorrowful and pretty.
BOOK
Only one thing is gonna walk you
through this, Mal. Belief.
MAL
Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd.
I ain't looking for help from on
high. That's a long wait for a
train don't come.
1490
60.
BOOK
When I talk about belief, why do
you always assume I'm talking
about God?
W (Mal has no response)
They'll come at you sideways.
As he continues, we see:
Inara stands waiting, her back to us, in front of the very
vista we first saw her before.
The operative comes slowly up the staircase, stands before
her.
BOOK W. (V.0.)
It's how they think: sideways.
It's how they move. Sidle up and
smile, hit you where you're weak.
BOOK
Sorta man they're like to send
believes hard. Kills and never
asks why.
MAL
It's of interest to me how much
you seem to know about that world.
BOOK
I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.
MAL
Have to tell me about that some
time.
BOOK
(looking out)
No I don't.
He walks away, offering this:
BOOK
(CONTINUING)
Sideways.
Mal watches him go, thinking.

61.
The Teacher from the very beginning is standing in front of
River, whose desktop screen depicts a single, dark planet.
TEACHER
River?
Eight-year-old River is working away, not paying attention.
TEACHER
(CONTINUING)
River, you look tired. I think
everybody's a little tired by now;
why don't we all lie down.
River looks up, scared. All the other children wordlessly
get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them.
TEACHER
(CONTINUING)
A little peace and quiet will make
everything better.
She starts to lie down herself, right on the grass.
RIVER
No...
Vao TEACHER
River. Do as you're told. It's
going to be fine. Lie down.
RIVER
NO!
The ship moves gracefully over the mountains.
She is nestled in a gorge, overhanging rocks all but burying
her from view. The shuttle on the right lifts off from the
side of the ship and glides off, keeping low.
4
66.
A line of young trainees files by in robes and red shawls
pulled over their heads -- one trainee a good deal larger
than the others.
Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
the foursome.
CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
one by one, counting down --
ALLIANCE SOLDIER
Grenade!
Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
the last light goes out and nothing happens.
One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
door shuts on him and Inara.
The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out.
We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing, six
little objects floating out of her belly like roe.
4
73.
These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly
home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They
all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different
directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect
and burns away from us.
The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle-
holes in her head -- makes her way through them.
Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is
the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
in to one system, one planet...
She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:
The ship swings around a mountain to come into view of the
camp.
I s
82.
It is a world of fire.
Every building burns, some blown right apart. Bodies litter
the scene, not one of them moving. There's a grounded
Alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down.
The crew pours out even as the ramp lowers, going off in all
directions, calling out to people...
Kaylee heads for the burning church.
KAYLEE
Shepherd? Shepherd Book!
She stops, looking at the ground by the steeple. There is
the body on the ground, face down. The child she played with
at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first uncomprehending.
ANGLE: MAL, moving in the other direction, approaches the
cannon, Jayne behind him. He stops and sees:
Book, lying by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down.
4 MAL
(to Jayne)
Get the Doc.
He moves to the Shepherd, grabs his searching hand.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Shepherd... Don't move.
BOOK
Won't go far...
MAL
Shouldn't've been you. I'm so
sorry, it was... they should've
hit us. They should've hit me.
BOOK
That crossed my mind.
(ROUGHS)
I shot him down --
MAL
I seen.
83.
BOOK
I killed the ship... that killed
us. Not... very Christian of me.
MAL
You did what's right.
BOOK
(not unkindly)
Coming from you, that means...
almost nothing... HNAAH! Ah, I'm
long gone...
MAL
Doc'll bring you round. I look to
be bored by many more sermons
'fore you slip -- don't move --
BOOK
Can't... order me around, boy.
I'm not one of your crew.
MAL
Yes you are.
Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal. Urgent, almost angry.
BOOK
You... it's on you now... all this
death, this shit... you have to
find a course. This can't mean
nothing. River... you have to...
MAL
Come on, keep it up --
Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something:
BOOK
I don't care what you believe!
Just... believe it. Whatever you
have to...
His breathing becomes laboured. Hitched.
Stopped. His hand slips away, his blood leaving a distinct
print on Mal's face.
Jayne and Simon run up,Simon slowing down -- going to the
e he's-dead.----Zne -a r.7-1, ;,,,r
them as Jayne looks around him, Mal still fixed on Book.
AD
84.
JAYNE
How come they ain't waiting? They
know'd we was coming, how come
they only sent one?
MO
Zoe realizes the answer, turns to Wash.
ZOE
Get on the Cortex. Wave the
Sanchez brothers, Li Shen --
anyone whose ever sheltered us
after a heist. Tell them to get
out. Get out now.
SMASH CUT TO:
Mal comes striding out, where the crew have been gathering
bodies, laying blankets over them.
MAL
Get these bodies together.
ZOE
We got time for gravedigging?
MAL
Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope
V0 'em together. Five or six of 'em.
I want them laid out on the nose
of our ship.
SIMON
Are you insane?
KAYLEE
What do you mean, the bodies...
MAL
Kaylee, I need you to muck the
reactor core, just enough to leave
a trail and make it read like
we're flying without containment,
not enough to fry us.
KAYLEE
These people are our friends --
MAL
Kaylee, you got a day's work to do
and two hours to do it.
(MORE)
14
87.
MAL (cont'd)
(turns from her)
Jayne, you and Wash hoist up that
cannon mount. Goes right on top.
MOO
Piece or two of the other ship,
stick it on. Any place you can
tear hull without inner breach, do
that too.
(looking around)
And we're gonna need paint. We're
gonna need red paint.
INARA
(getting it)
ZOE
Sir. Do you really mean to turn
our home into an abomination so we
can make a suicidal attempt at
passing through Reaver space?
MAL
I mean to live. I mean for us to
live. The Alliance won't have
that, so we go where they won't
follow.
JAYNE
V0 God's balls, there's no way we're
going out there!
And everybody (save River) is talking at once:
SIMON
What's the point of living if you
sink to the level of a savage --
WASH
INARA
Please, we should talk this over --
JAYNE
I ain't takin' orders from a man
has lost his brainstem --
, -Mal pule-s-his-
in his face, steps back, hand on his.
V0
88.
MAL
This is how it works. Anybody
doesn't wanna fly with me anymore,
this is your port of harbour.
There's a lot of fine ways to die.
I'm not waiting for the Alliance
to choose mine.
He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the
Alliance fighter. Struggling to get out is the badly wounded
pilot. He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender.
Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
I mean to confound those killers,
and take my shot at getting to
Miranda, maybe finding out what
all I'm dying for. That's my
theme now. So I hear a word out
of any of you that ain't helping
me out or taking your leave I will
fucking shoot you.
He grabs a body -- drops it at Zoe's feet as he heads toward
the ship.
MAL
(CONTINUING)
Get to work.
CLOSE ON THE BODIES as they BURN, flames passing over them
and suddenly flickering out as dark falls. They are patches
of leathered flesh stretched over bone -- monsters, screaming
soundlessly in the nothing of space.
We arm past them to the windows of the bridge, looking in at
Mal, watching, with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm.
And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the
first time: It is hardly recognizable. Charred corpses on
the nose, Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped
within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint... the
trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor.
It looks, for all the world, like a Reaver ship.
Serenity flies, silent.
Reverse to see: an armada.
The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a
vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them.
Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly
about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.
And arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships.
Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship. It turns, as
though watching her. But lets her pass.
Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed
for the small planet just beyond.
As she touches down, filling the frame. After a moment Mal,
Zoe and Jayne emerge from the airlock in full suits, armed.
Zoe reads a handheld scanner...
V0 MAL
Gravity's Earthnorm.
ZOE
02 levels check, pressure... if
there's anything wrong the scanner
isn't reading it.
Mal pulls off his helmet. Breathes, looking around him.
MAL
Well something sure as hell ain't
right...
WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out
for miles in every direction. Portions decimated by fires
long since cold, others overgrown with weeds, but mostly
intact. But silent, as if trapped in amber.
JAYNE

ZOE
We flew over at least a dozen
cities just as big. Why didn't we
hear about this?

MAL
Beacon's up ahead.
Out of their suits now, Mal, Zoe and Jayne take point as the
entire crew walks along the street, looking about them.
ZOE
Ho.
She moves rapidly, gun out, to:
ANGLE: A SKELETON
Face-down on the ground, clothes tattered. She examines it
as Mal approaches, waving the others back.
ZOE
(CONTINUING)
No entry wound, fractures...
MAL
Poison?

JAYNE (O . S . )
Got another one!
ANGLE: JAYNE is by a downed hovercraft. Inside are three
skeletons: two grown-ups and a small child. Clothes in
better condition, and again no sign of violence.
JAYNE
They's all just sittin'. Didn't
crash...
ANGLE: RIVER is quietly becoming more and more upset.
CLOSE ON: KAYLEE walks in front of an office building,
staying away from the cars as she hears:
JAYNE (O.S.)
Couple more here...
0 0 orpse _of_aman is
pressed up against the glass wall right behind her. Mouth
open, skin dead blue, terribly skinny... a thing to haunt.

SIMON
(seeing it)
Kaylee... Come this way. Come
here. Don't --
But she looks --
KAYLEE
GAAAAaaoh God --
-- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach.
It's an office. About half the employees are there, in
chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first
fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates...
JAYNE
How come they're preserved?
MAL
Place must've gone hermetic when
the power blew. Sealed 'em.
KAYLEE
(very upset)
What're they doing? What's
everybody doing?
SIMON
There's no discoloration, nobody's
doubled over or showing signs of
pain...
MAL
There's gasses that kill painless,
right?
INARA
But they didn't fall down. None
of them. They just lay down.
SIMON
More than anything, it looks like
starvation.
MAL
Anybody want to bet there's plenty
of food around?
INARA
They just lay down...
They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening.
She drops to her knees, clutching her head.
94.
As she speaks we see, as she sees, FLASHES: bodies. In
homes, in piles: an entire world, gently dead.
RIVER
, make them stop, they're
everywhere, every city every house
every room, they're all inside me,
I can hear them all and they're
saying nothing! GET UP! PLEASE,
GET THEM UP! , please God make me a
stone...
JAYNE
(UPSET)
She's starting to damage my calm.
ZOE
Jayne --
JAYNE
She's right! Everybody's dead!
This whole world is dead for no
reason!
WASH
Let's get to the beacon.
It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged,
is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way
towards it.
He takes a few unsteady steps away from the vessel. Inara
appears behind him, follows -- he holds a hand out behind
him, seemingly to make her stop, but then he grabs her
shoulder, holds her for support. She puts her hand over his.
MAL
I seen so much death... I been on
fields carpeted with bodies,
friends and enemies -- I seen men
and women blown to messes no
further from me than you.
INARA
Mal...
MAL
But every single one of those
people died on their feet.
Fighting.

MAL (cont'd)
Or, hell, running away -- doing
summat to get through. This is...

INARA
Mal, I need your help with this.
I need you to help me, because I
can't --
He looks at her, folds her into his arms. Brings her face to
his, not kissing but touching, pressing into each other with
the urgency of pulsing, necessary life.
Serenity is taking off, leaving the dead place behind.
We are amongst the Reaver armada. Serenity slices quietly
through the ships, as we come around and see Miranda receding
in the distance.
Serenity drifts through the armada -- and suddenly another
ship fires up, running next to her...
The two ships pace each other, another vessel coming about as
though staring at Serenity, who comes closer and closer to
frame, till we see the suited corpse draped on the cannon.
It suddenly moves: it's Mal.
He swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them.
It BLOWS, fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into
other ships, causing two smaller ones to blow as well.
Mal swings around and fires at another ship.
In close orbit waits the Alliance force, at least fifty
strong, and clearly with high tech firepower. We move in on
the Operative's ship, in the middle of the cluster.
It's the Operative's POV: the swirling Ion cloud as Serenity
breaks through and heads at us, fully Reavered out.
As Serenity get a bit closer, FIFTY REAVER SHIPS suddenly
burst from the cloud, also heading straight at us.
Serenity suddenly lists hard to port -- until she's almost
upside down -- the Alliance ships FIRE, missing Serenity but
tagging a few Reaver ships, none of whom have slowed down --
Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and
weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the
Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing
into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding --
The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around,
and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of
destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and
parts of ships fly at and past it.
ANGLE: SERENITY
She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet
before a barrelling chunk of debris -- which is twice their
size -- forces them to come hard about and remain in the fray.
Serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward
the tiny satellite moon.
40
The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface. As
it moves from the Operative's ship, we see that a Reaver
vessel has smashed into the main viewshield, and the ship is
spinning, explosions popping silently all over it.
She continues down, the metallic expanse of Mr Universe's
little moon complex sprawling below them. A moment after
Serenity blows through frame, so does a Reaver ship.
It fires an electronic pulse at Serenity and sparks fly.
We can see it, a long strip, which halfway along becomes a
kind of hanger. Serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast.
-40 And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside
the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility,
slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian
area, so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but
the body of the ship is hidden from it.
We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
out of it. A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above,
about to land next to it.
The cargo bay door opens -- just the little door housed
inside the ramp -- and Jayne comes out with his biggest gun.
He looks up, toward the edge of the runway, but no Reavers
have arrived yet.
JAYNE
Go!
The entire crew piles out, all heavily bedecked with weapons.
MAL
Head inside!
V0
We are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like
a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
stone beneath.
The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
Book.
The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
to it is River.
She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
holding a burning taper.
She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
of fireworks.

121.
WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads.
We are close on another explosion when it becomes:
CLOSE ON: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to see:
Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a
replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
came through.
Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
off the top of the ship.
Close on Mal as he watches it go...
WIDER ANGLE:
t f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed
by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all
over. The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of
repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly.
On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with
elegant precision.
It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground
of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground,
standing watching him from some twenty feet away.
Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun.
MAL
If you're here to tell me we ain't
finished... then we will be real
quick.
The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
ship, framed by the rain behind.
THE OPERATIVE
Do you know what an uproar you've
caused? Protests, riots -- cries
for a recall of the entire
Parliament.
MAL
(TURNING)
We've seen the broadwaves.
THE OPERATIVE
You must be pleased.
MAL
'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be
long 'fore she rolls right over
and falls back asleep. Taint my
worry.
THE OPERATIVE
I can't guarantee they won't come
after you. The Parliament. They
have a hundred men like me and
they are not forgiving.
MAL
That don't bode especially well
for you... giving the order to let
us go, patching up our hurt...
THE OPERATIVE
I told them the Tams were no
longer a threat -- damage done.

THE OPERATIVE (cont'd)
They might listen, but... I think
they know I'm no longer their man.
W MAL
They take you down, I don't expect
to grieve overmuch. Like to kill
you myself, I see you again.
THE OPERATIVE
You won't. There is...
(small, grim smile)
.nothing left to see.
Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
to look up at the nose of the ship.
ANGLE: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain.
THE OPERATIVE
(CONTINUING)
"Serenity". You lost everything
in that battle. Everything you
had, everything you were... how
did you go on?
Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as
they slide together. Glances at the Operative, unimpressed.
VAO
MAL
You still standing there when the
engine starts, you never will
figure it out.
The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.
Her engines fire up and tilt. She lifts gently off the
ground.
As we shoot up with her through sheeting rain, towards the
top of the sky.
We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as
she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot
off into the heavens --
There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at
camera, blacking out the frame.
MAL (0. S . )
What was that?
