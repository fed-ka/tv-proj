        EVENING 1, 2031

      1979. A summer s night in Baghdad; the grounds of a 
        large, opulent villa. Glimpse CHILDREN fleetingly as 
      they chase one another through bushes and disappear 
        leaving only the sound of their laughter.

      Find a LITTLE GIRL, creeping, hiding; when suddenly the 
        camera rushes up on her! The LITTLE GIRL is snatched 
      and lifted into the air by big, strong hands; she 
        squeals in delight. The OWNER of the big hands (SADDAM) 
        laughs and bites at her tummy making her laugh more. 
      The simple joy is interrupted by a man s voice.

                                        BARZAN
                      Saddam?

        SADDAM HUSSEIN (40) holds his daughter, HALA, and looks 
      to the man, BARZAN (28).

                                        BARZAN (CONT D)
                      Ready when you are.

        SADDAM nods.

                                        SADDAM
                              (to his DAUGHTER)
                      Baba has work to do; let s find Mama.

      HALA grabs hold of her father s neck and protests. 
        SADDAM (and HALA) and BARZAN move towards the villa.

      On to the terrace; it s a party; an important party; a 
        child s birthday party, yet the ADULTS are decked out 
      in Chanel, Dior and gaudy but expensive jewellery.

        GUESTS smile at SADDAM seeking approval. He finds his 
      wife, SAJIDA, and hands over HALA.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                      I believe this child belongs to you.
                              (eye contact with SAJIDA)

                                        SAJIDA
                      What time will he be here?

                                        SADDAM
                      Soon.

        SADDAM and BARZAN move into the villa.

                                        SAJIDA (O.O.V)
                                (gathering the children)
                      Children. Children come to me, we are 
                      going to play a game.

      The Presidential limo pulls up. A BODYGUARD (of two) 
      opens the door to the Limo and out steps AHMED AL BAKR, 
      60, PRESIDENT OF IRAQ, a small dapper man, holding a 
        beautifully wrapped gift. SADDAM steps forward.

                                        SADDAM
                      Mr President.

                      Mr Deputy.

      The two men embrace warmly. 

                                        AL BAKR (CONT D)
                      Sajida, you look beautiful.

                                        SAJIDA
                      You are too kind. Thank you so much 
                      for coming Mister President. Hala will 
                      be thrilled.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 7

                      Not at all; thank you for inviting an 
                      old man to a seventh birthday party; 
                      it is an important occasion!

      They are moving into the villa.



        SADDAM remembers.... 

        A scruffy BOY, dressed in a thin, off-white, dishdasher 
      walks bare-footed across the baked earth and stones of 
        a village track.

                                                                    CUT BACK TO:

        SADDAM remembers....

      The barefoot BOY runs through reeds, carrying a pistol.

                                                                          CUT TO:



        A line of dishevelled PARTY MEMBERS are led blinking 
      into an enclosed but open-aired, dusty yard. All have 
      their hands tied behind their backs, their feet 
        shackled and their mouths gagged. MASHHADI is amongst 
      them.

      The line of wretches face a line of  saved  PARTY 
        MEMBERS. The two lines of men, ex-colleagues stare 
        across at each other.

        A HANDGUN is cocked at the ready. We see it is in the 
      hand of SADDAM.

        SADDAM then calmly passes THE HAND-GUN on to the 
        nearest SAVED PARTY MEMBER.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 21



      Very reluctantly, the MEMBER steps up and with a 
        trembling hand, points the gun to the head of an ex-
        colleague; MASHHADI S head....the MEMBER is having 
        difficulty summoning up the courageto squeeze the 
        trigger. MASHHADI S breathing increases as he is 
        tortured with the feel of the gun at his head. SADDAM 
      is aware of the prolonged agony.

                                        SADDAM
                                (angrily)
                      FIRE!

      See the face of the PARTY MEMBER as he fires, a bloody 
      mist alights on his face and a BODY drops before him. 
      Hold on his silent horror.

      The PARTY MEMBER, in shock, the HANDGUN is passed to 
        another PARTY MEMBER. Then a hand is placed upon his 
        shoulder - he looks to the owner of the hand SADDAM.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                                (softly)
                      You have done your duty.

                      ...Thank you Mister President. May you 
                      live longer.

      More shots are fired; more bodies drop to the floor.  
      Find TARIQ standing apart, alone, removed from the 
      line.  Watching in horror.

                                                                          CUT TO:

        TERRACE - UDAY, 15, smokes the cigar, he looks quite 
      the expert. His brother, QUSAY is slouched in a chair.

                      You ll make yourself sick again.

      UDAY pulls a handgun from his waistband and points it 
      at QUSAY (who remains relaxed).

                      around the only dead man will be you.

      QUSAY gets up and calmly walks away.

                                        QUSAY (CONT D)

        A light goes on in a room across the garden, the window 
      of which have the blinds closed. UDAY looks to the 
        light, he sees a shadow of his father.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      The Presidential car flashes past as part of a 
        motorcade.

        Inside the car find SADDAM and SAJIDA.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      1503

      The motorcade pulls into a a residential street and 
      stops outside a villa. Inside the car:

                                        SAJIDA
                      I can t do this. I can t face her.

        A BODYGUARD opens the door of the car. SADDAM looks at 
        SAJIDA, shakes her head. SADDAM gets out of the car 
      alone and straightens himself and his suit. People stop 
      and stare at this unexpected sighting. Some edge 
        forward to kiss the hand of the PRESIDENT as he makes 
      his way to the door of the villa - which opens as he 
        reaches it. SADDAM enters the villa. SAJIDA is still 
        sitting in the car...she knows she has to follow 
        SADDAM.

                                                                          CUT TO:



        SADDAM and SAJIDA emerge from the house. 

        A larger crowd have gathered and as SADDAM emerges 
      there is a referential  buzz  from the crowd - it is 
      him, it is the President.Then a few echoed calls  Long 
      live Saddam ,  God save Saddam . CROWD begin to find 
      their voices and cheer and call his name. BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 29



        SADDAM acknowledges his people and moves slowly to his 
      car, the CROWD are kept a short distance away by 
        BODYGUARDS. SAJIDA is a little nervous. SADDAM 
        decides...

                                        SADDAM
                      We will walk with the people for a 
                      while.

        SADDAM walks past the car, with SAJIDA, and the CROWD 
        follows - reaching out to him.

                                                                          CUT TO:



        Another walkabout; different crowd, different day - but 
      more PEOPLE. SADDAM and SAJIDA.

      The calls of praise and support. EVERYBODY in the CROWD 
      wants SADDAM to look at THEM! SADDAM basks in the 
        warmth and begins to reach out to his people - pressing 
      the flesh in true Presidential style.

                                        SADDAM 
                      How are you? How are your family? Do 
                      you have enough food for the little 
                      ones?

                                                                          CUT TO:



        ANOTHER WALKABOUT - the biggest yet. More of the same 
        pressing of flesh, but this time SAJIDA too joins the 
        spirit of the walkabout - she can t help but feel 
        flattered. She is also important, she is the wife of 
      the President! They move off along the street and the 
      crowd grows.

        SADDAM turns a street corner and it s almost bedlam; he 
      is in a less prosperous part of town; the CROWD 
        surrounding him has grown considerably; the BODYGUARDS 
      are working overtime to keep the ten-yards ahead of 
        SADDAM clear. He is smiling and waving at his people, 
      some of whom now carry portraits - he is loving being 
        loved! He is a PRESIDENT for the people.

                                                                          FADE TO:BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 30




      The YOUNG MAN exits the cafe and walks away, very 
        briskly.

        Inside the cafe, Saddam is still with his people on TV.

      BANG! The window of the cafe blows out; bodies, tables 
      and contents are sent flying.

                                                                          CUT TO:

        BARZAN approaches SADDAM and they embrace.

                      should marry Hussein.

        HUSSEIN is standing dutifully near-by with CHEMICAL ALI 
      and SADDAM KAMEL (HUSSEIN S younger brother).

                      I was as surprised as you.

                                        BARZAN
                      Raghad has been promised to my son 
                      Mohammed for years, you know it.

                                        SADDAM
                      It was her wish.

                                        BARZAN

                      ...Raghad will marry Hussein.

      He is looking BARZAN right in the eye, challenging him 
      to kick off at their MOTHER S funeral. 

      He once again kisses BARZAN and walks away from his 
        stunned brother. BARZAN watches as SADDAM gets into his 
      car and shuts the door.

        SADDAM steps from a white Mercedes Limousine to face a 
      NEWS CAMERA CREW and a vast ADORING CROWD. 

      The NEWS CAMERA CREW film as SADDAM works the crowd - 
      who are pressing forward and chanting. 

        SADDAM is shaking reaching beyond his screen of 
        REPUBLICAN GUARDS and shaking hands with his people - 
        mostly old men, women and children (the young men will 
      be fighting at the front-line!). SADDAM is loving it 
      and the crowd are folding in around him. 

        A WOMAN thrusts beyond the REPUBLICAN GUARDS and grabs 
        SADDAM s hand. A SOLDIER goes to pull her away but 
        SADDAM stops him.

                                        SADDAM
                      No. No it s OK.

      She covers his hand with kisses, all of this filmed by 
      the news crew. SADDAM places his hand upon her head - 
      he looks around him and all he sees are 360 degrees of 
        adoring, happy faces.  It doesn t get any better than 
      this SADDAM!

        A SOLDIER slams the door shut and the crowd press in. A 
        satisfied SADDAM settles in the rear seat. A DRIVER in 
      the front. 

      The MOTORCADE car begins to move forward. Saddam leans 
      back, able to relax at last. SOLDIERS run alongside 
      until the car is clear of the Town Square and the 
        crowds.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 55



      1536

        SADDAM s car is now travelling at speed, the third car 
      in a motorcade of four. 

        Silence - the CAR glides along the road - Palm groves 
      pass outside the windows - it s been a perfect day! 
      Then NOISE...

        Gunfire. The car brakes, slews and shunts into the car 
      in front. Machine-gunfire shatters the windows and the 
        DRIVER is killed. The car in turn is shunted. All hell 
        breaks loose. It s an ambush.



      The occupants of all cars in the motorcade come out 
        FIRING. Some are HIT. SADDAM scrambles out of his car 
      and crouches at the back of the car, next to a wheel. 
      All around him is gunfire. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The ATTACKERS, in the palm grove, can now be seen and 
      the gun fight ensues. The SOLDIERS begin expertly 
        picking them off. GRENADES are thrown into the PALM 
      GROVE and the ATTACKERS begin to take flight.

      The immediate threat is past...bodyguards arrive by 
        SADDAM. SADDAM notices that his hand is trembling and 
      it fuels his anger further.

      The SOLDIER dares to put a hand on SADDAM S arm to lead 
      him to the car - SADDAM angrily shrugs him off.
