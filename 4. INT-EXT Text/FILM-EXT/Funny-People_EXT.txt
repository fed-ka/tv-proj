George hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him
driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see
his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous.
2.
George drives his large black Mercedes.
George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two
COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over.
COLLEGE STUDENT
Hey George, can I get a picture
with you?
GEORGE
Sure buddy. Let's do it.
One of the college students put his arm around George while
the other takes the picture.
COLLEGE STUDENT #2
Can I get one?
GEORGE
Yeah bud.
They take the picture.
COLLEGE STUDENT
You're the man. We love all your
movies, even the last one.
GEORGE
Thanks. Tell your friends.
George walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a
daze. An ASIAN GIRL and her MOTHER and BROTHER see him and
start screaming.
GIRL
Oh my God. Can you take a picture
with me?
GEORGE
Yeah, sure.
She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in
too.
GIRL
Thanks. You are the funniest.
GEORGE
Thanks, pal.
!NT. CAR - DAY
George drives home. We hear the voice of his doctor in his
head.
4.
DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
It's a rare blood disorder. In the
family of Hodgkins disease. We
really don't have a treatment for
it. There are things we can try.
They're all very experimental in
nature.
GEORGE (V.0.)
I don't understand what this means.
DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
I think you need to hope for the
best and prepare for the worst. Is
there someone who can help you get
your affairs in order?
Ira walks to his car. In the spot next to him is an enormous
Suburban SUV parked in a spot meant for compact cars. It is
so close to Ira's car that it isn't possible to open the
door. He hears some banging and odd wails from in the car.
Ira knocks on the window. We see that George is sitting in
his car in a world of pain. He's clearly been crying. The
knock startles him. He turns to Ira.
IRA
Sorry, man. I didn't mean to
disturb you. I just can't open my
door. There's no room.
GEORGE
Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out.
George pulls the car back ten feet.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
(calling to Ira)
Hey man, you had some funny shit
tonight.
IRA
Thanks!
GEORGE
Man, that audience hated you. They
really did not like you. They liked
your buddy, who looked exactly like
you but was funnier. Man, that's
going to haunt you. You're going
to wake up in six months and think
about this night.
IRA
Well, I'll probably bomb worse
tomorrow and forget about this one.
GEORGE
I'm just fucking with you. You had
some funny jokes in there. Good
writing.
IRA
Well, obviously, I'm a... you
know...I grew up on your shit, man.
George just stares at him.
14.
GEORGE
Alright, pal. Don't worry. Only
two hundred people saw that
tonight. I'll see you later.
George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by
Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and
starts screaming...
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill
you!
Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is
the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.
FULL SCREEN COMPUTER: We see a comedy short made by Leo.
It's very funny.
IRA
Holy shit, you got seven hundred
thousand hits in four days.
LEO
They put it on the main page at
YouTube and it exploded. Which
would be awesome if someone would
pay me.
The phone rings.
IRA
Hello?
GEORGE (V.0.)
Hey, is this Ira?
IRA
Yeah. Who is this?
GEORGE
It's George.
IRA
Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going?
15.
GEORGE
I thought you and Leo were pretty
funny last night and I have to do
this corporate gig for Apple
computers in a couple of days and I
thought you guys could write me
some jokes.
IRA
Definitely. What kind of jokes?
Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to
include him in this job offer.
GEORGE
I don't know, about computers and
shit. I could mainly do my act but
they like it if you talk about them
a little.
IRA
No problem. Where do you want me
to send em?
GEORGE
What is your email? I will send
you my fax and email and all that.
IRA
It's a...irasexiragmail.com.
GEORGE
(long silence)
I almost just changed my mind. You
got to change that.
IRA
Ok.
GEORGE
Today. Seriously. Ok. Later.
Ira hangs up and turns to his friends.
IRA
That was George Simmons. He wants
me to write jokes for him.
LEO
Holy shit. That is awesome. You
are so lucky.
16.
MARK
Are you gonna get to meet him?
IRA
I don't know, but he is gonna send
me his email address.
LEO
We are gonna have his email
address? I have to send him the
link to my short.
IRA
Easy. Let me get in there a little
more.
CUT TO:
The door opens, Ira gets in.
GEORGE
How you doing, you ready for this?
IRA
Yeah, this'll be fun.
GEORGE
I think I'm going to have you go on
before me to warn them up.
IRA
You don't have to do that. What if
I bomb?
GEORGE
Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be
more excited to see me. They'll be
so glad your not on stage any more.
Then if you do well, they'll be
ready for me. Either way, you're
helpful.
I/E PRIVATE JET - LATER
The limo pulls up to a private jet. Ira is shocked.
A moment later they're picking up speed to take off. George
seems really relaxed. Nothing registers that the jet is
going faster and faster and taking off.
19.
As they're having a conversation, Ira seems really freaked
out. Ira pretends he isn't.
GEORGE
I like this joke about watching
porn and making porn all at the
same time. That was a good one.
IRA
(turning white from
TAKEOFF)
Oh good. Yeah, I thought you'd
like that one. I was really happy
with that one.
GEORGE
You want something to eat? I had
them bring Chinese on the plane.
Ira's eyes widen. He likes this way of life.
George and Ira are waiting at the parking valet. The car
pulls up. As they get in:
GEORGE
I was thinking about it. I could
throw you some money every week for
coming up with new jokes for me.
Maybe you can organize them in the
computer, keep track of what I'm
doing.
IRA
Absolutely. What do you want to
pay me?
They close the doors, drive off.
GEORGE
I'll throw you $1500 a week.
IRA
Okay, that could work.
We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's
life.
Ira sees Daisy walking out as he's walking into the apartment
complex. He takes a deep breath, then:
IRA
Hey, Daisy.
DAISY
Hey --
IRA
Ira.
DAISY
(she doesn't)
I know.
IRA
I was gonna try to hunt down
tickets to see Wilco at the Greek
Theatre. You want to come? Are
you into them at all?
DAISY
I would love to come. That would
be amazing.
IRA
Okay. I'll call you with the
details. Hopefully I'll be able to
get seats which will not require
high-powered binoculars.
DAISY
I don't care where the seats are.
I just like to close my eyes and
listen to the music at concerts,
IRA
Perfect. Then I can play you their
live album in my car and trick you
into thinking we have front row
seats.
(laughing uncomfortably)
That won't work.
(MORE)
40.
IRA (CONT'D)
That wasn't funny at all. I'm
gonna leave while I'm ahead right
now.
She smiles. He walks away.
Ira and Daisy are having a heated conversation outside.
IRA
So now you're with Mark? You're
his girl?
DAISY
I just went out with him one night.
IRA
You got a lot accomplished in one
night. How did this happen?
DAISY
He invited me to a taping of his
show and we hit it off.
IRA
Must have been a great episode. I
should get a job on a shitty show
so I can use it as foreplay.
DAISY
What are you talking about? Don't
treat me like that.
IRA
I am not treating you like
anything. Do what you want. I
don't give a shit. I'll go to Wilco
alone.
DAISY
What planet are you from? The one
where everyone is perfect like you,
you judgemental fuck?
IRA
How could you do that? I thought
we were going out on a date.
DAISY
We are going on a date. I didn't
plan it. Am I not allowed to do
stuff because we're going out on a
.date? What the fuck's the matter
with you?
55.
IRA
I bought tickets to Wilco and I
worked all week to get a
reservation at a place that doesn't
normally let people like me eat
there. I just didn't see this
coming. Yes, you're right. You
can do anything you want. I'm glad
this fucking happened, before I
wasted the night with you. I
didn't think you were that kind of
person. That you would sleep with
a guy like that.
DAISY
He's your roommate. You don't like
him?
IRA
No, I think he's a pussyhound.
DAISY
Well, I didn't know that. Thanks
for the info. I wasn't trying to
hurt you. It just happened.
IRA
You got excited because he's the
star of the show. You literally
star-fucked.
DAISY
Yes, you're right. I'm awful.
(CRYING)
Give me a break. I don't even know
you.
George and Ira are skiing. There is no music, no noise. It
is very peaceful. George stops in a spot where he is
surrounded in all directions by gorgeous, majestic mountains.
He looks around, taking it all in.
George walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the
sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives
before. He likes it.
George and Ira hike up a hill.
GEORGE
I never understood why people hiked
before. I think I get it now.
IRA
(SWEATING)
I don't.
George is walking around his yard at night. He's clearly
never walked the grounds at night. He seems at peace.
George is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently
told them about his situation, and although there is sadness
in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in
a long time.
George says something that makes his DAD laugh.
George and Ira play basketball. Ira is awful.
George walks up, rings the bell. Inside the apartment he
hears a bit of a scuffle, as if the friends are fighting over
who can open the door.
Leo opens the door, sweaty, with a welt on his face.
65.
LEO
Hey, George. How are you? Come on
in.
Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on
his neck.
MARK
Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in.
The car pulls up to the theater.
George and Ira drive up to the house. It's a large one-story
house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse
stable.
They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell. George seems;
a little nervous.
IRA
You okay, buddy?
GEORGE
Yeah, of course I am.
Laura opens the door.
LAURA
Hi? We've been waiting for you.
Come on in.
Laura sits on a ATV. George sits behind her. Ira is on
another ATV with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he
steers. Mable rides a very small dirt bike.
LAURA
All right! Here we go.
They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of
the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they
drive. Ira looks over, concerned.
Laura points out a small pond and a fenced-in riding area.
Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get
ahead and turn a corner. Then she stops the ATV and turns
around and kisses George.
George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him,
trying to decide what she makes of him now. Then we hear
O.S.
MABLE (O.S.)
Mom! Mom!
Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour.
Ira, Mable and Ingrid are outside at a table building houses
out of Popsicle sticks.
IRA
If you had an Exacto knife we could
cut these sticks in half and make a
chimney.
MABLE
(SADLY)
When is George gonna die?
INGRID
George is gonna die?
IRA
Why would you say that?
MABLE
I heard my mom talking to her
friend about it on the phone and
crying.
INGRID
I don't want George to die.
MABLE
What do you care? You just met
him.
IRA
George is gonna be fine.
MABLE
They told me my grandfather
wouldn't die, but he did.
IRA
Here's the truth. George was
really sick.
(MORE)
100.
IRA (CONT'D)
But he went to the doctor and they
found the right medicine and now
he's better. And he's gonna live a
long time.
The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved.
MABLE
I think my mom's in love with him.
Ira looks doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his
popsicle sticks.
George and Laura park in the driveway, then sneak around to a
back guest house.
Everyone is taking a walk around the ranch. It is very
pretty outside.
CLARKE
I'm going to retire in seven years.
I'm done. I'm playing golf for the
next fifty years. Work hard now,
then get out. That's my plan. I'm
putting in the time. Then I'm
getting the fuck out. I don't like
working. I will do it. I like
what it gets me. But I don't like
it.
GEORGE
You ever see Laura act? She was
quite an actress in her day.
107.
LAURA
George, stop.
CLARKE
That's what I hear. Can't say I
watched that much 'Melrose Place'
back in the day. She keeps telling
me to watch the videos but, you
know, I was never a big 'Party of
Five' fan.
LAURA
Well, I also ran a theatre company.
And it was down to me and Cameron
Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed
a lot for our family.
CLARKE
Okay, if you say so.
(a beat)
The Mask was a funny fucking movie.
You know what other movie Cameron
Diaz was great in? 'There's
Something About Mary.'
Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and
disrespect. They keep walking.
CLARKE (CONT'D)
I love walking it off after a big
meal.
GEORGE
It's beautiful here at night.
LAURA
There's no pollution here like in
LA so you can actually see the
stars.
IRA
They are beautiful, but we have to
get going. We have a really long
drive to get back to Los Angeles.
CLARKE
You can't leave now, you won't get
back until daylight. You should
crash in the guest house. I'm sure
it not as fancy pants as where you
live, George, but it's better than
driving all night or crashing at a
hotel.
(MORE)
108.
CLARKE (CONT'D)
And if you want to hang out
tomorrow I just installed six
flatscreens, we can watch all the
football games we want. And dog-
racing from Florida. There's a big
game tomorrow. Ira, you must have
played some ball in your day.
IRA
No, I'm just big-boned.
GEORGE
We probably should get some rest
before the drive. All right, show
us to our quarters, sir.
Numerous images of them horse-back riding. Ira looks
terrified.
They are all fishing, feeding ducks.
They are riding ATVs while their dogs chase them.
The kids are climbing a tree. Laura is spotting them.
George pulls Ira aside.
GEORGE
(EXHAUSTED)
Jesus Christ, what time is it
already?
IRA
It's 10:15 in the morning.
GEORGE
Oh my god. Really? I mean, this
is fun, but I don't know how much I
can take. Hopefully they'll take a
nap at some point. I want to take
a nap.
116.
IRA
They don't look that tired.
The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight
more hours in them.
George kisses Laura, and then she gets in her car.
LAURA
I'll be back in an hour and a half,
tops. And then it all begins.
GEORGE
Okay, call me if you need any
backup.
LAURA
I love you.
GEORGE
(really uncomfortable)
I.. . love you.
The car drives off.
Ira drives in a panic.
IRA
Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the
fucking airport around here?
Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in
a panic. He can't make it work.
Ira is still messing with the navigation system. He finally
gets frustrated and punches it.
12-) .
Ira yells to someone on the street.
IRA
How do you get to the fucking
airport?!
Laura gets to check-in, looks around. She does not see
Clarke.
Ira parks in the no-standing zone. He gets out and starts
walking into the airport. His phone rings, he answers. It's
George.
GEORGE (V.0.)
Where are you?
IRA
I'm getting cigarettes.
GEORGE (V.0.)
You've been gone for forty minutes.
IRA
I got lost. I don't know this
town.
GEORGE (V.O.)
Well come back. I don't know how
to take care of these kids, I'm not
a camp counselor like you. These
kids are on to me. The older one's
too intense. She's troubled.
She's like Damien, from the Omen.
I need help.
124.
IRA
Ok, I'll hurry back.
Ira comes back out, his car is about to be towed.
IRA
No, no, no! I'm here. I'm here.
Clarke drives home, pissed off.
Laura drives home, quickly.
Clarke arrives at the house. He sees George sitting with
the kids.
CLARKE
(angry-to Mable and
INGRID)
Can you take it into the family fun
room?
MABLE
Are you two going to fight?
CLARKE
Ye s.
George and Clarke walk outside. Clarke puts up his fists,
ready to fight.
GEORGE
She's not happy.
Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts
style.
CLARKE
No one who's married is fucking
happy. Leave us alone! You fucked
up. You fucked it up with her a
long time ago. Let it go or I will
kill you. I will literally kill
you till you're fucking dead. That
disease didn't kill you. But I
will kill you.
GEORGE
You shouldn't joke about my
disease. That was very serious.
Very scary.
Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like
martial arts hits.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
What the hell is that?
Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Don't jump in. Whatever you do,
don't jump in. I don't want your
help!
128.
IRA
Okay.
GEORGE
You said you were getting
cigarettes then you ran to the
airport to stop her. What kind of
friend are you?
IRA
I am a good friend because this
entire situation is crazy. You are
out of control.
GEORGE
I didn't deserve what you did to
me. You betrayed me !
IRA
When I got there, she was already
kissing him. I never even had a
chance to stop it. I didn't get to
do anything!
CLARKE
Don't pretend you're fucking mad at
each other, just to distract me so
I won't beat your ass.
Clarke pushes George.
CLARKE (CONT'D)
You're gonna come to my house?
You're gonna come to my fucking
house? You have to get your own
life. Leave us the fuck alone.
GEORGE
Don't hit me! I've been sick!
They don't know. The medicine is
working now, but I'm still sick.
Clarke punches George.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
(to Ira)
What are you doing? I said to jump
in!
IRA
You told me not to jump in.
129.
GEORGE
That's what "don't jump in" means.
It means "jump in." Help me!
Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You're a terrible fighter.
IRA
I know, that's why I became a
comedian, because everyone used to
beat me up!
George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard,
sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and
Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet.
Laura runs into the middle of the scene.
GEORGE
Laura, tell Clarke to stop!
LAURA
Clarke, please don't do this.
CLARKE
Don't tell me what I can and can
not do.
GEORGE
Laura, tell him. Tell him you want
to be with me now.
Laura doesn't answer.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Laura?
LAURA
Why did you have to come here and
confuse me? Everything was fine
before you came here. Now
everything is all screwed up.
GEORGE
Laura, what's it going to be? Are
you going with him, or are you
going with me?
Laura looks at Clarke.
130.
LAURA
With him.
GEORGE
Don't do this.
LAURA
You fucked up my life. And now I
fucked up yours. But just a
little. Probably just for a day.
She walks back into the house.
CLARKE
Hit the road before I put you
through another round.
GEORGE
You cheated on her too!
CLARKE
Yeah, but we're married. We're
going to work through this shit.
You should have waited until you
were married to cheat. It buys
you another chance.
Clarke punches George. Ira is on the ground. He doesn't get
up.
GEORGE
She told me I was the love of her
life. And she loves me more than
she loves you!
CLARKE
When she said that, did she think
you were dying?
GEORGE
Yeah!
CLARKE
Too bad you had to 'Live and find
out it wasn't true. Leave my
fucking family alone!
Clarke punches him. George gets a punch in but it doesn't
hurt Clarke. Clarke punches him again.
CLARKE (CONT'D)
I can do this all night.
131.
Clarke hits George again. Ira leaps on Clarke and now all
three are on the ground rolling around, arms flailing.
GEORGE
(to Ira)
Stop Ira, you're hitting me too.
Mable and Ingrid appear outside.
MABLE
What are you guys doing?
INGRID
What's happening?
The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful.
IRA
We're just playing that's all.
GEORGE
We're wrestling. It's fun.
CLARKS
Boys like to wrestle just like
girls.
They all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake
playful. They give each other noogies, and tickle each other
so the kids won't be scared.
A little blood runs off of George's face.
INGRID
Are you bleeding?
GEORGE
No. We were just painting. I got
some paint on my cheek.
CLARKE
Come on girls. Let's go inside.
Mable and Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.
CLARKE (CONT'D)
You know what sucks about this? I
like your movies and now I can't
watch them anymore.
Clarke walks away, then walks back.
132.
CLARKE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. That was mean. Through
ail of this, I want you to know
something. I'm glad that you're
not sick, and I understand. And I
forgive you.
Clarke goes inside.
IRA
That was meaner than him punching
you. That is a demented
motherfucker.
George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches
at George's face and he stumbles back.
GEORGE
None of you fuckers can hurt me.
George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the
ground for a moment. Ira makes his-way free and gets up.
IRA
Get the hell off of me you psycho.
GEORGE
Drive me home.
IRA
No.
GEORGE
How are you gonna get home then?
IRA
Fine.
Music up: Ted Hawkins' song "Strange Conversation."
Ira drives George home in the dark. Neither one speaks.
We see images of different cities going by the window. Ira
thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead,
Ira pulls up to his apartment.
IRA
okay, I'm getting out. You have to
drive yourself home. I'm getting
out here.
GEORGE
Why didn't you drive me to my
house?
IRA
Because then I'd still have your
car.
135.
GEORGE
You'll drop it off later.
IRA
There is no later! I'm not going
to ever talk to you again. So I
don't want your car.
GEORGE
So that's how it's going to be.
George walks out of a store. A beautiful woman tries to chat
him up, but he lets her know he i.s"busy and has to go. He
walks off. She looks disappointed.
