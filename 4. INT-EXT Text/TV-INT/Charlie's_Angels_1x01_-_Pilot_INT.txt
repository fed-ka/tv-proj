      It s a statement in minimalist cool.  

      KATE                                                                                 4.


      strides across the white marble in an awesome silver coat and 
      envy-inducing Jimmy Choos.   

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    You bug Mackal s phone?

                                  ABBY
                    With one hand behind my back.  You 
                    in position?

      Kate arrives at the elevators.  She looks around, then stabs 
      the button of the service elevator.   

                                  KATE
                    Almost. 

      The doors open, she steps in and hits  B .  When the doors 
      close, she pulls off the coat, revealing a maid s uniform 
      underneath.  A pair of sensible sneakers hang from the belt.  
      As she quickly changes shoes...

                                  KATE
                    Gloria, has the buyer s rep touched 
                    down?

      SCREEN DIVIDES AGAIN TO INCLUDE:


      Kate steps out of the elevator.  She selects a service cart 
      from a row lined up against the wall and nods to a YOUNG MAID 
      who is clocking out.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the Young Maid as she 
      steps to the elevator.  The doors open, revealing                                                                                 5.


      THE JIMMY CHOOS.

      They re sitting in the middle of the floor.  Curious, the 
      Young Maid plucks the note scrolled in the left shoe.  

      TIGHT ON NOTE:  The paper is embossed with a pair of gold 
      angel wings.  The words  Handle With Love  are handwritten.  

      OFF the Maid s SCREAM of delight...


      He closes the flap, yanks an iPad from a Jack Spade gym bag.   


      Fisk is on a cell phone.  The thick privacy barrier is up.  
      Unknown to him, Gloria is eavesdropping via an earwig.                                                                                  6.


                                  FISK
                          (into phone)
                    I m meeting Pajaro s broker in 20 
                    minutes to pick up the package.  

      When she hears the name Pajaro, Gloria s face hardens and she 
      white-knuckles the wheel.

                                  FISK
                          (into phone)
                    I ll email you a picture now.  
                          (dirty smirk)
                    I think you ll approve.  

      TIGHT ON CELL PHONE:  He pulls up an image of a fresh-faced 
      girl in a T-shirt and jean shorts.  Her name is SARAH DANIELS 
      and she just turned 16.  As Fisk hits  Send ...


      Bosley finger-slides a window open on his iPad.  It s a high-
      tech GPS phone-tracking program.  

                                  BOSLEY
                          (into earwig)
                    Okay, Gloria, I m wired in.  Turn 
                    on the spin cycle. 


      Gloria grins, hits a button, locking all the doors, then 
      wildly turns the wheel.  


      Fisk is violently slammed around the back.   

                                  FISK
                    ARE YOU INSANE!  STOP!  

      Gloria goes even faster.  Prada boot to the pedal.  


      The limo catches air as it ROARS INTO VIEW.  It kicks up a 
      cloud of sparks as it CRASHES down and begins slaloming 
      around a line of concrete support columns.                                                                                  7.



      Battered and terrified, Fisk is seriously losing it.  

                                  FISK
                    I DON T WANT TO DIE!  PLEASE!

      Gloria sweeps out of a turn and powers straight for the 
      safety barrier that encircles the edge of the structure.    


      It s a suicide run until Gloria BRAKE-SLIDES the limo to a 
      dead stop an inch from the barrier.  Before the smoke has 
      cleared, she climbs out, clicks open the passenger door.   

      FISK

      is on the floor, a confused mess.  Gloria drags him out.  He 
      is hysterical with fear.  

                                  FISK
                    Take whatever you want!  

                                  GLORIA
                    I want a room number!  Where s 
                    Pajaro s broker keeping the girl?  

                                  FISK
                    I... I don t know.  I swear.  

      Enraged, she gut-punches him.  He buckles, winded.  

                                  FISK
                    I m meeting him at the bar.  Guy 
                    named Mackal.  Once he s confirmed 
                    my boss s wire transfer, he ll give 
                    me instructions how to get the 
                    package out of the hotel.  

                                  GLORIA
                    She s not a package!  Her name is 
                    Sarah.  She s 16 years old.    
                          (leaning in)
                    You know what they do to guys in 
                    prison that traffic underage girls?

                                  FISK
                    Please!  I ll do anything.  I m 
                    just the middleman.

      Gloria plucks his phone from the back seat.  Holds it up.                                                                                8.


                                  GLORIA
                    You re going to make a phone call 
                    and you better be Oscar worthy. 

      He nods and with a shaky finger inputs a number.

      MULTISCREEN WHEN NECESSARY:


      Kate pushes her cart into an elevator, on alert. 


      Bosley watches the iPad program track the call. 

      TIGHT ON iPAD: It flashes with an address. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    He called room 2342.  

      Kate hits  23  on the elevator panel. 

                                  KATE
                    Get visual confirmation Sarah s in 
                    the room.                                                                                 9.


      Bosley opens another program.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    I m on it. 

      It looks like a game console.  He hits the  POWER UP  button.  


      TIGHT ON iPAD:  The screen features a real-time helicopter 
      COCKPIT VIEW and a schematic of the hotel.  


      Bosley hits a button and the cockpit view goes THERMAL.  The 
      glowing red outlines of FIVE FIGURES BECOME VISIBLE.  The 
      smallest lies on the bed, gagged and bound -- THIS IS SARAH.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Okay.  I ve got five heat 
                      signatures.  Sarah s on the bed.   


      The elevator doors split and Kate emerges with her cart.  
       2342  is at the end. 

                                  KATE
                    Abby, you ready to do some 
                      housekeeping? 


      Sarah s on the bed, numb with fear.  The four GUARDS are 
      built like linebackers.  Two watch a Dolphins game on the 
        wall-mounted flat-screen while the others sit at a table, 
      eating room-service pizza.  

      DING DONG!

      One of the Dolphins fans, Guard #1, steps to the door.   

                                  GUARD #1
                    Who is it?

      DING DONG!  Annoyed, he yanks a heavy-duty Glock .45 from his 
      waistband and leans into the peephole.  

      WHAT HE SEES:  A fish-eye view of Kate!  She is in midair 
      with her leg outstretched -- WHAAAM!  She HAMMER-KICKS the 
      door right off its hinges!  

      The door SLAMS on top of the Guard.  He tumbles back and is 
      knocked out when his head hits the floor.  Kate charges over 
      the fallen door and into the room.  Taken by surprise,  

      THE OTHER GUARDS 

      pull their weapons.  As they face her, the window behind them 
      SHATTERS and Abby swings into the room in a shower of glass.  
      She lands with cat-like ease and instantly goes on the 
      attack.  She spin-kicks Guard #2, sending him face first into 
      the TV -- CRAAACK!  Then clotheslines #3.  

      GUARD #4

      is the last man standing.  Working in perfect synch, Kate and 
      Abby take him out with a combo of kicks and body blows.  The 
      women step to the bed and gently untie Sarah.  

                                  KATE
                    It s okay, Sarah.  You re safe now.

      She regards them, confused and grateful.

                                  SARAH
                    Who are you?  You don t look like 
                    cops.

                                  ABBY
                    We re Angels. 

      OFF her smile, the SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THREE and our title:

                                     CHARLIE S ANGELS                                                                                11.


      slides INTO VIEW.  The SCREEN DISSECTS again, revealing...  

      AN ART DECO SPEAKERPHONE BOX.

      It s sitting on the coffee table in...


      The open-plan space is on the second floor with views over 
      Ocean Drive.  It s vibrantly furnished and with a swoon-
      worthy mix of vintage and modern pieces.  Bosley and the 
      Angels are huddled around the speakerphone. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                          (on the Box)
                    I spoke to Sarah s parents.  They 
                    were relieved to have their 
                    daughter back safe and sound.  She 
                    won t be running away again soon. 

                                  KATE
                    Now that Mackal s hiding behind an 
                    army of lawyers, what are the 
                    chances he ll flip on his boss 
                    Pajaro?  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    It s doubtful he s even met him. 

                                  ABBY
                    You realize the irony of that 
                    coming from you, Charlie. 

                                  KATE
                    Miami PD s been trying to nail 
                    Pajaro for years.  He doesn t leave 
                    any footprints, electronic or 
                      otherwise.  He s a ghost.   

                                  GLORIA
                    Ghosts aren t real -- this guy is 
                    and I want him to bleed.

      The vehemence of her statement takes them by surprise. 

                                  KATE
                    Easy, girl.

                    Sorry, creeps like that just piss 
                    me off.                                                                                 12.


                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Don t lose sight of what you 
                      accomplished tonight.  Sarah s safe  
                    because of you three. 

      Bosley CLEARS his throat, feeling left out. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    And of course you, Bosley. 

      He shrugs modestly. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I m proud of all of you.  

                                  ABBY
                    Hold onto that feeling, Charlie, 
                    when you start hearing the 
                      unexpected charges we racked up 
                    tonight.   

      Bosley shakes his head and mouths the word  No .

                                  ABBY
                      Especially the bar tab for Bosley s 
                    hot-tub buddies.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    Astrid and Inga were a completely 
                      legitimate undercover expense.   

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I look forward to the debrief --
                    tomorrow.  Good night, Angels. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      MULTISCREEN MUSIC MONTAGE:

      AERIAL SHOT of a candy-apple red Porsche speeding across the 
      Causeway.  The BUZZING lights of South Beach.  The Porsche 
      glides up to the valet of a club, Ripcord.  Abby, Kate and 
      Gloria step out, styled and ready to party.  Abby winks to 
      the BOUNCER guarding the rope and the trio strides into... 


      A Technicolor fantasy.  YOUNG BODIES sway.  The Angels CLINK 
      cocktail glasses.  On the dance floor the girls let loose.  
      Free spirits.  Gloria steps to the booth and texts somebody.  

      MULTISCREEN ENDS. 

      Gloria puts away her phone as Abby slides in next to her.                                                                               13.

                    I m enforcing a strict no-texting-

      Kate joins them. 

                                  KATE
                    I need backup out there.

      Abby playfully takes Gloria s hand. 

                                  ABBY
                    Come on, potential ex-boyfriends

                    Mind if we bail early?

      They look at her, surprised. 

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry, who are you and what 
                    have you done with our best friend?  

      Kate studies Gloria, concerned. 

                                  KATE
                    Usually I m the one who cuts out

      Abby wags her finger. 

                                  ABBY
                    I m chalking your sacrilege up to a 
                    lack of sleep.   


      Wind-down MUSIC PURRS.  Abby drives.  Gloria is in the back 
      while Kate, in the front, raids the glove box.  

                                  ABBY

                    human Breathalyzer when I get home.                                                                                14.


                                  ABBY
                    It s sweet your mom waits up for 
                    you.  

                                  KATE
                    It s weird and overbearing.  I m 28 
                    and pay the mortgage.  But if I 
                    come through that door past 
                    midnight, it s like a perp walk.

                                  ABBY
                          (teasing)
                    You should have told me you have 
                    curfew.  

      Abby checks the rear view and sees Gloria, staring out the 
      window, lost in thought.  Kate pulls out a stack of letters.  
      She notes the return address,  CLEARVIEW STATE PENITENTIARY .  

                                  KATE
                    When you said your dad was reaching 
                    out -- you didn t say it was a full-
                    blown letter-writing campaign.   

                                  ABBY
                    He got tired of his mea culpas 
                    hitting my spam file and began a 
                      snail-mail assault.  The Wolf of 
                    Wall Street can be relentless when 
                    he s focused.  

                                  KATE
                    You haven t opened any. 
                          (off Abby s silence)
                    Aren t you even a little curious 
                    what he has to say?

                                  ABBY
                    I used to steal Warhols to get that 
                    man s attention, now I couldn t 
                    care less.  


      Unaware they are being watched, Abby swivels to Gloria. 

                                  ABBY
                    Your stop, Miss Morales.  

      Kate studies Gloria s preoccupied face. 

                                  KATE
                    You re way too quiet back there.  
                    You sure everything s okay?

      Gloria s about to say something but changes her mind. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Just beat.  Catch you ladies 
                    tomorrow.  

                                  ABBY
                    It is tomorrow. 

      They LAUGH.      


      Numb with grief, Kate perches on the edge of the bed.  Her 
      face is cut and bruised.  Abby appears at the door, drained.  

                                  ABBY
                    Doctor said you got the all clear. 

      Kate nods.  Abby sits next to her, emotionally spent.  

                                  KATE
                    How are you holding up? 

                                  ABBY
                    I m not.  I keep calling her cell.  
                    When I hear her voicemail message, 
                    I totally lose it.  You seem to be 
                    keeping it together.

                                  KATE
                          (smiles sadly)
                    Had a lot of practice.  After my 
                    dad passed, my mom fell apart.  I 
                    had to step up and stay strong for 
                    my brothers. 

                                  ABBY
                    You don t have to stay strong for 
                    me.

      She wraps her in a hug.  Kate s Kevlar facade crumbles.    

                                  KATE
                    We re going to find out who did 
                    this. 

                                  ABBY
                    If it s the last thing we do.

      OFF their emotional pact... 


      The Angels have almost reached the elevators when DETECTIVE 
      RAY GOODSON steps out of one.  He s 30 with handsome features 
      and a driven face.  Kate reacts in surprise.                                                                               17.


                                  KATE
                    Ray? 

                                  RAY
                    Glad to see you re okay. 

      He lifts his jacket, a detective s shield glints on his belt.

                                  KATE
                    We already gave our statements to 
                    the lead detective.

                                  RAY
                    Paperwork shuffle.  The case landed 
                    on my desk.   

      Kate reads between the lines and puts her grief aside. 

                                  KATE
                    You pulled rank because I was 
                    involved.  Didn t you?

                                  RAY
                    Don t make this personal.  

                                  KATE
                    Our best friend was just murdered 
                    and now my ex-fiance is running the 
                      investigation -- how is it not 
                    personal?   

      They lock eyes.  Neither blinks.  Abby breaks the stalemate. 

                                  ABBY
                    I don t think the cop staring power 
                    works on other cops. 

      Kate relents. 

                                  KATE
                    Where are you on leads? 

                                  RAY
                    We think Gloria s murder is gang 
                    related. 

                                  ABBY
                    No way.  Gloria hadn t been part of 
                    that world for years.  

                                  KATE
                    Cops like low-hanging fruit.  It s 
                    an obvious angle.                                                                                18.


                                  RAY
                    Ignore the obvious at your peril.  
                    Isn t that what you used to tell 
                    me?  The one time I did, it cost me 
                    my fianc e and the fast track.

                                  KATE
                    I thought we weren t making this 
                    personal. 

      He looks at her, concerned.

                                  RAY
                    Kate, please don t run around 
                    playing detective on this one.

                                  KATE
                    I don t play at anything. 

                                  RAY
                    I m trying to protect you.  A lot 
                    of your ex-colleagues are looking 
                    for any reason to lock you up.  

      She shakes her head, disappointed.  

                                  KATE
                      Appreciate the concern, Detective, 
                    but we re never letting this go.   

      Abby follows as she steps into an elevator.  OFF Ray, 
      watching the doors close...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CAMERA TRACKS Abby and Kate as they step in and stop in their 
      tracks when they see 

      AN ARMY OF PEOPLE 

      diligently checking the interior with a variety of gear, 
      everything from metal detectors to sniffer dogs.  Bosley 
      waves the Angels over, leans into the Box.                                                                               19.


                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie, they re here. 
                          (to crew)
                    Can we have the room?

      The sweeper unit files out as the girls cross to the Box.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                          (over the Box)
                    Bosley updated me from the 
                    hospital.  Thank God you re okay.  

                                  KATE
                    We re fine.  Who are all these 
                    people?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Just a precaution.  They re 
                    sweeping the Agency.  I sent teams 
                    to your homes as well.  

                                  KATE
                    You think we re being targeted?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I can t confirm that you re not.  
                          (beat)
                    Angels, tell me the truth.  Gloria 
                    was family.  Her murder is our most 
                    personal case.  I need to know 
                    you re up for the fight.

                                  ABBY
                    Bring it on.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Good to hear.  I ll back you all 
                    the way, pull any string, call in 
                    any favor -- just remember you re 
                    angels of justice, not angels of 
                      vengeance. 


      This is Bosley s parlor of high-tech cool.  Soho House-chic,  
      it s a grown boy s wonderland of monitors, hard drives and 
      arcade games.  Abby and Kate huddle around his workstation.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    I pulled this off a cigar store 
                    security camera across the street 
                    from Gloria s apartment.                                                                               20.


      The girls study a monitor featuring grainy time-coded 
        surveillance footage.    

                                  KATE
                    Does Miami PD have this?

                                  BOSLEY
                    Owner doesn't trust cops.

                                  ABBY
                    But he found the charm of the Bos 
                      irresistible?

                                  BOSLEY
                    I have an honest face and I bought 
                    50 boxes of hand-rolled 
                      Presidentes.  

      He nods to the stack of cigar boxes on the pool table. 

                                  BOSLEY
                          (re: monitor)
                    This is half an hour before you 
                    guys pulled up.  Check out the 
                    woman knocking on Gloria s door. 

        MULTISCREEN:  On the monitor, the Hispanic Woman who was 
      parked in the Jeep heads down the stairs of Gloria s 
      apartment.  The Angels study the footage.  Bosley s fingers 
      toggle the image forward.  The Angels react as the explosion 
      replays and the Jeep speeds away. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    She waits in her car and splits 
                    right after the explosion. 

                                  KATE
                    Got a clean shot of her face?

      Bosley rewinds,  boxes  the Woman s face and it pixelates 
      INTO FOCUS.  Kate s eyes narrow as she notices something.

                                  KATE
                    Enhance the shadow on her left 
                    shoulder. 

      Bosley highlights the area and expertly adjusts the contrast.  
      A familiar rose tattoo sharpens INTO VIEW. 

                                  ABBY
                    Parkway Gangsta ink just like

                    all.                                                                                 21.

                    That s my birthday. 

      Bosley s fingers fly.  There s a friendly BEEP and the 
      database s welcome page opens.  Kate masks her surprise.  

                                  ABBY
                    Do I need to fill this awkward 
                    silence by stating the obvious?  

                                  KATE
                    Please don t. 

      Bosley pastes an image of the woman s face and initiates a 
      search.  A result PINGS.  Fingerprints.  Mug shots.

                    19.  Let me widen the search. 

      He opens a search engine window.  Types in her name.  A list 
      of results pops up.  He hits one.  A formal military photo of 
      Marisa appears.  She s in uniform, standing at attention.

                    Sergeant Marisa Valdez.  Served two 
                    tours in Afghanistan.  Check out 
                    her speciality -- explosives and 
                    bomb disposal.                                                                              22.

                    She went from Street Fighter to 
                    Call of Duty.  How long has she 
                    been back in Miami?

                                  BOSLEY
                    She was dishonorably discharged 
                    three months ago.  

                                  KATE
                    No pension.  No benefits.  No 
                    future.  Maybe her old gang came 
                    calling for a freelance hit.

                    Bos, work your magic and get us an 
                    address. 

      Abby and Kate pull their guns, check their clips.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Remember what Charlie said.

                    What?  These are just conversation 
                    starters. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Abby brushes open the door with her gun and heads into the 
      interior, which is decorated in bright Caribbean hues.  Kate 
      steps in from the other side.  They meet in the galley.   

      ON THE FRIDGE  

      Kate tugs a photo from under the wing of a magnetic flamingo.   
      It features TEENAGE MARISA AND GLORIA.  Arms around each 
      other s shoulders.  

                                  KATE
                    Check it out.  G and our suspect.  
                    They look like best friends. 

      A CREAK -- on instant alert, the Angels look up just as a 
      figure CRASHES through the skylight in a shower of glass.  

      IT S MARISA!

      She lands between them, hammer-punches the gun out of Abby s 
      hand and scissor-kicks Kate s.  Marisa snatches the weapons 
      out of the air and points them at their previous owners -- 
      just as the Angels pull backup weapons and swing them up, 
      creating a four-gun Mexican standoff.    

                                  MARISA
                    For detectives, your breaking-and-
                    entering skills suck.                                                                                24.


                                  KATE
                    Why did you kill Gloria?

                                  MARISA
                    I didn t.  

      A distant RUMBLE.  Marisa looks at the plates drying on the 
      counter and sees they re RATTLING.  The SOUND grows LOUDER.  
      PUSH IN as Marisa realizes what s about to happen...

                                  MARISA
                    Take cover! 

      She dive-tackles Abby and Kate to the floor a second before   

      MACHINE GUNFIRE

      rips through the wooden ceiling and churns the interior to 
      confetti!  Broken plates and glasses avalanche.  A bowl of 
      fruit is pulped.  Abby glances up and sees they re under 
      assault from A GUNMAN standing on the skid of

      A HELICOPTER.  

      Realizing it s a deathtrap, the women scramble for the stern.  
      The aerial assault doesn t let up!  BULLETS nip at their 
      heels, decimate a sofa bed, spewing feathers into the air.      


      CAMERA TRACKS Bosley down the stairs.  He s holding a file. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    You two decent? 

      He finds Abby and Kate showered and changed.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie called.  Wanted an update. 

                                  ABBY
                    Tell him unless fly-bys are the new 
                    drive-bys -- this case isn t gang 
                    related. 

                                  KATE
                    Where are we with the police?

                                  BOSLEY
                    So far no eyewitnesses are 
                    reporting anyone fitting your 
                      descriptions leaving the marina. 
                          (holding up file)
                    I ve got Gloria s phone records. 
                    She texted Marisa at 12:35.                                                                               27.


                                  MARISA (O.S.)
                    Gloria told me you had mad hacking 
                    skills.   

      They turn as Marisa enters in fresh clothes.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    Okay, I m not a big fan of the  h  
                    word.  It s like telling Picasso 
                    he s good at throwing paint onto a 
                    canvas.  I m director of technical 
                      operations and--  

                                  ABBY
                          (interrupting, to Marisa)
                    Wait.  Gloria talked to you about 
                    us?

                                  MARISA
                    All the time.  Said you were the 
                    best crew she ever had.  

                                  ABBY
                    She never mentioned you once. 

      Marisa shrugs, sits. 

                                  MARISA
                    Not surprised.  After I enlisted, 
                    we kinda lost touch.  I wanted her 
                    to sign up too, but she wasn t into 
                    people ordering her around -- got 
                    enough of that at St. T s.  

                                  KATE
                    Is that a halfway house?

                                  MARISA
                    St. Theresa s Orphanage.  El 
                    Salvador.  We used to call it God s 
                    hellhole.  Boot camp was a cakewalk 
                    compared to that place.  
                          (to Abby)
                    Guess she didn t mention that 
                    either. 

      Kate takes the file from Bosley and paces as she scans it.

                                  KATE
                    You two have been talking a lot 
                    recently.                                                                               28.


                                  MARISA
                    When I got dropkicked by Uncle Sam, 
                    I landed pretty hard.  Gloria was 
                    helping me get back on my feet.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    I swept her hard drive.  If she was 
                    working a case on her down time, 
                    she left no trace.  

                                  KATE
                    Do you have any idea what she 
                    wanted to show you?

      Marisa shakes her head.  Kate nods to Abby who stands.  

                                  KATE
                    We need to check out the scene of 
                    the crime. 

                                  ABBY
                          (to Marisa)
                    Stay here with Bosley. 

      They grab their jackets.  Marisa rises, pissed. 

                                  MARISA
                    I look like I need a baby-sitter?  
                    Gloria called me because she 
                    thought I could help.  

                                  ABBY
                    What we re doing is a little less 
                    than legal -- we don t need any 
                    more wild cards.  Right, Kate?

      Kate assesses Marisa.

                                  KATE
                    I ve got a spare jacket upstairs.  
                    Bos, you mind showing her?  

      He gets the hint and exits with Marisa.  Abby waits until 
      they re out of earshot, then vents...

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry -- when did we go from 
                    guns in our face to sharing 
                    clothes?                                                                               29.


                                  KATE
                    I ve interrogated hundreds of 
                    guilty people, it s always in their 
                    eyes and I don t see it in hers.  
                    Besides, Gloria trusted her.

                                  ABBY
                    We don t even know if that story 
                    checks out.  Why are you so willing 
                    to give her a free pass?

                                  KATE
                    You mad at Marisa or Gloria? 

      The question hits home.  

                                  ABBY
                    Okay, I ll admit it.  I hate that 
                    Gloria kept things from us.  I 
                    mean, I m the queen of trust 
                    issues, but when it comes to you 
                    guys, I m an open book.

      Kate looks at Abby, supportive. 

                                  KATE
                    I m not suggesting we give her a 
                    gun and a key to the front door, 
                    but if she can help us find 
                    Gloria s killer, then we need to 
                    keep her close. 

      OFF Abby s nod of acceptance...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      10,000 BEES. 

      They re HUMMING on a frame oozing with honeycomb.  A puff of 
      smoke calms the horde.  GO SUPER WIDE TO REVEAL a TALL 
      FIGURE, dressed head to toe in white beekeeper s garb.  

      THIS IS CHARLIE TOWNSEND. 

      The hive is one of a trio that sits in the rose garden of...


      The decor is sumptuous.  Among the Warhols and Rothkos hangs 
        a pre-Raphaelite painting of a trio of angels.  Masked by a 
      blinding shaft of light, Charlie steps to the desk (note: we 
      do not see Charlie s face).


      Kate, Abby and Marisa are masked in shadow.

                    Since when does Miami PD have extra

                          (re: building)
                    Ladies, I got this.  


      Even in the moonlight, the extent of the damage is 
        depressingly clear.  Marisa waits as Abby helps Kate climb 
      through the window.  The women survey the damage, numb.  

                                  KATE
                    Donut patrol probably loops around 
                    every 20 minutes.  Keep the voices 
                    and flashlight beams down.  

      They CLICK on flashlights and begin to explore.  Kate looks 
      back and sees Abby hasn t moved.

                                  KATE
                    Abbs? 

                                  ABBY
                    Gloria didn t deserve this. 

      Kate puts a hand of comfort on her shoulder.  Abby takes a 
      deep breath, more determined than ever.  Water SQUELCHES 
      underfoot as they step to Marisa who kneels by the shattered 
      door.  They watch as she runs her finger down the frame.

                    The charges were positioned to kill 
                    and scorch the place.  This was a 
                      stone-cold pro job.  

                                  KATE
                    So whatever she wanted to show you 
                    is probably destroyed. 

                                  MARISA
                    Give my girl a little credit.  You 
                    grow up in an orphanage, you learn 
                    to hide things that are valuable.   

      They spread out.  The beam of Abby s flashlight glances 
      across a Charlie Brown DVD lying in the debris.  Abby scoops 
      it up.  Its case is partially melted.

                    Brown cartoons.  I think my first 
                    words were  Good grief .

      They share sad smiles, signalling a thaw in their 
      relationship. 

                                  KATE
                    Over here. 

      Abby and Marisa join Kate.  Her flashlight is aimed at a 
      picture hanging on the wall.  It features a South American 
      folk art drawing of a peacock with its tail feathers fanned.

                                  KATE
                    What s wrong with this picture?

      Abby s eyes narrow as she realizes that the frame is  
      perfectly angled while every other one has been blown right 
      off the wall or is totally askew.    

                                  ABBY
                    Nothing.

      She steps forward, feels around the frame and  hinges  the 
      right side of the frame back, revealing a compact wall safe.

                                  ABBY
                    Class-A wall safe.  Blast 
                      resistant.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                              34.

                                  ABBY (CONT'D)
                    Can withstand 2,000-degree heat.  
                    Biometric lock.  Good deterrent 
                    against a common thief -- lucky for 
                    you I m exceptional.  

      Abby flexes her fingers in anticipation. 

                                  KATE
                    How long will it take you?

                                  ABBY
                    Last time I cracked one of these, 
                    it was under two minutes.  But that 
                    was after two Cosmos and I was 
                    hanging upside down.  

      SAFE POV -- the door swings open, revealing Abby, Kate and 
      Marisa.  Abby s flashlight FLARES THE LENS as it washes 
      across the interior s only occupant.  

      A CHILD S JEWELRY BOX. 

      A delicate mosaic butterfly glitters on the lid. 

                                  MARISA
                    That was her mom s.  At St. T s she 
                    never let it go.  Even slept with 
                    the damn thing.  

      Kate places it onto a scorched tabletop.  Abby and Marisa 
      hold their flashlights steady as Kate removes  

      A BAGGIE WITH A SHOT GLASS. 

      A slip of paper is taped to its side.  Kate peels it free and 
      scans it.   

                                  KATE
                    It s a DNA analysis report, just 
                    came back yesterday.  Gloria had 
                    two samples tested.  A flake of 
                    blood from the box and saliva from 
                    this shot glass. 

      TIGHT ON THE BAGGIE:  Spangles of light bloom as Abby points 
      her flashlight through the plastic and reads the words etched 
      onto the shot glass.  

                                  ABBY
                    Club Cypher.  That s on 10th and 
                    Ocean.  Little Eurotrash for me.                                                                              35.


                                  KATE
                    Thanks for the review. 
                          (studying report)
                    The DNA samples match.  

                                  ABBY
                    I wonder who the big winner is?

      Kate sees a photo lying face down at the bottom of the box.  
      She lifts it and sneaks a peek. 

                                  KATE
                    Must be this guy. 

      She holds it up for Marisa to see.  It s a grainy 
        surveillance closeup of a handsome HISPANIC MAN in his 40s.

                                  KATE
                    Ring any bells?

      PUSH IN TO MARISA as she stares at the Man in stunned 
      disbelief.  It s like she s looking at a ghost.  

                                  MARISA
                    Can t believe she found the son of 
                    a bitch.

                                  KATE
                    Found who?

                                  MARISA
                    Pajaro. 

      Before Abby and Kate can react to that revelation, they hear 
      FOOTSTEPS and the CRACKLE OF A POLICE RADIO on the stairs.   

                                  KATE
                    We re out of here.


      Abby and Kate sprint down the street.  THUNDER booms.  

      Marisa PEELS around a corner, forged with determination.  

      The Angels weave through the CROWD waiting to get into a 
      garish Cuban bar.  Abby  brushes  past A MAN in a purple suit 
      and jacks his valet ticket.  Kate pulls out her phone. 


      Bosley s shirtless, hanging upside down in gravity boots, 
      doing crunches.  He takes Kate s call when his Bluetooth 
      earpiece flashes.  INTERCUT WITH:

                                  KATE
                          (into phone, urgent)
                    Bos, I need you to activate my 
                    LoJack. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Somebody stole your car?

                                  KATE
                    Yeah, Marisa.  Tell Charlie it 
                    looks like Pajaro is behind 
                    Gloria s murder. 

      Bosley drops to the floor and crosses to his workstation. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Pajaro?

                                  KATE
                    I don t have a lot of details.  
                    Just find my car.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    What are you doing for transpo?

                                  KATE
                    Abby s got it covered.  

      She turns as Abby pulls up in a seriously tricked-out Mazda 
      RX-7.  It s canary yellow and its sides are tattooed with 
      flaming red skulls.  Kate climbs in.                                                                               38.


                                  KATE
                    Real subtle. 

      They SCREAM off as one of Bosley s monitors flashes with a 
      LoJack map.  Marisa s location pulses.    


                                  ABBY
                    A hundred guilty faces and she s 
                    not one of them, huh?

                                  KATE
                    Please don t go there right now. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Marisa s heading down Ocean.  She 
                    just passed 7th.  

                                  ABBY
                    She s going to Club Cypher! 

      END MULTISCREEN.


      Thousands of candles of every size and shape flicker.  

                                  MARISA (V.O.)
                    Gloria and I snuck into the chapel 
                    on a dare.  We were always doing 
                    stupid stuff like that.  We were 
                    going to carve our initials on the 
                    back of this wooden angel.

      Young Marisa climbs onto a chair, reaches for the wooden 
      angel on tiptoes.  It s an exquisitely carved folk art 
      design.  She climbs down clutching the winged prize.  

                                  MARISA (V.O.)
                    That s when the trucks came. 

      Headlights wash through the windows.  The girls steal a peek. 

      WHAT THEY SEE:  A SQUAD OF MEN with machine guns leap off the 
      trucks.  Their faces are masked with bandanas.  A NUN races 
      out and is mercilessly SHOT in cold blood.   


      TIGHT ON Young Marisa and Young Gloria witnessing the 
      nightmarish execution with saucer-eyed disbelief. 


      Pajaro strides in.  There s no sign of the girls.  He pulls 
      down his bandana, leaving no doubt he s Rodrigo, crosses 
      himself, then ransacks the chapel s valuable altar pieces.                                                                                41.


      PAN TO REVEAL the girls cowering under the altar table.  
      Young Marisa clutches the wooden angel while Young Gloria 
      holds her jewelry box.  Hot tears streak their cheeks.   

      Rodrigo stuffs a chalice into his satchel, turns to go when 
      he hears the FAINTEST WHIMPER.  He swings back and in one 
      move sweeps the altar table over, revealing the girls. 

                                    RODRIGO
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                    You know what happens to strays?

      He smirks, reaches for his gun when Young Marisa whips the 
      wooden angel across Rodrigo s face, SHATTERING one wing. 

      TIGHT ON THE JEWELRY BOX as it is spritzed with blood. 

      Rodrigo staggers back, holding a cut.  Using the distraction, 
      Young Marisa and Young Gloria race out the side door.  


      Morning light bisects the space.  Abby and Kate are huddled 
      around the Box holding iPads.  Bosley hustles in, flustered. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Sorry I m late, Charlie.  Had to 
                    cab it back from North Beach. 

                                  ABBY
                    I thought you only dated girls who 
                    were geographically convenient.

                                  BOSLEY
                          (pointed)
                    I was returning a canary yellow RX-
                    7 to its irate owner. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Any problems? 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Nothing floor seats to the Heat 
                    couldn t fix.  

      He grabs his iPad and sits.  Charlie gets down to business.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I ran Nicholas Rodrigo past my 
                      intelligence sources.  

                                  KATE
                    Let me guess, he s squeaky clean. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Spotless.  Abby, did you speak to 
                    Sarah?

                                  ABBY
                    She said she was blindfolded and 
                    kept in some sort of cage.  When 
                    they shoved her in a van to take 
                    her to the hotel, she heard other 
                    girls crying out in Spanish.  

                                  KATE
                    Rodrigo must be using his 
                      Foundation to funnel girls into the 
                    country for trafficking.                                                                               44.


                                  BOSLEY
                      I squeegeed his Foundation s 
                    database.  Somehow he s kept all 
                    his illegal activity off the grid.  

                                  KATE
                    He runs a criminal enterprise in 
                    the 21st Century.  The information 
                    has to be somewhere.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Actually, it s in someone. 

      A photo of Rodrigo s female companion from Club Cypher 
      appears on their iPads.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Her name s Nadia Ivanov.  She has a 
                      photographic memory. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    One of my MIT buddies told me about 
                    this chick.  But I thought she was 
                    an urban legend.  They call her the 
                    human hard drive.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    She absconded with four million 
                    dollars from the Russian mob.  
                    Rodrigo s bodyguards aren t for his 
                      protection, they re for her.  They 
                    go with her everywhere except 
                    inside his Palm Island compound.   

                                  ABBY
                          (re: iPad)
                    According to his Twitter feed, 
                    Rodrigo s hosting a charity fund- 
                    raiser at his mansion tomorrow 
                    night.  
                          (wry)
                    The theme is heaven and hell. 
                    Sounds like we ll blend right in. 

                                  KATE
                    Big party.  Lots of security 
                      distractions.  We go undercover and 
                    grab Ivanov. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Hate to buzz-kill the plan, but 
                    don t you think the police would 
                    consider that kidnapping?                                                                               45.


                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    The police need evidence, I only 
                    need certainty.  Ivanov is the best 
                    way to link Rodrigo to his crimes 
                    and take him down. 

                                  MARISA (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      All turn as Marisa steps in. 

                                  ABBY
                    Which part of  you re benched  
                    wasn t clear?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Actually, I invited Miss Valdez. 
                    Thought she could be useful.    

      Marisa reads Abby s irritation.

                                  MARISA
                    I know I ve given you no reason to 
                    trust me, but Gloria was the only 
                    family I had.  I want to help. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    It s fortunate for you that I 
                    believe in second chances.  
                    However, my largess is finite -- 
                    don t let me down again.  

                                  MARISA
                    I won t.   

      Charlie CLICKS off.  Marisa looks at the Angels.    

                                  MARISA
                    I hope you guys are cool with this?

                                  ABBY
                    Charlie calls the shots. 

                                  KATE
                    And we re willing to go on a little 
                    faith.  

      Marisa nods, grateful.  OFF their tentative alliance...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MULTISCREEN WHEN NECESSARY:                                                                               46.



                                  KATE
                          (into earwig, concerned)
                      Security s swarming.  Marisa, where 
                    are you?


      The French door opens and Marisa steps inside.  She crosses 
      to the wall by the desk and stares up.  Only now do we REVEAL 
      the wooden angel -- the one that hung above the altar at the 
      orphange.  Marisa gently touches the broken wing.  

                                    RODRIGO (O.S.)
                    I kept that as a reminder of when I 
                    let two little girls get away. 

      Marisa spins and finds Rodrigo and a BODYGUARD. 

                                  MARISA
                    You killed my friend, you son of a 
                    bitch!                                                                              53.


                                    RODRIGO
                    I caught her checking me out in my 
                    club.  But when she didn t want to 
                    party, I got suspicious and tracked 
                    her down.  That s when I discovered 
                    the truth about both of you.

      Her grabs her chin, forces her to look him in the eye.

                                    RODRIGO
                    I guess fate gave me a second 
                    chance to correct my mistake.  

      The Bodyguard puts his finger to his earwig, listens.  Then  
      leans into Rodrigo. 

                                  BODYGUARD
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                    Ivanov s missing.  Her tracking 
                    chip s been jammed. 

      Rodrigo spins back to Marisa, who smirks triumphantly.

                                  MARISA
                    Pajaro is about to be unmasked.  

      Furious, he backhands her.  As she hits the floor, her earwig 
      is knocked free.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear. 

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                          (over earwig)
                    Marisa...


      Bosley wears catering overalls and is driving while Kate and 
      Abby watch Ivanov, who is tied up in the back. 

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    ... are you out of there? 

      A PIERCING BLAST OF FEEDBACK greets her question.  All yank 
      their earwigs and look at each other.  OFF their realization 
      that something is very, very wrong...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                              54.


                                          ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      Clouds slipstream past the windows.  Ivanov is slumped and 
      buckled in a chair, her wrist handcuffed to the armrest.  

                                  KATE
                    Time to bring the ice princess out 
                    of sleep mode.

      Abby SNAPS a vial of smelling salts under Ivanov s nose -- 
      waking her with a start.

                                  ABBY
                    Easy, the Captain hasn t turned off 
                    the fasten-seat-belt sign.  

                                  IVANOV
                    Who are you people?  Where are you 
                    taking me?   

                                  KATE
                    You re 25,000 feet over the 
                    Atlantic en route to St. 
                      Petersburg.   

      Ivanov s eyes narrow.

                                  KATE
                    Ripping off a Russian crime boss 
                    wasn t the smartest idea.

                                  IVANOV
                    Yabloko sent you?
                          (off Kate s nod)
                    I can get you three times what 
                    Yabloko s promised you.   

                                  KATE
                    We want information.  Rodrigo 
                    grabbed one of our team, where 
                    would he take her?  

                                  IVANOV
                    Turn the plane around.  I ll tell 
                    you when we re back in Miami. 

      Kate reads her body language like a seasoned interrogator.                                                                              55.


                                  KATE
                    You re lying.  She ll be dead by 
                    then.  
                          (to Abby)
                    Call Yabloko, tell him to have our 
                    money ready.  And he better not try 
                    and stiff us with counterfeit. 

      Ivanov reacts in surprise to the change of tack.

                                  IVANOV
                    What about your friend?

                                  KATE
                    She knew the risks. 

      Abby dials a satellite phone. 

                                  IVANOV
                    Wait.  Please... you don t know 
                    what he ll do to me! 

                                  KATE
                    Actually, he described it in pretty 
                    vivid detail.  You ready to talk?

      Ivanov nods her agreement.  Abby hangs up.  

                                  IVANOV
                    Rodrigo owns an abandoned wildlife 
                    park in the Everglades.  That s 
                    where he keeps the girls he 
                    traffics.  He would have taken your 
                    friend there. 

                                  KATE
                    We need an address. 

                                  IVANOV
                    13509 Turner River Highway.  
                    There s only one road in and the 
                    place is heavily guarded.  

      Abby crosses to the cockpit door and KNOCKS.

                                  ABBY
                    Bos, time to bail.  

      Suddenly, the ENGINES DIE.  Bosley exits the cockpit.  Ivanov 
      watches as Kate lifts the handle of the emergency exit. 

                                  IVANOV
                    ARE YOU INSANE!                                                                                 56.


      Kate shrugs and yanks the door open, REVEALING the plane is 
      actually stationary and sits in the middle of 

      A DARK HANGAR.  

      A Ritter fan and smoke machine work overtime.  Ivanov 
      realizes she s been conned and struggles with her cuff... 

                                  ABBY
                    Relax, at least you re not in 
                    coach.   

      Abby tosses her a bag of peanuts and exits with Kate and Bos.   

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Swampy shafts of light cut through the holes in the roof.  
      Marisa dangles by her wrists on a thick chain above the empty 
      circular pit.  She s sweat-drenched, in bad shape.  Rodrigo s 
      Bodyguard watches as his boss viciously backhands her.

                                    RODRIGO
                    Had enough?  

                                  MARISA
                    Just getting warmed up.

                                    RODRIGO
                          (losing patience)
                    Tell me who took Ivanov!  

      He snatches a Taser from the Bodyguard and brutally jams it 
      into Marisa s neck.  OFF her AGONIZED SCREAM...


      Abby spots TWO GUARDS patrolling in front of a barred cage 
      that once housed a family of Florida panthers.

                                  ABBY
                    Oh my God... look.

      Kate and Bosley follow her gaze and see 10 GIRLS penned in 
      the cage.  Most are Hispanic, and they re huddled together in 
      terror behind the bars.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    He s keeping them like animals.  

      Kate sees the Escalade parked in front of the alligator shed.                                                                              58.


                                  KATE
                    They must be holding Marisa in 
                    there -- we re going to need a 
                      distraction.  


      Marisa hangs limply.  Rodrigo realizes she s passed out.    

                                    RODRIGO
                          (to Bodyguard)
                    Ivanov isn t as strong as this one.  
                    She ll break.  It s time to slash 
                    and burn. 

      Suddenly, CEE LO S unmistakable anthem  FORGET YOU  BOOMS 
      from outside.  It GROWS LOUDER and is accompanied by the 
      sound of a ROARING engine.  


      TIGHT ON Bosley s thumb as it presses a detonator trigger. 


      Abby and Kate swing down from the tin roof of the wild cat 
      enclosure.  The grateful teens look on as Abby expertly 
      begins picking the cage s lock.    

      Bosley REVS the bus to life and ROARS forward. 

      Rodrigo freaks out, spins to his Bodyguard.

                                    RODRIGO
                          (re: Marisa, in Spanish)
                    Kill her! 

      He races out the door, brandishing an Uzi.  The Bodyguard 
      raises his Glock to kill Marisa when she jerks up her legs 
      and wraps his neck in a sleeper hold.  As they struggle...  

      Bosley pulls up to the wild cat cages and concertinas open 
      the door.  Kate hustles the liberated teens into the bus 
      while Abby takes off for the alligator shed.  

      Rodrigo races past the burning carcass of the helicopter 
      headed for his Escalade, but stops when he sees one of the 
      chopper s rotors embedded in the front of the vehicle.  

      Marisa vices the Bodyguard s neck but he breaks away and 
      swings up his gun.  Abby appears behind him, kicks the weapon 
      free, plucks it out of the air, then pistol whips him.  As he 
      drops, Marisa smiles with relief.  Abby shrugs, modestly. 

                                  ABBY 
                    Little trick I learned from a 
                    friend. 

      She helps Marisa down.

      Rodrigo races back, sees the last of the teens climbing into 
      the bus.  Furious, he OPENS FIRE!

      Kate, Bosley and the teens hit the deck as the bus is riddled 
      with DEAFENING lines of BULLETS.  When the onslaught finally 
      ends, Kate sees Rodrigo climb into a fan boat.  He takes off 
      just as Abby and Marisa head out of the alligator shed.                                                                               60.


                                  KATE
                    Bos, stay with the girls.  Call Ray 
                    at Miami PD.    

      She charges off to join Abby and Marisa.

      END MULTISCREEN.  


      Abby, Kate, Marisa and Bosley huddle around the Box.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Ivanov has agreed to turn state s 
                    evidence.  She s already given the 
                    FBI and INTERPOL a list of 
                    Rodrigo s clients past and present.  
                    They re making arrests as we speak.  

                                  KATE
                    What about the girls he trafficked?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I m working to ensure they all find 
                    safe homes and that the runaways 
                    are reunited with their families.  

                                  ABBY
                    Gloria can finally rest in peace.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I ve established a scholarship fund 
                    in her name to pay for their 
                    education -- every second chance 
                    deserves a helping hand.   

                                  MARISA
                    Somewhere out there she s smiling.   

                                  KATE
                    Those girls couldn t have picked a 
                    better patron. 

      They share a silent moment of remembrance.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    They have you three Angels to thank 
                    for their lives. 

                                  ABBY
                    Three?

      All turn to Marisa. 

                                  MARISA
                    Charlie gave me the heavy-duty 
                      recruitment speech.  I liked what I 
                    heard, but I told him no deal

      Abby considers Marisa, cracks a smile and extends her hand.

                    Welcome to the Angels, Marisa.

                    Care to join us, Charlie?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Not today, Angels.  But know I m 
                    always a phone call away.  

      The CAMERA DIVES INTO the Box and begins a dazzling CG fiber-
      optic journey.  It finally BULLETS OUT through the mouthpiece 
      of Charlie s phone.   


      Masked in afternoon shadow, Charlie disconnects and crosses 
      to admire the painting of the three pre-Raphaelite angels.  
      This is the first time we GET A LOOK at Charlie s face.  
      Enigmatic.  Wise.  Haunted.  A story yet to be told.  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:
