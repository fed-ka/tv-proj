Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
and groves of Saratoga.
The streets are well populated this morning with many
people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -
comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.
As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
Solomon to help her across.
ANNE
Solomon...
Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
waving her forward:
SOLOMON
Come, Anne. Jump.
The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.
ALONZO MARGARET
Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
it.
ANNE
I will not ruin my dress. Catch
me!
Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
replies.
(CONTINUED)
3.
SOLOMON
I will catch you, Anne.
(BEAT)
I will.
Again, lightly stern:
ANNE
You will.
And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
the delighted applause of the children. That done,
Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.
As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
this most handsome and harmonious group should be
obvious.
With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
Suddenly a voice barks out-
A VOICE (O.S.)
Jasper! Come on!
We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits
with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for
travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver
loads bags into the carriage.
For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.
SOLOMON
Travel safely.
ANNE
Stay safely.
Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the
horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty
good bye to his wife and children.
10 10
Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two
in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.
MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown
is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
him, slightly effeminate.
Moon, spotting Solomon:
MR. MOON
Call the Devil's name... There he
is now. Mr. Northup...! I have
two gentlemen who should make your
acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and
Hamilton.
BROWN
Sir.
MR. MOON
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen
were inquiring about distinguished
individuals, and I was just this
very moment telling them that
Solomon Northup is an expert
player on the violin.
HAMILTON
He was indeed.
SOLOMON
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.
(CONTINUED)

10 CONTINUED: 10
BROWN
Taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty, may
we trouble you for a moment of
your time to converse, sir?
11 11
We make a jump to a green space. Solomon, Brown and
Hamilton are sitting at a bench.
SOLOMON
A circus?
HAMILTON
That is our usual employee. The
company currently in the city of
Washington.
BROWN
Circus too constricting a word to
describe the talented and merry
band with which we travel. It is
a spectacle unlike most have ever
witnessed. Creatures from the
darkest Africa as yet unseen by
civilized man. Acrobats from the
Orient able to contort themselves
in the most confounding manners.
HAMILTON
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown;
an internationally renowned
practitioner in the art of
prestidigitation.
BROWN
We are on our way thither to
rejoin the company having left for
a short time to make a small
profit from our own exhibitions.
HAMILTON
The reason for our inquiry with
Mr. Moon...
BROWN
Yes. We had just a devil of a
time in procuring music for our

entertainments. Men of true
talent seemingly in short supply.
SOLOMON
Thank you sir...
BROWN
If we could persuade you to
accompany us as far as New York...
We would give you one dollar for
each day's service and three
dollars for every night played at
our performances. In addition we
would provide sufficient pay for
the expenses of your return from
New York here to Saratoga.
SOLOMON
You understand this is all very
sudden.
HAMILTON
Consider it an opportunity to see
THE COUNTRY--
SOLOMON
It's intriguing...
HAMILTON
If there is any way in which you
would give consideration to the
offer...
Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration.
SOLOMON
The payment offered is enticement
enough, as is my desire to visit
the metropolis.
HAMILTON
We are delighted, sir. So
delighted. Though we would add
that our travel plans--
BROWN
We would like to depart with
haste.
(CONTINUED)
10.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
SOLOMON
As luck would have it, my wife and
children are traveling. I will
write her of our plans.
BROWN
Excellent! I would beg you
collect yourself, then we may
proceed.
12 12
Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand. Brown and
Hamilton are waiting. They ride in a covered carriage
led by a pair of "noble" horses.
HAMILTON
No letter to post?
SOLOMON
No need. My return will coincide
with my family's.
BROWN
We're off then.
15 15
The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace
is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for
the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black,
and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands
are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag
hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of
Harrison at varying locations.
Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown
RIDE ONWARD IN THEIR CARRIAGE.
19 19
WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an
alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by
the street lights. He is violently ill, hunched over and
retching horribly.
HAMILTON
That's all right Solomon. No
shame in it. No shame at all.
15.
Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred
window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking
beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the
building, onto the city until clearly visible is the
Nation's capital. It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE
HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's
captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and
cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's
procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight.
27 27
It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in
by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.
The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years
old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in
education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who
answers to the name of Randall.
Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are
all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is
present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD
WATER. He throws water on the naked men.
RADBURN
Go on. Warsh up.
The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to
scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.
RADBURN (CONT'D)
The boy, too. Get him clean.
Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.
RADBURN (CONT'D)
Scrub now. Git 'em clean.
Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and
uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.
RANDALL
Do you know when my Mama will
come?
RADBURN
Hush him up!
Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to
cry.
RANDALL
Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to
come?
Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain
BEATING:
SOLOMON
Quiet, please.
Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.
RANDALL
Mama!
(CONTINUED)
21A.
30 CONTINUED: 30
Saying anything to keep the boy quiet:
SOLOMON
Your mother will come, I swear she
will, but you must be silent.
Please. Be silent!
On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall
goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws
water on the soapy men.
22.
31 OMITTED 31
Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John
and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy
enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon
is still trying to apply reason to the situation.
(CONTINUED)
22A.
32 CONTINUED: 32
Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he
calls out for his "Mama." By now, however, his calls
should feel like little more than background noise.
SOLOMON
This can't stand. It is a crime.
I believe now someone lay in wait
for me. My drink was altered...
We are free men. They have...they
have no right to hold us.
Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give
none.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
We need a sympathetic ear. If we
have an opportunity to explain our
SITUATION--
CLEMENS
Who in your estimation is that
sympathetic ear?
SOLOMON
The two men I journeyed with. I'm
certain they're making inquires at
this very moment.
CLEMENS
I would be just as certain they
are counting the money paid for
delivering you to this place.
SOLOMON
They were not kidnappers. They
were artists. Fellow performers.
CLEMENS
You know that? You know for
certain who they were?
(CONTINUED)
23.
32 CONTINUED: (2) 32
The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain.
CLEMENS (CONT'D)
How I reckon the situation:
whatever past we had...well,
that's done now. The reality to
come is us being transported
southward. New Orleans if I were
to venture. After we arrive,
we'll be put to market. Beyond
that... Well, once in a slave
state I suppose there's only one
outcome.
JOHN
No.
CLEMENS
I don't say that to give you empty
agitation, John...
JOHN
For y'all. For y'all they ain't
nothin' but that! But John was'n
kidnapped. John bein' hold as
debt, tha's all. Massa pay his
debt, and John be redeemed--
CLEMENS
Boy, our masters will not come for
us.
John is nearly beside himself with panic.
JOHN
Now John's...John's sorry for
y'all, but tha's how it be. Where
y'all goin', yah goin' witout
John. Massa take care of me.
Massa take care.
RANDALL
Mama!
All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall
doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is
Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties;
ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her
fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."
Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this
point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and
her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin
color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's
half sister.
As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,
then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly
this is mother and child being reunited.
(CONTINUED)
24.
32 CONTINUED: (3) 32
As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall.
She is overcome with emotion.
ELIZA
My darling. My sweet, sweet baby.
33 33
We now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the
children. They are being cuffed together. As John is
cuffed, he pulls back. Scared. He beings in
DESPERATION:
JOHN
John's massa gunna pay his debt.
John's massa gunna come for him.
(CONTINUED)
26-28.
35 CONTINUED: 35
Not wanting to hear any of this talk, Burch strikes John
several times in the head with a sap-like instrument.
Weakened, but again:
JOHN (CONT'D)
John's massa gunna--
Burch again strikes John until he's quiet. Curiously,
Emily and Randall don't even flinch. Why would they?
They are quite used to seeing this kind of violence.
BURCH
Not a word out of none a yah. Not
a word.
Burch and Radburn begin driving the shackled slaves from
the yard.
A36 A36
The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and
carriage. They are made to lay down side-by-side. We stay
with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them,
obscuring and blacking out their view.
At that moment, the screen is BLACKENED and we hear the
sound of the cart moving in haste.
36 36
Led by Burch, the group of slaves arrive to a dock. They
are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat
ORLEANS as the CAPTAIN, CREW and a MULATTO WOMAN WATCH,
but do not interfere.
37 37
The steamboat is en route between Washington and Norfolk.
We tilt up from the violent water foam to the powering
paddles of the boat.

We see a flat overhead view of the port of Norfolk.
Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the
day's sun as if like silver pennies. A chain of slaves
enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked
vessel.
MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and
ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT
who fights viciously with his captors. "With all haste"
is shoved down into the hold.
Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to,
Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word
spoken to Solomon or the others.
With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the
crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way
again.
The steamboat paddles pound the water, filling the whole
frame. The vessel ploughs on south.
32.
48 OMIT 48
We are back up on the deck of the ship. SOLOMON AND
CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT's body over the side of the ship.
Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the
wake of the vessel... then sinks beneath the water.
Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality:
CLEMENS RAY
Better off. Better than us.
Solomon's POV from the back of the steamship of Robert's
corpse slipping gracefully into the water.
-MID MAY, 1841-
A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands
AND BELLOWS-
RAY
Clemens...! Clemens Ray!
We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in
the young nation.
On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods
are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit
of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken
and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to
a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are
overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.
Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the
Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and
DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look
like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is
laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,
his master now represents "freedom."
(CONTINUED)
34.
52 CONTINUED: 52
CLEMENS
...My master... Master Ray, sir!
Master Ray!
Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other
slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like
dominos.
RAY
Who is in charge of this vessel?
CAPTAIN
I am the Captain.
RAY
I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor
has documentation verifying that
the Negro named Clemens Ray is my
property.
As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis:
CAPTAIN
I know nothing of--
RAY
You are ordered by court to return
that property immediately, or face
charges of thievery.
CAPTAIN
My duty is to transport goods. I
am not responsible for their
origin.
RAY
Remove these contraptions!
To his mate:
CAPTAIN
Free him!
Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs
over his master as would a lost and then found child.
RAY
It's all well, now, Clemens. You
will return home with me.
(to the Captain)
Consider this notice and warning.
(CONTINUED)
35.
52 CONTINUED: (2) 52
Ray, Davis and Clemens head away. Solomon seems both
desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray.
But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue
on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in
Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they
fade into the environs and are gone from sight.
53 53
Hours later. The slaves sit off on one side of the dock,
baking in the sun, awaiting their fate.
THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall, thin-faced man with light
complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck
calling out names from a list. The slaves STAND as they
are called.
FREEMAN
Oren. John. Lethe. Eliza.
Randall. Emily. Platt... Platt!
Solomon does not respond. Freeman looks around. He
spots Solomon.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
Captain, who shipped that nigger?
CAPTAIN
Burch.
Freeman steps to Solomon. He gives him a looking over.
FREEMAN
Stand up.
Solomon does as told.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
You fit the description given.
Why didn't you answer when called?
SOLOMON
My name is not Platt. My name is--
Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face.
FREEMAN
Your name is Platt, and I will
teach you your name so that you
don't forget.
(to the Captain)
Shackle my niggers. Get them to
my cart.
36.
54 I/E. CART - LATER 54
Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's
stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.
As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it
opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -
herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain
gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -
THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A
CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER
PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE
NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people
being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of
oppression in place.
55 55
"Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are
led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto.
The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with
ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the
pen.
Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to
each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this
new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all
that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.
56 56
The slaves are in various states of undress, men and
women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap
and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is
oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they
primp themselves.
57 57
Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and
Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss
of her two children she has dropped into a depression she
will not be able to pull out of.
(CONTINUED)
41.
60 CONTINUED: 60
They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of
the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly
called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in
front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry
house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The
plantation is described as "a green spot in the
wilderness."
With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of
activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery. MR.
CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM.
CHAPIN
Sam, call to the Mistress.
SAM
Mistress! Mistress, they arrivn'.
MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending
slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM'S WIFE - and
travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly
INQUIRES:
MRS. FORD
Did you bring all those niggers?
Two of them? You got two?
FORD
Make me something to eat, dear.
The day has taken it from me.
MRS. FORD
Let me get a look at them...
FORD
Mr. Chapin--
MRS. FORD

FORD
Separated from her children.
MRS. FORD
Oh, dear.

John Tibeats, stands before the slaves. Chapin hovers to
one side.
TIBEATS
My name is John Tibeats, William
Ford's chief carpenter. You will
refer to me as Master.
Tibeats nods in Chapin's direction:
TIBEATS (CONT'D)
Mister Chapin is the overseer on
this plantation. He is
responsible for all of Ford's
property. You too will refer to
him as Master.
This plantation covers many
hundreds of acres, and you will
traverse the Texas road between
the forest site and the sawmill in
double time. Any clever nigger on
that path that gets a little
lightfooted, I will remind him
that on one side men and
bloodhounds patrol the border and
on the other the bayou provides a
hard living, with alligators and
little to eat or drink that won't
kill you. No slave has escaped
here with his life. You're here
to work niggers, so let's
commence.
Tibeats begins to sing the song "Run Nigger, Run"
mockingly.
We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of
the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the
sawmill.
Lyrics for "Run Nigger, Run"

Run nigger run well you better get away
-END OF MAY THROUGH EARLY JUNE, 1841-
We are in a wooded area. There is A GANG OF SLAVES
chopping trees into timber. It is hard, laborious work
made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is
among them as well as Sam.
62 62
The slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon.
Again, hard work done under the ever present sun.
42B.
As Sam drives the wagon, the other slaves trudge along
side by foot. We should get the sense the travel is long
and tedious.
It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek.
There is much work being done, the slaves primarily
employed in piling the timber and chopping it into
lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the
rigors of the job at hand.
Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS.
There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing
orders.

the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is
present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to
them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by
way of compassion.
FORD
"But as touching the resurrection
of the dead, have ye not read that
which was spoken unto you by God,
saying, I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob. God is not the God of
the dead, but of the living. And
when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at his
doctrine. Then one of them, which
was a lawyer, asked him a
question, tempting him, and
saying, Master, which is the
great commandment in the law?
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind. This is the
first and great commandment. And
the second is like unto it, thou
shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself. On these two
commandments hang all the law and
the prophets."
Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope
in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED
A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY.
We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that
Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

-MID JUNE, 1841-
The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked
meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon
reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.
SOLOMON
But he that is greatest among you,
let him be as the younger; and he
that is chief, as he that doth
serve. For whether is greater, he
that sitteth at meat, or he that
serveth? Is not he that sitteth
at meat? But I am among you as he
that serveth.
A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound
of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the
Bible.
WINSLOW
From where did you thieve this?
SAM
Suh, the book is my property.
The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With
flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM. Solomon tries
to stop him. That only makes the situation worse,
Solomon now the target of the man's ire.
WINSLOW
Take your hands from me!
Ford comes running over.
FORD
What is the commotion?
WINSLOW
Your niggers are either brazen or
rebellious. This one was readin'
Scripture, and this one claims it
to be his.
FORD
It is. A gift from his Mistress.
WINSLOW
You condone this?
FORD
I encourage it. As a Christian I
can do no less.

WINSLOW
You can do no worse, Ford. A
slave that reads is dangerous.
Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford:
WINSLOW (CONT'D)
And the man who would allow a
slave to read is unfit to own
niggers!
Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly:
FORD
Pay him no mind. The word of God
applies to all. In that you may
take comfort.
71 71
OMITTED
Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to
Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it
ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings
the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road
ahead of them.
Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of
buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic
colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them
DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a
deer.
The two groups stare at each other for a long moment.
73 73
The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled.
They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of
the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As
well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN
FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;
trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a
guttural, sing-song noise.
The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon
particularly taken by the music...if not entirely
enthralled by it.
(CONTINUED)
46.
73 CONTINUED: 73
After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the
group.
Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the
river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO
DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing
waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a
thought far greater than relieving himself has come to
him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were
a man possessed.
75 75
Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as
Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making
rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.
SOLOMON
The creek is plenty deep enough to
sail, even with a boat full of
load. The distance from the WORK
AREA to the point on the latter
bayou is several miles by water
fewer than land. It occurs to me
that the expense of the
transportation would be materially
DIMINISHED--
TIBEATS
"Materially diminished?"
SOLOMON
If we use the waterway.
TIBEATS
It's a scheme. Plenty of
engineers have schemed similarly.
The passes are too tight.
SOLOMON
I reckon them at more than twelve
feet at their most narrow. Wide
enough for a tub to traverse. A
team of niggers can clear it out.
TIBEATS
And you know what of transport and
terra formin'?
(CONTINUED)
47.
75 CONTINUED: 75
SOLOMON
I labored repairing the Champlain
canal, on the section over which
William Van Nortwick was
superintendent. With my earnings
I hired several efficient hands to
assist me, and I entered into
contracts for the transportation
of large rafts of timber from Lake
Champlain to Troy.
FORD
(TO TIBEATS)
I'll admit to being impressed even
if you won't.
(TO SOLOMON)
Collect a gang, see what good you
can do.
76 76
-END OF JUNE, 1841-
WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a
TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES
ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just
a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic
to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the
slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. And
rightly they do.
Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with
which he will transport the timber.
Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP
THE CREEK WITH A TEST LOAD.
77 77
Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks
just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their
manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.
Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber
winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally
applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just
been shown up after all.
78 78
As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon
with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously
owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's
gratitude is easily expressed.
(CONTINUED)
48.
78 CONTINUED: 78
SOLOMON
My great thanks, Master Ford.
FORD
My thanks to you, and it is the
least of it. My hope is that it
brings us both much joy over the
years.
Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years"
is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now
finds himself.
79 79
-END OF JULY, 1841-
The slaves eat. All tired from a days work they conduct
themselves in silence. All except for Eliza who,
SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION, as always weeps. The
sound of her sobbing edging him up - particularly after
Master Ford's "over the years" observation. Solomon
FINALLY SNAPS:
SOLOMON
Eliza. Eliza, stop!
Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza. She does not stop. As
if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZA
VIOLENTLY.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Stop it! Stop!
ELIZA
It's all I have to keeps my loss
present.
SOLOMON
You let yourself be overcome by
sorrow. You will drown in it.
ELIZA
Have you stopped crying for your
children? You make no sounds, but
will you ever let them go in your
heart?
SOLOMON
...They are as my flesh...
(CONTINUED)
49.
79 CONTINUED: 79
ELIZA
Then who is distressed? Do I
upset the Mistress and the Master?
Do you care less for my loss than
their well being?
SOLOMON
Master Ford is a decent man.
ELIZA
He is a slaver.
SOLOMON
Under the circumstances--
ELIZA
Under the circumstances he is a
slaver! Christian only in his
proclamations. Separated me from
my precious babies for lack of a
few dollars. But you truckle at
HIS BOOT--
SOLOMON
No...
ELIZA
You luxuriate in his favor.
SOLOMON
I survive. I will not fall into
despair. Woeful and crushed;
melancholy is the yolk I see most.
I will offer up my talents to
Master Ford. I will keep myself
hearty until freedom is opportune.
ELIZA
Ford is your opportunity. Do you
think he does not know that you
are more than you suggest? But he
does nothing for you. Nothing.
You are no better than prized
livestock. Call for him. Call,
tell him of your previous
circumstances and see what it
earns you...Solomon.
Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to
underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet
he says nothing. Again, pointedly:
ELIZA (CONT'D)
So, you've settled into your role
as Platt, then?
SOLOMON

ACCUSE ME--
ELIZA
I accuse you of nothing. I cannot
accuse. I too have done so many,
many dishonorable things to
survive. And for all of them I
have ended up here... No better
than if I had stood up for myself.
Father, Lord and Savior forgive
me... Forgive me. Oh, Solomon,
let me weep for my children.
FORD (V.O.)
At the same time came the
disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who
is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven?
80 80
-AUGUST, 1841-
It's Sunday. The slaves are again gathered in the rose
garden near the front of the house to hear the word of
the Lord as read by Master Ford.
FORD
And Jesus called a little child
unto him, and set him in the midst
of them, And said, Verily I say
unto you, Except ye be converted,
and become as little children, ye
shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven.
The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to
sob uncontrollably.
Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-
MRS. FORD
I cannot have that kind of
depression about.
Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to
Eliza with worry.
Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening.
FORD
But whoso shall offend one of
these little ones which believe in
me, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his
neck, and that he were drowned in
the depth of the sea. Woe unto

-JANUARY, 1842-
Seasons have passed. It is winter now, and very grey out
along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen
working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon,
Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much
lament.
TIBEATS
Raise yer shirt.
Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon's
back, at the scars from lashings he bears.
TIBEATS (CONT'D)
Troublesome.
FORD
He's a good carpenter and quick-
witted.
TIBEATS
I am familiar with his cleverness.
FORD
You won't find a nigger more
humble.
TIBEATS
Ain't found a nigger yet I cain't
humble.
Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the
preceding.
SOLOMON
Sir, have I done something wrong?
FORD
Not your concern, Platt. I say
with much...shame I have compiled
debts. I have long preached
austerity, but find myself
hypocritical in that regard.
You'll be in the ownership of Mr.
Tibeats. You are his now. Serve
him as you'd serve me.
SOLOMON
Sir.
FORD
And your faithfulness will not be
forgotten.
(CONTINUED)
52.
81 CONTINUED: 81
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
FORD
Pride and want have been my sin.
Loss of you is but one of my
punishments.
82 82
-END OF JANUARY, 1842- [OVER ONE DAY]
We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a
Weaving House that stands off to the side of the
plantation's Great House.
At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding. Tibeats
arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work.
TIBEATS
Make them boards flush.
SOLOMON
They are, sir.
TIBEATS
They is no such thing.
Solomon runs his hands over the boards.
SOLOMON
As smooth to the touch as a
yearling's coat.
TIBEATS
Callin' me a liar, boy?
SOLOMON
Only a matter of perspective, sir.
From where you stand you may see
differently. But the hands are
not mistaken. I ask only that you
employ all your senses before
rendering judgement.
What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do
is spew invectives.
TIBEATS
You are a brute. You are a dog,
and no better for followin'
instruction.
SOLOMON
I'll do as ordered, sir.
(CONTINUED)
53.
82 CONTINUED: 82
TIBEATS
Then you'll be up at daybreak.
You will procure a keg of nails
from Chapin and commence puttin'
on clapboards.
Tibeats wheels away. Solomon goes back to his work.
After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in
the drive of the great house. It involves an
inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart
DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.
Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days
as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.
83 83
It is day break. As ordered, Solomon is up and working.
Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for
Solomon.
CHAPIN
If Tibeats prefers a different
size, I will endeavor to furnish
them, but you may use those until
further directed.
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
84 84
As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking
in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even
before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of
belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.
TIBEATS
I thought I told yah ta commence
ta puttin' on clapboards this
morn'.
(CONTINUED)
54.
84 CONTINUED: 84
SOLOMON
Yes, master. I am about it. I
have begun on the other side of
the house.
Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is
picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.
TIBEATS
Didn't I tell yah last night to
get a keg of nails of Chapin?
SOLOMON
And so I did; and Chapin said he
would get another size for you, if
you wanted them when he came back
from the field.
Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward
Solomon "with a great passion:"
TIBEATS
Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed
somethin'!
Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in
no mood for Tibeats.
SOLOMON
I did as instructed. If there's
something wrong, then its wrong
with your instructions.
TIBEATS
Yah black bastard! Yah goddman
black bastard!
In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza
to fetch a whip.
Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and
Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,
runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's
instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats
marches back whip in hand.
TIBEATS (CONT'D)
Strip yer clothes!
Solomon does no such thing.
TIBEATS (CONT'D)
Strip!
SOLOMON
I will not.
With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for
Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and
(CONTINUED)
55.
84 CONTINUED: (2) 84
raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike
the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,
Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A
violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
handle again and again and again.
TIBEATS
Yew will not live ta see another
day, nigger! This is yer last, I
swear it!
Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's
wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
then pleas for mercy:
TIBEATS (CONT'D)
Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,
help me. God be merciful!
And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-
TIBEATS (CONT'D)
Papa I'm sorry!
Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers
a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
ground.
CHAPIN
What is the matter?
Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of
dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on
SOLOMON:
SOLOMON
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me.
CHAPIN
What's the matter with the nails?
With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats
says, as if being exposed-
TIBEATS
They're...they're too large.
CHAPIN
I am overseer here. I told Platt
to use them, and
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

84 CONTINUED: (3) 84
CHAPIN (CONT'D)
I shall furnish such nails as I
please. Do you understand that,
Mr. Tibeats?
Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the
shaking of his fist.
TIBEATS
This ain't done by half. I will
have flesh, and I will have all of
it.
Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He
looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
Anxiety mounts on his features.
A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles
his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to
fetch him.
Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is
visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
an air of impending trouble.
CHAPIN
Do not stir. Do not attempt to
leave the plantation on any
account whatever. But if you run
there is no protecting you.
SOLOMON
SIR--
CHAPIN
If you run, Platt, there is no
protecting you. Rachel...!
Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a
distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log
kitchen.
Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is
to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we
continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the
unexpected mounts.
Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,
and he knows that death awaits him.
A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS
THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.
(CONTINUED)
57.
84 CONTINUED: (4) 84
Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and
watches, but does not move to Solomon.
Solomon waits, and waits...
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.
He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They
carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.
TIBEATS
Tha's the one. Tha's him.
Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
it intensely palpable.
Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,
he begins to struggle and fight.
A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
life is choked from him.
With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber
"Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with
determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and
matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't
need to be much more demonstrative.
CHAPIN
Gentlemen... Whoever moves that
nigger another foot from where he
stands is a dead man. I am
overseer of this plantation seven
years, and in the absence of
William Ford, my duty is to
protect his interests. Ford holds
a mortgage on Platt of four
hundred dollars. If you hang him,
he loses his debt. Until that is
canceled you have no claim to his
life.
Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:
(CONTINUED)
58.
84 CONTINUED: (5) 84
CHAPIN (CONT'D)
As for you two, if you have any
regard for your own safety...I
say, begone!
Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols
Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without
further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.
TIBEATS
Yah got no cause. Platt is mine,
and mine ta do with as I please.
Yah touch my property, I will 'ave
yah strung up as well.
Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment
as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He
chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the
neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the
DISTANCE:
CHAPIN
Sam! Get the mule. You must ride
to Master Ford. Tell him to come
here at once without a single
moment's delay. Tell him they are
trying to murder Platt. Hurry,
boy. Bring him back if you must
kill the mule to do so!
SAM
Yes, suh!
Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much
speed.
85 85
HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight
and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as
Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was
left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on
the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the
field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.
It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging
even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this
time and space.
(CONTINUED)
59.
85 CONTINUED: 85
Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his
hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and
better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate
Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as
though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a
property dispute, he offers no further aid.
Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the
sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches
of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in
Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he
cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes
flutter between life and lifelessness...
86 86
OMIT
Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in
sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips
dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may
very well expire before the day is over.
Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she
were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of
water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for
him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the
water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,
and leaves Solomon to hang.
88 88
The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon
remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford,
trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts,
and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache:
FORD
Platt... My poor Platt.
Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon
attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to
the ground and passes out.
89 89
-END OF JANUARY, 1842-
From the back porch, we come into the scene on EDWIN
EPPS; a repulsive and coarse man. His language gives
speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed
the advantages of an education.
(CONTINUED)
61.
90 CONTINUED: 90
Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them
altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty
years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married
to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD
and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though
in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She
is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to
Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant
sexuality.
MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits
with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH
THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY." We also see Epps's overseer
TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.
Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone
of compassion with which Ford read.
EPPS
"And that servant which knew his
Lord's will...WHICH KNEW HIS
LORD'S WILL and prepared not
himself...PREPARED NOT HIMSELF,
neither did according to his will,
shall be beaten with many
stripes..." D'ye hear that?
"Stripes." That nigger that don't
take care, that don't obey his
lord - that's his master - d'ye
see? - that 'ere nigger shall be
beaten with many stripes. Now,
"many" signifies a great many.
Forty, a hundred, a hundred and
fifty lashes... That's Scripter!
91 91
-AUGUST, 1842-
WE START THE SCENE WITH A PAIR OF BLACK HANDS
picking cotton ferociously. As we move out, we identify
PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman. The camera
moves out again to a wider shot. This reveals several
lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in
the lead.
We cut to another pair of black hands. This time,
revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking
cotton. A lash bears down on him.
It is August, "cotton picking" season.
We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It
presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of
light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to
seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches

91 CONTINUED: 91
shooting out in all directions and lapping each other
above the water furrow.
There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a
sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the
mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed
at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of
cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are
again filled.
EDWARDS
Pick that cotton. Move along now.
THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE
RUSTLE OF LABOR, THE MALE CICADAS BUGS "TYMBALS" IN THE
HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES.
Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The
slaves are "driven" by Edward, who is himself "driven" by
Treach.
TREACH
C'mon. Drive dem niggers.
Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them
without regard.
EDWARD
Pick dat cotton. Move along now,
hear?
92 92
The day's work is done. The slaves are now assembled in
the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are
being weighed by Treach. There is anxiety among the
slave, the reason for which soon becomes apparent.
TREACH
Two hundred forty pounds for Bob.
EPPS
What yah got for James?
TREACH
Two hundred ninety five pounds.
EPPS
Tha's real good, boy. Tha's real

Wiley is pulled from the line, huddled with Solomon.

In the distance, a flogging is going on. Solomon, Phebe,
and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now
being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by ANOTHER
IDENTIFIED SLAVE.
94 94
Evening, but the day is not yet done. Slaves attend
their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing
laundry, cooking food. There is no respite from a
slave's charge.

The sun has only just risen above the horizon. FROM THE

SOLOMON
Yes, Mistress.
MISTRESS EPPS
Can you find your way to
Bartholomew's?
SOLOMON
I can, ma'am.
Handing Solomon a sheet of paper.
MISTRESS EPPS
This is a list of goods and
sundries. You will take it to be
filled and return immediately.
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our
debt.
SOLOMON
I will, Mistress.
Solomon looks at the list. In a careless moment, Solomon
reads quietly from it. He catches himself, but not
before the Mistress notes his action. With high
INQUISITIVENESS:
MISTRESS EPPS
Where yah from, Platt?
SOLOMON
I have told you.
MISTRESS EPPS
Tell me again.
SOLOMON
Washington.
MISTRESS EPPS
Who were yah Master?
SOLOMON
Master name of Freeman.
MISTRESS EPPS
Was he a learned man?
SOLOMON
I suppose so.
MISTRESS EPPS
He learn yah ta read?

SOLOMON
A word here or there, but I have
no understanding of the written

MISTRESS EPPS
Don't trouble yer self with it.
Same as the rest, Master bought
yah to work. Tha's all. And any
more'll earn yah a hun'red lashes.
Having delivered her cool advice, Mistress heads back
into the house.
A101 A101
Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped
over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly
gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense
foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees
flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods.
The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet,
heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate.
The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is
silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers,
preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's
eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with
a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose
around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start
barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of
Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.
PATROLLER
(AGGRESSIVELY)
Boy, where are you going?
SOLOMON
(almost tripping over
HIS WORDS)
To the store, Sir, to
Bartholomew's. I was sent there
by Mistress Epps.
The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around
his neck, yanking him forward. He looks at it.
PATROLLER
Get there and get there quick.
The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way.
Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young
men; again there is a moment of connection.
Solomon turns. The two men are hoisted up, kicking and
spitting, behind his shoulder.
Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards
Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and

trepidation. He walks, fighting to calm himself down.
We move behind him as he continues his journey, a lonely
figure.
Solomon returns and delivers the items to the Mistress.
MISTRESS EPPS
Any trouble?
SOLOMON
No, ma'am. No trouble.

OMIT - MOVED TO A105
-JULY, 1844-
Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea
with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though
once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not
wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with
white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER.
It makes for a tranquil surreal scene.
MASTER SHAW, A WHITE MAN, IS ON THE LAWN GROOMING A
HORSE.
69.
Solomon is running flat out along the road. Running as
though his life depended on getting to his destination in
beyond a timely manner.
Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the
SHAW HOUSE.
As Solomon arrives:
MASTER SHAW
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.
SOLOMON
Good morning, Master Shaw. I've
been sent by Master to retrieve
Patsey. May I approach?
MASTER SHAW
You may.
Solomon makes his way over to the piazza.
SOLOMON
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.
MISTRESS SHAW
Nigger Platt.
SOLOMON
My apologies. Patsey, Master
wishes you to return.
PATSEY
Sabbath day. I's free ta roam.
SOLOMON
Understood. But the Master sent
me running to fetch you, and said
no time should be wasted.
MISTRESS SHAW
Drink tea?
SOLOMON
Thank you, Mistress, but I don't
dare.
MISTRESS SHAW
Would you knowed Massa Epps's
consternation ta be any lessened
wit your timely return? Sit. Sit
and drink the tea that offered.
(CONTINUED)
70.
B105 CONTINUED: B105
Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has
tea poured for him.
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D)
What'n was Epps's concern?
SOLOMON
...I'd rather not say...
MISTRESS SHAW
L'il gossip on the Sabbath be
fine. All things in moderation.
Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as
diplomatic as possible.
SOLOMON
As you are aware, Master Epps can
be a man of a hard countenance.
There are times when it is
impossible to account for his
logic. You know he has ill
feelings toward your husband.
MISTRESS SHAW
He do.
SOLOMON
Master Epps has somehow come to
believe, as incorrectly as it may
be, that Master Shaw is... That
he is something of a lothario and
an unprincipled man. A misguided
belief born out of their mutual
competition as planters, no doubt.
MISTRESS SHAW
No doubt...if not born outta truth
itself.
The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the
conversation, waves back.
SOLOMON
I'm certain Patsey's well being is
Master Epps's only concern.
MISTRESS SHAW
Nothin' Epps desire come outta
concern.
SOLOMON
I meant no disrespect.
MISTRESS SHAW
He ain't heard you.
(CONTINUED)
71.
B105 CONTINUED: (2) B105
SOLOMON
I meant no disrespect to you,
Mistress.
MISTRESS SHAW
Ha! You worry for me? Got no
cause to worry for my
sensibilities. I ain't felt the
end of a lash in 'mo years than I
cain recall. Ain't worked a
field, neither. Where one time I
served, now I got others servin'
me. The cost to my current
existence be Massa Shaw
broadcasting his affections, 'n me
enjoyin' his pantomime of
fidelity. If that what keep me
from the cotton pickin' niggers,
that what it be. A small and
reasonable price to be paid 'fo
sure.
Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D)
I knowed what it like to be the
object of Massa's predilections
and peculiarities. And I knowed
they can get expressed with
kindness or wit violence. A lusty
visit in the night, or a
visitation from the whip. And wit
my experience, if'n I can give
comfort, then comfort I give. And
you take comfort, Patsey; the Good
Lord will manage Epps. In His own
time the Good Lord will manage dem
all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day
comin' that will burn as an oven.
It comin' as sure as the Lord is
just. When His will be done...the
curse on the Pharos is a poor
example of all that wait 'fo the
plantation class.
Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a
slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG
WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip
of her tea.
105 105
Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw's. Waiting on
the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for
Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious.
(CONTINUED)
72.
105 CONTINUED: 105
EPPS
Pats...! Patsey!
SOLOMON
Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.
Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and
moves toward the pair in a rage.
EPPS
Patsey...!
Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off
as Patsey continues on. Playing up his "ignorance" of
THE SITUATION:
SOLOMON
Found her, Master, and brought her
back just as instructed.
EPPS
What'd you jus now tell her?
What'd you say to Pats?
SOLOMON
No words were spoken. None of
consequence.
EPPS
Lie! Damned liar! Saw you
talkin' with 'er. Tell me!
SOLOMON
I cannot speak of what did not
occur.
Epps grabs Solomon.
EPPS
I'll cut your black throat.
Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE
PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around
the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,
however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as
speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can
even get close to the slave.
Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:
(CONTINUED)
73.
105 CONTINUED: (2) 105
EPPS (CONT'D)
Platt... Platt, liquor filled me.
I admit that it did, and I done
over reacted. It's the Lord's
day. Ain't nothin' Christian in
us carryin' on like this. Help me
ta my feet, and let us both pray
to the Lord for forgiveness.
Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon
moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within
striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases
Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
drops down. And again offering a treaty:
EPPS (CONT'D)
I'm all done in, Platt. I have
met my limitations, and I ain't
equal to 'em. I concede to yah,
but in the name of valor, help yer
master to his feet.
Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is
attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is
too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE
PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING. A CHANGE
OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY BLEAKNESS OF SLAVE
LIFE.
Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair.
MISTRESS EPPS
What? Wha's the fuss?
SOLOMON
A misunderstanding is all. It
began when I was sent to retrieve
Patsey from where she'd taken
sabbatical at Master Shaw's. Upon
returning, Master Epps believed
Patsey and me to be in
conversation when we were not. I
tried to explain, but it lead to
all this.
MISTRESS EPPS
What is it? Ya cain't remain the
Sabbath without her under your
eye? Ya are a no-account bastard.
EPPS
Hold a moment...
MISTRESS EPPS
A filthy, godless heathen. My bed
is too holy for yah ta share.

EPPS
Wha's...wha's he been tellin' yah?
MISTRESS EPPS
Of yer misbegotten ways.
EPPS
And he would know what of
anythin'? I ain't even spoken
with him today. Platt, yah lyin'
nigger, have I? Have I?
Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains
silent.
EPPS (CONT'D)
There; there's all the truth he
got. Damned nigger. Damn yah.
Epps pushes his way past the Mistress.
106 106
-AUGUST, 1844-
With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A
SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the
tedium at hand.
But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry
begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse
right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,
none move to help him. None dare.
From Treach rather matter of factly:
TREACH
Get him water.
Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry,
DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY
ANYTHING TO DRINK.
Roused, Henry rights himself.
EDWARD
Go'won. Git up.
Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking
cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the
song is all that can keep him going.
107 107
On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -
Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his
manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and
clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape
and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain
as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is
vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to
violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
from her. When that fails, he punches her which only
leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,
Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep
breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left
him.
Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.
109 109
Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.
He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the
store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When
he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens
it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he
folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up
the sack and continues on his way.
76.

-JULY, 1846-
Hard times on the planation. Where previously the field
in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and
under grown.
The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but
rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms
have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.
We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among
and destroying the cotton crop.
Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined
field.
EPPS
It is a plague.
TREACH (O.S.)
Cotton worm.
EPPS
A plague! It's damn Biblical.
Two season God done sent a plague
to smite me. I am near ruination.
Why, Treach? What I done that God
hate me so? Do I not preach His
word?
TREACH (O.S.)
The whole Bayou sufferin'.
EPPS
I don't care nothin' fer the damn
Bayou. I'm sufferin'.
Epps looks among his slaves at work, his enmity growing.
EPPS (CONT'D)
It's that Godless lot. They
brought this on me. I bring 'em

115 CONTINUED: 115
EPPS (CONT'D)

Crazed, Epps runs into the field, taking himself from
slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay
his hands on.
EPPS (CONT'D)
Damn you! Damn you all! Damn
you!

RE-OMIT
-OCTOBER, 1846-
Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a
cart. SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM. Epps has
delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man
and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on
Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf. Epps and
Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as
Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch.
One of the slaves whisper under their breath.
EPPS' SLAVE
I hear cutting cane is twice as
hard as picking cotton.
BOB
But at least we'll be away from
Master Epps.
UNCLE ABRAM
Boy, you two have no sense.
Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting
salutation.
EPPS
Yer Judge Turner's for the season.
More if need be, until my crop
return. Yah'll bring no
disrespect to me, and yah'll bring
no biblical plagues to him. Be
decent, ere mark my words, I will
deliver an ungodly whippin'.
118 118
An OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON
AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane. WITH A KNIFE IN HAND
he demonstrates the process:
OVERSEER
Draw the cane from the rick, cut
the top and flags from the stalk,
understand? Leave only that part
which is sound and healthy. Cast
off the rest...
120 120
-NOVEMBER, 1846-
ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are
divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,
the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the
rows after.
Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves
with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he
displayed picking cotton.
Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.
121 121
Solomon waits outside the house on the porch. A house
servant - ZACHARY - approaches and admonishes Solomon.
ZACHARY
Off the porch. Get off.
Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down.
Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to
Solomon.
SOLOMON
...Sir...
JUDGE TURNER
Platt is it? Have you cultivated
cane previously?
SOLOMON
No, sir, I have not.
JUDGE TURNER
You take to it quite naturally.
Are you educated?
(CONTINUED)
83.
123 CONTINUED: 123
SOLOMON
Niggers are hired to work, not to
read and write.
Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives
Solomon a wary looking over.
JUDGE TURNER
You play the fiddle?
SOLOMON
I do.
JUDGE TURNER
Willard Yarney, a planter up the
bayou, celebrates his anniversary
in a three week's time. I will
hold out your name to him. What
you earn is yours to keep.
SOLOMON
Sir.
JUDGE TURNER
Mind yourself, Platt.
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
Work over, the slaves congregate to eat.
As Solomon eats, he takes note of the JUICE FROM SOME
BERRIES ON HIS PLATE.
Solomon plays with a piece of cane, fashions it into some
kind of writing tool, testing it in the mud. He then
brushes over the dirt with his hand.
84.
Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting
by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his
fiddle. It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.
Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed
berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.
The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.
Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some
scraps of food with him, which he snacks on.
A127 A127

His playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to
Judge Turner's on foot. There is only the moonlight with
which to light the way. As he walks, Solomon eats from a
HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from
the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the
brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of
the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.
SOLOMON
C'mere. C'mon, boy.
(CONTINUED)
85.
128 CONTINUED: 128
This time, there is no dog. Instead, from the dark and
the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks
the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves
covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not
just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.
At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.
Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.
Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is
attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back,
PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the
head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men
retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.
A129 A129
Outside of the slave shacks Solomon's wound tended by
Uncle Abram. As he works on it:
UNCLE ABRAM
Runaways I would expect. The
Bayou full with 'em. They nothin'
'mo dangerous than a nigger in
flight.
SOLOMON
They acted out of desperation.
UNCLE ABRAM
Act outta lunacy. Heads fulla
stories 'bout life up north. Yah
ever been north, Platt?
SOLOMON
...No...
UNCLE ABRAM
And never should yah be. I hope
that yah never bear witness the
sorry condition of the northern
black. Got neither no purpose,
nor direction. They jus...they
jus fall about the streets in
search of sustenance of both body
and spirit.
SOLOMON
You know this to be so?
UNCLE ABRAM
Two of my massas tolt me.

-FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847-
Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a
low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the
edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen
from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of
about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.
"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond
that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.
It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in
her dress.
Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As
Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite
PLAINLY:
CELESTE
I am hungry. Give me food.
SOLOMON
Who are you?
CELESTE
I'm hungry.
Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,
famished, devours it.
SOLOMON
What is your name?
CELESTE
My name is Celeste.
SOLOMON
What are your circumstances?
CELESTE
I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave
been two days among da palmettoes.
Celeste is sick and cain't work,
and would rather die in the swamp

Massa's dogs won't follow me. The
patrollers 'ave tried to set dem
on me. But dey a secret between
dem and Celeste, and dey won't
mind the devilish orders of the
overseer.
Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Do you believe me?
SOLOMON
Yes.
CELESTE
Why?
SOLOMON
There are some whose tracks the
hounds will refuse to follow.
CELESTE
Give me more food. I'm starvin'.
SOLOMON
This is all my allowance for the
REST OF--
CELESTE
Give it to me.
Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she
eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Most slaves escape at night. The
overseers are alert for such
chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem
'n alight in the middle of the day
wit the sun up at its highest.
The place of my concealment now
deep in the swamp, not half a mile
from Massa's plantation, and a
world apart. A world a tall
trees whose long arms make fo' a
canopy so dense dey keep away even
the beams of the sun. It twilight
always in Celeste's world, even in
the brightest day. I will live
there, and I will live freely.
The overseers are a cowardly lot.
Dey will not go where their dogs
show fear and where it always be
night. Others will join me in the
twilight, and we ain't gunna be
slaves no 'mo forever.

Solomon isn't sure what to say. Before he can say
ANYTHING:
CELESTE (CONT'D)
Celeste will come to you again in
the night. You will have food for
her.
Celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a
vision.
131 131
Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious
nature as he waits.
Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is
Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way
directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says:
CELESTE
I am hungry.
Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She
opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats:
CELESTE (CONT'D)
I was rude, and didn't even ask yo
name.
SOLOMON
Platt.
(BEAT)
Solomon. Solomon is my true and
free name.
CELESTE
Was you free?
SOLOMON
I was. I am.
Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he
ANNOUNCES:
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
I remain free in my heart.

Giving a laugh as though it's the silliest thing she's
HEARD:
CELESTE
Free heart means nothin if'n yo

SOLOMON
I will not.
CELESTE
How? Celeste knows you ain't
gunna run. Celeste knows it ain't
your nature.
SOLOMON
I have a plan. I have a letter.
CELESTE
A letter? How'll yah mail da
letter? Who yah trust to post it?
A nigger that can read and write
is a nigger that'll hang.
There is a pause. Solomon can't answer this question. It
is the glaring hole in his plan.
Having finished eating:

Solomon is picking at the bark off a WHITE MAPLE.
In a tin cup, over a fire, Solomon boils the white maple
bark in just a bit of water.
Solomon sits with Celeste. He relates his news to her.
SOLOMON
I have my letter.
CELESTE
Yah has your freedom then?
SOLOMON
All that remains is to contrive
measures by which the letter can
safely be deposited in the post
office.
When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy.

Solomon gives an unnerved look. This is not good news.
SOLOMON
Is it more food you need?
CELESTE
I live in fear.
SOLOMON
None will come after you in the
swamps.
CELESTE
It ain't the patrollers I scared
of... At all seasons the howling
of wild animals can be heard at
night along the border of the
swamps. At first their calls were
welcomin'. Dey too was free, 'n I
thought dey greeted me like a
sistah. Lately, dey cries have
turned horrifyin'. They mean to
kill Celeste.
SOLOMON
The solitude plays tricks. It's
your impression, nothing more. If
you go back to your master you
could face the same.
CELESTE
My freedom been nothin' but a
daydream. So was Celeste's
thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in

To return is to die!

Celeste got no one to write a

As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more
Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into
the swamp after her.
SOLOMON
Celeste... Celeste!
Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the
dark night and murky waters.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Celeste, I will guide you north!
Wait, and I will take you.
Celeste is too nimble. She outpaces Solomon, continues
on and disappears into the night.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Let me take you! Let me go with
you!
Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. He stumbles
around disoriented, calling into the blackness:
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Celeste...
Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds
and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving
closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more
frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite
literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then
neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to
guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to
crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way

back to shore. No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon
calls to her - desperately - for assistance.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Celeste! Come to me, Celeste!
In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly
done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this
is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible.
It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or
maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he
reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling
himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses
in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste
never to be seen again.

-MAY/JUNE, 1847-
We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps
stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits
as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way
wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
gathered.
The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully
returned.
EPPS
A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark
times is behind us. Clean livin'
'n prayer done lifted the plague.
Indicating to the cotton:
EPPS (CONT'D)
As thick 'n white as New England
snow. 'N now my niggers is
returned to me.
(TO SOLOMON)
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.
Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?
Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.
Not on my land. Much work to do.
Days of old long since, eh?
Joyous! Joyous indeed!
Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey
who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE
HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms
display many new scars. It's clear that in the
intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
boy for Epps and the Mistress.
94.
-JULY, 1847-
The slaves are out working on the field. White hands
appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at
picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job.
As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short
on self-motivation. In anachronistic terminology, he'd
be called a "slacker." He joins in with the slaves,
singing a spiritual.
141 141
We come in after the punishment has been dealt. Patsey
tends to Uncle Abram's back as Armsby applies liniments
to Solomon's. As he does, Armsby muses:
ARMSBY
It's a tragedy. How does such
come to pass? Working a field and
picking cotton like a lowly hand.
I'm of a damn sight better
station. And my desires never
lacked for a grandiose component,
though I will admit they have at
times been short on ingenuity.
But only at times. I've worked as
an overseer, you know.
SOLOMON
I did not, sir.
ARMSBY
Not "sir." Just Armsby. Not owed
more than any other in the field.
I worked plantations from
Virginia, down into Alabama. I
could manage easy a hundred slaves
and have done so. But to toil in
the field? Never thought that
would come to pass. Never. But
times are desperate. Where once I
had said "no" to Epps and his
merger offerings, I returned cap

in hand. ...Look at what I've
become.
SOLOMON
How did you arrive at such a
place, if I may ask?
ARMSBY
Ask. It's just conversation.
From a pocket Armsby produces a flask.
ARMSBY (CONT'D)
I became a little too dependant on
the whisky, a little too
undependable on the job. Before
you say I'm just a sorry drunkard,
let me state my case: As reliable
employment as overseeing is, it's
no easy chore on the spirit. I
say no man of conscious can take
the lash to another human day in,
and day out without shredding at
his own self. Takes him to a
place where he either makes
excuses within his mind to be
unaffected... Or finds some way
to trample his guilty sensations.
Well, I trampled.
Armsby takes a drink.
ARMSBY (CONT'D)
And with frequency.
SOLOMON
Where is your place of birth?
ARMSBY
Maryland. Have you traveled
there?
SOLOMON
...I cannot say that I have.
ARMSBY
Fine country. More seasonal than
the bayou. A deal less humid.
SOLOMON
Why did you leave it?
ARMSBY
To make my fortune, of course. I
gave in to tales of wealth and
prosperity that were the lore of
the southern states: all that's
needed being a patch of land and a
few good growing seasons. Cotton,

or tobacco. And then locating a
proper bank in which to store your
riches. But such profitable
outcomes are reserved for the
plantation masters. It's the lot
of the rest of us to serve. So I
settled on being an overseer, and
failed as well at that. In the
meantime my dreams gave way to
reality. Now, I want nothing more
than to earn a decent wage.
(BEAT)
And get myself home.
Armsby takes another drink and leans back.
143 143
With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
working the field picking cotton. As before they sing a
spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the
tedium at hand.
But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Uncle
Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the
ground.
Treach calls to Edward:
TREACH
Get him water.
Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and
DUMPS ON HIM...BUT ABRAM DOES NOT RISE. DOES NOT MOVE.
At this point, the sounds of the singing from the others
tapers off as they realize Abram isn't getting up.
145 145
We are beyond the main of the plantation, the cotton
field in the background. We are at the slaves' cemetery,
a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground.
Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when
we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt. The
uncovered body of Abram lays near. Having dug down an
appropriate distance, the three men take the body and,
very unceremoniously, place it into the ground. Holding

the shovel in his hands, and resting it by his feet, Bob
tilts his head down and closes his eyes. The others do
the same. Almost stutteringly, not really knowing what to
SAY--
BOB
I just want to say something about
Uncle Abram. He was a good man and
he always looked out for us since
we were little. God Bless him. God
love him. And God keep him.
That done, they begin to cover it with dirt. It is all
the more of a funeral that Abram will receive.

147 OMIT 147
A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to
sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan." A response of
"Oh Yeah" quickly follows. Again the singer continues,
"where John baptized three."
The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now
filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have
created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to
transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy
which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has
been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's
captivating, infectious.
This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the
audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the
seemingly chastising environment.
The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist,
some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher,
because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny." And
with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe.
Oh, I believe."
148 148
Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is
conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon
works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he
normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a
matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.
But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and
talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward
Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.
152 152
Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the
shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,
Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to
his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from
a FLASK.
Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a
friend, and guides him into the woods.

letters and tries to get white
fellows to mail 'em.
Solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off.
EPPS (CONT'D)
Well, Armsby tol' me today the
devil was among my niggers. That
I had one that needed close
watchin' or he would run away.
When I axed him why, he said you
come over to him and waked him up
in the middle of the night and
wanted him to carry a letter to
Marksville. What have yah got to
say to that?
SOLOMON
All I have to say, master, is all
that need be said. There is no
truth in it.
EPPS
You say.
SOLOMON
How could I write a letter without
ink or paper? There is nobody I
want to write to 'cause I hain't
got no friends living as I know
of. That Armsby is a lying
drunken fellow. You know this,
just as you know that I am
constant in truth. Now, master, I
can see what that Armsby is after,
plain enough. Didn't he want you
to hire him for an overseer?
A beat.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
That's it. He wants to make you
believe we're all going to run
away and then he thinks you'll
hire an overseer to watch us. He
believes you are soft soap. He's
given to such talk. I believe
he's just made this story out of
whole cloth, 'cause he wants to
get a situation. It's all a lie,
master, you may depend on't. It's
all a lie.
For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go.
Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and
equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's
thoughts. In a low curse that clearly states his ill
intentions.
(CONTINUED)
102.
153 CONTINUED: (3) 153
Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the
conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up
against Solomon's stomach. As Epps speaks, he closes it
and taps it on Solomon's shoulder.
EPPS
I'm damned. I'll be god... Were
he not free and white, Platt.
Were he not free and white.
Epps heads off. Solomon is left to exhale a deep breath.
154 154
Having found a lonely spot, Solomon has struck a SMALL
FIRE. He has in his hand his letter. With no ceremony,
he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn.
And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever
being free. He stands and looks at it as if forever, as
ashes descend into the night sky.

-MARCH, 1852-
The slaves are now employed working on an extension to
the Great House. The slaves work under the direction of
MR. SAMUEL BASS, a between forty and fifty years old, of
light complexion and light hair. He is cool and self-
possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with
extreme deliberation as well as a Canadian accent.
B155 B155
As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation
going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the
art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled
mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does
little more than joke his way around the facts.
Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps
offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.
EPPS
Take it. You look unsettled.
BASS
I'm well.

No shame in taking respite from
the heat; drink, shade. It's
ungodly for travelers. Hearty, or
otherwise.

BASS
Your humor is inadvertent.
Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense,
Epps presses.
EPPS
Then share what's funny. Or what
ills you.
BASS
I'm here to complete the work at
hand. As requested, and as paid.
EPPS
Something rubs you wrongly.
Before I take further offense, I
offer you the opportunity to speak
on it.
BASS
You ask plainly, I will tell you
plainly. What I find amusing: You
worry about my well being in the
heat but, quite frankly, the
condition of your laborers--
EPPS
"The condition of my..." What in
the hell are you--
BASS
It is horrid. It's all wrong.
All wrong, sir.
EPPS
They ain't hired help. They're my
slaves.
BASS
You say that with pride.
EPPS
I say it as fact.
BASS
If the conversation concerns what
is factual and what is not;
there's no justice nor
righteousness in slavery. I
wouldn't own a slave if I was rich
as Croesus, which I am not, as is
perfectly well understood. More
particularly among my creditors.
There's another humbug: the credit
system. Humbug, sir. No credit,

slavery; what right have you to
your niggers when you come down to
the point?
EPPS
What right? I bought 'em. I paid
for 'em.
BASS
Of course you did. The law says
you have the right to hold a
nigger, but begging the law's
pardon...it lies. Is everything
right because the law allows it?
Suppose they'd pass a law taking
away your liberty and making you a
slave?
EPPS
Ha!
BASS
Suppose.
EPPS
That ain't a supposable case.
BASS
Because the law states that your
liberties are undeniable? Because
society deems it so? Laws change.
Social systems crumble. Universal
truths are constant. It is a
fact, it is a plain fact that what
is true and right is true and
right for all. White and black
alike.
EPPS
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yah compare me
to a nigger, Bass? Yah might as
well ask what the difference is
between a white man and a baboon.
Now, I seen one of them critters
in Orleans that knowed just as
much as any nigger I got. Yah'd
call them fellers citizens, I
s'pose?
BASS
Look here; you can't laugh me down
in that way. These niggers are
human beings. If they are allowed
to scale no higher than brute
animals, you and men like you will

BASS
That will not go unpunished
forever. There will be a
reckoning yet.
EPPS
You like to hear yourself talk,
Bass, better than any man I know
of. Yah'd argue that black was
white, or white black if anybody
would contradict you. A fine
supposition if yah lived among
Yankees in New England. But yah
don't.
(POINTED)
You most assuredly do not.

It's the Sabbath. The slaves are left to themselves to
do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are
washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their
clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry
near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It
is a sight of ritual. Missing from the field of labor is
Patsey, for whom Epps hollers.

Patsey... Patsey!
A drunk Epps asks of the slaves:

The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to

drops into true sorrow.
EPPS (CONT'D)
She gone... My Pats gone.
156 156
Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. He looks
up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION. Epps
steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief.
As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from
where they are hanging their laundry to dry. Treach is
near as well.

Run off. Run off, did you?

Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress.

Treach runs quickly to the tool shed. In short order he
returns with the rope in hand.

Strip her. Strike her bare 'n

Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She
gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction.
Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his
whip.
EPPS (CONT'D)
Yah done this to yerself, Pats!
Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high...but no
matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the
blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating
and spurring him on.
MISTRESS EPPS
Do it! Strike the life from her.
Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand
ahead of the act... But he does not have it in him to
deliver such a beating. Turning to Solomon, thrusting
the whip at him:
EPPS
Beat her.
Solomon doesn't move. Epps shoves the whip into his
hand.
EPPS (CONT'D)
Give her the whip. Give it all to
her!
Patsey, begging to Solomon:
PATSEY
I'd rather it you, Platt.

Strike her, or yah'll get the

156 CONTINUED: (4) 156
Solomon takes a step back. He unfurls the whip... He
begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms
before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too
distraught to watch.
But the Mistress... She is not satisfied with Solomon's
half-hearted effort.
MISTRESS EPPS
He pantomimes. There ain't barely
a welt on her. That's what your
niggers make of yah; a fool fer
the takin'.
Epps's grief is replaced by fury. EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL
FROM TREACH'S HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves.
EPPS
Yah will strike her. Yah will
strike her until her flesh is rent
and meat and blood flow equal, or
I will kill every nigger in my
sight!
Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life.
But from the ground, from Patsey:
PATSEY
Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I
am dead.
What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly
whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey
screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again...
After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is
not satisfied.
EPPS
Until I say no more! I ain't said
nothing!
Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as
promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE
THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD.
Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do
no more.
EPPS (CONT'D)
Strike her! Strike her!
Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips
Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. The
painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and
dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases
struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.

Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die
away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying.
Solomon, screaming at Epps:
SOLOMON
Thou devil! Sooner or later,
somewhere in the course of eternal
justice thou shalt answer for this
sin!
Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying
anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.
EPPS
No sin! There is no sin! A man
does how he pleases with his
property. At the moment, Platt, I
am of great pleasure. You be
goddamn careful I don't come to
wantin' to lightenin' my mood no
further.
By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in
the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the
foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign
everywhere.
Everywhere else.
Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the
Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back
into the house.
Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the
cabin.

Solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or
more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly
slung over his right shoulder. Drearily he walks. His
eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left.

SLOW DISSOLVE
To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.
Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels
away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons
Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who
are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon
approaches, Bass shouts-
BASS
And bring those markers!
Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and
approaches Bass.
BASS (CONT'D)
No letter yet.
SOLOMON
You are certain?
Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the
earth.
BASS
I have inquired thoroughly. More
than is safe for either of us.
Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground,
improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.

Solomon...I have a job or two on
hand which will be completed
shortly... The work here has
grown sparse.

Bass doesn't need to spell things out for Solomon.
Solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation
should be very clear.

You must know, wherever I am I

SOLOMON
Five months. On top of these
years. No cause remains.
BASS
If there is any chance...
SOLOMON
Mr. Bass...
BASS
I will continue to write your
PEOPLE--
SOLOMON
Go home knowing you have tried.
The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both
men. Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES
SOLOMON'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND
SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen
making contact with a slave. But in the strength of
their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold
each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.

Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
something that is a million miles away.
Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
He then repeats the action.
Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
ground.
He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
an odd way, respectful.

The Slaves are sewing the heavily plowed field, making
their way in the trying soil. Solomon, too focused to
note the arrival of two men by carriage: Parker and the
SHERIFF.
While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Parker
remains with the carriage. The Sheriff calls:
SHERIFF
Platt...? Where is the boy called
Platt?
SOLOMON
...Sir...
The Sheriff crosses to him.
SHERIFF
Your name is Platt, is it?
SOLOMON
Yes, sir.
Pointing off to the distance.
SHERIFF
Do you know that man?

Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his
eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him.
But when it does, it hits him as a rush.
SOLOMON
Mr. Parker...?
(CONTINUED)

168 CONTINUED: (2) 168
Solomon starts for Parker, but he is pulled back by the
Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity.
SHERIFF
Say again?
SOLOMON
Mr. Parker?
As he does, Epps makes his way over.
SHERIFF
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations. You
look me in the eye and on your
life answer me truthfully: have
you any other name than Platt?
SOLOMON
Solomon Northup is my name.
EPPS
Sheriff...
SHERIFF
Have you a family?
EPPS
What's all this?
SHERIFF
It's official business.
EPPS
My nigger, my business.
SHERIFF
Your business waits.
(TO SOLOMON)
Tell me of your family.
SOLOMON
I have a wife and two children.
SHERIFF
What were your children's names?
SOLOMON
Margaret and Alonzo.
SHERIFF
And your wife's name before her
marriage?
SOLOMON
Anne Hampton. I am who I say.
Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward
Parker, his pace quickens with each step until his

personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two
old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other
in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by
Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff.

EPPS
Nah... You will unhand 'em.
Platt is my nigger!
PARKER
He is Solomon Northup.
EPPS
You say...
PARKER
He belongs to no man.
EPPS
You say! You come here,
unfamiliar to me, and make claims.
SHERIFF
Not claims. I have no doubts.
This is Solomon Northup, a
resident of Saratoga Springs, NY.
EPPS
To hell with that! My nigger, and
I'll fight you for 'em!
PARKER
As is your right. As it will be
my pleasure to bankrupt you in the
courts. Your decision.
By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome
their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered
in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,
out of sight of Epps.
Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda
next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed
emotion.
Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds
his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance
that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there
to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to
BACK DOWN:
EPPS
You think this is the last you'll
see of me, boy? It ain't.
(TO PARKER)
Whatever paper you hold about his
freedom, it don't mean naught. He
is my nigger - and I will have my
day in court, sir. As God as my
witness, I will have my day in
court. Take 'em!
Epps calls to Bob-

EPPS (CONT'D)
Saddle my horse! And bring her up
here.
Epps walks back into the plantation.
The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back
by the call of Patsey's voice:
PATSEY
Platt...
Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
Solomon and they embrace.
Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
rides off furiously.
Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:
PARKER
Solomon...if we know what's wise,
we should depart.
A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They
separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and
Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they

start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the
ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining
state, the other slaves around her.
WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.
Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a
bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
forever more.

-MARCH, 1853-
We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-
PARKER
Are you ready?
Solomon swallows and nods.
