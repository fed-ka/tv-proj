      FADE IN:

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - EVENING (DAY ONE)

      BLAKE messes with the TV in a homemade pro wrestling outfit.

                                  BLAKE
                    Tell me this isn t happening.  This 
                    is not happening.   

      ADAM, with beers, and DERS, with panini sandwiches, enter.  
      They re also dressed up in homemade outfits, Adam as a 
      wrestler and Ders as a referee.  

                                  ADAM
                    Turn it on, dude.  

                                  BLAKE
                    I m trying.  

                                  DERS
                    Turn it on, bro.  The panini are 
                    getting cold.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s busted!

                                  ADAM
                    Quit messing around and turn on the 
                    goddamn TV!  

                                  BLAKE
                    IT S BROKE, DUDE!  IT WON T TURN ON!

                                  ADAM
                          (in wrestler voice)
                    THEN HOW THE FUCK ARE WE GOING TO 
                    WATCH MONDAY NIGHT RAW, BROTHER?!  

                                  DERS
                    GUYS!  Relax.  This could be a 
                    blessing in disguise.

                                  BLAKE
                    Ders, in case you forgot we are 
                    hosting our annual Wrestlemania 
                    party this weekend and it s like, 
                    something we re known for!                Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         2.


                                  ADAM
                    And if we miss Raw tonight, how are 
                    we gonna keep up with the story 
                    lines, come Mania time?!   

                                  DERS
                    But who needs a TV when we ve got 
                    an entire wall of entertainment?

      Ders points to their BOOKSHELF.  It s dusty and dark -- 
      clearly no book has been read in a long time.  

                                  BLAKE (PRE-LAP)(O.S.)
                    PULL!

      EXT. GUYS  HOUSE - ROOF - LATER

      Anders tosses a book in the air and Blake chops at it with a 
      samurai sword.  This throws us into...

      QUICK POPS OF THE GUYS BEING  ENTERTAINED  BY BOOKS:

      1.  The guys jump-kick tall stacks of books.

      2.  Adam tries to rip a book in half with his bare hands.

      3.  Blake pitches Ders a book.  Ders hits it with a bat.

      4.  The guys strap fire-crackers to books.  A neighbor sees.

      5.  Adam tosses a flaming  book grenade  into a burning stack.

      END MONTAGE.

      Ders grabs a book. 

                                  DERS
                    I wanna do a book grenade!

      Adam torches the book and it accidentally catches onto 
      Blake s hair.  His hair LIGHTS ON FIRE.  He freaks out and 
      JUMPS OFF THE ROOF into the pool, extinguishing the fire.

                                  BLAKE
                    I m OK! 

                        DERSADAM
      We have to get a TV.That was awesome, I m next-- 
                                                  yes, TV, let s.

                    Alright, well, we have a special 
                    treat today.  The people at

                    our sales of their refrigerators 
                    that they ve decided to show their 
                      appreciation by giving the first 
                    person to sell 20 units today a

      The room s a buzz.  The guys could care less.

                                  ADAM
                          (to guys)

                    with Snoozin  Sarandon.

                                  ALICE
                    If you get a sale, just come on 
                    down and ring the Frostwell bell.

      Alice rings a SMALL BELL. 

                                  BLAKE
                          (to guys)
                    There goes our date.  I guess I ll 
                    just draw mazes.                Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         4.


                                  ADAM
                    Yes!  But can you not make them so 
                    hard this time?  I mean, I like a 
                      challenge, but get real.

      A delivery man wheels the Glacier into the room.  Stainless 
      steel with a 15  LCD TV built right into the door.

                    I know her game.  Trying to get me 
                    all horny by dressing super normal, 
                    making my imagination run wild, 
                      eventually devouring itself.  
                    That s what she s doing.

                          (looking into his pants)
                    Oh God, I didn t wear any 
                      underwear.  What happens when I 
                    start pre-cumming?

                                  DERS
                    Nobody s gonna pre.  Just find her 
                    flaw.  Yes, she s exactly what you 
                    want to be raped by, BUT does she 
                    have the genetic build to birth me 
                    my Olympic triathlete?  Not with 
                    those giant cans and tapered waist.  
                    No sirree.

                                  BLAKE
                    Ders, she has the face of god.  If 
                    I look directly at her, I will pre 
                    my pants.

                                  ADAM
                    Whoa, dude, and you pre a lot.  You 
                    could fill up an Otter Pop sleeve.

                    Anyway, welcome to TelAmeriCorp.

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - DAY

      The guys are on calls.  Ders takes a call while staring over 
      the wall looking for Naomi.

                                  DERS
                            (distracted, into phone)
                    Yeah, sir, I m uh, calling to, sell 
                    you a refrigerator if you want one. 
                    Do you? ...  Hello?  OK, bye.

                                  ADAM
                          (into phone)
                    No, sir, trust me, you re going to 
                    love this boob-- refrigerator.  
                    It s pretty boob-- good.  Sorry, 
                    boobbye-- I mean, buh bye, sex-- 
                    sir.  Cunt hair, I mean, take care. 

                                  BLAKE
                          (on phone, spies on Naomi)
                    Is your mom home, little dude? ... 
                    Why aren t you at school?...  
                      Suspended, cool! ... Only a four 
                    inch blade?... Grounded too?
                          (then, noticing)
                    I gotta go man, sorry about your 
                    dumb mom.  Knives forever.

      Naomi approaches, coat in hand.  Blake avoids seeing Naomi by 
      looking at the ceiling, covers his dick for good measure.

                                  NAOMI
                    Hi, sorry to bother you guys.

                                  BLAKE
                          (eyes to ceiling, acting 
                             normal )
                    No problem, what s up?

                                  NAOMI
                    Is there a coat rack around here?                Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         8.


      Ders points to his own jacket draped on his chair.

                                  DERS
                    Uh yeah, it s called  the back of 
                    your chair.  

      Naomi isn t phased by their rudeness, she s all sunshine.

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh, got it. 

                                  ADAM
                    This ain t the Four Seasons, 
                    sister.  Get real, act real.

                                  NAOMI
                          (plays along, cute gang 
                            sign)
                    Fo sho, y all.

      She exits and then turns back.  Her boob presses up against 
      the cubicle giving her major cleavage.  It only makes Adam 
      and Ders hornier, thus angrier.  Blake sneaks a peek, then 
      looks back up.

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    Oh, and one more thing.  I was 
                    trying to dial out, but--

                                  ADAM
                    Hit 9 first.

                                  NAOMI
                    Right, thank you.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, welcome to America.

      Adam goes to give Blake a high-five, but he s still looking 
      up.  As Naomi leaves...   

      INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Jillian approaches Naomi.  

                                    JILLIAN
                    What s up slut?

                          (to Naomi)
                    Anyway, this is for you.

      She hands a folded note to Naomi who reads it.

                                    JILLIAN (CONT D)
                    Read it.  Aloud. 

                                  NAOMI
                          (reading note)
                    Will you go to lunch with me?

                                    JILLIAN
                    And...

                                  NAOMI
                          (off note)
                    Your dear friend, Jillian.

                                    JILLIAN
                    That should say Jill.  I can fix 
                    that.

                                  NAOMI
                    Um... Yeah, I ll go to lunch with 
                    you.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Cool.  Wanna hit Burger King?

                                  NAOMI
                    I m actually a vegetarian.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Really?
                          (covering)

                      friendship test.  Table for two at

                                  NAOMI
                    Sounds perfect.

      INT. OFFICE - GUY S CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

      Jillian excitedly bounds up to the guys.

                                    JILLIAN

      DING DING DING DING DING!!!  Montez rings the bell as he 
      approaches.

                                  MONTEZ
                    Chalk it up boys.  Five fridges in

                                  ADAM
                    Umm... none.

                                  BLAKE
                    How can you concentrate with that 
                    sex-demon Naomi running around 
                    smelling all good?

                                  MONTEZ
                    Oh, that s easy.  I love my wife.

                                  DERS
                    Never do.

      INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - LATER

      The guys rummage for snacks.  Adam turns around.

                                  ADAM
                    Does this look weird?

                                  DERS
                    Does what look weird?

                                  ADAM
                    Yes!  Cool.  No, I just tucked my 
                    boner up under my belt.

                    Got that Naomi boner, huh?

                                  ADAM
                    I got one of those fifth grade 
                    boners, where your dick hasn t 
                    fully grown yet, so there s too 
                    much blood rushing in and it s 
                    super hard.  

                                  DERS
                    Yeah, we re fully torqued, but

                    and we re not.  We need that TV.                Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         11.

                    Fine, I guess I ll be the natural 
                    leader that I am and go crank it 
                    down in the bathroom, to clear my 
                    mind, and makes some sales.  Yo-
                    yeah.

                                  DERS
                    You re going to crank it down in 
                    the office?  You think that s 
                    smart?

                                  ADAM
                    People take smoke breaks all the

                    So we ll take a stroke break.

                                  DERS
                    Okay, that s insane.  You could so 
                    easily be fired for that. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Fine.  If it makes you feel better, 
                    me and DeMamp will ask Alice first.  

                                  ADAM
                    She s a pro, she gets it.

                                  DERS
                    This I have to see.

      INT. OFFICE - ALICE S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Adam and Blake stand before Alice.  Ders paces outside the 
      office, peeking through her inter-office window.

                                  ADAM
                    Alice, Ders wants to know if he can 
                      masturbate in the bathroom.

      When Alice sees Ders through the window, he gives her a look 
      that MEANS  These guys are idiots, right?   But LOOKS TO HER 
      LIKE,  Hey, this guy just needs to crank down.  Can ya blame 
      me?

                    Holmvik, get in here!

      Ders enters.

                                  DERS
                    Lemme guess, you said,  No.   Told 
                    you guys.  It was stupid to ask.

                                  ALICE
                    So this isn t a joke?

                    Oh, no they re serious.  We ve been

                    Wow.  I never thought I d have to

                    are not allowed to masturbate at

                                  ADAM
                    Sorry, dude.  We tried.

                                  DERS
                    Me?  No-no-no-no.  Them.  They want

                    Oh, so what?  You don t want to 
                    crank it, Ders?

                    Of course I do, I d love to, but I 
                    didn t think we should ask!

                                  ADAM
                    So you were just gonna do it 
                    without asking?!  Were you raised 
                    in a barn, Anders!

                                  ALICE

      Walking away from Alice s office.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, that was easy.

                                  DERS
                    What?

                                  ADAM
                    You heard her:  No masturbating in 
                    the office.

      OFF a classic Adam S go finger swirl.

                                                                        SMASH CUT:

      EXT. OFFICE/INT. CAR - PARKING LOT - LATER

      The guys are in the car.  Ders in the driver s seat, Adam in 
      shotgun, Blake in the back.  They hang jackets in the windows 
      and staple Ders  swim towels to create dividers for privacy. 

                                  DERS
                    OK, that should hold.  Let s make 
                    this quick.  I m pretty sure we can 
                    go to jail for this.

      Ders UNZIPS his pants to get ready.  Adam s got his shirt 
      behind his head like a shoulder yolk and is already cranking.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, Ders keep talking.   I need 
                    some sounds.  It s too quiet in 
                    here.

                                  DERS
                    I m not giving sounds.

                                  ADAM
                    That s perfect.

                                  DERS
                    SHHH!  

      Blake s foot jams through to the front as he pulls his pants 
      off.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey, stay in your space, dude!  We 
                    have designated Crank Zones.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         14.


      Blake s now completely naked, clothes hanging neatly behind 
      him.

                                  BLAKE
                    OK, sorry.  I ll stay in my Crank 
                    Zone.

      Ders starts to get in the mood when Adam s hand creeps in.

                                  ADAM
                          (fucking with Ders)
                    Ders, lemme get a handful of moob.  
                    Where them nips at?

                                  DERS
                    Dude, honestly, back off my 
                    titties!  Get back in your Zone!

                                  ADAM
                    I hate my Zone.  Blake can I come 
                    into your zone?

                                  BLAKE
                    No one s coming in my Zone except 
                    for me, muchacho.

                                  ADAM
                    Ders, are you done?  Pretty quiet 
                    in there?  What s happening?  Talk 
                    to me.  Want some of my lube, bro?

                                  DERS
                    I m fine.

                                  BLAKE
                    You got lube?  Pass me some.

                                  ADAM
                    Actually, it s Turtle Wax from the 
                    glove compartment.

      Adam passes the Wax.

                                  DERS
                    Just go dry.

                                  ADAM
                    Eww, you re a Dry Guy.  Did you 
                    also kill animals as a kid, Dexter?

                                  DERS
                    I just don t think jerking off 
                    should be some grand ritual.  It 
                    should be spontaneous.  A treat.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         15.


                                  BLAKE
                    Oh boy, this lube burnin  mah dick.  
                    Totally went in the pee hole.  Ders 
                    are you finished with this Gatorade 
                    back here?  Daddy s got to put out 
                    a fire.

                                  ADAM
                    Here we go.  So close.  Oh yeah.

      In the throes of passion Adam grips the curtain and pulls it 
      down.  All three guys are now visible to each other.  

                                  DERS
                    That s it!  I m outta here.

      Ders bolts out of the car covering himself and slams his door 
      into the neighboring car, setting the alarm off.  Smokers in 
      the parking lot stare.

      Adam s focus is lost.  He sees the smokers and gets out 
      buttoning his pants and belt.  Blake joins him, does the 
      same.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, there Ders goes again.  
                    Ruining our good time.

                                  BLAKE
                      Ruuuuuude!

      They pass the smokers.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh so you can take ten minutes to 
                    smoke, but we can t take ten 
                    minutes to stroke.  Crank down.

                                  BLAKE
                          (to a smoker)
                    That s a disgusting habit.

      FADE IN:

      INT. OFFICE - LATER

      The guys return from the crank session, in a funk and are 
      startled by the DING DING DING of Montez ringing the bell.

                                  MONTEZ
                    Awwwww shtooooops!  This one goes 
                    to eleven, bitches!  Michael 
                    McKean, y all!

                                  ADAM
                    What s that mean?

                                  MONTEZ
                    Means I m in the motherfucking 
                    zone.  Y all ever had slow-cooked 
                    venison stroganoff?  That shit will 
                    rock your world.  

      Montez saunters off and the guys head into their cubicle.

                                  DERS
                    Alright, how many sales do we have?  

                                  ADAM/BLAKE
                      Nothing./Nearing Zero.

      Naomi approaches.  The guys scramble.

                                    BLAKE/ADAM/DERS
                    Oh my God./Oh boy./Jesus Christ.
                            (whispering)
                    Tuck it up, tuck it up, tuck it up.

      They all do A QUICK SLY BONER TUCK UP. 

                                  NAOMI
                    Really sorry.  How do you dial out 
                    again? 

                                    ADAM/BLAKE/DERS
                    NINE! 

                                  NAOMI
                    Yeah, I tried that, but I got a 
                    weird beeping noise.               Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         17.


                                  ADAM
                    Oh.  Right.  You gotta hit your 
                    employee ID number.  AND THEN HIT 
                    NINE.

                                  NAOMI
                          (playing along again)
                    OK!!!

      Naomi exits.  In the BG, the guys watch her walk away.  

                                  ADAM
                    Those titties are NSFW!  

                                  BLAKE
                    How are her boobs that beautiful?   
                    My brain knows they re just air and 
                    water, but then I look at them and 
                    they re so big and juggly...

      Blake inadvertently humps the office wall. 

                                  DERS
                    Hey!  Do you or do you not want to 
                    host Wrestlemania X-X-V-I-I-I?

                          (wrestler voice)
                    Of course we do, brother, but  
                    she s got my mind all suplexed.

                                  DERS
                    I think we re done with the voices, 
                    dude.

                                  BLAKE
                    The voices are fine, but the babe 
                    has to bounce.

      OFF Blake s evil grin, he puts on his sunglasses.

      INT. OFFICE - HALLWAY - LATER

      Adam and Blake lead the charge towards the break room.  Ders 
      follows.

                                  DERS
                    Guys?  Guys, we re not actually 
                    doing this!  This is crazy...

                                  BLAKE
                    It ll be fine.  I ll just dig in 
                    the fridge, grab some ketchup and 
                    squirt it all over her.

                    She ll go home to change and we ll 
                    make some sales and be watching 
                      Wrestlemania in no time.

                                  ADAM
                    Nope, no squirting.  Too sexy.  You 
                    can pour.  Throw.

                                  BLAKE
                    Spray?

                                  ADAM
                    Too sexy.  Just pour something.  
                    But not milk.

      Ders stops and gets dead serious.

                                  DERS
                    It s got to be juice.
                          (Adam and Blake halt)
                    If we re really doing this, it has 
                    to be juice.  Cranberry.  Juice.

      INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The guys enter to find Naomi looking SUPER HOT, but hugging 
      an AVERAGE-LOOKING DUDE, GREG.  They stop in their tracks.

                                  NAOMI
                    Thanks for lunch, Greg.  We ll talk 
                    about everything later.

      Greg kisses her and leaves.  The guys are stunned.

                                  ADAM
                    Who was that guy?

                                  NAOMI
                    That was my boyfriend or... 
                    actually we just -- I don t really 
                    know anymore.

                                  BLAKE
                    Let me guess:  It s complicated.   

                                  NAOMI
                    Well, he wants to settle down and 
                    have kids, but I m not there yet.  
                    Sorry, what do you guys care?

                                  DERS (CONT'D)
                    Sounds like this Greg guy needs his 
                    ass kicked.

                                  NAOMI
                    Ha, no.  I just need to find 
                    someone who just wants to have fun, 
                    party, keep it casual.  

                                  ADAM
                    You deserve that. 

                                  NAOMI
                    I mean, I have this great apartment 
                    but since Greg goes to bed at like 
                    9 o clock every night we can never 
                    have people over.  I love having 
                    parties.

                                  THE GUYS
                          (adlib, eager, over each 
                            other)
                    Yeah, totally.  Parties.  Keeping 
                    it casual.  Fun.  Parties.  Fun.  
                      Casualness.  Hosting parties.  Fun.      

                                  NAOMI
                    By the way, how nice is that fridge 
                    they re giving away?  God, I would 
                    kill for that.

      Jillian suddenly enters.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Hey Naynay, you ready for lunch!

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh, Greg surprised me and brought 
                    me a sandwich.  I m sorry.

      Jillian hides her disappointment.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Well I was gonna give you this at 
                    lunch, but here.

      Jillian reveals a wrapped gift and Naomi opens it.  It s a 
      personally decorated frame with a photo of Naomi working at 
      her desk from afar.

                                    JILLIAN (CONT D)
                    Surprise!  You had no idea I was 
                    watching and you looked so 
                    peaceful, so I snapped a pic.  
                    Thought you d like it.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         20.

                          (nice about it)
                    Yeah, it s great.

                                    JILLIAN
                    FUCK YES!  Cool, cool.  Let s go 
                    make me one now.  You can take my 
                    photo.  Did you know in Africa, 
                    tribesman believe a photo captures 
                    your soul.  Do you think it does?

      And Jillian whisks Naomi away.  The guys are left hanging; 
      they huddle.

                                  ADAM
                    If Naomi was dating that Greg dude, 
                    she is def down to DTF.

                    Yes.  She s totally boneable.  I 
                    read a study about this in Redbook.

      their new fridge/TV.

      EXT. OFFICE - PARKING LOT - DAY

      Employees exit the building, leaving for the day.  Naomi 
      appears, heads to her car where the guys are posing-all-sexy-
      like with the fridge.

                                  NAOMI
                    Congrats on the fridge.                Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         28.

                    Yeah, it s pretty...  cool.     

      Ders and Adam set the fridge up next to her car.

                                  DERS
                    Ummm... so like you like 
                      refrigerators, right?

                                  NAOMI
                    Yeah.   

                                  ADAM
                    Great.  Because we wanted to give 
                    this to you.  As a gift.  

                                  NAOMI
                          (confused but kinda 
                            excited)
                    Really?  Why?

                                  ADAM
                    Because you ve been throwing out 
                    super sex appeal all day and we saw 
                    that you date normal dudes, like us 
                    and Greg.

                                  BLAKE
                          (then, super sweet)
                    And we thought that maybe you liked 
                    one of us?

                                  DERS
                    So who do you choose? 

      They all make their sexiest faces and poses.  She s weirded 
      out. 

                                  NAOMI
                    I m sorry, I don t understand.

                                  BLAKE
                    Go ahead and pick one of us to be 
                    your boyfriend, so we can start 
                    planning for the Wrestlemania Party 
                    at your house.  

                                  DERS
                    I ll just need your neighbors  e-
                    mails to send them a heads up.  Let 
                    them know we ll be done by 10:30, 
                    so they don t freak out.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         29.


                                  BLAKE
                    We ve got some loud friends.

                                  NAOMI
                    What the hell are you talking 
                    about?    

      Suddenly Jillian enters, filled with rage.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Hey!  
                          (holding up frame)
                    I found this in the trash.  If you 
                    didn t want to be friends, you 
                    could have just been honest.

                                  NAOMI
                    I didn t put that in the trash. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    You put one thing in the trash:  
                    Our friendship. 

                                  NAOMI
                    We re not friends, Jill. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    It s Jillian.  
                          (re: fridge)
                    Are you guys giving this to her?  
                     Cause she ll just throw it in the 
                    trash because that s what she does 
                    with gifts!  So why don t I just 
                    trash it for her!

      Jillian furiously tips the fridge over on it s side, crushing 
      the TV.

                                  NAOMI
                    God I hate temping.

      Naomi climbs into her VW Bug and pulls out.  The guys and 
      Jillian watch her go.  Blake turns the fridge to reveal the 
      TV is shattered.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Drama queen.

                                  BLAKE
                    Thanks, Jillian.  Now what are we 
                    gonna do for Wrestlemania?              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         30.


      EXT. GUYS  HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - A WEEK LATER (DAY THREE)

      The  Wrestlemania  party is going down.  People stand around 
      a makeshift wrestling ring where the dudes, wearing the same 
      homemade outfits as before, are wrestling each other using 
      found objects like folding chairs, lasagne tins, the broken 
      TV, books, and at the center - The Fridge/TV.  

      The dudes are in their own world.  The crowd is growing 
      tired.  Adam slams Blake and starts to climb the fridge.

      KARL comes from the crowd and taps Ders.

                                  KARL
                    Where s the TV?  I thought we were 
                    watching Wrestlemania.

                                  DERS
                    Don t you have a tape worm you 
                    could be pulling from your ass 
                      somewhere?

      Adam reaches the top of the fridge and slaps his arms (like 
      Randy The Ram in The Wrestler) and in mid-Ram Jam we...

                                                                   CUT TO BLACK.
