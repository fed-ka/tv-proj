      Back at Emergency Response, the operator s already routing

      At the wheel, TYLER (30s) - slight build, nutty eyes - hits

      Pain, healing and chaos swirl around the curtained Trauma 
      rooms and offices.  Walking through it all, the maestro, DR. 
      JOSEPH SAVIANO (50s) sees everything, remembers everything 
      and appears to be affected by nothing.

      A team of TRAUMA DOCS and INTERNS trails Dr. Joe.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Cardiac arrest, burns, brain

                    deal of electrocution.  Incoming

      Dr. Joe opens the curtains of TRAUMA 3, surprising an Intern 
      and a heavily BANDAGED MAN.

                    He stable?

      In the back, on a gurney NANCY MONAHAN (32) - intense, just 
      enough damage to make her interesting - straddles TERRY 
      BANNER (36) - handsome, witty and serious in equal measure.  
      To say the radio interrupts is a huge understatement.

                                  NANCY
                    Wait... Not now.

      Terry scrambles out from under her.

                    It s a call...

                    Naughty Nancy to check her buttons.

      Terry doesn t like that too much. Nancy checks her uniform.  
      Yep, the top button on her blouse reveals a little too much.  
      She takes care of it.

                                  TERRY
                    I told you...  Not in the van.

      Climbing into the passenger seat, Nancy musses his hair.

                                  NANCY
                    Yes, in the van. I mean come on,  I 
                    get the residency, no more fun on

      Like a razor sharp coin, he twirls a SCALPEL through his 
      fingers.


      Rabbit s got the uplink going to SFGH. DR. JOE S FACE appears

      Through the windshield, Rotor sees a NEWS HELICOPTER appear 
      from around a nearby building, heading straight toward them.

      The News Copter s coming too fast. Rotor pulls up, just as 
      the News Copter dives.  It s a slow motion symphony of 
      disaster.  The COPTERS COLLIDE.  Metal rips metal.

      past metrosexual. Screams come from the back, where...

      NANCY works on a man bleeding from a CHEST WOUND. Eyes blank, 
      her hands move of their own accord. She clamps an artery, 
      then slams a sedative into the IV.

                    Oak it is.

      Bailey checks the back. Nancy s soothing the patient. But the 
      bleeder is UNCONSCIOUS. Nancy s barely looking at him.

                                  NANCY 
                      Everything s going to be just fine.


      BOONE watches his two DAUGHTERS jam down some EGGOS, peck

      The Intern stares at her blankly.

                    Autoplex. A plasma-based coagulant.

                    No. That time s has passed.

                                  DR. JOE
                    I held your spot on the Trauma 
                      residency. It s yours if you want 
                    it.

                                  NANCY
                    I m not sure I ever did. I think I 
                    was trying to be something I m not.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Or maybe realizing who you could 
                    be?

                                  NANCY
                    Stop with the Obi-Wan crap. What?  
                    Are you telling me to make my 
                    father proud?

                                  DR. JOE
                    God no. I ve known him 25 years. I 
                    probably loathe him more than you.

      That gets a smile from Nancy.

                                  DR. JOE (CONT D)
                    Great doctor. Questionable human 
                    being.

                                  NANCY
                    There s a lot of that going around.

      Now, it s Joe s turn to smile. Then, he hits her with the 
      zinger.

                                  DR. JOE
                    It s not your father I m asking you 
                    to honor.

      The HURT takes over her eyes.  She heads off. Joe waits, cold 
      and stoic. Then chases after her.


      Fast and even, Marisa moves up the stairs, opens the door 
      into the offices. PILOTS and EMTs look up from a game of 
      GRAND THEFT AUTO.

                                  MARISA
                    Hey, what s up?

      They smile, check her out, go back to the game.  Marisa moves 
      to the dispatcher, JOHNNY OH (30s) - deadpan, maybe even half-
      stoned - pulls her paperwork.

                                  MARISA (CONT D)

                    art man. Get moving. Rush hour s 
                    starting.

      Near the TV, there s an odd MEMORIAL - ROTOR S CHARRED HELMET 
      propped on his plastic GUITAR HERO GUITAR. One of the EMTs 
      snickers as she passes.

                                  MARISA
                    What? You got a tick or something?  
                    Some kind of stutter. Lotta meds on 
                    the copter. Maybe one could fix you 
                    up.

                                    GLASSES EMT
                    You got no idea what you re in for,

      She checks him out, noticing he s wearing GLASSES.

                                  MARISA
                    You weren't military were ya,

                    for some action, right?

      His face drops. She nailed it. His buddies chuckle.  

                                  MARISA (CONT D)
                    Oigame guero, what you call a rush, 
                    I call retirement.

      On the TV, the GTA player goes down in a hail of bullets.


      Marisa slides in. Home. Instinctively, she runs her hands and 
      eyes over the gauges. She pulls a MEDALLION, hangs it around 
      the compass.  

      Suddenly, a GRUFF VOICE scares the shit out of her.

                                  VOICE
                    Take it down.

      Startled she turns. RABBIT moves out of the shadows of the 
      back. Intense, almost manic, Rabbit has a faint scar running 
      along his cheek.

      The back is IMMACULATE. Everything put perfectly in its 
      place, the result of Rabbit s obsessive attentions. Not 
      scared, simply wary, Marisa smiles and flicks the medallion.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 20

                    here. I am. And I didn t say you

                                  MARISA
                    You re Rabbit.

      He smiles and waves,  Bye. Bye.  She slides out of the 
      copter. St. Joseph stays. Rabbit eyes the medallion.


      The EMT in glasses has his eyes on his watch as Marisa blazes 
      in the room.

                    right?  Somebody needs to get him 
                    out of there.

      Snickers ring the group. Something s up.

                    Rabbit s your Paramedic.

                                  MARISA

      Marisa thinks about this. The only way out is through.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Marisa and Rabbit see the explosion.  They share a look.  She 
      veers the copter toward a clear spot on the bridge.

                                  RABBIT
                    God, I love my job.


      Alarms sound. The Skater Kid crashes.  Marisa stays calm at 
      the stick, ripping along the water very very fast.

                                    CARPOOL MOM

      Marisa takes the copter to the city. In the back, Rabbit has 
      the Skater Kid s head strapped down. The SCALPEL hovers over 
      his throat. Nearby, a LARYNX-TRACHEAL TUBE waits.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    What are you going to do?

                                  RABBIT
                    Help him breathe. Um... This looks 
                    worse than it is. Okay that s a 
                    lie. Here, just give me your 
                    hand...

      Gently, Rabbit takes the CARPOOL MOM S hand. He puts it on 
      the boy s shoulder.  

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Just look away and I ll move your 
                    hand when I need it.

      The Mom looks away, Rabbit raises the scalpel. Suddenly, 
      shudders rips through the hull.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Not helping.  

                                  MARISA
                    Bad air is bad air.

      Violent and deft, Rabbit slices a slit into the Skater Kid s 
      throat. He reaches for Mom s hand.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hold this open. Yeah. Yeah. Like 
                    that.

      Carpool Mom spreads open the larynx with her fingers. She 
      makes the mistake of taking a look.

                                    CARPOOL MOM
                    Oh God.

      Rabbit quickly slides the TRACHEAL TUBE into the incision and 
      down into the airway. Like siphoning gas, Rabbit quickly 
      blows and sucks into the tube, inflating the lungs.

      FLUID spits out of the tube. Then, WHEEZING BREATHS sound 
      out. Mom looks ready to puke. Rabbit smiles broadly at her.

                                  RABBIT
                    Hey... Thanks Mom.       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 36




      Marisa makes a wildly banking turn, smiles when she sees 
      Leggy flail for a handhold.  Rabbit moves to push the  Play  
      button the stereo. Marisa slaps his hand away.

      Then she pushes the  Play  button.


      The aftermath of the bridge accident.  Interns and Doctors 
      work in the Trauma rooms.  Less serious patients wait on 
      gurneys, moaning, bitching.

                                    PATIENT
                    My leg hurts.

      Joe checks it out. It s obviously broken.

                                  DR. JOE
                    I m sure it does.

      He moves on, into a TRAUMA ROOM and a more life-threatening 
      case.


      Her WRIST in a cast, the LEGGY WOMAN sits on the edge of the 
      bed. BOONE pokes his face around the curtain.

                                  BOONE
                    And how are we feeling?

                    I just might do that.

      She gives him a look, obviously charmed.


      Rabbit s mildly battered CHEVELLE motors up one of the city s 
      steep hills.

                                  RABBIT
                    Why start now? Look whatever you ve 
                    heard. I m cool.

      The speedometer peaks as Rabbit crests the hill. The car 
      catches air. Lands hard.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I m cool.  

                                  MARISA
                    Rabbit, I d like to keep some 
                    fillings.

                                  RABBIT
                    You ever see Bullitt?

      Rabbit guides the car fast down a steep hill. There s an 
        intersection at the bottom.  The light reads GREEN.

                                  MARISA
                    Knock it off, okay? Not how I want 
                    to go.

                                  RABBIT
                    There s something you should know 
                    about me...

      The light at the intersection turns yellow. Instead of 
      watching the road, Rabbit fixes his eyes on her and blazes 
      straight through the RED LIGHT.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    I can t die.

                                  MARISA
                    Oh, Jesu Christo...

      They re gathering speed, continuing downhill. Another 
      intersection, another green light turning YELLOW. Rabbit 
      keeps looking at her instead of the road.

                                  RABBIT
                      I survived hell and fire...

      The moment of IMPACT. Rotor screams as the helicopter shears 
      into the roof. The fireball builds. And miraculously, RABBIT 
      IS THROWN OUT OF THE BAY DOORS. Like a rag doll, he skitters 
      across the roof,crumples into a bloody heap. His eyes, 
      flutter. He SMILES.

                                  RABBIT (CONT D)
                    Every single odd should have me 
                    dead and crispy. But I m here.  
                    When it s your time, it s your 
                    time. And when it s not, it s not.  
                    And it is not my time.

      The intersection approaches. The light s RED.

                                  MARISA
                    Listen to me Rabbit, every corpse I 
                    know figured it wasn t his time.  
                    And you need to...  

      A HORN interrupts her. There s a CAR pulling into the 
      intersection. Rabbit swerves. He fishtails through the 
      intersection. Incredibly, Rabbit gets the car under control.

      Then... At the curb, an AUDI S DOOR OPENS right in front of 
      Rabbit.

      RABBIT S CAR slams into the Audi s door, shearing it off.  
      Rabbit s Chevelle spins out, finally comes to a stop.

                                  MARISA (CONT D)
                    You dumb sonofabitch...

      A terrible sound comes sounds out from the Audi. A scared 
      man s voice.

      Nancy moves through the quiet waiting room. She checks at 
      RECEPTION.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    What? Pulling a double?

                    I had a John Doe DOA. Anybody call 
                    or show up asking about him? He was 
                    on the bridge.  

      The RECEPTIONIST checks.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    No. Nothing. Sorry Nance.

                                  NANCY
                    No worries. I ll be around let me 
                    know if anything comes in.

      Nancy goes, kicks back in the waiting room, checks out 
      reality TV for a bit. She takes a moment look at the wounded, 
      the waiting, their loved ones.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 53

      Out of the lab coat and in a damn fine suit, DR. JOE heads 
      through. He spots Nancy.

                                  DR. JOE
                    No.  No.  No.  You re not allowed 
                    to be here later than me. 

                                  NANCY
                    Nice suit.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Joanne and I had a dinner.

                                  NANCY
                    And then you came back to work.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Dinner wasn t that great.

      They both smile a bit.

                                  DR. JOE (CONT D)
                    Waiting to see who claims the John 
                    Doe?
                          (off her)
                    You should know by now. Not much 
                    escapes me here.  I saw the path 
                    report. He had Endocarditis.  His 
                    heart was like a 90 year old s.  
                    Probably didn t know. Smoke 
                      inhalation triggered total cardiac 
                    shutdown. For lack of a better 
                    word, the guy was doomed.  You 
                    okay?

      The veneer cracks a bit... For both of them.

                                  NANCY
                    I don t know.

      Dr. Joe sits down next to her, takes a gander at the waiting 
      room, the parade of damage.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Rabbit coming back was going to 
                    push some buttons. He s a reminder 
                    of Rotor...  Of Terry. He s a 
                    walking ghost really. And he s... 

                                  NANCY
                    He s Rabbit.

                                  DR. JOE
                    Do you really want to be out there 
                    violently underachieving?

                                  NANCY
                    It s the right place for me right

                          (to himself)
                    All of you, you run so fast. You 
                    miss the point entirely.

                                  NANCY 
                    There s a point?  

                                  DR. JOE
                    Yes indeed. People get hurt. Some 
                    get saved. A lot die. And then it 
                    happens all over again.  

                                  NANCY 
                    You missed your calling Joe.

                                  DR. JOE
                    I know. I should have been a rock 
                    star.

      Getting up, Joe PATS HER LEG. It s a touch, a moment that 
      takes them both by surprise.

                                  DR. JOE (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I... I ll uh see you 
                    tomorrow.

      With that, he s gone. Leaving Nancy to the wounded, the 
      waiting and reality TV.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Nancy s cooked. The waiting room s clearing out. The night s 
      ending. Heading out, Nancy passes reception. There s a TIRED 
      YOUNG WOMAN there.  

                                  TIRED WOMAN
                    ... On the bridge. My name is 
                    Alison.

      Boom! The name hits Nancy.  

                                  NANCY
                    Excuse me, are you looking for 
                    someone?

                                  ALISON
                    Yes. Jeremy. My boyfriend. Well 
                    kind of. We just really started 
                    dating...

                                  NANCY
                          (to the receptionist)
                    Call downstairs. I ll take her.

                                  ALISON
                          (hopeful)
                    He s here?!

                                  NANCY
                    He s here. But Alison. I ve got 
                    some very tough news.

      Alison starts to crumple. Nancy holds her.


      An attendant pulls back the body bag, reveal John Doe s face.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 57

      On the other side of the glass, Alison stands with Nancy.  
      Tears roll down her face.

                                  ALISON
                    That s Jeremy.  Oh God...

                                  NANCY
                      I couldn t... save him. Um, I tried 
                    really hard. And I don t think 
                    anyone could have done much more.

                                  ALISON
                    We had a fight. He was mad the last 
                    time I saw him. He died hating me.

                                  NANCY
                    No he didn t. I was there with him 
                    at the end. He didn t go alone.  
                          (fighting for control)
                    His last word was your name. And it 
                    wasn t in anger.

                                  ALISON
                    Thank you.

      There s a moment. A complete and utter shared connection of 
      grief.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    This happened to you didn t it?
                          (Nancy nods)
                    Does it ever get better?

                                  NANCY
                    Not recently. You got a job?  
                    Something you love? Something you 
                    were born to?

                                  ALISON
                    I work in an insurance company. I 
                    hate it.

                                  NANCY
                    Okay... Scratch that.

      Alison manages a chuckle. We move around to the other side of 
      the glass. The attendant zips up the body bag. The tag 
      reading John Doe is replaced with a tag:  JEREMY BURTON. 


      BOONE rides the train. STOCKBROKERS fill some seats. He 
      catches the eye of a PRETTY BROKER. They look at each other.  
      Then Boone looks away.


      Extreme focused minimalism. A very nice bed. A very nice 
      refrigerator. A stereo system easily worth $10,000. Neat 
      shelves of books, CDs and vinyl. No TV. Not a single picture 
      on the wall.  

      A ritual, Rabbit pulls down blackout curtains. Meticulously 
      he TAPES the edges of the window shades. Done with the task, 
      he just stands there. Nowhere to go. Night over.


      Packing up the UNIFORM, Nancy changes into street clothes, a 
      simple t-shirt and jeans.  They don t smell like smoke, 
      they re not stain with blood.  She moves out the door


      Boone creeps into the darkness. The first thing he sees is 
      THE COUCH made up for him to sleep on. Resigned, he moves 
      toward his DAUGHTERS  ROOM.

      Suddenly, his CELL PHONE VIBRATES, lighting up the room.

      INTERCUT: NOE VALLEY APARTMENT

      Wine in hand, the LEGGY WOMAN looks out the window. The phone 
      just rings.

      Boone pushes  IGNORE  on his phone. Then tiptoes to his 
      daughter and kisses them on the forehead.  


      Rabbit lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. There s a KNOCK 
      at his door. He looks confused. Could it be? No way.

      He opens the door. It s NANCY. The look that passes between 
      them speaks encyclopedias.

                                  NANCY
                    I can t sleep.

                                  RABBIT
                    Yeah, me neither.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)       TRAUMA    "PILOT"   PRODUCTION DRAFT    2/17/09    pg. 59

                                  NANCY
                    I know.

      Together they move to the bed. There s nothing sexual about 
      it. They slide in together. His shirt rides up, exposing a 
      HORRIBLE SCAR on his back. Lightly she touches it.

                                  RABBIT
                    Chicks think it s sexy.

                                  NANCY
                    Shut up, Rabbit.

      She SPOONS him. Rays of light seep through the sides of the 
      windows.  

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    Hey... welcome back.

      Together, they let sleep take them.
