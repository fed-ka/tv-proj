      SLAM!  A spotlight slams down on the Doctor!

      WIND blasts across the wasteland, violent -

      And from up above, two ARMED GUARDS, in black security
      uniforms, ABSEIL DOWN, either side of the Master -

      The Doctor battling the wind, staring up -

      MASSIVE NOISE of a helicopter above!  Lights shining down!

      Fast, in seconds, a Guard injects a metal hypo-device into
      the Master's neck - he falls unconscious, held by the guard -

      TWO MORE GUARDS appear, ground level, running across the
      rubble - guns aimed at the Doctor - yelling 'Keep back!'

      The Abseil Guards are hooking the unconscious Master on to
      one Guard's harness, making him secure -

      The Doctor running forward -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Don't!  Don't - !

      One ground-level guard opens fire, PRAC GUNFIRE -

      PRAC SHOTS fire in front of the Doctor, stopping him -

      And the Master & Abseil Guards are HAULED UP INTO THE SKY!

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Let him go - !

                                  Writer's 
      Whack!  On the back of his head, with the butt of a rifle -

      The Doctor falls to the ground -

      The lights in the sky recede...

                  The 
      The Guards on the ground run, disappearing into the night.

      The Doctor lying on the floor.  Unconscious.

      The wind and noise die down, into silence.

                    They're just Ood.  But it's all

                    touching Donna's subconscious -
