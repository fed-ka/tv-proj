      Ah. Much more peaceful. Will and Andy stroll down one of 
      those beautiful hilly streets in San Francisco. Andy is laden 
      with Jonah in a baby bjorn and Ben and Stacy in a double 
      stroller.  Will holds a shopping bag filled with diapers and 
      other baby products.

                    You are living my nightmare. Your 
                    life is my cautionary tale.

                    Knowing I play such a critical role 
                    in your life makes me whole.

                    Why would you ask me to be a 
                      Godparent? You know me.

                                  ANDY
                    I fought for you. It was you or 
                    Laurie s crazy sister. 

                                  WILL
                    Right, I keep forgetting Laurie s 
                    the sane one in her family. The 
                    point is I don t have room in my 
                    life for another child. I have me.

      Will stops cold as a GORGEOUS WOMAN gets out of a Mini 
      Cooper. This is DAKOTA (30s, think Leslie Mann).

                    I m Dakota. And I m late.

      She starts toward the building. Will sees the sign on the 
      door, for Single Parents Group. He makes a snap decision.

                                  WILL
                    Me too. I m late too.

                    Yes, I am.

      Andy watches them walk in. Where the fuck is he going?



      Will emerges in his tighty whities and runs past FIONA (late 
      30s, think Minnie Driver) exudes vegan throwback hippie-ness, 
      holding moving boxes. She is not happy to see this half-naked 
      man who apparently is her new neighbor.

                                  FIONA
                    Um, HELLO!?

      Will runs straight to Dakota, who is rushing into her car.

                                  WILL
                    Wait. Dakota. I need your number! 
                    You owe me an orgasm! 

      Fiona is appalled. Watches Will get Dakota s number. Fiona 
      watches as Will charms Dakota, leaning over into the driver s 
      window and kissing her, so that Fiona is staring at his butt.

      Dakota drives away. Will turns, does a little victory dance, 
      waving Dakota s phone number in the air, and comes face to 
      face with Fiona, who looks at him, livid. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)

                    these in the laundry, they re mine.

      He extends his hand to shake it.

                                  FIONA
                    Why don t we try this another time, 
                    when there s less of you flopping 
                    about?

      Fiona goes in her apartment and slams the door. Behind the 
      door, REVEAL MARCUS (11), weird, wearing John Lennon glasses 
      and a hat that belongs on a 70-year-old Frenchman. He stares 
      at Will, fascinated.



      Will is in his tiny backyard, barbecuing a steak as he 
      grooves to hip hop. He turns and sees Fiona in her 
      identically small backyard.

                    Marcus, get over the fence, now!

      Everyone makes a hasty exit. Marcus turns back to Will.

                                  MARCUS
                    Are we still on for ribs?

      Fiona helps Marcus into the yard and slams the door as they 
      head inside. OFF WILL...

                          ACT THREE



      Andy has all three of his kids in the kiddy park. He pushes 
      two of them on a swing while he holds Jonah in a baby bjorn.

                                  WILL
                    I had to do it. I had to cut the 
                    cord with Marcus, right?

                                  ANDY
                    Uh huh.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1331.


                                  WILL
                    I mean, these people are officially 
                    weird. I can t take this on right 
                    now.

                                  ANDY
                    You have to cash the checks from 
                    that stupid song. Chase women.  
                    Full plate. 

                                  WILL
                    Hey, how about a little support?

                                  ANDY
                    You don t want to be Jonah s 
                      Godparent, you don t want to help 
                    out the weird kid next door. You 
                    don t want to care about anyone who 
                    isn t you. You never wanted to care 
                    about anybody who isn t you.

      Andy walks away to focus on his kids, leaving Will stunned. 
      Will watches his best friend with his children -- it s a 
      sweet moment of Andy just loving his kids. Soaking them in. 

      Will reaches into his jacket pocket, and finds the crumpled 
      up flyer from Marcus s talent show. He looks at it. Alarm 
      building. 

      We see what he s looking at: a flyer for the Oakwood Middle 
      School talent show. And listed as one of the featured 
      performers is: MARCUS BOWA, PERFORMING ADELE S  SOMEONE LIKE 
      YOU.  A CAPELLA. 

                                  WILL
                    Oh no. Oh no. 

      Then he sees the date on the flyer: September 14th, 11:30 AM. 
      He looks at his watch. He looks at his watch: 11:14!

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    ANDY!!!!!



      Will and Andy, kids in tow, sprint through the front 
      entrance. 



      Laurie screams at Will.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1338.


                                  LAURIE
                    You re never gonna grow up. You re 
                    an infant, Will. An infant. Good. 
                    Run. That s perfect.

      Will runs down the street. Laurie turns back to camera.

                                  LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Why are you still recording. Turn 
                    that stupid thing off.

      And as the video goes black...
