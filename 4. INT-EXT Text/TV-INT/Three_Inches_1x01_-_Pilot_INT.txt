      A modest two-bedroom house in Studio City.  Birds chirp, 
      the sun shines.  A SUPER reads: That Morning.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter s old bedroom is a time machine.  Comic books, a 
      Sony PlayStation, a faded World of Warcraft poster.  An 
      old Bondi Blue iMac with a Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
        screensaver.  Walter doesn t live here anymore.  He s just 
        passing through.  The cardboard boxes stacked against a 
      wall contain his belongings.  Walter lies in his high 
      school bed, peers at the ceiling.

                                        WALTER
                    Ten, nine, eight...

      It s a countdown.  Walter is ready to launch.

      IN A HALLWAY

        BELINDA SPACKMAN, 50, walks down a hallway with an unlit 
        cigarette in her mouth.  Belinda is profane, brutally 
        honest, and borderline bi-polar.

                                        BELINDA
                    Rise and shine, my little boomerang!  Up 
                    and at  em!  He who hesitates is lunch! 

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter continues the countdown:

                                        WALTER
                      Four, three, two...

      IN A HALLWAY 

        Belinda reaches Walter s door.                                                                                      2.



                                        BELINDA
                    All work and no play makes Jack my first 
                      husband!  If at first you don t succeed, 
                      you re a Spackman!

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter sits up.  Liftoff.

                                        WALTER
                      Lily.

        Belinda enters, and without missing a beat: 

                                        BELINDA
                      Don t do it.  It s a death trap, it s a 
                      suicide run.

                                        WALTER
                      Lily s back visiting her Dad.  I can tell 
                    by the way the air shimmers.  And she 
                      texted me.

                                        BELINDA
                    You don t listen to a word I say.

                                        WALTER
                      I appreciate your advice and I know you 
                    care about me.

      Walter hops out of bed.  Belinda blocks the doorway.

                                        BELINDA
                       Care  is insufficient to describe my 
                      willingness to murder anyone who hurts 
                    you.

                                        WALTER
                      You re not going to change my mind.

                                        BELINDA
                      Walter.  You may be too old for me to 
                    lock in the basement.  But you are too 
                      young to learn that dreams are just lies 
                    we tell ourselves when we re asleep.

      Walter believes he is different from everybody else.  He 
      can feel it deep inside.  Now all he needs is actual 
      proof.  Which some might call hope.

                                        WALTER
                      I should ve told her when we were ten and 
                    she hated her braces.  I should ve told 
                    her when we were twelve and she placed 
                      third in the Scripps National Spelling 
                    bee --                                                                                      3.



                                        BELINDA
                      I could spell  laodicean  standing on my 
                      head.

                                        WALTER
                      I should ve told her when we were sixteen 
                    and she blew out her knee at Kitzbuhel.  
                      I should ve told her when we were twenty 
                    and she modeled in Paris.

                                        BELINDA
                      Funny thing.  You never mention what you 
                    were doing at the time.

                                        WALTER
                      Today, I m finally going to tell Lily 
                      Theroux how I feel.  I m going to put the 
                      right words in the right order like a 
                      magic spell.  And when I do?  Everything 
                    will be different than it was before.  
                    I ll be different, too.

      Walter steps to the hallway.  Belinda calls after him.

                                        BELINDA
                      Hearts don t break like legs break.  The 
                      pieces never really mend.  Brush your 
                      teeth!!



      The Im-Paws-ible Dream Pet Salon is a tiny pet groooming 
      business hidden in a sunbaked mini-mall.  Keeping Your 
      Pets Happy Since 2003!

      IN THE SALON

        A cramped interior.  Walter works at a big metal tub in 
      the back.  He wears rubber gloves and an apron.  He washes 
      a toy poodle and rehearses:  

                                        WALTER
                       Lily.  I know this will come as a 
                      surprise --  
                                (beat)
                       Lily.  It took me a long time to 
                      understand --  

      AKIO NOMO is in his late 60s.  He trims each pet with care 
      and precision.  Nomo listens to Walter rehearse.

                                        WALTER
                       Lily.  I know this will come as a 
                      surprise --    

                                        NOMO
                      Walter?

                                        WALTER
                    Yes, Mister Nomo?

                                        NOMO
                      There is no way this will come as a 
                      surprise to anyone.  Lily included.

        Everybody knows how Walter feels about Lily.

                                        NOMO
                    Try the other way.

                                        WALTER
                     It took me a long time -- ? 

                                        NOMO
                    That one, yes.

                                        WALTER
                       Lily.  It took me a long time to 
                      understand that my life had a purpose. 

      Nomo nods approval.  Then, quiet and sure:                                                                                      5.



                                        NOMO
                        Congratulations.  Today is your happy 
                      ending.  



      Walter opens one of the boxes stacked against the wall.  
      It s full of old vinyl.  Walter removes a record.  There s 
      a name printed on the sleeve.  BEN SPACKMAN.  Walter takes 
      the album to an old turntable.  He places the record on 
      the platter, puts the needle to the groove.   Are You 
      Ready  by Pacific Gas & Electric, an absurdly soulful rock 
      song, circa 1970, BLASTS into the room.  

      Walter lets the music wash over him.  He is eager.  He is 
      ready.  At least until the record starts to SKIP.   Walter 
      bows to the walls of his bedroom like an Olympic boxer.  
      Lifts the needle from the groove.  Steps from the room.



      Night.  Walter lies in his hospital bed.  Belinda sleeps 
      in a chair.  Walter is unconscious.  But then a faint 
        stirring.  Walter s eyes OPEN.  A beat.  Then:

                                        WALTER
                    Ow.

        Belinda wakes, and leaps to his side.

                                        BELINDA
                      Walter?

                                        WALTER
                      I was struck by lightning.

                                        BELINDA
                    That explains the charring.

                                        WALTER
                    Can you hear that?

      The RINGING resumed the moment he woke up.

                                        BELINDA
                    Hear what?  Walter.  How do you feel?

                                        WALTER
                      Slight numbing weakness in my 
                      extremities.  Problematic concentration.  
                      Increased irritability which is probably 
                    the result of frontal lobe damage.  
                      Headache, dizziness.  And of course the 
                      ringing.

                                        BELINDA
                      Anything else?

                                        WALTER
                      I used to think I had a destiny and her 
                    name was Lily Theroux but now I know I 
                    will never be anything but normal.

                                        BELINDA
                    You got hit by lightning and didn t die.

                                        WALTER
                      Except for that.                                                                                    15.




      The hospital exterior.  It s a sunny day.

      IN WALTER S HOSPITAL ROOM

      Time passes.  Walter recovers.  He s in the same hospital 
      bed.  The RINGING continues at an even lower level.  
      Walter is bored and restless and alone.  

        There s a glass of water on a stand next to the bed.  
      Walter reaches for the glass, but it is out of reach.  
      Walter frowns, reaches for it a second time.  But the 
      glass is still beyond his grasp.  Walter exhales an 
        irritable sigh.  He keeps his arm extended.  And then 
        something impossible happens.  The glass MOVES three 
      inches toward his fingertips.  As if to respond to his 
      mind s wish.  Walter FREEZES.  He looks around the room 
      for witnesses or a reason.  He checks under the stand.  A 
      beat.  Walter looks back to the glass.  

        Belinda Spackman BARGES into the hospital room without 
      warning.  Walter SCREAMS at the top of his lungs.  Belinda 
      pretends that he didn t.

                                        BELINDA
                      You re looking chipper.

        Macklin follows Belinda into the room.  He pushes a 
        wheelchair.  Belinda indicates the chair.

                                        BELINDA
                    Time to go.  I completed the relevant 
                      paperwork, strangled two doctors and --

                                        WALTER
                      I think I may be having hallucinations.

                                        BELINDA
                    Of course you are, dear.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Maybe it s a side effect of getting your 
                      brain boiled.

      That s when Walter realizes there s something he missed.

                                        WALTER
                    The ringing.  It s gone.

      And it STOPPED the moment he moved that glass.  Or 
        hallucinated that he did.  Or not. 



        Another sunny day in Studio City.                                                                                    16.



      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter gets out of bed with unusual caution.  There s a 
        slipper on the floor.  Walter looks at the slipper, and it 
      MOVES three inches closer.  Walter lets out YELP, and 
      dives back into bed.  He looks around the room.  Every 
        object, large and small, represents a threat.  If only 
        because Walter is afraid he ll move it with his mind.

      TIME CUT - IN THE KITCHEN

      Walter eats breakfast with his mother.  Walter eyes his 
      bowl of cereal.  Naturally, the bowl MOVES three inches in 
      his direction.  Walter grabs it with both hands, if only 
      to stop his mother from noticing. 

                                        BELINDA
                    -- And you can stay here for as long as 
                    you like.  Apartment-hunting can wait.  I 
                    will tend to your every need.

      Walter looks to a glass of orange juice.  He reaches for 
      it slowly so as not to disrupt the space/time continuum.  
      Walter takes hold of the glass.  It did not move an inch.  
      Walter reacts with relief.  

                                        BELINDA
                    Is there something wrong with the orange 
                      juice?  I squeezed it myself.

                                        WALTER
                    No, it s fine.  Very fresh.

      Walter s spoon starts to bounce and shake.  Walter slams a 
      hand on top of it.  And changes the subject:

                                        WALTER
                    So.  Mom.  What happened to your fake 
                      cigarette?

                                        BELINDA
                      I quit fake smoking.  It s fake bad for 
                    you.

      The doorbell RINGS.  Now what?

                                        WALTER
                    Is that my head or is that the door?



      Walter opens the front door.  It s Lily Theroux.  Lily 
      looks at him with great sympathy. 

                                        LILY
                      Walter.  Can I hug you?  Is that -- ?                                                                                    17.



                                        WALTER
                      A hug would be great.  Thanks.

      Lily hugs Walter.  Walter holds on longer than he should.

      TIME CUT - IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Walter and Lily sit in the living room.  An awkward beat.

                                        LILY
                    I m sorry I didn t get back to the 
                      hospital.  I was in Oakland helping Alice 
                      Waters build a sustainable garden for 
                    poor children --

                                        WALTER
                      That s okay.  My stay there was 
                      completely uneventful.

      No it wasn t.

                                        LILY
                    Are you feeling better?

                                        WALTER
                    Much improved.

                                        LILY
                      Walter.  We can t pretend you didn t say 
                    what you said.  But I hope, I know, we 
                    can get back to the way we were.  This 
                      doesn t have to make it harder for us to 
                    be friends.

                                        WALTER
                      I don t think it can be much harder.

                                        LILY
                      Well.  I just wanted to check in.  Make 
                    sure you were all right.  Come and see me 
                    if you want.  Any time.  I mean it.

      TIME CUT - AT A WINDOW

      Walter stands at a window, and watches Lily return to the 
        street.  A young man with the chiseled features of an all-
      star athlete who decided to model for a couple years in 
      Milan waits for her on a motorcycle.  This is DJANGO. 



      Late at night.  A bright moon soars overhead.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter gets out of bed, steps to his window.  He opens the 
        blinds.  Lily s bedroom is directly opposite.  The bedroom                                                                                     18.



      curtains are drawn.  Light shines inside.  Walter can HEAR 
      the sound of MUFFLED conversation.  Lily s talking on the 
        telephone.  Walter extends his arm to her window.  Walter 
        focuses and the focus is reflected in his face.  He 
      gestures for the curtains to part.  And they do.  Three 
        inches.  But not an inch more.  Walter s not freaked out 
      this time.  He s not surprised, either.  Walter smiles.



      Walter sits in bed in the dark.  Walter thinks about what 
      he did.  Walter s not sure where to turn.                                                                                      20.




      The Hollywood Restaurant is a hip hangout in Hollywood.  

      INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

        Post-modern club decor.  Tables, booths.  An open kitchen 
      and a long bar.  Walter sits at the bar over a bottle of 
      beer.  Macklin steps into view.  He wears kitchen whites.

                                        MACKLIN
                      What s up?

                                        WALTER
                    The first of many beers.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Nuking your sorrows with alcohol.  Good 
                      plan.

                                        WALTER
                    Do you think alcohol will help me forget 
                      Lily?

                                        MACKLIN
                      I don t think it s possible to drink that 
                      much.

        Macklin returns to the kitchen.  Walter looks to a bowl of 
      peanuts.  The bowl MOVES three inches to his hand.  A 
      beat.  Then a surprise:

                                        TROY S VOICE
                      Hello, Walter.

        A stranger sits two stools away.  It s Troy Hamilton, last 
      seen at Walter s hospital bed.  

                                        WALTER
                    Hey.

      Wait a minute.

                                        WALTER
                    Have we met?

                                        TROY
                    No.

                                        WALTER
                    But you know my name.

                                        TROY
                      I know everything about you.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?                                                                                    21.



                                        TROY
                    It s my job.

      Troy sits beside Walter.  He s an affable man.  Quick to 
      smile, a twinkle in his eyes.  But there s iron behind the 
      friendly exterior.  

                                        WALTER
                      Well, whatever they re paying you?  It s 
                    too much.

                                        TROY
                    Why do you say that?

                                        WALTER
                    I m a twenty-six year-old dog washer 
                      currently living with his mother.  What s 
                    to know?

                                        TROY
                      Don t be so hard on yourself.  Everybody 
                    has a secret gift inside.  A difference.  
                    You just happen to be a little more in 
                      touch with yours than most.  The trick is 
                    to make the very best of it that you can. 

                                        WALTER
                    My Mom buys audio books that sound just 
                    like you.  

                                        TROY
                    I m curious.  Have you tested the limits 
                    of your ability?  It s important to 
                      understand what you can and can t do.

      Walter reacts.  Troy knows.  

                                        WALTER
                    Who are you?

                                        TROY
                    Troy Hamilton.

      Walter s not sure what to do next.  Because this 
        conversation feels impossible.  

                                        WALTER
                    So.  Troy Hamilton.  What can I do for 
                    you?

                                        TROY
                      Ideally?  You can help me fight evil and 
                    make the world a better place.

                                        WALTER
                      Seriously.  Why are you here?                                                                                    22.



                                        TROY
                      I find people with special talents.  We 
                      track lightning strike victims.  That s 
                    how I found you.

                                        WALTER
                    Are you part of a super secret government 
                      organization that turns out to be as bad 
                    as the bad guys in the end?

                                        TROY
                    I m a private contractor with good 
                      intentions and clear conscience.  Wasabi 
                      peanut?

      Troy indicates the bowl of peanuts that Walter pushed.  A 
      beat.  Walter quietly confesses:

                                        WALTER
                      Look.  Whatever I move, I can only move 
                    it three inches.  It s the worst 
                      superpower ever.  Like having an extra 
                      thumb.

                                        TROY
                    You need to expand your line of thinking.

                                        WALTER
                    Bar bets?  The circus?

                                        TROY
                    You have no idea what you can do.  Not 
                    yet.  

                                        WALTER
                      Invisibility.  Now there s a superpower.

                                        TROY
                      Doesn t exist.  I looked.

      Walter reacts.  Walter looks back to his beer.  Troy leans 
      a little closer to him.

                                        TROY
                      Walter.  I know exactly how you feel.  
                    You feel lost and alone.  You feel like 
                      nobody could ever understand.  You feel 
                    like a freak.  But that s not who you 
                    are.

      Walter turns to Troy.  Troy meets his gaze.

                                        WALTER
                      Okay.  Who am I?

                                                                                      23.



                                        TROY
                      You re a young man with a special talent.  
                      A talent that can make you a hero.

                                        WALTER
                    I m not hero material.  Ask anyone.

      Walter gets up, and walks away.



      Troy Hamilton remains at the bar.  Walter returns to him.  

                                        WALTER
                    My talent isn t a talent.  It s a curse.  
                    I m going back to washing dogs where I 
                      belong.

      Except here he is.  Troy meets Walter s gaze.

                                        TROY
                    Tell you what.   Why don t I introduce 
                    you to the rest of the team, and then you 
                    can make up your mind.

                                        WALTER
                      Wait.  There s a team?

                                        TROY
                    Of course there is.  You can t fight evil 
                    all by yourself.

      Walter takes a closer look at Troy.  Having grown up 
        without one, every man he meets is measured for a father.

                                        WALTER
                    You want a beer?  I get a discount.

                                        TROY
                      A beer would be just the thing.

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    24.



                                        ACT THREE



      Morning.  The modest two-bedroom house in Studio City.  

      IN A HALLWAY & BEDROOM

        Belinda walks down the hallway, and calls out as she goes:

                                        BELINDA
                    Rise and shine, my little lightning rod!  
                    All work and no play makes Walter --

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

                                        BELINDA
                    -- A minimum wage employee!

        Belinda continues inside.  Walter s bed is empty.



        A sparsely furnished living room.  The door OPENS, and 
      Troy ushers Walter inside.  The image SHIMMERS almost 
        imperceptibly.  Troy speaks TO CAMERA.

                                        TROY
                      Everybody?  This is Walter Spackman.  I 
                      invited Walter to join us.  But Walter 
                    has his doubts.

      CAMERA PANS 180 degrees to REVEAL a young man.  He s 31 
      years old.  This is TIME ZONE.  He watched Walter s 
        arrival like it was on TV.  And in a way it was.  Time 
      Zone just looked five minutes into the future.

                                        TIME ZONE
                    New guy s coming.  Walter Spackman.

      Time Zone grabs his head, doubles over with pain.  It s a 
      side effect.  THE HUMAN SMELL, a chubby, acned boy of 16, 
      steps beside him.                                                                                    25.



                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    What does he do?

                                        TIME ZONE
                      I can t tell.

      MOOD SWING puts a comforting hand to his back, and looks 
      to the front door.  She s a beautiful young woman of 28.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Whatever it is?  If Troy wanted us all 
                    here to meet him, he must be something 
                      special.



      Troy and Walter step toward a drab 1950s ranch house.

                                        TROY
                    It s not exactly the Fortress of 
                      Solitude.  We like to keep a low profile.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Troy ushers Walter into house and living room.  Exactly 
      like Time Zone saw it.  Troy speaks TO CAMERA again.

                                        TROY
                      Everybody?  This is Walter Spackman.  I 
                      invited Walter to join us.  But Walter 
                    has his doubts.                                                                                    26.



      MYNAH BIRD, 45, steps to greet them.  She looks like a 
      suburban housewife.  From Seoul, Korea.  Her expression is 
      blank.  Mynah Bird s expression is always blank.  

                                        TROY
                    This is Mynah Bird.  She can duplicate 
                    and broadcast almost any sound.

      Mynah holds out hand to shake.  THE BUGMASTER follows.  
      He s an albino man of 35.

                                        TROY
                    The Bugmaster is able to commune with 
                      members of the insect kingdom.

        A cockroach skitters from the Bugmaster s hair down the 
      collar of his shirt.  

                                        TROY
                    Time Zone can see into the future.  
                      Approximately five minutes.

      Time Zone s face retains the headache wince.

                                        TROY
                    The Human Smell?  Well.  You can probably 
                      guess.

      The Human Smell muttered throughout the introductions.  
      Now we HEAR what he s muttering.  It s a kind of superhero 
      VOICE OVER, a narration for this boy s life.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    -- As they came face to face, the first 
                      thing Walter noticed was the Smell s 
                      steely gaze, eyes that penetrate --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Save it, Stinky.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Sorry.  Hey.  Dude.

      Walter shakes his hand.  Troy indicates Mood Swing.

                                        TROY
                    And Mood Swing.  Able to alter and shape 
                      emotional states faster and more 
                      effectively than any drug known to man.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s not exactly leaping tall buildings 
                    in a single bound.  But I get by.  What s 
                    your secret, Walter?

      Walter looks at Mood Swing and forgets his own name.                                                                                    27.



                                        WALTER
                      I can -- I can -- I --

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Probably not public speaking.

                                        TROY
                      Walter can move any object three inches.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    That sounds about right.  Welcome.  I 
                      think you re going to like it here. 

      Mood Swing holds out a hand.  Walter takes hold.  Walter s 
      doubts decrease by a factor of ten.



      Walter sits before a panel screen in a computer lab.  Troy 
      Hamilton looks over his shoulder. 

      A HIDDEN CAMERA in Walter s hospital room recorded his 
        recovery.  Troy FAST-FORWARDS the images.  Until he finds 
      Walter considering a glass of water beyond his reach.  
      Walter MOVES the glass toward his fingertips.  Walter 
        watches the recent past with quiet fascination. 

                                        WALTER
                      I thought I was crazy.

                                        TROY
                    Not crazy, Walter.  Amazing.

      Troy puts a hand on Walter s shoulder.  

                                        TROY
                    What do you say we find out just how 
                      amazing you are?



      Troy and Walter move to a sterile white room.  CAMERAS 
      record the session.  A YOUNG WOMAN in a white lab coat 
      inputs data into a hand-held.  Troy sets three oranges on 
      a narrow platform. 

                                        TROY
                      Target practice.

                                        WALTER
                    Are you training me to be a fruit 
                      assassin?

      Troy deadpans.  Walter extends an arm.  He focuses, the 
      focus is reflected in his face.  Walter pushes the first 
      orange off the platform.  Then the second and the third.                                                                                    28.



                                        TROY
                      Amazing.

      The praise warms.  Troy sets up three more oranges.  He 
      moves Walter farther from the platform.

                                        TROY
                    So.  This Lily Theroux.  What s she do, 
                      anyway?

                                        WALTER
                    How do you know about Lily?

                                        TROY
                     I know everything about you. 

                                        WALTER
                      She s a model-humanitarian.

                                        TROY
                    Does she know what you can do?

                                        WALTER
                    No.

      Walter knocks an orange off the platform.  Troy moves him 
      back a step.  Walter handles a second orange, too.

                                        TROY
                    In my limited experience?  When it comes 
                    to model-humanitarians, you have to take 
                    the long view.

      Troy moves Walter back another step.  Walter extends his 
      arm, focuses.  But this time nothing happens.  Troy looks 
      to the young woman in the lab coat.

                                        TROY
                      Maximum range.  Twelve feet, four inches.

      Troy looks back to Walter.  Walter s still trying to knock 
      the last orange off the platform.  He extends his arm as 
      far as he can.  His face scrunches with effort.

                                        TROY
                    The face scrunching probably doesn t 
                      help.  You can lose the stiff-arm, too.

      Walter de-scrunches.  Walter drops his arm.



      Walter and Troy return to the computer lab.  Walter sits 
      at a smart screen.  There are locks of different makes on 
      the screen.  Some whole, some in pieces.  Walter can move 
      the parts with his fingertips.  Troy stands over him.                                                                                    29.



                                        TROY
                    Your basic key lock contains a small 
                      cylinder.  When the door is locked, a 
                    part called the tang is partially out of 
                    the cynlinder.  When the door is 
                      unlocked, the tang rests fully inside it.  
                    You need a key to release the tang.  
                      Unless you are you.

                                        WALTER
                    So what you re saying is.  I can be the 
                    best locksmith ever.  Wow.  All my dreams 
                    are coming true.  

                                        TROY
                    What I m saying is.  Sometimes the good 
                    guys need to walk through doors that only 
                    you can open.

      Walter never considered that.

                                        TROY
                      A bowling ball or a feather.  It s always 
                      three inches?

                                        WALTER
                    Yep.  I don t know why.

                                        TROY
                    It makes sense.  We re made of atoms.  
                      Everything is.  The only thing holding 
                      those atoms together is the electrical 
                      attraction between the negatively charged 
                      electron and the positively charged 
                      nucleus.  The lightning must ve altered 
                    your brain chemistry, allowing you to 
                      exert electromagnetic force on the atoms 
                    in any object.  But there s only so much 
                      charge in the atoms that you can access.  
                    That would limit the distance you can 
                    move them.



      Back in the white room.  There s a glass door on wheels.  
      Walter stands on one side, Troy on the other.  Troy speaks 
      to Walter through the glass. 

                                        TROY
                    Let me in.

      Walter starts to extend his arm, as is habit.  But then he 
      stops.  Walter focuses.  Nothing.  Walter reacts.  He 
      tries again.  Nothing.  Walter mutters unhappily:

                                        WALTER
                      I can t do this.                                                                                    30.



                                        TROY
                      Concentrate, Walter.  Be the lock.

                                        WALTER
                      That s not helping.

      Walter faces the door and the lock.  Then we HEAR it.  An 
        audible and welcome CLICK.  Walter and Troy react.  Troy 
        reaches for the door.  A tense beat.  Walter wonders.  
      Troy OPENS it.  Troy grins, Walter beams.  This is fun.   

        ANOTHER ANGLE - OBSERVATION WINDOW

        There s an observation window that looks into the white 
      room.  A young man stands on the other side of the glass.  
      This is CAPTAIN NORMAL.  He is 26 just like Walter.  
        Captain Normal watches Troy and Walter work.  He doesn t 
      like what he SEES.



      A new day.  The two-bedroom in Studio City.  

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter s room and bed are empty.  The door suddenly swings 
      OPEN.  Belinda s on the other side.  As if she was trying 
      to catch Walter before he left.  But she didn t.



      Walter returns to the surburban HQ.  Troy leads Walter 
        through the living room to an elevator.  The elevator 
      doors OPEN.  Walter and Troy step inside, descend.

        MONTAGE

      - In the white room.  Walter faces the familiar platform.  
      But this time he wears headphones.  The headphones fill 
      with SOUNDS meant to distract, and impair his focus.  High 
      treble hiss, sudden screams, horrific explosions.  A 
      Celine Dion power ballad.  Walter knocks objects off the 
        platform.  He s like a gunslinger and his mind is the gun.  
      Troy Hamilton nods with satisfaction.

      - In a corridor.  Walter faces a locked door.  Troy 
        watches and waits.  Walter looks to the keypad.  No arm 
        extended, no scrunched face.  Just growing confidence.   
      Walter unlocks the door with his mind.  He opens the door, 
        reacts.  It s a comfortably decorated bedroom, wholly at 
      odds with the rest of the HQ.  Walter wonders what the 
        bedroom is for. 

      - In the white room.  Walter faces the platform.  There 
      are objects all over the floor.  But one remains in place.  
      Walter tries to move it but he can t.  The woman in the 
      lab coat checks a stopwatch, writes down the time in a box 
      marked DURATION/LIMIT.                                                                                        32.



        - Sunset.  Five cars are parked in the alley behind the 
      drab house.  Walter races from car to car, and starts each 
        ignition.  Troy waits at the last car.  He applauds.



      Walter and Troy return to the living room.  

                                        TROY
                    Wait here.

      Troy steps off.  Walter sits on a sofa.  Walter feels 
        special and he never felt like this before.  That s when 
      Mood Swing enters.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      How s it going?

                                        WALTER
                    Hi.  What?

      Walter s newly acquired powers do not yet include the 
        ability to converse with beautiful women.  

                                        WALTER
                    Oh.  With Troy.  Great.  I mean I was 
                      worried at first, there s all this stuff 
                    to learn, and it s hard sometimes, but 
                    the thing is --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You never really knew how much you could 
                    do until now.

                                        WALTER
                    No, I didn t.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Troy does that for everyone.

                                        WALTER
                    Are you altering or shaping my emotional 
                      state with your mind right now? 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    No.

                                        WALTER
                      Sorry.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    I ve got an idea.  Why don t we 
                      celebrate?  Drinks?

                                        WALTER
                      Sure.  Great.  I know a place we can go.                                                                                    33.



      Walter hurries to his feet.  A familiar voice is HEARD.  
      Or rather, narration.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL S VOICE
                    The only thing the Smell liked more than 
                    the touch of a woman who thought he was 
                    cool was the cool touch of a bottle of 
                    beer served to him by a woman --

      The Human Smell ambles into view.  Time Zone, Bugmaster, 
      and Mynah Bird follow. 

                                        TIME ZONE
                    Time you got to know the team.



      The team sits in a booth in the back.  A WAITRESS leaves 
      the latest in a series of pitchers.  The mood is bright 
      and familiar.  The beer helped.

                                        THE BUGMASTER
                      I was working in the Entomology 
                      Department at Texas A&M.  One day this 
                      stranger walks into the lab, and he asks 
                    for me by name, and he doesn t look at me 
                    like other people do, like I m weird or --

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Dude.  You are weird.

      Walter looks off toward the open kitchen.  

      JUMP CUT - IN THE BOOTH

      Myna Bird speaks in the voice of Troy Hamilton.

                                        MYNAH BIRD
                      Everybody has a secret gift inside.  You 
                    just happen to be a little more in touch 
                    with yours than most.  The trick is to 
                    make the very best of it that you can.

      Walter reacts.  Everybody laughs.  Walter grins. 

      JUMP CUT - IN THE BOOTH

      Time Zone winces through a headache, and mutters:                                                                                    34.

                      Anybody know where the nearest Rite-Aid 
                    is?

      JUMP CUT - IN THE MENS ROOM

      Walter and The Human Smell wash up in the Mens Room. 

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    My baby smell was like the smell of a 
                      million stinky baby diapers.  Freaked Mom 
                    and Dad right out.  They were afraid of 
                    me, you know?  And girls are pretty much 
                    out of the question  cause I can t always 
                      control my aroma.  But here?  I m not a 
                      mutant, I m special.  
                                (beat)
                    Ever wonder why superheroes work in 
                      teams?  Family.  Everybody wants one. 

      JUMP CUT - IN THE BOOTH

      Time Zone s cell phone rings.  He answers, speaks into it.

                                        TIME ZONE
                    Hey.  Out with the team.  We re breaking 
                    in the new guy.

      The Human Smell mouths explanation to Walter.  The wife.

                                        TIME ZONE
                      Cough medicine?  Sure.  She okay?

      The Human Smell mouths again.  The baby.

                                        TIME ZONE
                    I ll pick it up upon the way home.  
                      There s a Rite Aid on Sunset.

        Because he already knew this call was coming.

      JUMP CUT - IN THE BOOTH

      Walter pours himself another beer.  He listens to the back 
      and forth with growing wonder.

                                        THE BUGMASTER
                      I hear rumors.

                                        TIME ZONE
                    New mission in forty-eight.

                                        WALTER
                      Mission?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Retrieval and delivery.                                                                                      35.



                                        WALTER
                      Wait.  When you say  forty-eight  do you 
                    mean forty-eight hours?

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      What s the target?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Package.

                                        WALTER
                      Okay.  Hang on.  What kind of package?

      They all look to Walter.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    If we knew that?

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    It wouldn t be half as fun.

      Walter s heart swells.  He feels like he s in Joe s Bar on 
        Galactica with Starbuck and Helo.



        Patrons exit from the bar to the night.  It s late.

      INSIDE THE BAR

      Mood Swing studies Walter for a beat.  Then:

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You need a catch phrase. 

                                        WALTER
                      I do?

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Everybody has one.

                                        WALTER
                    They do?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    No.  But you need a costume.

                                        WALTER
                      I do?

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Everybody has one.

                                        WALTER
                    They do?                                                                                    36.



                                        MOOD SWING
                    No.  But you need a superhero identity.

      Walter does not speak.  If only to avoid getting fooled 
      again.  Mood Swing deadpans:

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Actually you do need a superhero 
                      identity.   Walter  won t cut it in this 
                    line of work.

      Walter grins.  The Human Smell was right.  With each 
        passing moment, this feels more like a family to him.

      JUMP CUT - IN THE BOOTH

      Walter pours himself another beer.

                                        WALTER
                    When did you realize you could make 
                      people happy or sad?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    The day after I hit puberty.

                                        WALTER
                      What s your real name?  What did they 
                    call you when you were born?  If you were 
                      running across a summer lawn and your 
                      mother shouted your name because it was 
                    time for dinner, what name would she -- ?

      Walter s shitfaced.  A VOICE interrupts:

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL S VOICE
                      That s a secret nobody knows.  

      Walter turns to the sound.  Captain Normal stands over 
      him.  He s the young man who watched Walter train.  He is 
        handsome, cocksure, and strong.  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Step out, Newbie.

      Walter obeys without thinking.  Captain Normal sits in his 
      place next to Mood Swing.

                                        WALTER
                    Who are you?

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    I m the guy that makes sure you freaks 
                      don t screw up.  I m the team leader, and 
                      liasion to Mister Hamilton.  When I give 
                    an order?  You obey.  Sit.                                                                                    37.



        Freaks.  There s that word again.  Walter sits in spite of 
      himself.  The Human Smell quietly narrates his 
        humiliation:

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    The night tasted of defeat and broken 
                      dreams.  Captain Normal smirked, his 
                      arrogance exceeded only by his one true 
                      ability -- the ability to act like a 
                      total douche bag --  

        Captain Normal shoots a look at the Human Smell.

                                        WALTER
                      What s your special power?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Captain Normal doesn t have one.

                                        MYNAH BIRD
                      Hence the name.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    My special ability is I can kick your ass 
                    with one hand tied behind my back.

        Captain Normal puts an arm around Mood Swing.  Mood Swing 
      shrugs it off.  But Walter SEES the way Captain Normal 
      looks at her.  Walter s heart sinks just a little.



      In the kitchen.  Walter steps between racks.  A LINE COOK 
      nods a greeting.  He s a familiar face here.  Walter finds 
        Macklin chopping lettuce in the back.

                                        WALTER
                      Still on prep?

        Macklin keeps chopping.  He s angry.

                                        WALTER
                      Look.  I m sorry about disappearing like 
                      that.  But something really weird 
                      happened to me -- I brought some friends 
                      I want you to meet -- 

                                        MACKLIN
                    No worries.  I m going to find a place by 
                      myself.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?                                                                                    38.



                                        MACKLIN
                    Well sure, if you were my roommate I 
                      could probably get you on the phone, but 
                    I m not sure it s worth the aggravation.

                                        WALTER
                      Maybe you should lighten up a little.

                                        MACKLIN
                    I ve been hacking romaine for three 
                      hours.  You lighten up.

      Walter would be more sympathetic if he wasn t shitfaced.

                                        WALTER
                    You don t have to be a dick about it.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Right.   Cause it s my fault.  I waste my 
                    time trying to find us a decent place to 
                    live while you chase after Lily who 
                      treats you like a pet which reminds me, 
                      washing dogs?  C mon man, isn t that a 
                      little embarrassing but no, everything s 
                    cool -- joke girl, joke job -- because 
                    you have a ten-year plan that everybody 
                      knows used to be five.  Also lately you 
                    suck as a friend.

        A stunned beat.  Walter can t believe he said that.  He 
      walks away.  Macklin can t believe he said it, either.

      AT THE BOOTH

      Walter steps back to the booth.  Captain Normal is 
      missing.  Everybody looks up at him.  Walter wobbles. 

                                        WALTER
                      I need you to do me a favor and not ask 
                    why and I will happily join the team if 
                    you do this favor for me.  In return.  

      TIME CUT - AT THE BOOTH 

        Captain Normal returns with a pitcher of beer.  Only The 
      Human Smell remains.  He quietly narrates:

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    The Smell met his gaze with the carefree 
                      abandon of a man with no zits and nothing 
                    left to lose --  



      Walter rises in an elevator.  The doors open to reveal the 
      sparsely furnished house in Grenada Hills.  

      Walter enters the living room.  Walter wears a uniform.  
      It s a sleek black bodysuit.  Everyone is waiting for him.  
      Mood Swing, The Bugmaster, Myna Bird, The Human Smell, 
      Time Zone.  Troy Hamilton and Captain Normal.  They all 
      APPLAUD.  Except for Captain Normal.

                                        TROY
                    How does it feel, Walter?

                                        WALTER
                    It rides up a little in the butt but I m 
                    sure that can be --

                                        TROY
                    How does it feel to join the Team?

                                        WALTER
                    Oh.  It feels great.

      Troy steps to Walter, claps a hand on either arm.

                                        TROY
                      Good.  First op in thirty-six hours.



      Late night.  No lights in the Spackman house.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter sits in the dark.  The iMac s Buffy screensaver 
      casts light.  Walter is nervous, on edge.  

      TIME CUT - AT HIS COMPUTER 

      Walter sits at the computer.  He checks the iChat panel.  
        Macklin is on line.  Walter composes a message to him.  
      This is going to sound insane.  But you have to believe 
      me.  Every word is true.  

      Walter stops.  He s not sure how to put the impossible 
      into words.  Walter looks away from the computer.  When he 
      looks back?  Troy Hamilton peers at him from the screen.  
      Walter reacts with yelping surprise.

                                        TROY
                      Sorry to pop in like this.  I just wanted 
                    to see how you were doing.                                                                                    41.



                                        WALTER
                      Doing great.  Never better.  Super good.

                                        TROY
                      You re scared to death.

                                        WALTER
                      Every cell in my body is screaming.  
                      That s seventy trillion cells.

                                        TROY
                    Do something for me?  Step to the window.  
                    Look at the stars.

      Walter steps to the window.

                                        WALTER
                      I can t see them.  But that s mostly due 
                    to the city lights, and there may also be 
                      a cloud or smog layer --

                                        TROY
                      Walter.  You can t see the stars but you 
                    know they re up there.  That s not faith 
                    or a good guess.  It s a fact.  The 
                      courage inside you is like the stars.  
                    You can t see it, but it s there.  That s 
                      a fact.

      Walter keeps his eyes on the sky.  Then, as much to 
        himself as to Hamilton:

                                        WALTER
                      I decided at a very early age, four 
                      actually, to learn the answer to every 
                      question.  And I did, to the exclusion of 
                      almost everything else, and then one day 
                      there I was, and my head is full of 
                      answers and that s when I realized I 
                      forgot all the questions.  Except the 
                      first one.

                                        TROY
                    What was your first question?

                                        WALTER
                       Where s Dad? 

                                        TROY
                    You never knew your father.

                                        WALTER
                      I was only three when he died.

                                        TROY
                      A boy should know his Dad.

      Walter looks back to the iMac screen.                                                                                    42.



                                        WALTER
                      I got a box of his old records.  And a 
                      photograph.  I used to keep it by my bed.  
                    But it wasn t a memory.  It was just a 
                      picture.  Like an insert in a frame you 
                    buy.  All that did was make me sadder.  I 
                    put it away.

                                        TROY
                    Do me a favor?  Put it back.

                                        WALTER
                      Okay.

                                        TROY
                    Get some sleep.  Big day, tomorrow.
                    Good night, son.

      Son.  It s a companionable descriptive.  But it feels like 
      more than that to Walter.  Troy Hamilton reaches OFF-
        SCREEN, disconnects. 



      Night.  Limousines idle outside the Four Seasons Hotel.

      INSIDE THE HOTEL

      PAVEL HUSAK sits at the hotel bar.  Husak is a quiet man 
      of middle age.  He wears a bespoke suit and a blank 
        expression.  He drinks a glass of wine.  A BODYGUARD sits 
      beside him.  The BARTENDER sets his drink on the bar.

                                          BARTENDER S VOICE
                    Club soda and lime.

      The bartender is Time Zone.  The bodyguard takes a sip.  
      Time Zone takes a closer look at him.

      TIME CUT - AT THE END OF THE BAR 

      Time Zone winces through a headache.  He speaks into a 
      cuff mike.

                      Men s room.

      ON A SOFA

        Captain Normal sits on a sofa.  He wears a suit.  He 
      cleans up nice.  Captain Normal speaks into a cuff mike.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    You heard the lady.  Move.

      THREE MERCS in track suits move to the rest rooms.  
        Captain Normal walks out of the lounge.                                                                                    43.



      AT THE BAR

      Pavel Husak s bodyguard grunts, grabs at his stomach.  He 
      races to the men s room before his bowels explode.  A 
        beautiful woman takes his place.  It s Mood Swing in a 
      black cocktail dress.  Mood Swing cleans up more than 
      nice.  She s stunning.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Hello, Doctor Husak.

      Husak suddenly is filled with warmth, contentment, and 
        memory.  He looks at Mood Swing with absolute wonder.

                                        HUSAK
                      I almost forgot.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    What did you forget?

                                        HUSAK
                      Solovyovo.  Home.  There is an island in 
                    the middle of the lake and there are 
                      ruins of a church on the island.  It is 
                    said that the bones of a saint are buried 
                    in the soil.
                                (beat)
                      I was only eight years old.  We took an 
                    old rowboat, my sister Vladka and me.  We 
                      rowed to the island and we looked for the 
                      bones.  Vladka.  I haven t thought about 
                    her in years.

      Husak is captive to happiness.  Mood Swing knows just when 
      to make her move.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Tell me where it is, Pavel.

                                        HUSAK
                      What?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    The package.



      The warehouse is a high security facility.  There s a door 
      at the end of a corridor.  A bulletproof glass booth next 
      to the door.  A GUARD sits inside.  He reads a magazine.  
      Nobody goes through the door without going through him.

        There s an air conditioning vent over his head.  A 
        butterfly slips through vent.  It alights on his shoulder.  
      The guard swats the butterfly away.  He turns back to his 
        magazine.  But then a second butterfly floats into view.  
      This one bounces off his mouth.  The guard spits.

                                        GUARD #3
                    What the -- ?

        A third butterfly appears.  A fourth.  Butterflies POUR 
        through the vent.

      WIDER ANGLE

      The booth FILLS with butterflies.  The guard flails.  When 
      he SCREAMS the butterflies fill his mouth.  The team 
        watches the guard sink from view.                                                                                    46.



                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                      Dude.  Gross.

                                        THE BUGMASTER
                    Look who s talking.



      The team runs down a corridor.  There s a T intersection 
      at the end.  Captain Normal urges them forward.  Walter 
      brings up the rear.  Walter turns to look behind them.  He 
      TRIPS over his own feet, and FACE-PLANTS on the floor.  
      Walter struggles to his feet.  But the rest of the team 
      has vanished from sight.  Walter stands, faces the T 
        intersection.  Left or right?



      Walter hurries down another hallway.  No sign of anyone.   
      Two armed GUARDS move into view.  Walter FREEZES.  The 
      first guard aims his weapon at Walter.

                                        GUARD
                    DOWN ON THE FLOOR.  Spread your arms, 
                      spread your legs.  

      Walter obeys.  The second guard steps to Walter.  The 
      first is about to speak into his headset mike, when Mood 
      Swing strolls into view.

                                        MOOD SWING S VOICE
                      Hello, Boys.

                                        GUARD #2
                    What the hell -- ?

                                        GUARD
                    DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

      Mood Swing keeps coming.  Because her mojo only works at 
      close range.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Sorry.  I m running late.

                                        GUARD
                    DOWN ON THE --

      He never finishes the order.  He chuckles instead.  A 
      beat.  The second guard chuckles too, like he heard the 
      same joke.  Mood Swing aerosols both with a knockout drug.  
      The guards drop to the floor.

                                        WALTER
                      I can t feel my legs.                                                                                    47.



      Mood Swing hoists Walter to his feet.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Walter.  Look at me.  One more door to 
                      open.  Then we can all go home.  Got it?  



      But not just any door.  It s steel-reinforced concrete 
      vault door.  Captain Normal takes a device out of his 
        backpack.  A portable X-Ray.  It reveals the lock s 
      workings on a screen.  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Step on it, freak.  We re on the clock.

      Freak.  Walter checks the X-Ray, faces the lock.  Walter 
        reacts.  His power is starting to wane.  

                                        WALTER
                    I ve never seen anything like this 
                      before.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      That s what I was afraid of.  Why anybody 
                      thought you belonged -- ?

                                        MOOD SWING
                    He can do it.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      Yeah?  Because all I see --

        Captain Normal is interrupted by a CLICK.  Everyone 
        reacts.  The first click is followed by a SECOND.  Walter 
      checks the X-Ray, focuses.  CLICK.  Walter exhales relief.

                                        WALTER
                       Freak ?  You make it sound like a bad 
                      thing.



        Captain Normal enters the vault.  The others follow.  But 
      then they STOP.  The only thing in the vault is a ten year-
      old GIRL sitting in a chair.  She s the package.  Her name 
      is CASSIE.  Cassie has been sedated, her speech slurred.

                                        CASSIE
                    Who are you?



        Captain Normal ushers Cassie down the hallway.  Walter 
      keeps pace beside them.                                                                                      48.



                                        WALTER
                    Are you all right, is there anything we 
                    can -- ?

      They reach the T intersection, round the corner.  FIVE 
      GUARDS run in their direction.   

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    This is me.

      The team members put on small gas masks like the one 
        Captain Normal wore at The Hollywood Bar.  Mood Swing 
      helps Cassie into a mask.  The guards STOP.  The Human 
      Smell steps forward to meet them.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    Want to see something gross?

      The Human Smell PULLS DOWN the upper half of his bodysuit, 
        revealing the chubby torso inside.  Every one of his PORES 
      dilates, opens a fraction.  We HEAR a faint HISSING.  The 
      guards choke, they hurl, they claw at their eyes.  They 
      collapse on the floor.



        Captain Normal leads the team to the door they came in.  
      He grips Cassie by the arm.  Walter speaks to her. 

                                        WALTER
                      Hello?  Hi.  My name is --

      But then it happens and it happens fast.  The first guard 
      we met, the one Captain Normal gun-butted, CHARGES into 
      the warehouse.  The guard FIRES, and three bullets RIP 
      into The Human Smell s chest.  Mood Swing SCREAMS.  

      PAN & REVEAL - TIME ZONE

      If the slight shimmer didn t give it away, the 180-degree 
      PAN and CLOSEUP do.  Time Zone just looked into the 
        future.  He bends double with pain.   

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      What?

                                        TIME ZONE
                    The first guard.  He s coming.

      AT THE DOOR

      The guard CHARGES into the warehouse.  But this time 
        Captain Normal s waiting for him.  He gun-butts the guard 
      a second time.  The guard falls in a heap all over again.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    That dude is gonna need a new grill.                                                                                    49.



                                        WALTER
                              (to Cassie)
                    My name is Three Inches.  Are you all 
                      right?

      But Captain Normal drags Cassie out the door.



        Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie run up a flight of stairs.                                                                                    52.



      ON THE ROOF

        There s a door that opens to the roof.  It OPENS, and they 
      pour through it.  Mood Swing closes and locks the door.  

                                        WALTER
                    You can see the stars from here.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      What s your name?

                                        CASSIE
                      Cassie.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Cassie.  What were you doing in that 
                      room?

                                        CASSIE
                      I don t know.  I was on my way home from 
                      school.  They took me.

                                        WALTER
                    What about the men who are chasing us?  
                    Do you know who they are?

                                        CASSIE
                    No.

                                        WALTER
                      Mister Hamilton will know what to do.

      An angry POUNDING interrupts.  They turn to the door.  The 
      Samoan is on the other side.  He s not alone.  Walter, 
      Mood Swing, and Cassie run to the edge.  There s an old 
      fire escape below, but it doesn t reach to the roof.

                                        WALTER
                      That s weird.  Apparently I m terrified 
                    of heights.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    This is not the time to discover new and 
                      interesting phobias.

                                        CASSIE
                    DO SOMETHING!

      Mood Swing drops OFF the edge, catches it with her hands, 
      hangs for a moment, finds purchase with her feet, does a 
      seamless BACKFLIP, and lands on the fire escape landing 
      below.  Mood Swing runs the fire escape ladder up to the 
      roof.  Walter helps Cassie to the ladder, follows.  

      ON THE STREET

        Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie drop to the street.  Walter 
      looks at Mood Swing with amazement.                                                                                      53.




      START CLOSE ON Walter.  Walter is a terrible liar.

                                        WALTER
                    -- more like a scavanger hunt, actually?  
                    And in order to win we have to find a 
                      place to hide for three to five hours 
                      before we try to locate the midget or get 
                      a policeman s autograph.

        Walter, Mood Swing, and Cassie are inside The Hollywood 
        Restaurant.  BUS BOYS clear tables.  It s just past 
      closing.  Macklin frowns in his kitchen whites.  

                                        MACKLIN
                    The last time you were here a roomful of 
                      paying customers ran screaming into the 
                      night projectile vomiting.

      Walter doesn t want to talk about that.  Macklin looks 
      from one to the next.  Until he gets to Mood Swing.

                                        MACKLIN
                      There s a day bed in the storage room.



      Mood Swing checks out the storage room.  Cassie bounces on 
      the day bed.  She s got her jacket off.  Mood Swing 
        notices a red welt on her upper arm.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      What s that?

                                        CASSIE
                      Nothing.

      Mood Swing takes a closer look. 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    What kind of shots did they give you, 
                      Cassie?

                                        CASSIE
                      I don t know.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    How often?

                                        CASSIE
                      Every morning.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    The men who gave you the shots, do you 
                    know who they are?                                                                                    57.



                                        CASSIE
                    No.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Bad guys who keep you.  Bad guys who 
                      chase you.  Bad guys everywhere and you 
                      don t know who they are or what they re 
                      after.

      Cassie shakes her head.  She s a bad liar, too.

      IN THE RESTAURANT

        Meanwhile.  Walter and Macklin sit at the bar in the empty 
        restaurant.  Macklin looks at Walter like he s crazy.  

                                        MACKLIN
                    So.  Just to sum up.  After you got fried 
                    by a lightning bolt you discovered you 
                      could move any object three inches and 
                    then you joined a team of superheroes to 
                      fight evil but you grabbed a little girl 
                      instead.
                                (beat)
                    One of us is really high.

      Walter looks to three beer taps.  He focuses, flips the 
      first.  Beer SPILLS from the spigot.  Macklin hurries to 
      shut it off.  Walter flips the second and the third.  
        Macklin shuts off them off, too.  He looks at Walter with 
      absolute wonder.

                                        WALTER
                      Sorry.

                                        MACKLIN
                      It s.  Just.  Beer.

                                        WALTER
                    Not that.  For unleashing a hellish odor 
                    in here.

                                        MACKLIN
                    That was you?

                                        WALTER
                      Friend of mine.  Calls himself The Human 
                      Smell.

                                        MACKLIN
                    Wow.  That is one stinky superpower.  

        Macklin considers the impossible.  Seeing it helped.

                                        MACKLIN
                      Look.  I m sorry, too.                                                                                    58.



                                        WALTER
                    For what?

                                        MACKLIN
                      I should ve known something was going on 
                    with you.  Maybe not this because this is 
                      completely insane.  But still.  

        Macklin indicates the storage room in the back.

                                        MACKLIN
                      What s her superpower?

                                        WALTER
                    She can make you really happy or really 
                    sad.  

                                        MACKLIN
                      I meet a lot of girls like that. 

      That makes Walter smile.  It reminds him of when life was 
      closer to normal.

                                        MACKLIN
                    You trust this guy?  Troy.

                                        WALTER
                      I did.  I do.  I don t know anymore.

                                        MACKLIN
                    Why did he send you after a kid?  Does 
                    she have a superpower too?

      Boom.  There it is.

                                        WALTER
                      I have no idea why I did not see that 
                      until now.



      Walter and Mood Swing face Cassie in the storage room.  

                                        WALTER
                      You re special.  Just like us.

      Cassie nods.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    What kind of powers do you have?

                                        CASSIE
                      Lots.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    How did you get them?                                                                                    59.



      Cassie shrugs.

                                        WALTER
                      I got hit by lightning.

                                        CASSIE
                    Did it hurt?

                                        WALTER
                      Lots.  

                                        MOOD SWING
                      They re giving her medication.

                                        WALTER
                      Probably an inhibitor.  Will your powers 
                    come back if they stop?

                                        CASSIE
                      I hope not.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?

                                        CASSIE
                      I don t want to be a freak.  I don t want 
                    to be different.  I m only ten.  I want 
                    to be a real girl.

      This breaks Walter s heart.  It makes him think, however 
      briefly, about the difference in him.

      TIME CUT - IN THE STORAGE ROOM 

      Walter and Mood Swing sit and watch Cassie sleep.

                                        WALTER
                      I wonder what she can do.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    We should call Troy.

                                        WALTER
                      I know.

      But Walter can t make the call.  Not yet.  



      Morning.  Walter and Mood Swing sleep.  Mood Swing rests 
      her head on his shoulder.  Cassie WATCHES them with a 
        knowing gaze.  She slips off the bed, and out of the room.

      ON THE STREET                                                                                    60.



        Macklin returns to the restaurant with bagels and coffee.  
      Then he SEES something unexpected.  Cassie exits and 
        hurries away.  A beat.  Macklin follows her.



      Walter and Mood Swing explain it all to Troy Hamilton 
      inside The Hollywood Restaurant. 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    She left some time during the night or 
                      early morning.  Her name is Cassie.

                                        WALTER
                    The package is a little girl.  All she 
                      wants --

      Walter s cell phone RINGS, interrupts.  A deadpan beat.  
      Walter sends the caller to Voicemail.  

                                        TROY
                    You have no idea how important that 
                      little girl is.

      Then a shock.  Captain Normal enters.  Walter gapes.  

                                        WALTER
                      You re dead.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    I m bulletproof.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Angry Samoans are after her.  Then 
                      there s the people we took her from.  So 
                      that s at least two teams that are 
                      chasing her --  

      Walter still can t believe Captain Normal is upright.

                                        WALTER
                      Literally bulletproof?

                                        TROY
                    Oh, for God s sake, Walter.  He wears 
                    body armor!                                                                                    61.



                                        WALTER
                    Oh.

                                        TROY
                      Cassie is a high value subject.  The men 
                    who held her had the worst possible 
                      intentions.  I have no idea who the 
                      Samoans are working for.  But if you re 
                      right, and there s a second player?  That 
                      makes our mission even more urgent.

                                        WALTER
                      There s also a mysterious motorcycle 
                      rider --

        Captain Normal can t restrain himself any longer.  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    You let her get away.

                                        TROY
                              (to Captain Normal)
                    The only thing you need to think about is 
                      getting her back.  Standard protocol, 
                      search and rescue.  Go.

        Captain Normal s jaw tightens.  He exits.  

                                        WALTER
                      I want to help.

                                        TROY
                    No.  I will never send you through a door 
                      you re not ready to open.  Go home, 
                      Walter.  It s been a long night for 
                      everyone.

      Hamilton exits without another word.  A beat.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I thought you quit.

      Walter doesn t answer.  He checks his phone, listens to 
      the message.  Then:  

                                        WALTER
                    It s Macklin.  He found her.



      Union Station is an architectural marvel and local legend.

      IN THE WAITING ROOM

      Walter and Mood Swing meet Macklin on the periphery.  
        Macklin indicates Cassie sitting on one of the burnished 
      wooden benches in the waiting room.                                                                                    62.



                                        MACKLIN
                      She s been here all morning.  

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You didn t make contact?

                                        MACKLIN
                    Are you kidding?  What if she has laser 
                      beams in her eyes?

                                        WALTER
                      Look.

      Cate steps through the vast interior.  

                                        WALTER
                    The mysterious motorcycle rider is a 
                      woman.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Keep her busy.  I ll get Cassie.

      Mood Swing hurries to the bench.  Walter and Macklin turn 
      to face Cate.  Macklin holds up two palms. 

                                        MACKLIN
                      Look.  Easy Rider.  I don t want to hurt 
                    you --

      Cate drops Macklin with a swift kick to the solar plexus.

                                        CATE
                    You want some?

                                        WALTER
                    I m good.  Thanks.

      The SOUND of HEAVY BOOTS interrupts.  Captain Normal leads 
      an extraction team into the building.  The combat-suited 
      MERCS grab Cassie.  Cassie SEES Cate and she SHOUTS:

                                        CASSIE
                      Cate!!!

      The team heads for the door.  Cate CHARGES after them.  
        Captain Normal SEES her coming.  Cate SHOUTS:

                                        CATE
                      Cassie!!

        Captain Normal LEVELS Cate with a single punch to the jaw.  
      He follows the extraction team out the door.  Walter runs 
      to Cate, and kneels at her side. 

                                        WALTER
                    Who are you?                                                                                    63.



                                        CATE
                    I m her sister.



      Walter stands outside with Captain Normal.  An armor 
      plated Humvee idles at the curb.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      I figured you d try something like this.  
                    So I played Follow The Wiener.  You are 
                    the Wiener.

                                        WALTER
                        Congratulations.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    You think I m stupid, don t you?

                                        WALTER
                    Not any more.

        Captain Normal indicates the Humvee, Cassie inside it.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      Sucks to be her.

                                        WALTER
                    Why?

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    We transfer  the package  to the client 
                    in the morning.

      IN UNION STATION

      Mood Swing and Macklin sit with Cate on a bench.  Walter 
      joins them.  Cate looks up at Walter.

                                        WALTER
                      Cassie s special, isn t she?

                                        CATE
                    In ways no one really understands.
                      We ve been on the run since the day she 
                      found out.  I do whatever it takes to 
                      protect her.  But it s never enough 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Who are the Samoans working for?

                                        CATE
                      They re new.  I don t know.

                                        WALTER
                    Do you know who was holding her?                                                                                    64.



                                        CATE
                      Government.

                                        WALTER
                      Really?  I m not sure I believe  --

                                        CATE
                    Not our government.

      Cate gets to her feet.  She looks hard at Walter.

                                        CATE
                    Who do you work for?

                                        WALTER
                    We don t want to hurt Cassie.  We want to 
                    help her.

                                        CATE
                    You don t believe that.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Yes, he does.

                                        CATE
                    What do you think your boss is going to 
                    do?  He s going to measure and probe my 
                      little sister just like the others did.  
                    And the worst thing is?  When he tells 
                    you he s doing it for the right reasons?  
                      You ll believe that, too.

      Cate shoves past Walter.  He calls after her.

                                        WALTER
                      Where re you going?

                                        CATE
                    To get her back.

      Walter turns to Mood Swing.  

                                        WALTER
                    So that s it?  We re just going to let 
                    them take her?  That s not right.  She s 
                    only a --

                                        MOOD SWING
                    It s over, Walter.  Go home.

      Mood Swing doesn t like this any more than he does.  But 
      she knows there is nothing they can do.



      Walter enters.  Belinda gets up from the sofa.  The unlit 
        cigarette is back in her mouth.

                                        BELINDA
                      Well, look who the cat dragged in.

      Walter steps down the hall.  Belinda follows.

                                        BELINDA
                    We don t have a cat.  That s just an 
                      expression.  But if we did, I would ve 
                      spent the night telling Snowball that my 
                    son was missing and he didn t answer my 
                      calls and I was afraid he was lying in a 
                      ditch somewhere, you know, the default 
                      ditch that every mother sees in her head 
                    when a child doesn t come home --

      Walter enters his bedroom, closes the door behind him.  
        Belinda stands at the door.  

                                        BELINDA
                    I m glad you re not dead.

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                      Thank you.

                                        BELINDA
                    Is there anything you need?

                                        WALTER S VOICE
                    No.

                                        BELINDA
                      I started fake smoking again but don t 
                      worry, it s not your fault.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM                                                                                    66.



      Walter lies on his bed.  Belinda is HEARD from the other 
      side of the door.

                                        BELINDA S VOICE 
                    That was a lie.  It s completely your 
                      fault.

      Walter puts a pillow over his head. 



      Night.  The Spackman house is dark.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter hasn t moved an inch.  The room is dark except for 
      the Buffy screensaver on the iMac screen.  At least until 
      it disappears and is replaced by Troy Hamilton.

                                        TROY
                      Walter?  May I have a word?

      Walter sits, and faces Hamilton on the iMac screen.

                                        TROY
                      Everybody has a secret gift inside.  A 
                      difference.  You just happen to be a 
                      little more in touch with yours than 
                      most.  The trick is to make the very best 
                    of it that you can.

                                        WALTER
                    You already said that.  Word for word.   
                      Mynah Bird does a very good impression.

                                        TROY
                    It s worth repeating.  Your abilities 
                    have been tested.  Sometimes when we re 
                      tested, we start to doubt the thing that 
                      makes us special.

                                        WALTER
                    Is being special always this hard?

                                        TROY
                    It gets easier over time.

                                        WALTER
                      I hope so.

                                        TROY
                      You ll have to trust me on that.  Good 
                      night, son --

      Troy reaches OFF-SCREEN to disconnect.  But:                                                                                    67.



                                        WALTER
                      Mister Hamilton -- how s Cassie?

                                        TROY
                      Cassie is in good hands.  

                                        WALTER
                    What about her sister?

                                        TROY
                    I ll take care of the sister.  

                                        WALTER
                      Whoa, wait.  Her name is Cate and all 
                      she s trying to do is --

                                        TROY
                      Walter.

                                        WALTER
                    Yes?

                                        TROY
                    Get some sleep.  We start fresh in the 
                      morning.  

      It s an order.  Hamilton DISCONNECTS.  Walter sits in the 
      dark.  Then he decides.  Walter walks out the door.



      Walter continues through the kitchen of The Hollywood 
        Restaurant.  Until he finds Macklin assembling a cold 
        appetizer.  

                                        WALTER
                      You re off prep.

                                        MACKLIN
                    Back where I belong.  You?

                                        WALTER
                    I m about to do something stupid and I 
                    need your help.

                                        MACKLIN
                    Is it really stupid?

      Walter nods.  Macklin grins. 

                                        MACKLIN
                      Cool. 

                                      END ACT FIVE                                                                                    68.



                                          ACT SIX



        A Hollywood dive.  Mood Swing sits at the bar.  She came 
      here to be alone.  But men don t always respect her 
        wishes.  That explains the YOUNG MEN to either side, both 
        sniffling quietly.  Mood Swing drinks from a bottle of 
      beer.  One of the men chokes back an audible sob.

                                        WALTER S VOICE 
                    Can I talk to you outside?

      Mood Swing turns, SEES Walter standing there.

      ON THE SIDEWALK

      Walter faces Mood Swing on the sidewalk.

                                        WALTER
                      I went home.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Good idea.

                                        WALTER
                      I can t stop thinking about Cassie.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Bad idea.

                                        WALTER
                      Cassie needs my help so she can be a real 
                    girl but they re transferring her to the 
                      client in the morning and we don t even 
                    know who the client is and then it will 
                    be too late so I m going to save her and 
                      I don t care what the consequences are 
                      because for the first time in my life I 
                    know exactly what to do next.  Also it 
                      would be great if you came with me.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    Good speech.

                                        WALTER
                      Thanks.  I usually rehearse them first.



        Captain Normal sleeps soundly in a small room.  The room 
      is bare.  There is a surveillance screen on the wall.  
      Rotating images of the HQ interior.  A beat of silence.  
      Then a loud KNOCK.  Captain Normal sits up, alert, and 
      takes a handgun from under his pillow.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    Who goes there?

      The door opens, reveals Mood Swing. 

                                        MOOD SWING
                    I go there.  Here.  Hi.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

        Walter, Macklin, and Cate walk through the living room.  
        There s a guard posted at the elevator.  

                                        WALTER
                      Shift change.

                                        WALTER
                      Midnight snack?

                    For who?

      The guard draws down on them.  But Walter POPS the clip 
      right out of his gun.  And adds a helpful correction:

                                        WALTER
                      Whom.

      Cate levels the guard.  Macklin deadpans:

                                        MACKLIN
                    I m starting to think you enjoy that.

                                        CATE
                    Are you flirting with me?

                                        MACKLIN
                      Would it be a bad thing if I was flirting 
                    with you?

      But then a surprise.  An Extraction Team THUNDERS right at 
      them.  Helmets, face-plates, and body armor.  

      IN CAPTAIN NORMAL S QUARTERS                                                                                    71.



      The latter flashes across the screen in Captain Normal s 
      room.  But he doesn t notice.  Captain Normal looks up at 
      Mood Swing.  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    What are you doing here?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I couldn t sleep.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    In Silver Lake?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Driving relaxes me.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    But you think I m an idiot, remember?

                                        MOOD SWING
                      Maybe I forgot.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      C mon.  I m normal.  It s my frackin  
                    team name.

                                        MOOD SWING
                      What s wrong with normal?

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      Everything.

        There s something surprisingly vulnerable in this.  Mood 
      Swing did not see it coming.  



      There are two GUARDS posted at a door in a corridor.  Troy 
        Hamilton s VOICE comes over their headsets.

                                        TROY S VOICE
                      Attention all units.  HQ Code Red.  We 
                    have intruders on site.  Prepare the 
                      subject for immediate transfer --

      The Extraction Team hurries into view.  Helmets, face 
        plates, and body armor.  The guards part.  The Team Leader 
      bends to door and keypad.  The keypad BEEPS.  Wait a 
        minute.  Those beeps sound weird --

      IN THE ROOM

      It s a comfortably furnished bedroom.  The same one Walter 
      saw during his training days.  Cassie sits up in bed.  She  
      wears a red nightgown.  The Extraction Team pours inside.  
      The Team Leader is Walter.                                                                                    72.



      IN CAPTAIN NORMAL S QUARTERS

      That s when every light inside Captain Normal s room 
      starts to FLASH.  A bright STROBING ALARM.  Captain Normal 
      looks to Mood Swing, and repeats.  

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      What re you doing here?

      Then we SEE it.  The tension that usually animates Captain 
      Normal s features is replaced by contentment.  The kind of 
        happiness he never feels.  And Mood Swing put it there.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                      Please.  I don t want to be happy.  Not 
                    like this.

                                        MOOD SWING
                    I m sorry, Jason.

      The weird thing is, she means it.  



      The drab 1950s ranch house in Granada Hills.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Troy Hamilton assembles the team.  He paces and shouts.  

                                        TROY
                    How can I make it clear to you, really 
                      clear, that I m not just angry, I m 
                      betrayed, and that s a --

      Walter and Mood Swing enter, interrupt.  Hamilton darkens.

                                        TROY 
                      You re late.                                                                                    76.



                                        WALTER
                    You can t tell me I m late.  I quit.

                                        TROY
                      What?

                                        WALTER
                      I set Cassie free.  It s my fault.

      But then, Mood Swing steps beside him.  And repeats:

                                        MOOD SWING
                      I set Cassie free.  It s my fault.

      One by one, they get to their feet.  The Bugmaster first, 
      tall and pale.   Mynah Bird, who looks like a Korean 
        housewife.  Time Zone, too.  And each time, they repeat:

                                        THE TEAM 
                      I set Cassie free.  It s my fault.

      The Human Smell narrates.  Nobody thinks to stop him.

                                        THE HUMAN SMELL
                    They rose to their feet and ripped off an 
                    old movie my dad would never shut up 
                      about that has this guy in it with a big 
                    dent in his chin.  They did it because 
                    they were a team.  They did it because 
                    the guy before them did it.  They did it 
                    to blow your mind.

      Troy looks from one to the next.  Captain Normal is the 
      last to rise.  But not to play along.

                                        CAPTAIN NORMAL
                    HQ is my responsibility.  It s my fault.  
                    I m sorry, Dad.

      Dad.  Walter tilts.  He speaks aside:

                                        WALTER
                      Dad?!

                                        MOOD SWING
                    You didn t know?

                                        WALTER
                    Not if nobody tells me.

                                        TROY
                      Walter.

      Hamilton interrupts the back and forth.  

                                        TROY
                      Follow me.                                                                                    77.




      Troy Hamilton sits behind a desk.  Walter sits opposite.  
      Hamilton leans back in his chair, and smiles.  Which is 
        unexpected.

                                        TROY
                    Well done.  Even better than I expected.

                                        WALTER
                    I m confused. 

                                        TROY
                      I once told you I was a private 
                      contractor with a clear conscience.  
                      Thanks to you?  My conscience is clear.

                                        WALTER
                      Still confused.  Sorry.

                                        TROY
                      I was hired by a client to retrieve a 
                      package.  The package turned out to be a 
                      little girl.  This was as much a surprise 
                    to me as it was to you.  The client 
                      betrayed my trust, and sent a third party 
                    to take the girl from me.  In case I had 
                    any reservations about handing her over.
                                (beat)
                      I needed someone to get her out of here 
                    and give me plausible deniability at the 
                    same time.  A disgruntled former 
                      employee.  Like you.

                                        WALTER
                      I wasn t really disgruntled.  Did you 
                    know that  gruntled  is a word?  Am I 
                      still quitting -- ?

                                        TROY
                    It s not enough to have a hero s power.  
                      That s just an unfair advantage.  You 
                    need the heart of a hero, too.  Nice 
                      work, son.

      Son.  The word doesn t hit Walter like it did the first 
      time.  Hamilton gets to his feet, extends a hand.  Walter 
      shakes it.  He steps from the room.  CAMERA REMAINS long 
      enough for Troy Hamilton s expression to change, if by a 
        fraction.  Enough for us to question everything he said.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Walter returns to the living room.  They all waited for 
      him.  But Walter walks right out the door.                                                                                    78.




        Midday.  Walter steps toward home.  But first he detours 
      to Lily Theroux s front door.  Walter rings, waits.  Lily 
      answers.  

                                        LILY
                      Walter, hi --

      Walter gives Lily a great big KISS.  Then he walks away.  
        A beat.  Lily puts her fingertips to her lips.

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

        Belinda sits on the sofa, sucks on an unlit cigarette, and 
      waits for her increasingly wayward son.  Again.  She HEARS 
      the door open, gets to her feet.  She opens her mouth to 
        censure or complain.  But Walter interrupts:

                                        WALTER
                    When I was struck by lightning a strange 
                      power was given to me and while I 
                      resisted it at first, abused it after 
                      that, I eventually found common cause 
                    with a group of similarly gifted men and 
                      women who fight evil.  So basically I m 
                    not washing dogs anymore.  I m going to 
                    save the world instead.

      The unlit cigarette drops from Belinda Spackman s mouth.

      IN WALTER S BEDROOM

      Walter enters his bedroom.  He opens the box of his 
      father s records.  Walter fits a disc to spindle and 
      platter.  Walter puts the needle to the groove.  It s  Are 
      You Ready  by Pacific Gas & Electric and the music BLASTS 
      even louder than before.  Walter stands at the center of 
      the room.  

      Walter begins to dance.  Just a twitch at first.  But then 
      his body finds the rhythm, and he leaps and jukes and 
      slides all over the room.  Walter Spackman is a terrible 
        dancer.  Walter Spackman has never been happier in his 
      life.

                                          THE END
