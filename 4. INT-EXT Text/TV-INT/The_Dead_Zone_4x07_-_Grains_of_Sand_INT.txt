          Bruce, in his "hot guy" party clothes, shakes off the
          rain, walks in.

                                        BRUCE
                                  (impatient)
                        Hey, man, let's get a move on! 
                        Some other guy could be hitting
                        on her right now!

          Bruce enters the living room, is startled to see a
            partially-assembled toy train set.  Johnny comes downstairs
          with an armload of dusty boxes of train stuff.

                                        BRUCE
                        No.  You are not doing this to me
                        again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I found it in the attic.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny, I spent four weeks icing
                        this girl's totally healthy rotator
                        cuff until I got her number.  Now
                        she invites us to her birthday
                        party, complete with hot friends,
                        and you're playing with toys.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Lionels.  My dad gave me this set
                        when I just a kid.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's so amazingly poignant. 
                        Now let's go.

          Johnny is hardly listening to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You see this?  It's a 6464-100
                        Blue Feather boxcar.  Look at
                        that: 1954. J.J.'s gonna be so
                        into this.

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen, instead of playing with
                        trains, why don't you get on one. 
                        It's called the 'love train', and
                        it's leaving the station without
                        you.

          Johnny seems to be getting the message.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're right.  This is childish
                        and I'm beyond it.
                                (beat, then suddenly)
                        Hey, the caboose!

          And he's back into the train set.

                                        BRUCE
                        Susanna said eight, and if we
                        leave now, we'll be there within
                        the "cool, not desperate, but not
                        so late as to be rude" window.

                                  reluctance)
                        I can't go alone.  I'm not gonna
                        be Desperate Guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everybody loves Desperate Guy. 
                        He makes them feel good about
                          themselves.

                        know how rare this is? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Not as rare as a single, funny,
                        beautiful, female African-American
                        lawyer in Maine.  Get in the car. 



          Torrential rain.  Bruce and Johnny drive along a country
          road.  Johnny's at the wheel, which Bruce hates.

                                        BRUCE
                        Brake before the curve, man, then
                        accelerate out.  It's simple

                        been driving since I was sixteen,
                        and "C," I didn't even want to be
                        here.

                                        BRUCE
                        I hope we don't have to park too
                        far away.  I'm wearing my party
                        shoes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Party shoes?

                        Maybe no one will show because of
                        the rain and we'll have Susanna
                        and Gabrielle all to our ourselves.

                        What the hell?

          Johnny brakes as two FIGURES appear, silhouetted in the
          headlights (NOTE: one is JOSE, the driver).  They're
          injured, dazed and terrified.  As Johnny comes to a stop,
          to his surprise the people scatter into the woods.  Bruce
          jumps out.

            Darkness, dozens of bodies crammed together --

          They hear muffled screaming in Spanish, pounding from

                        There's people still inside!

          Johnny shines his flashlight through the wire-mesh back
          door windows and we get a quick glimpse not of many people,
          but of the panicked face of one YOUNG WOMAN trapped inside,
          water rising around her shoulders.

                        It's a woman!  We'll have to pry
                        the door open --

                        It's wedged shut.

          The freezing cold water rushing around them, Johnny and
          Bruce struggle to move the tree stump -- but it won't
          budge.

          Johnny and Bruce quickly work their way to the front of
          the van, which is wedged on the upstream side against a
          massive rock, a tree through its windshield.  Johnny shines
          his flashlight through a broken window to see the seats
          twisted out of place, and the woman, arms cut, head
            bleeding, pinned by the driver's seat against the side of
          the van only a foot of air left between her and the
            severely-dented ceiling.

                                        WOMAN
                                (crying)

                        pierna esta trabada.  Alguien
                        ay deme por favor.

          Johnny hands the flashlight to Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's pinned behind the driver's
                        seat.  I gotta get in there --

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny, wait!

          But Johnny's already slipping in, feet first, through the
          broken windshield.  As he plunges into the icy water, he
          gets a --          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - TEASER - 3/22/05 - GOLD-2  5.



          Johnny is up to his shoulders in water, detritus --
          clothes, a knapsack, styrofoam cups, etc. -- floating
          around him as he tries with all his might to move the
          driver's seat to free the woman, who's crying, trying to
          keep her head above the quickly rising water, looking
          like she's going to slip into unconsciousness. She's
          holding a bundle above the water, yells to Johnny.

                                        WOMAN
                                (frantic)
                        Por favor, por favor!

          Johnny reaches for the bundle -- something wrapped in her
          coat.  Just as he's about to reach it, the VAN SHIFTS. 
          Johnny lurches forward.  The woman knows time's running
          out.

          Before Johnny knows what's happening, there's a bundle in
          his arms.  He looks down and sees A SIX MONTH OLD BABY.

          Johnny reaches through the windshield, hands the baby to
          Bruce.



          Johnny reaches for the woman, the water encircling her
          face.

                        Grab my hand!  La mano!... 

          But it's no use.  She's wedged in tight.

                        Damnit!

          But Johnny's determined to free her.  As he throws all
          his weight against the driver's seat, he plunges under
          water --

                        She's totally pinned.  I can't

          A fire burns in the fireplace, looks cozy despite the
          sound of driving rain outside pelting the windows.  The
          toy train set is now operational, a little black engine
          pulls a set of cars clack-clack-clack on tracks that snake
          around the room.  Johnny is holding the baby, who smiles
          at the train set as it vrooms past.

          He looks over at Bruce, who is sitting there staring into
          space, clearly re-living the past hour, and haunted by
          it.

                        in the morning.

          Bruce realizes this is a good idea.  He needs some rest.

                                        BRUCE
                        What party?  Oh. 

          He is cut off by a familiar voice that freezes them both
          on the spot.

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                          Helloooo... thank God, you've got
                        power.  J.J.'s at a sleepover,
                        Walt's on graveyard shift and the
                        power went out --

          Sarah enters, soaking wet, removing her rain coat before
          they can even move.  She, of course, has no idea anything
          is wrong.

                                        SARAH
                        ...It creeps me out to sit home
                        alone in the dark.  Hey, you guys. 
                                (sees him)
                        Baby? 
                                (to baby)
                        Aren't you a cutie?

          Bruce looks at Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good luck.  Sarah.

          Bruce grabs his coat and leaves.

                                        SARAH
                        Making ends meet by babysitting?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly.  Do you think his
                        diaper needs changing?

                                        SARAH
                                (sniffs)
                        Yes.  And this "historic" playpen--
                          violates every child safety law.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Was good enough for me.

                                        SARAH
                        Come on, whose baby is it?

          Johnny starts to lie...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, friend of mine...

          Sarah, her bullshit radar up, eyes him as she changes the
          diaper.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  
                                (looking around)
                        Why did you buy so many diapers?

                        Well, I wasn't sure how long he'd
                        be here, or what size he was or...

                                        SARAH
                        Why are you lying?

                                        SARAH
                        I think I'll stand.

          As Johnny searches for the words...

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Sarah stares at Johnny.  She trusts him, so she's trying
          to go along with what he's told her, but it's not easy.

                                        SARAH
                        That must have been a hell of a
                        vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was.

                                        SARAH
                        How long are you planning on
                        keeping him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just until I see that it's going
                        to be okay.  I'm going to try to
                        find his family, figure out where
                        he's from.
                                (beat)
                        His mother... it was awful, Sarah.

          Sarah absorbs this, knowing full well what mothers do for
          their children.  The baby starts to cry, Sarah tries to
          soothe him.

                                        SARAH
                        Shhhhh.

          But he just cries harder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He likes the train.

          As Johnny takes the baby, shows him the train -- WHOOSH!



          The baby morphs into the FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY we saw in the
          teaser vision.  He and Johnny are playing with the trains. 
          The train set is growing: Johnny, now an indulgent adoptive
          parent, has clearly been shopping. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Mikey, look at the new
                          caboose.

          The little boy grabs it.

                                        MIKEY
                              A ninety-two-seventy-three?! 
                        Cool!

          He and Johnny laugh like fathers and sons do.  The Vision
          ends --



          Sarah is staring at Johnny as he holds the baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        SARAH
                                (growing impatient)
                        A woman dies and you leave the
                        scene of an accident with her
                        baby.  You say you're looking for
                        the family but I'm not supposed
                        to tell any of this to my husband,
                        the Sheriff.

          Johnny looks at her, holds up the baby.  Sarah is forced
          to look into the baby's eyes as Johnny speaks.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quietly)
                        Some things in life are bigger
                        than you can explain.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        I have to keep this baby safe...
                        until I know that it's okay to
                        let him go.  And it's not okay
                        yet.  It's not Walt, it's the
                        system.  The system is broken.

                                        SARAH
                        But you had another vision.  Just
                        now.  Tell me you didn't.  Tell
                        me I'm wrong and I'll walk away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to protect this baby.

          Sarah gets up and starts out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.  You're right, I had a
                        vision.  And it told me it might
                        be a while.  I need your help.
                        Will you help me?

          Sarah thinks of what the mother went though, instinctively
          reaches for the baby.

                                        SARAH
                                (tacit okay)
                        Someone must be hungry.

          Johnny grabs a bottle and Sarah starts to feed the baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mikey's a good eater, huh?

                                        SARAH
                        Mikey?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That was his name, in the vision.
                                (re: baby sucking
                                down the bottle)
                        Wow.  Look at him go.

                                        SARAH
                        Just like J.J.  Do you remember
                        when he was like a year...

          She stops, embarrassed, realizing Johnny missed that time
          because of the coma.

                                        JOHNNY

                        J.J. was more of tug than a
                          squeeze.  Oh, and before he fell
                        asleep he used to jerk violently
                        like a punk rocker.

                        You laugh.  It used to freak me
                        out.

          Johnny stands over the baby, playing with him as he lies
          in Sarah's arms.  It s a moment of emotional connection
          for them.  It's as if Sarah and Johnny are, for a moment,
          young parents again, with their own newborn, J.J.

                                        SARAH
                        It's been such a long time... you
                        forget.

                        How vulnerable they are.  How
                        much they depend on you. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Never thought I'd be doing this
                          alone... I mean, in my visions,
                        I'm really bonded with this kid.

          As Sarah looks at him quizzically -- "what are you talking
          about, this isn't your kid," -- the phone rings.  Johnny
          picks it up without thinking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello. -- Walt.  What's up?

          He locks eyes with Sarah.

                                                                                CUT TO:



          Latino bar, a hangout for underclass workers on the
            outskirts of Bangor.  Smokey, slightly seedy feel. 
          Ranchera music, tequila, and women who dance with men for
          money.

          Bruce is leaning over the bar, guys with their noses in
          their beers on either side, talking to the BARTENDER.

                        Anyone here waiting for a van?

          The Bartender, busy, shows no sign of understanding.  No
          one offers to help.  Bruce turns and sees a DANCER (EVA)
          approaching Johnny. 

                                        EVA

                        Hi.  Hola.  I hope you can help
                        me.

          The DANCER's overdone -- big hair, too much eyeliner --
          but you can tell she's pretty under all that.

                        What?

          Before Johnny can respond, she takes his arms in classic
          salsa pose, starts moving with him to the music.

                        You are a terrible dancer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.  I'm John.

                        Eva.  So, John, why are you looking
                        for this man?  Hips tighter. 
                        Stand closer, what, you are afraid
                        to touch me?

          As she puts her hands lower on his hips to show him, WHOOSH --



          Out of the vision, Johnny finds her staring at him.

                        You're not having a stroke, are
                        you?  White boys can't handle
                        this music.  It's too nasty.

                          I learned to dance in fourth grade
                        P.E.  Square dancing.

            Suddenly, over her shoulder, Johnny sees Jose, the DRIVER
          OF THE VAN, about to go through the back door of the bar. 
          He's a little busted up -- bruised by the air bag, a few
          cuts.  He turns and locks eyes with Johnny.  Jose slips
          through the back door of the bar.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you for the salsa.  I think
                          I better stick to the kind that
                        you dip with chips.

          He hands her a ten.

                        Keep the change.

          He catches Bruce's eye and heads for the door.



          Bruce and Johnny are driving, having just been worked
          over by Ricky and his thugs.

                        Why does it feel like this is the
                        longest night of my life?  If I
                        was gonna get worked over, at
                        least I thought it was going to
                        be by a beautiful Black woman.

          Johnny's trying to figure it all out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw something back there.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's something about that woman,
                        the dancer.  She's connected to
                        this somehow, but it's not clear
                        yet.  I keep seeing her as a little
                        girl.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's weird.

                        And there's something else. 
                        Another vision I had, off the guy
                        with the pipe.  There are people*
                        somewhere, migrants trapped in a
                        container.  They're going to die
                        if we don't find them.

                                        BRUCE
                        We better call Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not yet.  I think that's why I
                        ended up with this baby.  I think
                        finding the father is the key to
                        this whole thing.

          On their hope that they are doing the right thing --



          As Johnny comes through the front door, Sarah puts on her
          coat.

                                        SARAH
                        Baby's asleep.

          Which sets off a crying jag.

                        I have got to get this shirt into
                        the laundry before Walt sees it. 
                        He's off in twenty minutes.

          Johnny looks at Sarah's orange goo-covered shirt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wow, Mikey's never done that with
                        me.

                        Stealth spewer.  Watch out -- you
                        never see it coming.  So, you
                        found his father?

                        But you're going to find him,

                        I'm doing my best.  Sarah, thank
                        you.

                                        SARAH
                        It was kind'a fun, actually. 
                        Like stepping into a time machine. 
                        He's a very special baby.

          Johnny looks at her, she understands his attachment to
          Mikey more than she knows.  On that wistful note, Sarah
          kisses her finger, touches it to the baby's cheek and
          leaves.  Johnny leans in to a still-fussy Mikey.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you miss me?  Did ya?

          As he picks up the baby, and heads for the train set...



          Mikey is now eight, he and Johnny are playing, the train
          set is out again, now much more elaborate.  Tracks go
          everywhere, through the kitchen, back into the living
          room from the dining room.  Clearly a house where two
          boys live, one little, one big enough to buy a lot of
          toys for both of them.

                        to bring you here from Mexico.

                        What did he sacrifice?

          That's a big word for a little kid.  Johnny looks at him.

                          Everything.  He sacrificed

          Out of vision, on Johnny, cradling Mikey, feeling very
          paternal and conflicted.



          Bruce enters with armloads of groceries.  He's already on
          a rant as he comes through the door.

                        You have to call her and tell her

                        want to do this whole baby thing
                        with, and Mikey here's gonna mess
                        it up for me.  How's that for
                        ironic?  This baby has got to go--

          Johnny holds up the baby, who lights up at Bruce, clearly

                        You know that rundown bunch of
                        mobile homes up off of Highway 45
                        that we pass when we go up to the
                        lake?

                        They use them for the workers
                        when they're cutting the timber.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's it.

          He grabs his jacket.  They both get all the way through
          the living room --



          ...through the front foyer...



          And into the vestibule.  As they're about to open the
          door, they stop.  Turn.  And walk back into --



          ...and look at little Mikey, cooing all alone on the floor
          with the trains.

          They look at each other.

          Bruce sighs.  The muscle hates to be left at home.

          We see on Mike's face that the moment he said it he
            regretted it.

                                        MIKE (CONT'D)

                        Told you what?

                        What happened to him? 

          As Johnny looks into the boy's eyes, WHOOSH!



          Out of the vision, Johnny realizes these private visions
          of himself and the baby are beginning to fall apart, even
          in his subconscious mind.

                        You lied to me.

                        But I just need a little more
                        time.  Just until I can find his
                        father.

                        Okay, so I hooked up with this

          Eva's getting antsy -- pissed off.  She opens the
            refrigerator, then some cabinets.  Takes out a frilly,
          gold-edged gravy boat (or some similarly old ladyish piece
          of china) that belonged to Johnny's mother.

                        You have really crossed the line!

          Off Eva, thinking she's in the middle of a domestic spat...

          Pick up with Johnny and Walt, mid-conversation.  Johnny,
          "shushing" him.

                        Just give me a few hours.  Please.

          It's the same thing he has asked of Bruce.  And Sarah. 
          Will it work with Walt, too?

                                        WALT

                        It's more than just Miguel, Walt. 
                        There are others -- I keep getting
                          visions.

                          A container of people are going
                        to die.

                                        WALT
                        Where?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know, but she can help me
                        find them.  I can't explain it
                        right now, but she's important.

          He stops, looks Walt in the eye.  The baby has been fussing
          while Johnny talked.  Johnny reaches into his pocket,
          pulls out Miguel's SAINT'S MEDAL, takes it out of the
            handkerchief and dangles it over Mikey.

          As Walt stares at Johnny, trying to decide what to do,
          the baby's tiny fingers close around the medal, it makes
          a powerful connection between Mikey, the medal and Johnny,
          sending him into --



          Vision Johnny watches as Miguel is being given the medal
          in a church (over whose altar Johnny sees the sign: "Our
          Lady of Hope"), by an Irish priest, FATHER O'CONNOR, whose
          Spanish is accented with his distinctive brogue.  (Note:
          this is pre-accident.  Miguel is hopeful and excited about
          seeing his family again.)

                        favor I need to ask.

          Johnny hands Walt the baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Make sure you burp him for at
                        least ten minutes.



          Eva's trying to jigger the locked door.  Johnny opens it
          quickly, closes the door behind him, and we hear the SOUND
          of baby Mikey crying O.C.

                        Enough with the boyfriend.  It's

                        Gotta make a stop first.

          On a skeptical Eva --



          Voices in Spanish echo through the small, 19th-century
          chapel, lighted by the glow of votive candles and Santos,
          reflecting its largely Latino congregation.  Eva makes
          the sign of the cross as she enters, and she and Johnny
          move past rows of pews, and scattered groups of people
          praying.  Eva whispers to one of the parishioners who
          answers in hushed tones.  She looks at Johnny --

                        It's a prayer service for the
                        woman killed in the van accident.

          This is hard for Johnny -- he was the last living soul
          this woman ever saw.

          Eva walks out the doors they came in.  As Johnny heads
          down the center aisle towards the altar, one of the side
          doors at the front of the church opens and Father O'Connor --
          the priest from his vision -- enters, talking to a
          distraught parishioner whom Johnny can't quite see yet.

          Johnny now sees that it's Miguel.  He moves closer, heart
          racing.  Miguel turns and makes eye contact with Johnny.

          Miguel looks past Johnny, to someone behind him, coming

          who's now bolting back out the front door of the church
          in order to run around the side and intercept Miguel.

          The same recurring vision he's had before the dark space
          cramped with people, including Vision Johnny.  Someone's

          rattle of the chain lock as it bangs against the side,

          expiring immigrants look up in hope, thinking they're
          about to be freed, instead, another handcuffed person is
          shoved inside and the container is once again slammed

                        I was seeing.

                                        EVA
                        What kind of vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        People.  Lots of them.  Jammed
                        into a cramped, dark space.  

          Eva's radar's up.

                                        EVA
                        That is strange.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sheriff Bannerman told me that
                        the coyotes smuggle immigrants
                        across the country in shipping
                          containers.  I assumed the people
                        I was seeing were the ones in the
                        van.

                                        EVA
                        How do you know they weren't?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Those people got out.  The ones I
                        keep seeing are trapped.  Dying
                        from exposure, dehydration.  I
                        think they're in a second
                        container.  One the coyotes never
                        come back for.  The problem is I
                        don't know where the container
                        is.

          Johnny pulls the car over.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you do.

          Eva's getting tense.

                                        EVA
                        What are you talking about?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        My visions only give me pieces of
                        the puzzle.  But I don't have all
                        the answers.  That's why I need
                        you.

          Eva gets out of the car.



          Johnny whispers to Miguel.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you okay?  Is everyone all
                        right?

                                        MIGUEL
                        We are all going to die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not if I can help it.

          Miguel's eyes widen as Johnny works the handcuff key out
          of his mouth and between his front teeth (or shoe:
          production choice).

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you mind?

          Miguel sticks out his hand as Johnny drops the key into
          it.  Miguel unlocks his cuffs.  Eva made the right decision
          after all.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.

          He turns to the frightened people.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The police are coming.

          This has the opposite effect on them than intended.  There
          are frightened cries of "policia?"  Johnny tries to shush
          them.  Johnny pulls a flare he has tucked into the
            waistband of his pants.  He aims it through a small opening
          in the top of the container.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Walt and Roscoe are on the bow of a COAST GUARD boat. 
          Walt's scanning the area through binoculars.  He spots
          the flare shoot up from one of the back containers.

                        The container is in the northeast
                          quadrant of the shipyard.  Move
                        in.  Everybody keep a heads up.



          As Miguel helps Johnny down, WHOOSH --



          From inside the container we hear the muffled sounds of
          Walt arriving and arresting the crew.  As in Johnny's
          earlier vision, Walt swings open the container, but as
          the bright daylight hits them, people don't fall out,
          they're dazed and disoriented, but thankfully alive. 
          Miguel stumbles out, then Johnny emerges.  As his eyes
          adjust to the light, he sees:

          Ricky wrestle away from Roscoe and grab Eva.  He pulls
          her weapon with every intention of using it.  Eva's not
          going to let him: instead of backing away, she heroically
          wrestles him for the gun, and it goes off.  As she slides
          to the ground, Walt lunges for Ricky, gets his weapon,
          splays him face down in the dirt.  Johnny rushes to Eva,
          who's bleeding from the gunshot wound, starting to lose
            consciousness.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lie still.
                                (to others)
                        Get an ambulance!
                                (to Eva)
                        Hang on. 

          She looks up at him.

                                        EVA
                        One grain of sand.

          As she slips away...



          Johnny holds baby Mikey in his arms as he walks him around
          the track of the toy train set with him one last time. 
          As he leans down and picks up the caboose...



          Under a banner announcing State Science Fair, amidst much
          applause a 15-year-old Mike proudly runs up to the podium
          and is handed a First Place Blue Ribbon by a SCIENCE
          TEACHER.

                                          15-YEAR-OLD MIKE
                        Thanks for this award.  I've always
                        loved trains and it was pretty
                        cool inventing a solar powered
                        model.  I'd like to dedicate this
                        prize to the guy who helped me
                        every step of the way -- my dad.

          As Johnny stands and heads up the aisle, Mike walking
          towards him, arms outstretched:

                                          15-YEAR-OLD MIKE
                        I love you, Papi.

          Johnny smiles, but to his surprise, the boy walks right
          through him into the awaiting arms of Miguel, his very
          proud, very real father.  As Vision Johnny disappears
          from the scene...



          Johnny, baby in his arms, rounds the corner into the foyer,
          to see Walt, Bruce and Sarah.

                        Just got off the phone with
                          immigration.  Eva will be charged
                        with obstructing justice among
                        other things, but her cooperation
                        in shutting down Penobscot's human
                          trafficking ring will be

                                        JOHNNY
                        And Miguel?

                                        WALT
                        USCIS has given him special visa
                          consideration.  Reverend Purdy's
                        gonna put some Faith Heritage
                        muscle behind the problems of the
                        migrant community, and has offered
                        to help Miguel get settled as a
                        single dad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I guess I can't put this
                        off forever.

          Bruce, Sarah, and Walt -- all the babysitters -- gather
          round their charge, each share a moment of their emotional
          attachment to baby Mikey, then part... and we see Miguel
          standing there, bandaged and bruised.  Even still, his
          face lights up, eyes misting with joy at the sight of his
          child.  As Johnny walks towards him, the men lock eyes,
          two fathers finally face to face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your son.  Miguelito...

          As Johnny hands Miguel his son, we see, as we have before
          with Johnny, how painful doing the right thing sometimes
          is, how much it can cost him.  Yet we also see, as he
          lets go of the bond he shared with this small person,
          finally, the bittersweet fulfillment of the promise he
          made to baby Mikey's mom.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He likes trains.

          Johnny hands Miguel the caboose.

                          Something to remember me by...

          Johnny, feeling obsolete, steps aside, then pulls something
          from in his pocket, turns back.

          As he starts to hand Miguel the St. Michael medal, Miguel
          closes his hand over Johnny's -- an echo of Johnny's moment
          with the baby.

          OFF JOHNNY --



          Johnny and J.J. come into the house, frisbee in hand. 
          J.J.'s headed for the fridge, Johnny pulls him back, points
          him towards his beloved childhood toy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, J.J., check this out.  My
                        old train set.  Vintage Lionels. 
                          Practically mint condition.  Pretty
                        cool, huh?  What do you say we
                        connect all the track--?

          J.J. looks at him like he'd rather eat nails.

                        How 'bout we play Rallisport

                          gross-out car crash effects. 
                        That's cool.

          Johnny can't tell him that the last thing he wants to do
          is play a game about car crashes.  He's already had enough
          of those to last a lifetime.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like a plan.

          As he settles in to play a video game, understanding the
          great life he's got right here, right now, with his own
          son, Johnny glances over at the train set for a beat,
          thinking of what might have been. 

          Off Johnny and J.J., battling on X-Box...
