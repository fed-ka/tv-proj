  -- Spartacus is SLAMMED onto a table by BARCA and ASHUR. -- 
  Ashur grabs a large CLAY POT filled with ASH and BLOOD. -- 
  Ashur haphazardly SMEARS a handful of the crimson mixture 
  over Spartacus  writhing torso and face as Barca struggles 
  to restrain him. -- Ashur grabs SURA S PURPLE BINDING on 
  Spartacus  wrist, struggles to remove it. Spartacus goes 
  berserk, manages to forearm shiver Ashur, sending the 
  cripple crashing to the stone floor.

                                        ASHUR
                        Thracian bitch.

  Spartacus lunges forward, but Barca grabs his neck, forcing 
  him back onto the table, hard -- he s going nowhere. 
  Spartacus chokes as Barca s grip tightens like a vise.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Barca! Release!

  REVEAL Batiatus, stepping through the threshold. Barca nods, 
  releases his stranglehold.

                                        BARCA
                        Dominus.

  Spartacus sucks in staccato breaths as Batiatus stands over 
  him. Ashur recovers, glaring at Spartacus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I think it best your wife s binding 
                        remains here. Where you re going, 
                        you may lose it. Along with your 
                        arm.

  Batiatus offers his hand. Spartacus hesitates, then unties 
  the binding and reluctantly hands it to Batiatus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Finish preparing him.

  Batiatus exits. As Barca restrains Spartacus, Ashur pulls 
  out another handful of the crimson mixture from the clay jar 
  and slams it into Spartacus  jaw, SMASHING US TO --



  Batiatus quickly strides down the corridor, Sura s binding 
  dangling between his fingers. DOCTORE appears.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A word, dominus?

                        You find objection to this course?

                        suffering. Beasts slaughtering 
                        beasts, to die without honor. Your 
                        father would never have --

                        The decision is made! If an animal 
                        cannot be tamed, it must be 
                        unleashed.

  Batiatus exits. Doctore pauses a moment, his distaste for 
  this course apparent. He turns to go, WIPING US TO --



  CLOSE ON a damp SPONGE held by Naevia as she dabs at the 
  thirsty skin of Lucretia.

  She takes the emerald necklace (from 103) and has Naevia 
  attach it. Batiatus hustles in, agitated.

                                        BATIATUS

                        The Pits.

  Lucretia glowers, not pleased with the answer. Batiatus 
  quickly launches into an explanation as he searches for the 
  dagger.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Crixus remains the single draw of 
                        the ludus. All interest of 
                        employment for the games falls 
                        squarely upon his shoulders. Of the 
                        new recruits, Varro is the only man 
                      of promise. Spartacus and Kerza 
                        prove worthless in the arena. So I 
                        fight them both tonight where they 
                        may yet fill our purse.

                        Dispatching the Thracian brings me 
                        relief. You descending into The 
                        Pits does not. The place stains the 
                        name. And threatens the body.

                        Barca looms over it, ready to break 
                        bone at the slightest provocation.

  Lucretia retrieves Batiatus  dagger, holds it out to him.

  -- KERZA S JAW CRACKING as it COLLIDES with a mallet of a 
  FIST, sending

  RIVULETS OF BLOOD

  through the air in SLOW MOTION, SPLATTERING ACROSS the FACES 
  of the BLOODTHIRSTY DREGS that make up this MOTLEY CROWD 
  encircling the death fights -- a stark contrast to the 
  pageantry of the arena. TIME RESUMES as they HOWL for blood, 
  loving the gratuitous gore. CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES around

  IXION,

    a gargantuan sadist wearing his last victim s FLAYED FACE AS 
  A MASK. He stalks a near-dead Kerza in the  ring  of the 
  abandoned blood-stained courtyard of a two-storied insula 
  known as  The Pits .

  KERZA

  screams as Ixion lands a bone-splintering blow, sending him 
  CRASHING to the ground. Ixion picks up a fallen RUSTY BLADE 
  and descends on him as the CAMERA MOVES


  INTO THE CROWD,

  its loud din drowning out Kerza s screams OFF-SCREEN. CAMERA 
  finds CORPSES of losing fighters hanging from meat hooks, 
  illuminated by the blazing CREMATORY at the periphery.

  A DROOLING OGRE OF A MAN

  fucking a CARBUNCLED, ANDROGYNOUS WHORE from the rear, 
  cheers the fight as he grunts and thrusts.

  UGLY MEN AND EVEN UGLIER WOMEN,

  in various states of unkemptness, drink, fight, and fuck. 
  MONEY exchanges grimy hands at a furious rate as the 
  denizens bet on the death match. Come to rest on 

  SPARTACUS

  shackled in the cell adjacent to the fighting area. His eyes 
  study the bizarre surroundings. He s never witnessed fights 
  of this nature in Thrace, nor the arena. These are not men, 
  but animals. And to survive, he must become one. Ashur 
  drifts past, joining

  BATIATUS

  by the cage door, frowning at the beating Kerza s taking. 
  Barca looms at his side as promised, his eyes alertly 
  scanning for any potential danger.

                        matter...?

  Barca takes a step forward, looming over the much smaller 
  Ovidius. Ovidius grits his teeth, realizing there s nothing 
  he can do.

                        such time, the points accrue.

  Ovidius moves off. Batiatus  face darkens.

                        head.

  The crowd ERUPTS, drawing Batiatus  attention to IXION, 
  howling victoriously. He hoists the gore-dripping

  FLAYED FACE OF KERZA

  up to the crowd. REVEAL Kerza s limp body lying in a pool of 
  his own blood, head devoid of skin. Ixion stands proud, 
  takes a bite from the facial flesh and spits it into the 
  crowd -- a cannibalistic souvenir for the merciless gawkers.

  ANUBIS,

  a huge, unpleasant man with a scarred face and milky eye, 
  steps forward to proclaim the winner.

  The crowd ROARS. Two BRUTES appear. One shackles Ixion 
  before escorting him out of the ring, while the other 
  removes Kerza by impaling his chest with a meat hook, then 
  dragging the limp body through the crowd, rest on

  Naevia escorts Crixus through the villa, passing various 
  SLAVES attending the place. Crixus  eyes fall on her neck,

  She pulls the necklace from her robes and presses it into 
  his hand. Crixus hardens at the rebuke.

  Crixus turns his back on her as he enters --



  Lucretia stands with her back to Crixus as he enters. She is 
  a vision in a sheer robe, as beautiful as she is commanding.

                        Draw closer, and make it so.

  He complies, taking her in his arms and kissing her. She 
  melts into him hungrily -- and discovers his hand clenched.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        What are you clutching? Show me.

  Crixus is forced to think on his feet.

                        A humble offering. For a goddess.

  He opens his hand, revealing the opal necklace.

                        Help me put it on.

  She removes her emerald necklace. He slides behind her, 
  draping the simpler opal necklace round her neck. He begins 
  kissing her neck, then slides her robe off her shoulders. 
  His hands explore her nakedness. She moans, grinding against 
  him.

  He reaches down OUT OF FRAME and maneuvers his cock inside 
  her. She gasps in ecstasy. As he works himself in and out of 
  her, PAN OVER to the DOORWAY where

  emotions swirling across her hurt face as she moves off,

  ANUBIS addresses the rowdy crowd.

                        death descend anew! Behold, Myrmex!

  The crowd roars and cheers as MYRMEX, a chiseled Egyptian 
  whose face is covered in tattoos, is led up. He grins at the 
  crowd, eyes blazing with the red mist of blood-lust.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Behold, Spartacus!

  Spartacus is led up, his face set in stone. The crowd jeers 
  and hisses, a few pelting him with garbage.

  BATIATUS,

  flanked by Barca and Ashur, frowns at the reaction.

                                        ASHUR

                        Why would they, after his showing 
                      in the arena?

  Anubis picks up a CLAY URN.

  He thrusts the urn at Myrmex.

                        Choose your fate!

  Myrmex reaches in and pulls out the small BLOODIED KNOB OF A 
  FEMUR. Anubis inspects the selection, then declares --

                        Myrmex draws Sphairai!!

  NOTE: Sphairai (ancient spiked gloves). Shouts from the 
  crowd placing bets as a BRUTE emerges from the shadows, 
  quickly attaches the Sphairai onto Myrmex s hands and 
  forearms as Anubis thrusts the urn at Spartacus. Spartacus 
  reaches in and pulls out a PIECE OF JAW BONE. Anubis 
  inspects, then declares --

  selection.

  Ashur nods, moves off to place the bet. The Brutes finish 
  equipping Myrmex and Spartacus. Anubis addresses the crowd.

                        Charon arrives!

  Anubis throws his arms up. The Brutes shove Spartacus and 
  Myrmex into the blood encrusted fighting area. The crowd 
  shouts and cheers, craving blood.

  SPARTACUS AND MYRMEX

  circle one another, the din all but deafening. Myrmex 
    sadistically smiles, then PUNCTURES his tongue with one of 
  the spikes from his Sphairai. His mouth instantly floods 
  with blood, which he promptly

  SPITS

  at Spartacus, the blood splattering his face. Spartacus 
  quickly wipes away the blood. Myrmex seizes the distraction, 
  attacking Spartacus and opening a gash across his chest with 
  his spiked gloves. Spartacus counters, on the defensive.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as Spartacus and Myrmex trade blows. Spartacus is getting 
  the worst of it, his blood SPLATTERING the crowd.

  BATIATUS

  wipes a fleck of blood from his cheek, frowning sourly at 
  the proceedings. The gods seem truly against him.

  MYRMEX

  lands a painful blow, roars to the crowd. They greet him 
  with cheers.

  SPARTACUS  POV

  of the crowd, distorted through the pain, the cacophony 
  assaulting him as if from underwater.

  ON SPARTACUS

  as he shakes the pain from him, his jaw setting in anger and 
    determination. Myrmex attacks. Spartacus is driven back, 
  recovers, unleashes a barrage of savage blows. Blood flies, 
  splashing Anubis, , but Myrmex refuses to go down.  He 
  retaliates, driving Spartacus back towards

  ONE OF THE MEAT HOOKS

  hanging from the rafters.  Spartacus grabs the hook and 
  SLAMS IT UP through Myrmex's jaw.  Myrmex screams, blood 
  spewing from his mouth as he grabs Spartacus around the 
  throat, strangling him.  Spartacus chokes, punches Myrmex in 
  the ribs in an attempt to get him to release.  Losing 
    consciousness, Spartacus desperately grabs the hook and

  RIPS MYRMEX'S FUCKING JAW OFF

  in a spray of gore.  It flies into the crowd, causing a 
  commotion as the crowd scrambles for the gory souvenir. 
  Myrmex stands dazed, blood spewing from torn arteries as his 
  tongue flops loosely.  A frozen moment.  Myrmex collapses, 
  dead.  Anubis steps forward.

  THE CROWD ROARS,

  money exchanging hands.

  SPARTACUS

  stands bloodied and exhausted, the fight having cost him 
  dearly.

  BATIATUS

  beams in excitement and relief.  Barca laughs in delight 
  over the unexpected victory.

  Batiatus moves off to collect his winnings, WIPING US TO --



  CLOSE ON: A GASH is crudely stitched closed with a THORN 
  serving as a needle. POP WIDE to REVEAL a severely beaten 
  Spartacus sitting on one of the tables as the MEDICUS tends 
  to his back.

  SLOW PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS,

  as he winces in pain. Exhaustion and blood drips from him in 
  equal measure. The LIGHTING DARKENS, reflecting his state of 
  mind. A beat, broken by --

  WIDEN TO REVEAL SURA is now by his side in her blue Thracian 
  dress. Spartacus takes her in with a warm smile, drawing 
  strength from her presence.

  Spartacus suddenly winces in pain, the lighting smashing 
  back to normal. POP WIDE, revealing the Medicus stitching up 
  another gash. Sura is gone, a fleeting dream. OFF Spartacus, 
  his wounds deeper than mere flesh and blood...

                        I should wash. I smell of death.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You smell like a man. Come to bed.

  She drops her robe and heads for bed. Batiatus grins, love, 
  strong and true, shining in his eyes. He moves to follow, 
  WIPING US TO --



  Spartacus trudges down the corridor in a haze of exhaustion 
  and pain. A GRUNTING SOUND echoes from BARCA S CELL. 
  Spartacus absently glances in as he passes, spotting

  BARCA FUCKING PIETROS

  inside. Pietros MOANS in pleasure, smiling at Spartacus as 
  another thrust sends him into ecstasy. Spartacus continues 
  down the corridor, arriving at

  THE BARRACKS

  where Varro and a knot of Gladiators lie sprawled across the 
    straw-littered floor. Varro half rises at the sight of 
  Spartacus, glad to see him yet breathing.

                                        VARRO
                        You live.
                                to other men)(
                        I told you he would.

  HAMILCAR glances over at Spartacus.

                                        HAMILCAR
                        What of Kerza?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Fallen. Never to rise whole.

  Spartacus starts to lay down.

                                        HAMILCAR
                        This is where gladiators sleep. Not 
                        dogs.

                                        VARRO
                        Hold your tongue.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        Fuck you, Varro. He stays...
                                to Spartacus)(
                        ...he wakes beside Kerza in the 
                        afterlife.

  Some of the Gladiators nod, GRUNT in agreement. Spartacus 
  locks eyes with Hamilcar -- then turns and exits, too weary 
  to argue.

                                        VARRO
                        Spartacus --

  Varro glares at Hamilcar as he follows after Spartacus into

  THE CORRIDOR

  Spartacus makes his way towards the landing at the rear 
  stairs.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        Pay no mind to those inbred fucks.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They speak the truth. I am no 
                        longer a gladiator.

                                        VARRO
                        Yet you are still a man.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Am I?

                                        VARRO
                        One deserving of respect.  Though 
                        I'll grant The Pits could force 
                        Jupiter himself to doubt his cock.

  Spartacus painfully eases himself down on the landing.  His 
  bed for the night.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What do you know of The Pits?

                                        VARRO
                        Too much. I wagered coin there at a 
                        time. And added to the debt that 
                        led me here within these walls.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You were of the crowd? Howling for 
                        blood?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        Pride does not follow the 
                        statement. These fights, Spartacus. 
                        They re different from the arena. 
                        I ve seen them twist the mind, 
                        turning men into beasts, their 
                        senses flown --

  Varro pauses. Spartacus is already asleep, the exhaustion 
  having seized him.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                                  soft)(
                        Sleep, then. And dream of better 
                        days.

  He turns and exits. PUSH IN on Spartacus  battered face. The 
  image BLOWS OUT TO SEARING BRIGHTNESS, transitioning us to 
  --

  CORVUS, a scarred, blood-drenched fiend with muscles as hard 
  as petrified wood, connects an elbow to Spartacus  ash and 
  blood smeared jaw. Spartacus, drenched from head to toe with 
  sweat and blood, staggers back, the sword in his hand 
  tumbling from his grasp.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as Corvus, forearms encased in blood-crusted steel, assaults 
  Spartacus. The background BLURS in and out of FOCUS around 
  Spartacus, the crowd s SHOUTS alternate between being 
  MUFFLED and HEIGHTENED. The beatings are taking a serious 
  toll.

  SPARTACUS SNARLS,

  countering the assault with a fist to Corvus  torso, the 
  impact sending shock waves of punishment through the brute s 
  body. Spartacus hammers. Corvus counters. The two stand toe-
  to-toe, slugging it out, blood flying.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.
  CONTINUED:

  CORVUS

  lands a crushing blow to the mid-section, reopening a GASH 
  over Spartacus  ribs. Spartacus grunts in pain. Corvus 
  surges, tackling him to the ground. His fists rain down, 
  pounding Spartacus  face into raw meat.

  BATIATUS

  eyes the action with concern. Barca looms behind his master, 
  enjoying the blood along with the SCREAMING CROWD -- now 
    considerably larger than the night before... a result of 
  word spread about Spartacus  victories.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  under his breath)(
                        Get up... Get up, you fucking 
                        worthless --

  SPARTACUS

  blocks a blow and HEADBUTTS Corvus, smashing his nose. 
  Corvus howls. Spartacus kicks him off of him and


  INTO THE CROWD,

  taking some of the rowdy fucks down with him. A few 
  overzealous fans join in the fun and kick Corvus while he s 
  down. Corvus rises, tossing the offenders aside as he rushes

  SPARTACUS,

  who greets him with bloodied fists. They trade devastating 
  blows, blood flying into the howling crowd. Spartacus takes 
  the brunt of the exchange, on the verge of getting his 
  brains knocked out. Corvus hauls back, launching his fist at 
  Spartacus  face. Spartacus bends out of the way at the last 
  second,

  GRABBING CORVUS AROUND THE NECK

  from behind. Corvus struggles, the capillaries in his eyes 
  BURSTING. Tears of BLOOD streak his cheeks. Spartacus roars 
  -- an animal, subhuman sound of rage. CRACK! Corvus  neck 
  snaps. The man goes limp, sliding from Spartacus  grasp, 
  dead before he hits the floor.

  THE CROWD ROARS

  at the victory. Spartacus sways, barely clinging to 
    consciousness. The crowd BLURS around him, their cheers a 
    REVERBERATING CLAMOR. His eyes fall on

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.
  CONTINUED:

  SURA,

  the lone FIGURE IN FOCUS standing at the front of the crowd. 
  She wears her blue dress, sans leather top. The dress is now 
  tattered and dirty. Tears fill her eyes, her heart breaking 
  at the agony Spartacus is forced to endure.

  ON SPARTACUS,

  his own eyes welling with tears at the sight of Sura, the 
  state of her dress. His hand reaches out, desperate to feel 
  her skin against his. It s snatched out of the air by

  ANUBIS,

  who throws it in the air to the roar of the crowd.

                                        ANUBIS
                        Spartacus! Victor!

  Batiatus raises his arms to the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Now that s how you send a shit to 
                        the afterlife!!!

  The crowd howls with laughter and cheers. Spartacus turns 
  back to where Sura was standing, only to find her gone. He 
  blinks the blood and sweat from his eyes, attempting to 
  regain his senses as two BRUTES shackle him.

  ASHUR

  weasels his way through the crowd, passing two DRUNKARDS as 
  he goes (we will see these men again later).  He draws up 
  next to Batiatus in excitement.

                                        ASHUR
                        The odds soar in Spartacus  favor. 
                        They believe he s unbeatable. A 
                        dead man whose soul refuses to 
                        leave its body.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus has no soul. It resides 
                      in the heart of another.

  Spartacus bloody, empty in his victory, is dragged towards 
  Batiatus by one of the Brutes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Prepare yourself.  You fight 
                        Mytilus next.

  OFF Spartacus  exhausted, soulless eyes...



  CRIXUS exits the bath, glistening and naked save a towel 
  slung over his shoulder. He slows as a GUARD approaches.

                                        GUARD
                        Crixus. You are summoned.



  TIGHT ON a key unlocking the gate between the mess hall and 
  the storage area at the landing of the stairs leading up to 
  the villa. POP WIDE to reveal

  NAEVIA

  standing on the other side of the gate. Crixus, now wrapped 
  in his towel, averts his eyes in forced disinterest as the 
  Guard opens the gate.

                                        NAEVIA
                                to Guard)(
                        Thank you.

  The Guard secures the gate after Crixus, who starts for the 
  stairs.

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        Wait.

  Crixus pauses. Naevia watches as the Guard moves off.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Domina will grow impatient. You 
                        know the urgency of her desires --

  Naevia turns, satisfied the Guard is out of earshot. She 
  struggles to keep her voice low.

                                        NAEVIA
                        She did not summon you.

  Crixus eyes her in confusion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Then why am I here?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                        me?

                                        CRIXUS
                      As I said.

                        Then why does it grace the neck of 
                        the Domina?

  Crixus stares in surprise, can t help but laugh at the 
  absurdity of the question.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The mind of a woman! Deflect a 
                        gesture then question where it 
                        lands. Your words -- I cannot 
                        accept this.

                        Yes. My words. Cut off before 
                        completion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And the others to follow?

                                        NAEVIA
                        That it is impossible for me to 
                        keep it, regardless of desire. 
                        There is nothing in my possession 
                        that was not given to me by Domina. 
                        Are you so thick that this fact was 
                        ignored? Did you think she would 
                        not notice?

  Crixus stares at her for an uncomfortable beat, the 
  realization of his mistake blossoming.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I... I misunderstood your meaning 
                      in the returning of it.

                                        NAEVIA
                      Of course you misunderstood! You 
                        have no mind outside the arena! You 
                        think only with your sword and your 
                        shield, you stupid, lumbering --

  Crixus abruptly pulls Naevia into a passionate kiss. Naevia 
  stiffens, momentarily acquiesces... then suddenly pulls 
  away. A charged beat.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  Words meant more for herself than Crixus.

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        Guard!

  She quickly retreats up the stairs.  Crixus watches her for 
  a moment as a hopeful, genuine grin bends his lips.  The 
  Guard reappears, unlocking the gate.  OFF Crixus as he exits 
  back into the ludus, barely containing the joy of the stolen 
  kiss...



  Spartacus scrapes blood and ash off of his oiled skin with 
  shaking hands, WINCING with each stroke. The fights have 
  taken a devastating toll on him, both physical and mental.

                                        SURA (O.S.)
                        How much longer?

  SURA appears next to him, her blue dress in worse condition 
  than before. Her hair is becoming matted and stringy. While 
  still beautiful, her appearance is beginning to reflect 
  Spartacus  mental state.

                                        SURA
                        How much blood until we re free?

  laughing, gambling, and fucking strain to pierce his veil of 
  pain, as if again heard from underwater.

  SPARTACUS  POV,

  coming in and out of focus. He passes GNAEUS, who sneers at  
  him, face twisted into a grotesque mockery. He passes the 
  barracks, seeing more

  DISTORTED FACES,

  eyeing him through the bars.  Varro rises from where he sits 
  talking with Hamilcar, his face filled with concern at the 
  sight of Spartacus.  He holds the MANDRAKE ROOT out through 
  the bars, hoping Spartacus will change his mind.

  SPARTACUS GLANCES AT IT,

  continues on his way in a fog of agony. The din of the ludus 
  rises, a deafening wave of sound. He reaches the landing to 
  the stairs and painfully lowers himself to the floor, back 
  against the wall.

                        her. In a dream.

  Batiatus studies Spartacus with a frown, waves Ashur and 
  Barca back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And what did they show you?

  Spartacus blinks, grits his teeth, trying to focus. His eyes 
  land on Batiatus, now seeing him clearly.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The truth. Your profit from my 
                        blood ends tonight.

  Batiatus doesn t care for the sound of that.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Refuse to fight, and I will cease 
                      my attempts to find your wife.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.
  CONTINUED:

  Spartacus laughs. There is no mirth in it. Only weariness 
  and pain as the madness creeps back in.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have to save her.  Before the 
                        rains come.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Give way to your meaning, you mad 
                        fuck!

  Batiatus strikes Spartacus hard across the face, snapping 
  his head to the side. A tense moment as Spartacus slowly 
  turns it back around to face Batiatus, his eyes hard and 
  focused again.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The odds remain high in my favor?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Still.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then bet everything you have 
                        against me.

  Ashur glances to Batiatus in surprise. How s that again?

                                        BATIATUS
                        You would die in The Pits? 
                        Willingly, to see my fortune rise?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes.  If you will hold to wrest my 
                        wife from the Syrian with a piece 
                      of it.

  Batiatus considers the offer.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And what s to keep me to this 
                        bargain once your blood is spilled?

                                          SPARTACUS

                        from the afterlife should you 
                        betray it.

  Ashur and Barca move in to comply. PUSH IN on Spartacus, his 
  eyes set to the task of dying as the SOUNDS OF THE CROWD in 
  The Pits swells, carrying us to --



  The CROWD yells and leers in SLOW MOTION. PAN ACROSS THEM to 
  find Spartacus as he s led past by the Brutes.

  THE TWO DRUNKARDS,

  swill from their ever-present cups, the wine dripping from 
  their mouths as they cheer Spartacus on.

  ANUBIS

  announces Spartacus as he s brought to his side.

                                        ANUBIS
                        Behold, Spartacus!

  The crowd ROARS. Ixion, the fiend that flayed off Kerza s 
  face, is ushered in by a Brute. Ixion now wears KERZA S FACE 
  as his death mask. Gruesome and cruel.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Behold, Ixion!

  The CROWD ERUPTS in response. Ixion snarl-laughs at 
  Spartacus. Spartacus looks right through him, barely 
  registering the man.

  ASHUR

  limps up next to Batiatus and Barca as Anubis goes into his 
  pre-fight spiel.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The wager is placed?

                        What weapons shall the gods bless 
                        them with?!  Or curse them with 
                        empty hands?!  Choose your fate!

  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus nods, tensely eyeing the crowd for such signs of 
  suspicion as Anubis thrusts out his clay urn to Ixion. Ixion 
  draws a SLIMY PIECE OF RIB BONE.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Ixion draws bipennis!

  NOTE: Bipennis (double headed axe). A Brute emerges from the 
  shadows and hands Ixion the double headed axe. Anubis offers 
  the urn to Spartacus. Spartacus draws a BLOODIED FRAGMENT OF 
  A RADIUS (forearm bone).

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus draws sica!

  NOTE: Sica (curved three-foot sword). Another Brute appears, 
  hands Spartacus his sword.

                                          ANUBIS(cont'd)
                      We have but a single rule! Only one 
                        survives! Mongrel on mongrel, till 
                        Charon arrives!

  Anubis throws his arms up. The Brutes shove Spartacus and 
  Ixion into the blood encrusted fighting area. The crowd 
  shouts and cheers, craving blood.

  IXION

  flurries his axe as he stalks towards Spartacus. Spartacus 
  grips his sica, steeling himself for the fight -- and his 
  death.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as Ixion attacks. Spartacus narrowly dodges the axe, 
  counters with a SLASH that grazes Ixion s chest, prompting

  RIBBONS OF BLOOD

  to suspend in air before SPRAYING faces in the crowd. Ixion 
  HOWLS, returns with a brutal onslaught. Spartacus BLOCKS, 
  spins, and dodges as best he can, but Ixion finally 
  connects, the blade splitting the skin across

  SPARTACUS  BACK,

  splaying blood. Spartacus staggers in agony.

  CONTINUED:

  Ixion swings, intent on decapitating Spartacus. Spartacus 
  deflects the blow with his sword, but the force sends his 
  weapon HELICOPTERING into the crowd in SLOW MOTION, landing 
  at the feet of the

  TWO DRUNKARDS.

  Drunkard #1 kicks it aside, his eyes narrowing, suddenly not 
  drunk at all as he focuses on Batiatus across the room. He 
  nods to Drunkard #2, who also turns dead sober as he slips a 
  DAGGER from his robes. Drunkard #1 follows suit. The two 
  assassins split up, disappearing into the crowd as they head 
  towards the unsuspecting Batiatus.

  SPARTACUS,

  now weaponless, is doing his best to avoid Ixion s deadly 
  axe. He lands a series of blows with his bare fists, but 
  Ixion responds with a belt from the axe s handle, sending 
  Spartacus to the ground, spewing blood. TIME SLOWS as 
  Spartacus locks eyes with

  BATIATUS,

  who nods in response. Time to sacrifice his life for Sura s. 
  Ixion raises the axe behind Spartacus, prepared to deliver 
  the death blow. But Spartacus  eyes shift, spotting Drunkard 
  #1 closing in behind Batiatus, the assassin s dagger 
  catching the light.

  SPARTACUS TENSES,

  realizing that if Batiatus dies, Sura will be lost forever.

  IXION SWINGS HIS AXE,

  the blade CONTRAILING as it slams down towards the back of 
  Spartacus  head. Spartacus ROLLS ASIDE a split second before 
  it connects. The axe slams into the floor, throwing sparks.

  SPARTACUS

  kicks Ixion back, sending him stumbling back.

  BATIATUS

  stares in shock, seeing his staggering wager in jeopardy. He 
  still doesn t see Drunkard #1 approaching from behind.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

  Spartacus surges to his feet, shouting to Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Behind you!

  But his shout of warning is drowned out by the shouts of the 
  crowd as Ixion attacks.

  BARCA

  cocks his head, having picked up that something s wrong. He 
  catches the BLUR of movement behind him, whirls just as 
  Drunkard #1 surges towards Batiatus with his dagger. Barca 
  intercepts, the blade SLASHING HIS ARM.

  BATIATUS AND ASHUR

  turn in shock at the assault. Batiatus fumbles for his 
  dagger. Barca GRUNTS in pain, his face twisting in rage as 
  Drunkard #1 slashes at him. Barca grabs his arm, SNAPPING it 
  as he rips the dagger free and starts SLASHING THE FUCK out 
  of Drunkard #1. Blood splatters everywhere.

  DRUNKARD #2

  emerges from the crowd behind Batiatus and smashes Ashur out 
  of the way. Batiatus whirls around just in time to avoid the 
  death blow, but gets sliced across the ribs. Batiatus  
  dagger flies from his hand. Barca, still carving up Drunkard 
  #1, doesn t realize Batiatus is about to be murdered.

  SPARTACUS

  sees Drunkard #2 going in for the kill. He unleashes a 
  BARRAGE OF VICIOUS BLOWS against Ixion, rips the axe out of 
  his hand and DECAPITATES him in a geyser of blood.

  THE CROWD ROARS,

  then quickly dive out of the way as Spartacus spins around 
  and HURLS THE AXE. TIME SLOWS as the blade lazily ROTATES 
  through the crowd, narrowly missing them. TIME RESUMES as

  THE AXE SLAMS INTO DRUNKARD #2 S BACK

  a moment before he would have plunged his dagger into 
  Batiatus  heart. The Drunkards s body slumps to the floor, 
  revealing a shaken Batiatus clutching his bloody side. CHAOS 
  ERUPTS

  all around him. Barca, having dispatched Drunkard #1, shoves 
  the crowd away from his master. Batiatus locks eyes with 
  Spartacus, knowing the man just saved his life, but in the                                                                                     44.

  Lucretia stands in her sheer robe, bathed in moonlight and 
  lost in thought. Her hand absently fingers the OPAL NECKLACE 
  Crixus gave her. A beat. Her other hand drifts to her belly, 
  longing for it to be filled with life.

  BATIATUS

  enters behind her. He pauses, the beauty of his wife 
  amplified by his brush with death. Lucretia senses his 
  presence, smiles without turning.

                        widow. He saved my life in The Pits 
                        this night.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A place you would not have been if 
                      it weren t for him. He is cursed by

                        ended, as it should have when he 
                        stepped into the arena, doomed to 
                        execution. Every day Spartacus yet 
                        breathes, I fear his curse becomes 
                        our own.

  OFF Batiatus, her words resonating...



  Spartacus lies prone on a table, waiting for the Medicus to 
  arrive and treat his considerable wounds.

                                          DOCTORE (O.S.)
                        Spartacus.

  Spartacus painfully opens his eyes, focusing with difficulty 
  on Doctore.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Batiatus summons you.

  A beat. Spartacus knows this is not going to end well. He 
  painfully rises, his battered body WIPING US TO --
