UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
One of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
garbage seems gift wrapped.
The VOICES continue over as
we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.
The voices continue:
"Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
ride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
"Card"...
In contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
brownstone, we go inside to find...
STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT
Nick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
Cavello has a good half block on him.
From nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
block behind, silently cursing his age.
AT THE CORNER
a limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.
The limo
streaks away.
CHARLIE
turns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.
CUT TO:
POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Nick strides out the door.
Charlie hurries after him.
CHARLIE
Wait up.
You know the guy who did
the Weismuller through the window --
NICK
-- Cavello.
Ronnie Cavello.
Charlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:
a Harley hog
complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.
The
bike is held together with tape and baling wire.
CHARLIE
You know him?
Nick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.
NICK
He works for Frank Abolofia.
Atlantic City.
Casinos.
CHARLIE
So why dive through the glass for a
nickel and dime bust?
Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
sock, grabs Charlie's foot.
Charlie teeters.
NICK
What's this?
CHARLIE
Let go...
Nick pulls out a Beretta 32.
CHARLIE
Back-up.
NICK
Get rid of it.
CHARLIE
Why?
NICK
It's not regulation.
And the only
way you're gonna stop anybody with
it is to show it to him, and while
he's laughing, you can shove it down
his throat.
CHARLIE
(looking at Nick's
bike)
I'll get rid of it when you get rid
of the egg-beater.
The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
ski goggles.
CHARLIE
Nick, let's go hunting.
Bag
Cavello.
NICK
Charlie...
Nick pops the bike into gear.
NICK
... You still got shaving cream on
your ear.
Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.
BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT
WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
of the lights and shadows.
The SOUND of wind whips
through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.
SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT
Civil service heaven.
Nick hits the cut switch and glides
past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
development.
A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
or Chrysler in every garage.
One house sticks out.
The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
driveway.
Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
at the house.
His house.
It's as inviting as an open
grave.
He shoots away.
THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT
A Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.
Nick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.
Number Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
trigger.
He's wild.
The front windows of the Lime House
shatter.
The LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.
Number Two tosses the
package to him.
Nick empties his revolver.
Number Two goes down.
The driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
take off on foot.
Nick follows, reloading as he runs.
STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE
Deserted.
The wail of police sirens in the distance.
Charlie has his gun out.
He's drenched in sweat.
Where
is his partner?
CHARLIE
NICK...!
Shit... SHIT!!
CUT TO:
ANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT
Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.
Drugs going up
and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
slumped on the ground.
Everyone scatters -- the one's
that can.
AN ABANDONED PAIL
swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.
Nick
cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
hands.
A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
gun and nearly blows him away.
NUMBER ONE
We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
the back of the alley.
From now on we'll call him KOBO.
His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
casually at his side.
A very cool character.
Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
finger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
his hand.
NICK
On the ground, man.
NOW!!
Kobo cups his hands around his ear.
He doesn't understand
English.
Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
kicks out his legs.
Kobo falls flat on his chest.
Nick pulls out his cuffs.
But Kobo lunges for Nick's
ankle and yanks it toward him.
Nick stumbles backward;
Kobo's on his feet.
Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.
Nick gets up, barrels into him.
Kobo knees Nick in the
solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
Nick's back.
It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
that this kid is so damn fast.
Nick slowly gets to his feet.
KOBO lands two more brutal
shots to the side of Nick's head.
He's a bloody mess.
TWO POLICE CARS
stop at the end of the alley.
FOUR OFFICERS climb out.
CHARLIE
joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
getting pummeled.
Charlie shoots at Kobo.
Misses.
Kobo turns to see the
five cops, guns drawn.
Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.
Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
drops it next to Nick.
The blade gleams in the light.
That was next.
Nick got lucky.
Kobo towers imperiously above Nick.
Their eyes lock.
We
hold then...
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
NICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING
There isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
of it.
In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
centerstand.
A drop cloth is spread around it, tools
neatly aligned.
It's a Harley -- but this one is in
perfect condition.
A phone RINGS insistently from off screen, then stops.
NICK (O.S.)
Yeah... sure, sure I'll be down.
Nick walks in, naked.
Every muscle aches.
One side of
his face is completely swollen.
He has a band-aid over
his right eye; some blood caked on his earlobe.
He stops
to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet, but it snaps.
CUT TO:
POLICE STATION - DAY
Nick and Charlie cross the street.
Charlie's trying to
read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given
them.
CHARLIE
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.
Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our
side.
NICK
Let's grab some food.
CHARLIE
First decent idea you've had.
Charlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo" book, flips
through the pages.
CHARLIE
Food... Food, here we go.
Tokyo
offers a wide variety of food.
It's
best to sample the local
specialties, including sashaimi,
soba, and world renown Kobe beef...
Nick goes into a restaurant.
Charlie drops the book,
disgusted with Nick's choice.
Charlie reluctantly follows
him in.
REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant.
CUT TO:
HOUSING PROJECT - SHIN OKUBO - DAY
Rows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and
brightly painted concrete walls.
Nick and Charlie are
searching for the Japanese cop's building.
They can't
speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half
the buildings don't have numbers.
It's a nightmare.
CHARLIE
This should be it...
NICK
You said that in the last two
places.
Charlie holds out the paper to a passing man.
CHARLIE
Kore?
Doku?
Kore doku?
The man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing
to.
NICK
Okay, you were right.
Charlie grins, satisfied.
SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT
The jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a
motorcycle down.
It's a bad neighborhood, one of the
poorest in Tokyo.
We spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on
wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this
labyrinth.
CHARLIE
(looking around)
Getting very weird.
NICK
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
CHARLIE
Maybe we should bail?
Seeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to
hurry up, then disappears around the corner.
NICK
(looking at the maze
of streets)
Think we could find our way back?
CUT TO:
A GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR
A poor man's idea of a bar.
The woman points inside,
chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving
Nick and Charlie on their own.
INSIDE PINK SARON
Nick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven
flaps shut behind them.
A vintage wurlitzer juke box
glows across the room.
An Enka plays.
(Haunting Japanese
blues.)
MAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS)
Big shots from New York.
I like
your style!
ICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches
from them.
He is a short overweight man looking every
minute of his fifty-five years.
His white short sleeve
shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle;
his collar soaked in sweat.
He's not drunk yet, but he's
been at it a while.
Call him Ich.
ICH
(bowing)
Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.
I'm the
man you're looking for.
This is Ohashi's best man?
Well, at least he speaks
English.
ICH
The man you are looking for, Kobo,
was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi.
A Yakuza.
Ich nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer.
They shake their heads.
Ich finishes it.
NICK
Where do we start looking for this
guy?
ICH
Where would you look for the mafia?
CHARLIE
The back room at Lombardi's after
the Columbus Day Parade.
Under the
bed.
In the mayor's office.
Everywhere.
Ich heads for the door without saying a word.
NICK
Where're you going, Ichiro?
ICH
(stops, faces them)
The mayor's office, under the bed,
the back room at Lombardi's.
(tucking in his
shirt tail)
And call me Ich.
CUT TO:
ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - NIGHT
Charlie and Nick are trying to help a besotted Ich find a
taxi, but no one will take him.
Ich is shouting half
English, half Japanese phrases.
ICH
... We got to keep looking.
Track
him down!
Great balls of fire!
NICK
(frustrated, to a
cabbie)
What's the problem here?
The cabbie ignores them.
WOMAN (O.S.)
You don't speak the language.
I'll
drop him off.
They turn to see Joyce standing behind them.
ICH
Ah, Joyce...
The rest is slurred Japanese.
Joyce speaks to a cabbie in
Japanese.
The rear door swings open.
She helps Ich in.
Joyce climbs in.
ICH
(out the window)
See you tomorrow!
The taxi pulls away.
Nick and Charlie watch it go.
NICK
Not a prayer.
CUT TO:
STREET - FOUR A.M.
An early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and
plucks at the tails of dragon-like banners hanging outside
the shops.
Nick and Charlie are walking down this narrow
sidestreet on the way back to their hotel.
CHARLIE
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like
him.
NICK
He couldn't find his ass with both
hands.
A brand new Kawasaki 1000 motorcycle with windshield and
full farings gleams under a street light.
CHARLIE
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I
want to see you on.
NICK
(muttering)
Sure, a rice burning crotch
rocket...
CHARLIE
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy
without any help?
Maybe I should
work on that girl Joyce, she speaks
the language.
Nick glances over at his partner, smiles.
But before he
can respond --
The DULL ROAR of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance
breaks the pre-dawn stillness.
TWENTY BOSOZOKU (BIKERS)
on their multi-cylinder high tech street bombers, creep
around the corner and slowly ride toward Nick and Charlie.
We get a better look at them:
turbo punk Elvis-samurai
hybrids -- some wearing a slipper under their headbands,
courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants.
And tattoos...
They head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last
moment, split and float away IN SLOW MOTION, as if the
cops didn't exist.
Suddenly, the street is empty again.
Silent except for
the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns,
rustling the wind chimes...
Hold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the
street, realizing just how far away from home they are.
DISSOLVE TO:
HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING
A rocket shaped building:
a mixture of Dutch Gable and
Japanese Minka roof.
The mid-day sun beats down on a
particular room.
PRINTING PLANT - DAY
Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the
crowd toward the subway entrance.
TWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from
the top of two different subway entrances.
As soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they
climb off their bikes and follow.
SHINJUKU - NIGHT
The MUSIC continues.
The sax screams as the melody is
abandoned.
Nick is drunk.
Roaring angry drunk.
He doesn't know
where he is.
He doesn't care.
He plows down the street,
occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go.
Nick begins to laugh.
A couple is staring at him, Nick
yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.
He stumbles on...
drop back to find.
ICH
following in his wake.
He bows and apologizes to the
offended.
CUT TO:
LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - NIGHT
Nick is thrown onto the street.
He tries to reenter and
is thrown out again.
We spot JOYCE inside watching; she
turns back to her customers.
GINZA - NIGHT
Nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him
and continues selling his papers.
Ich appears and
apologizes to the news vendor.
STREET - TWO A.M.
Nick's sitting on the curb, his head in his hands.
People
step around him.
Across the street, out of Nick's sight, Ich is watching
his partner, feeling every barb of Nick's shame.
Charlie Parker continues over the slow...
DISSOLVE TO:
NICK --
asleep, the futon tangled around him.
He opens his eyes.
A woman is making tea in the kitchenette.
This is the
kimonoed woman who led Nick and Charlie to Ich the other
night.
A RADIO is on softly in the background.
The Charlie
Parker tune we've been listening to over the previous cuts
ends, and the announcer comes on:
RADIO
... That was the Bird, from the Blue
Note years.
1230 hours and 72
degrees in central Osaka.
This is
specialist Doug Dale, Tapestries in
Jazz, on the Far East Network, armed
forces radio...
Nick slowly sits up to see
ICH
seated at a low table looking at him from across the room.
Nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner.
Nick now realizes he's in Ich's apartment.
It's spotless.
Everything is now in its proper place.
NICK
What happened?
ICH
They made you leave your hotel...
(looks away)
... you caused a disturbance.
Nick's eyes fall on Charlie's things:
his sports clothes,
his tour book, his shoes which Ich has stacked on the
table.
ICH
It may be too soon to talk about it.
When someone we care for dies we...
(beat)
... keep something of their's.
A
tie, a pen.
NICK
Why weren't you at the platform?
ICH
I couldn't keep up.
My shame is
complete.
Nick slowly shuts his eyes, his head pounding.
CUT TO:
NARITA AIRPORT
The brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift
carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly
of the cargo plane.
Nick watches it from the edge of the
tarmac.
AIRPORT CHECK IN GATE
Nick hands the clerk his ticket.
NICK
... Smoking.
CLERK
Aisle or window?
Nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the
counter.
He can't read it, of course, but there's a
picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed,
swarming with police.
Nick continues to stare at the
paper.
CLERK
Aisle or window, sir?
NICK
(looks up)
I want to cash it in.
Yen.
CUT TO:
ICH'S APARTMENT - DAY
Nick steps in, drops the two suitcases.
NICK
Ichiro?
The woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in
Japanese.
Nick doesn't have a clue.
CUT TO:
DEPARTMENT STORE - SIX P.M.
The SALESGIRLS are lined up at the door bowing and
thanking the last customers for shopping in their store.
Standard practice.
The GIRL whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out
wearing her uniform and heads down the street.
NICK AND ICH
waiting in the restaurant, get up to follow.
CUT TO:
THE GIRL
stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash.
She walks
past a doorway where...
NICK is standing.
ICH now walks past his partner picking up the tail.
No
acknowledgement between them.
STREET CAR STATION
There are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.
The
girl is on one of them.
Ich has lost her.
Nick and Ich
hurry from car to car.
ICH
You said you could keep up with her!
'No problem, Nick-san.'
NICK
(cutting Ich off)
No.
Don't say anything.
Don't do
anything, and for Christ's sake,
don't apologize!
ICH
Nick...
Nick hurries toward another car to check it out.
NICK
What'd I tell you?
ICH
There she is!
They spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the
street cars, about to turn onto the main street.
The two cops race for the car.
Nick leaps on.
Ich is a
few steps behind.
Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up.
They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard,
both out of shape.
CUT TO:
NIGHTCLUB DISTRICT - NIGHT
Narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far
as the eye can see.
We spot our girl hurrying down the street.
Nick, a half
block behind, is bumping into people, trying not to lose
her.
She crosses the street and Ich picks her up.
Nick drops
off.
ON A SIDE STREET
around the corner the girl disappears into a three story
apartment building above an electronics store.
DISSOLVE TO:
GIRL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
We're watching our girl inside her apartment.
She flips
off the TV and climbs into bed.
CUT TO:
A STOREROOM - NIGHT
We've been watching the girl from a window across the
street.
It's a storeroom full of shipping crates, not
much else.
Ich is sitting on the floor, legs crossed,
back erect, watching Nick.
Nick glances over.
Ich
continues to watch him.
Nick returns to the window.
ICH
You dislike me.
Nick keeps looking out the window.
NICK
Did I say that?
ICH
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
NICK
Are we getting married?
Pause.
ICH
I'm a joke.
They sent you to me to
make a fool of you.
Nick looks over at Ich.
Ich is looking away.
Nick looks
out the window, then back at his partner.
NICK
You're doing fine, Ich.
Now drop
it, okay?
ICH
Sure.
The girl switches off her light across the street.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE STOREROOM - MORNING
Ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale.
Nick, exhausted, is sitting by the window his head resting
against the sill.
NICK'S POV OF THE STREET
as the girl, dressed in her store uniform, comes out of
the apartment and heads for work.
NICK
nudges the sleeping Ich with his foot.
Ich opens his
eyes.
NICK
Let's book.
Ich is groggy, nonplused.
NICK
Let's go.
CUT TO:
GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Rain pours down.
STREET - GINZA DISTRICT - NIGHT
It's our GIRL standing alone on the corner of the street
but you wouldn't know it at first.
She's wearing tight
leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red
lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her
hair to fall to her waist.
NICK AND ICH
watching in a doorway down the block.
Nick's shivering,
his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket.
Ich doesn't
mind the cold.
He's had his sake.
THREE BOSOZOKU
riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her,
then circle back.
One of the RIDERS stops to talk to her, then drives off.
She hurries off in the opposite direction.
ICH
Yakuza.
NICK
Good.
Very good...
CUT TO:
A SUBWAY STATION
The girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing
back, steps in the car.
The train pulls out.
The cars
race past until we see --
Nick and Ich standing inside of the last car.
It
disappears into the tunnel.
CUT TO:
THE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT
The girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.
Drop
back to find Ich twenty yards behind.
She crosses the
street.
Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window,
picks her up.
AROUND THE CORNER
Nick has lost her.
It's a cul de sac with a dozen
buildings.
He's standing in the middle of the street.
Ich catches up to him.
NICK
She disappeared... shit!
ICH
You were too far behind.
Nick does a double-take.
ICH
(recalling Nick's
words)
Don't say anything more.
Don't do
anything.
And, for Christ's sake,
don't apologize!
DISSOLVE TO:
STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER
NICK
dropping another cigarette butt to the ground.
There's a
small pile at his feet.
He's leaning against the wall
watching one end of the block.
TRACK over to reveal Ich,
his back to Nick's, watching the other end.
Ich glances back at Nick.
Nick ignores him.
Ich turns
back.
ICH
Nicklaus-san!
Nick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house.
She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.
She
climbs into a taxi.
CUT TO:
PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT
The girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside.
Nick and Ich are watching from across the street.
HOSTESS CLUB
Nick waiting under the pink neon sign.
HOSTESS CLUB
Nick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell
is Ich?
Ich comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his
drunken, pigeon-toed walk.
Nick, of course, thinks Ich
has gotten drunk again.
Two of the bodyguards are
watching from inside.
NICK
I don't believe it...
(grabs him)
Son-of-a-bitch --
Ich, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the
sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk.
ICH
(under his breath)
I'm not drunk...
NICK
We're through.
I mean it.
This is
the end of the line, Matsumoto.
ICH
Nick --
NICK
Shut-up.
No longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops
his affected walk, and sounding very sober --
ICH
You shut-up!
(then)
Kobo is inside.
He's with Sugai,
the head of the Summaguchi-clan.
ACROSS THE STREET
Ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in
on Sugai.
ICH
... A Godfather.
His man was killed
at the printing plant.
NICK
I want to yank Kobo.
ICH
Not without a small army, Nicklaus-
san.
Ich quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up,
pleased with himself.
NICK
Ich, my name is Nick.
Not Nicklaus,
not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san.
Nick.
ICH
San is an honorable title.
Ich realizes it's better to drop it.
CUT TO:
THE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER
Drunken Salarymen spill out the door.
ICH AND NICK
are standing across the street waiting for the cops to
arrive.
Nick freezes.
THE GIRL
they've been following steps out and lights a cigarette.
TIME SLOWS.
She looks up and spots the two men through
the traffic.
Nick turns away, afraid he's been made.
When he looks back, she's gone back inside.
NICK
Shit...
Nick races across the street toward the club.
Horns
BLARE.
ICH
(doesn't understand)
Nick?!
IN FRONT OF THE CLUB
Nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club
BURST OPEN.
He's too late.
Three bodyguards burst out,
checking the street.
A red and white Debonnaire pulls up.
Sugai, surrounded by a half-dozen additional bodyguards,
comes out and slips into the car.
It tears off down the
street.
SIRENS AND POLICE CARS
from either end of the street peel around the corner.
It's a madhouse.
The remaining lieutenants and bodyguards
fan out, trying to elude arrest.
Nick hurries down the steps.
INSIDE THE CLUB
The patrons are still in place, but the two side rooms are
empty.
Nick spots KOBO going out the rear entrance.
He starts
after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him
earlier.
Nick connects to the guy's jaw before his
adversary can raise his hands.
The bouncer staggers back.
Nick flies out the rear door.
CUT TO:
FRONT OF CLUB - NIGHT
Several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns --
possession is a felony in Japan -- as the police close in.
REAR OF HOSTESS CLUB - NEARBY STREETS - NIGHT
SILENCE.
The narrow streets are deserted.
Nick slowly
makes his way down the street.
The SOUND of a GUNSHOT.
Nick ducks for cover -- it's a car BACKFIRING.
He
continues on.
Nick's POV of a woman giving a man a blow-job in a narrow
alley.
The man's face is hidden by the shadow.
Nick continues on.
JAPANESE MAN (FROM THE DARKNESS)
People like Charlie are a dime a
dozen.
Nick turns back to see Kobo as he steps into the light.
Kobo tosses a handful of change at Nick.
KOBO
Keep the change.
NICK
I'm taking you back.
The girl takes off down the block.
KOBO
Here I am.
From across the street, a dozen bodyguards appear from
various doorways and alleys.
KOBO
Charlie was a rookie...
Kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut Nick
in New York.
KOBO
... But you can take care of
yourself.
You're 'the biggest thing
to hit this town since Godzilla.'
Nick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.
He is
unarmed.
To make a move would be suicide.
More POLICE
SIRENS in the b.g. closing in.
KOBO
What's the matter.
I'm right in
front of you, Nick.
(takes a step closer)
But I was right in front of you when
you let Charlie die.
Kobo takes a step forward.
His face is inches from
Nick's.
KOBO
Walk away again.
Maybe you'll get
used to it.
Nick doesn't budge.
A LONG BEAT, then... Nick turns and slowly walk off.
After a dozen yards Nick looks back.
The street is empty, except for a street sweeper pushing
his wet broom down the block.
HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT
A half dozen bodyguards are being frisked, then shoved
into police cars.
Ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner.
Nick
steps up to him.
Ich hurries over.
ICH
Nick!
NICK
(to Ohashi)
A few minutes faster, we might've
nailed him.
Ohashi doesn't say a word, hands Nick a document.
NICK
What's this?
OHASHI
Your visa has expired.
Be on a
plane in twenty-four hours or you
will be deported.
NICK
While you were hanging out at the
visa office, we found the son-of-a-
bitch.
OHASHI
Look.
Ohashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a
SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.
The rear doors are open
revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops.
OHASHI
You ruined an on-going investigation
that could have gotten us more than
one runner.
(to Ich, in Japanese)
I want a full report in the morning,
officer.
Ich bows as Ohashi walks off.
NICK
Maybe if you'd work with us --
Ohashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting
car.
NICK
(shouting)
Hey...!
(Ohashi keeps
walking)
HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
OHASHI
(his back toward
Nick)
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Ohashi slips into his car.
Nick storms up to the car and
slams his fist on the window.
NICK
Ohashi!
Ohashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.
Nick takes
the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna.
Ich grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car.
The car pulls away.
ICH
Nick, stop!
Nick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing,
punches Ich below his left eye.
Ich stumbles back over
the curb and lands on his ass.
NICK
Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people
telling me what I can and can't do.
No one ever solved anything sitting
on their ass.
Nick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's
car disappear down the block.
ON ICH
looking up at
NICK
who walks off without looking back at his partner.
CUT TO:
LAS VEGAS BAR - CLOSING TIME
The last customers find their way to the street, some with
a little encouragement from a BOUNCER.
Joyce steps out.
Nick comes up to her.
NICK
You know where I can get a decent
cup of coffee this time of night?
I'm buying.
JOYCE
Somebody must be suffering
somewhere, you're being so nice.
Joyce takes off down the street.
Nick watches her for a
beat.
NICK
I need your help, Joyce.
JOYCE
Where's Ich?
NICK
Unavailable.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
The neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement.
Nick and
Joyce walk down the deserted street.
She's carrying an
umbrella.
JOYCE
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
NICK
He drinks.
JOYCE
He's got a reason.
Nick shrugs, everyone's got a reason.
JOYCE
His son hooked up with some bikers.
Yakuza kids.
A cop shot him running
from a robbery.
Nick looks over for the first time.
JOYCE
A father doesn't out live that kind
of thing here, much less a police
officer...
Pause.
NICK
Where's the wife?
JOYCE
You met her.
Nick looks surprised.
JOYCE
The woman in the apartment.
She
won't speak to him.
But she won't
leave either.
Japan... Nice, huh?
Before Nick can respond, something catches his eye:
What
he sees --
A MAN
partially shadowed, standing in the alley.
Nick grabs his gun.
The man steps out zipping up his
trousers.
It's a drunken Salaryman.
Nick lowers his gun.
The Salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself.
JOYCE
Not wound too tight...
CUT TO:
JOYCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A three story modern building on a quiet street.
She's
searching for her keys.
JOYCE
I'd invite you up but I know you'd
hate the incense.
(as if to explain)
I chant.
NICK
What do you chant?
JOYCE
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'
You think
it's dumb of course.
NICK
Not if it works.
(holding the door
open for her)
I'll meet you at the train?
JOYCE
I don't remember saying yes.
NICK
I don't remember you saying no.
Joyce smiles, heads inside.
CUT TO:
BULLET TRAIN
The Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills.
BEPPU - DAWN
Plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street
corner.
If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the
city was on fire.
Beppu is a resort famous for it's
geothermal baths.
SUGAI'S HOUSE
The only traditional house we'll see in our story.
It's
surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the
hot springs.
AT THE GATE
CLOSE ON A 1000 yen bill as it is dropped on the ground.
A pair of dice rolls over it.
A handful of GUARDS wearing
suits and ties are playing craps.
OUTSIDE THE GATE
Ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall,
sound asleep.
Nick is standing nearby.
He checks his
watch.
Tired of waiting, he walks over to --
JOYCE
reading the Manichi Daily.
NICK
(impatiently)
They took the gift an hour ago.
The phone rings inside the gate.
A guard picks it up.
JOYCE
(certain it's bad
news)
All's not lost.
There's a famous
temple here.
We could chant.
The guard hangs up, calls out to Joyce.
Joyce responds in
Japanese.
The guard opens the gate.
NICK
We're in?
JOYCE
The cheese...
SUGAI'S COURTYARD
Nick steps out of the house.
He now has one end of a wire
coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other
end around his wrist.
His gun is pressed just beneath
Sugai's ear.
If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.
A handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is
polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.
They spot Nick and
Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.
NICK
Explain to them.
They shoot me,
they kill you.
(Sugai hesitates)
DO IT!
Sugai explains to his lieutenants.
They stand helpless as
Nick walks Sugai toward the car.
NICK
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
ICH
No.
NICK
Not now, man, okay, not now.
Work
with me.
Ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car.
He
gets inside.
Joyce hurries in bedside him.
ICH
You don't know what you're doing.
Nick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over
and shuts the door.
NICK
Start it.
ICH
(terrified)
I can't...
JOYCE
Slide over.
Joyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the
wheel.
Ich gets in on the other side.
She spins the car around.
The gate opens.
They tear off.
CUT TO:
STREET - BEPPU - DAY
The car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot-
springs beneath the street.
It tears down the narrow
block dodging traffic.
Joyce is concentrating hard on the
road.
NICK
(to Ich)
Where's somewhere safe?
Nothing from Ich.
He's still apoplectic.
JOYCE
(angrily)
You came up with the first part.
CUT TO:
KUDAN LOVE HOTEL - BEPPU
A four story concrete hotel, strictly for making love.
"Love Hotels" exist all over Japan.
Each have various
themes:
western, fifties drive in, Star Wars, etc., each
complete with music and lighting effects.
LOVE HOTEL - DAWN
Nick is putting Joyce in a taxi.
He shuts the door.
JOYCE
I still think you're a bastard.
NICK
What if I chant?
JOYCE
Wouldn't help.
(beat)
Watch out for Ich.
He nods.
The cab drives off.
Nick watches her taxi until
it is out of sight, around a corner, then heads inside.
CUT TO:
NICK - LATER
walking into Sugai's room.
Sugai's asleep on the bed.
Ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner, the gun
resting on the table in front of him.
NICK
Better wake him up.
CUT TO:
LOVE HOTEL - LATER
Quiet.
The wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the
parking lot.
INSIDE THE LOVE HOTEL - HALLWAY
A YOUNG GIGGLING COUPLE step out of a door, arm in arm,
and disappear down the hall.
STAR WARS MUSIC from one
room.
HAWAIIAN MUSIC from another.
THE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.
It opens, Kobo
steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.
CUT TO:
SUGAI
wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back
to us, facing out the window.
Drop down to --
THE ROOM BENEATH HIM
A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.
The door burst open.
Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
their arms, step in.
They aim at the ceiling, blasting
into Sugai's room above.
THE GIRL
starts screaming.
The men ignore her and continue to pump
bullets into the ceiling.
KOBO AND HIS MEN
stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the
room.
They make their way down the hall.
A naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly
gunned down.
Kobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room.
TRAIN - DAY
as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to Tokyo.
TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO
It slows into the station.
ROAD - DAY
Flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side
of the road.
We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside
a gas station.
KOBO
(in Japanese)
Yes.
Do it.
NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY
A police car rolls through the service gate.
We see Nick
inside the car along with two police guards.
AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT
The car slows.
Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing
him his papers.
The guard takes a good hard look at Nick.
Time stands still... He waves them through.
Nick can
breath again.
NICK
You know, Ichiro, you just burned
your bridges.
Ich is silent for a moment.
He hands Nick's Beretta back
through the partition.
So it goes.
ICH
Rest.
Nick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.
The
little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road.
DISSOLVE TO:
STREET - BEPUKU - DAY
Nick and Ich are standing outside their car.
The Police
radio crackles from inside.
WHAT THEY SEE:
A large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.
Police
have cordoned off the area.
An empty ambulance is parked
out front with various other cars:
Debonnaire's,
Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball
against the compound wall.
Whatever happened is long
over.
Ich flips off the radio.
ICH
Someone attacked him.
NICK
Now we've got nothing to negotiate
with.
CUT TO:
ROAD - DUSK
The police car streaks across endless fields.
INSIDE THE CAR
Nick is at the wheel.
He rubs the sleep from his eyes.
Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road.
Ich pulls out a cigarette.
Nick lights it for him.
NICK
Joyce told me about your family.
It's tough...
Ich looks up surprised.
ICH
Thank you.
(beat)
You have one?
NICK
A wife.
She left.
ICH
I'm sorry.
NICK
Me too.
Ich glances over at Nick, then back at the road.
Nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the
accelerator.
DISSOLVE TO:
KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN
A small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of
land.
A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a
berm between the flooded rice paddies.
ON NICK AND ICH
sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff.
There's no easy way in.
NICK
Let's go.
Ich hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife.
NICK
What's that for?
ICH
Luck.
Nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket.
NICK
Thanks.
Nick opens up his door and climbs out.
ICH
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
NICK
(stopping)
Why's that?
ICH
Because we're the biggest things to
hit this town since Godzilla.
CUT TO:
THE DIRT ROAD
leading to the house lined with foliage.
The rice paddies
on either side.
CUT TO:
NICK AND ICH
making their way through the waist high water.
TWO WORKERS
with their hoes make their way into the water.
They don't
see our cops.
OUR COPS
making their way along the edge of the road.
The SOUND of
a motorcycle coming.
THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER
slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and
onto the dirt berm toward the house.
He's one of Kobo's
Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo.
The rider comes around the bend to see --
A COP
standing in a uniform.
Ich.
For a moment he doesn't know
what to do.
Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and
accelerates toward Ich.
ICH
stands his ground as the bike closes in.
The biker takes
aim.
Ich drops off to the side as --
NICK
rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he
passes, catching the man across the face.
The rider drops
like a swatted fly.
The biker's momentum carries it a few
yards before it falls and skids to a halt.
Nick hurries to the bike.
Ich drags the biker off the road, then catches up to his
partner.
NICK AND ICH
raise the heavy bike.
Nick mounts.
He takes the riders
helmet and goggles from Ich, and puts them on.
ICH
What are you going to do?
Nick doesn't know exactly.
He taps the bike into gear, it
torques like a mule.
There's a lot more juice here
than he's used to.
Nick fishtails for a minute, then gets the hang of it.
Ich heads off taking another route.
THE HOUSE
Kobo steps out, and not recognizing Nick, raises his hand
to greet what he thinks is one of his men.
ON NICK
bearing down on Kobo.
ON KOBO
as Nick keeps coming.
He is unable to see clearly until
Nick is almost on top of him.
NICK
dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on
Kobo.
Nick and Kobo roll off the narrow porch.
Nick breaks
free.
He isn't fighting fair this time.
He slams his
foot into Kobo's face and ribs.
Kobo tries to get up, but
Nick knees him in the chin.
A woman cries out in Japanese.
Nick turns to see
JOYCE
standing at the top of the steps.
A biker is pressing the
muzzle of a Sig-Saur assault rifle on her.
Kobo's girl is
beside them holding a small pistol.
KOBO
gets to his feet.
The biker tosses Kobo the rifle.
Kobo
works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side.
He has all the time in the world.
Kobo whirls and kicks Nick in the groin.
Nick falls to
his knees in agony.
Kobo towers above Nick as he did in the alley in New York.
KOBO
Still on your knees, Nick?
Kobo walks off, his back to Nick.
KOBO
There's nothing you can do for me
anymore.
I have the plate.
Sugai's
dead.
No there is something.
He walks up to the steps to Joyce.
KOBO
You can tell me who I should shoot
first.
Nick struggles to get to his feet.
Kobo turns and faces
Nick at the foot of the steps.
ICH
appears behind Kobo and takes him down with an amazing
display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training.
He grabs the gun.
A biker bursts out of the door.
Ich
fires, hitting him in the thigh.
He drops his gun.
SUGAI'S DAUGHTER
grabs the gun.
NICK
tackles her, and wrestles the gun away.
She grabs for it.
Nick slugs her.
A GUN BLAST
Ich is hit in the back of his shoulder, falls onto the
porch.
KOBO
the shooter, is holding a pistol -- a Glock 17 automatic.
He fires at
NICK AND JOYCE
who scramble for cover.
KOBO
continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle.
He pops
the clutch and flies off down the road.
Nick fires after
him, but Kobo's gone.
NICK
(to Ich)
You all right?
ICH
Yes...
NICK
(to Joyce)
Call for help.
Nick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged
rocket into gear.
THE ROAD
Rain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.
He
opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a
screaming dot in the distance.
NICK
comes around the same corner.
His bike fishtails and
slides out from under him.
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD
Kobo tears past a police car.
The police car takes off
after him.
THE FOOTHILLS
A series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely
forested hills.
Kobo's bike flies up the road.
The police car can't keep
up, begins losing ground.
THE POLICE CAR
going flat out, falling further and further behind.
Kobo's going to escape.
SUDDENLY
Nick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.
His left arm is
scraped and bloody.
ON KOBO
glancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.
Kobo's
pleased.
He gives it more gas.
NICK
pulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.
The rain
stings his face.
It's hard to keep his eye open.
THE FOOTHILLS
Kobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
peak.
NICK
is gaining on him.
He HEARS something coming up behind
him.
A BOSOZOKU
the one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.
ON NICK
as the biker draws even.
THE BIKER
pulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.
Nick drops back causing him to miss.
The biker drops
back.
Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
him.
He's a good rider, this boy.
Very, very good.
The biker moves in again, blade drawn.
NICK SEES
something the biker doesn't.
A TRUCK
coming around the corner.
NICK
swerves to avoid it at the last moment.
The biker reacts
too late and runs --
INTO THE GLEAMING
radiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
wheels.
ON KOBO
around the bend, glancing back.
Empty road.
He eases up
on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
see
NICK
burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.
KOBO
waits and waits.
Nick draws closer.
Then, Kobo tears off
back down the mountain, shooting past Nick.
Nick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
heading right for the edge of the road.
CUT TO:
NICK'S MOTORCYCLE
flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.
CUT TO:
THE EDGE OF THE ROAD
Nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
arm is probably broken.
He tries to get up with a one arm push up.
It's hopeless.
His head falls into a puddle of water.
The WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.
Kobo has come
back for him.
Nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.
KOBO
bearing down on Nick.
NICK
struggling to get his gun.
Finally he does.
But it's
caked in mud.
If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
Nick has to take the chance.
ON KOBO
Closer and closer.
NICK
aims as best he can and fires.
The mud caked gun explodes
in his hand.
Nick screams in agony.
KOBO
pulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.
Nick
seems to be bleeding everywhere:
his hand, his nose, his
mouth, the side of his head...
Kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
him.
The rain pours down.
He picks up the gun.
Points it at Nick, squeezes the
trigger.
KOBO
(slowly)
Bang... bang...
He tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.
KOBO
... You're dead.
The sound of approaching Police SIRENS.
Kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
road, then swings back.
Kobo guns the engine.
He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
five.
NICK
struggles to get up.
He can't.
KOBO
opening the throttle.
NICK
crawling a few inches, that's it.
KOBO
twenty yards away.
NICK
reaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.
He rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
he races past.
KOBO
screams in pain.
He tries to stop too suddenly.
The bike
flips over.
Kobo flies into the air then hits the
pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
He stops on his back.
It's lucky he's alive.
The SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.
THE PLATE
has fallen out of Kobo's jacket.
It rests in the road,
halfway between the two men.
KOBO
crawls toward it on his belly.
NICK
mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
all fours.
KOBO
crawling snake-like.
NICK
still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.
KOBO'S FINGERS
as they reach for the plate.
NICK
grabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.
Nick
picks up a rock.
It looks as if he's going to smash
Kobo's head.
Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
shattering it in a half-dozen pieces.
Nick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.
NICK
Keep the change.
Nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.
He looks
over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.
Nick makes a
slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
mirror in New York.
Nick passes out.
His eyes shut... the screen...
FADES TO BLACK.
BLACK SCREEN
The SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.
The
SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.
The SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...
FADE IN:
POLICE COURTYARD - A FEW DAYS LATER
A small decoration ceremony.
ON ICHIRO
getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress
uniform.
In the far corner
NICK, JOYCE AND
Ichiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the
ceremony.
CUT TO:

It's raining.
A sun shower.
