  A grungy place - docks for trucks, trash piled in bags...  A 
  door swings open, and Dana comes out.  She s carrying her 
  shoes and staggering.  She s got her jacket over her 
  shoulder, and her shirt is pitted with sweat.

  She takes two steps, then there s a SPLASH.  She looks down.  
  She just stepped in a puddle.  Various disgusting things are 
  floating around in it, including a band-aid.  

  She takes one step towards the street.  Up ahead, she sees 
  Brian get in a cab, drive away.  He sees her and waves.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                First day of work!


  Peter s standing on the sidewalk.  Behind him is a driver 
  waiting on one of those bicycle rickshaws.  A window opens 
  three stories up, and Dana sticks her head out.

                              PETER
                Good morning!  Take a pedicab, number 
                seventy two on your list.  I thought 
                we could go to the Statue of Liberty, 
                knock off two in a day.  What do you 
                say?

  Dana wavers, thinks about it...  The driver on the rickshaw 
  shrugs, gestures to Peter...  Give him a break.

                              DANA
                I m coming down.


  Dana comes out of the apartment, walks over to Peter.  He 
  holds out her list.

                              PETER
                I found this.

                              DANA
                I see.

                              PETER
                I got something for you.

  Peter pulls a small trophy out of a bag, hands it to Dana.  
  She takes it and reads the base.                                                                                    34.

                              DANA
                 Dana Hopkins, Official New Yorker. 
                      (smiles, then looks at figure)
                Wait, what am I doing?

                              PETER
                We didn t have any Official New Yorker 
                statues, so it s a guy playing squash.

                              DANA
                I have been rewarded for my 
                  mediocrity.

                              PETER
                Today, you are an American.
                      (then, gesturing to cab)
                So what do you say?  

  She looks at the cab, her trophy...


  Dana and Peter stand on the deck.  The voice of an overly 
  dramatic TOUR GUIDE comes over the P.A.

                              TOUR GUIDE (V.O.)
                Imagine you ve been on a boat for two 
                weeks.  You do not have a window.  You 
                do not have much food or fresh air.  
                You sleep in tiny hammocks, when you 
                sleep at all.  Then you hear shouts.  
                You run up to the deck and catch your 
                first glimpse of your new home.  Your 
                new country.  And welcoming you?  Lady 
                Liberty!

  And just then, the Statue of Liberty comes into view.  Dana 
  leans over to Peter, whispers:

                              DANA
                Okay, you were right.  It s a little 
                cheesy.

  Peter doesn t answer.  Dana looks up - tears are running down 
  his face.

  Dana slips her hand in his, and they turn and look at the 
  Statue together.

                              DANA (V.O.)
                Great, just when I start to like him, 
                it turns out he s gay.

                              PETER (V.O.)
                Can you get a handie in a rickshaw?

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    35.
