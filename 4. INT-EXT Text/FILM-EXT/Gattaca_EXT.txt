CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.
MORNING.
It is still early as JEROME exits the building's underground
parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and proceeds
down the long straight driveway.
He exchanges a wave with a
GARDENER trimming a lawn.
The whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its
conventional appearance.
GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.
DAY.
JEROME's car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road
leading to the parking lot of "GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION".
A sleek, modern, low-rise industrial compound boasting perfectly
manicured landscaped gardens.
BEACH.
DUSK - THIRTY-ODD YEARS EARILER
A starry sky.
The camera tilts down to find palm trees
swaying against a setting sun.
JEROME (VO)
I was conceived in the Riviera.
Not the
French Riviera.
The camera tilts down further to find a Buick Riviera parked in
a deserted beachfront parking lot on a polluted stretch of
beach.
JEROME (VO)
The Detroit variety.
Through the car's steamed windows we see Jerome's mother and
father, MARIA and ANTONIO, early twenties, making love.
JEROME (VO)
They used to say that a child conceived in love,
has a greater chance of happiness.
They don't
say that any more.
TRACT HOME - BACKYARD.
DAY.
2-YEAR-OLD JEROME (REFERRED TO BY HIS GIVEN NAME OF "VINCENT"
FOR MOST OF THE FOLLOWING FLASHBACK) running with a toy rocket
falls more in clumsiness than fatigue.
MARIA suddenly whisks up
the toddler.
MARIA
(hysterical)
Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let
you out of my sight.
Maria frantically listens to her young son's heartbeat.
For
his part, Vincent appears surprised by the attention.
Maria
places a portable oxygen mask over Vincent's mouth.
JEROME (VO)
I was born Vincent Antonio Luca.
And from
an early age I came to think of myself as
others thought of me - chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose treated
as if it were life-threatening.
HOME.
DAY.
ANTONIO reluctantly shows off his spotless Buick Riviera to a
prospective BUYER.
JEROME (VO)
It meant selling the beloved Buick.
The two men haggle over the price while MARIA, holding VINCENT
in her arms, looks on.
Finally money and a pink slip are
exchanged.
VINCENT (VO)
My father got a good price.
After all,
the only accident he'd ever had in that
car was me.
As the BUYER drives away, Antonio shrugs to Maria to hide his
disappointment.
GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE BUILDING.
DAY.
ANTONIO, MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT exit a packed commuter
bus and enter a Genetic Counselling office building bearing
the sign - "PRO-CREATION".
BEACH.
DAY.
13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON sit together on a
windswept beach.
Anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of
his thumb with the sharp edge.
He hands the shell to Vincent
who hesitantly follows suit.
JEROME (VO)
By the time we were playing at blood
brothers I understood that there was something
very different flowing through my veins.
The two brothers press their thumbs together, merging the blood.
JEROME (VO)
And I'd need an awful lot more than
a drop if I was going to get anywhere.
BEACH.
LATER IN THE DAY.
While ANTONIO and MARIA doze under a beach umbrella, ANTON and
VINCENT enter the water, diving through the waves.
From above
we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other
beyond the breakers.
JEROME (VO)
Our favorite game was "chicken".
When our
parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside
the flags, as far out as we dared.
It was about
who would get scared and turn back first.
Suddenly VINCENT stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the
water, exhausted and fearful.
He watches ANTON swim on into the
distance.
JEROME (VO)
Of course, it was always me.
Anton was by far
the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.
STREET.
NIGHT.
13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT stands at a cul-de-sac at the end of a long,
straight deserted street.
He places a basketball in the middle
of the street to represent the SUN and begins to unwind the huge
reel of string attached to the ball.
11-YEAR-OLD ANTON walks a
pace behind him.
Several yards along the trail a bead is
threaded through the string to represent the planet MERCURY.
ANTON
How many astronauts are there, anyway?
Vincent ignores him and continues to reel out the string.
ANTON
I bet I could be one.
Vincent stops and regards his younger brother with contempt.
VINCENT
You're standing on Venus.
Anton lifts his foot.
There is a bead beneath it.
CAR / SATELLITE DISH.
DUSK.
VINCENT has developed into a handsome 17-YEAR-OLD.
His
spectacles hidden, he and a YOUNG WOMAN are necking in the front
seat of a beat-up car, parked overlooking a huge satellite dish.
JEROME (VO)
I was popular enough until it got around
that I wasn't a long-term proposition.
The love-making intensifies.
The YOUNG WOMAN moves down
Vincent's chest and unzips his fly.
JEROME (VO)
Those who didn't know already could easily
find out for themselves.
It was certainly
no problem coaxing the information out of me.
We remain on Vincent's face as he climaxes.
The YOUNG WOMAN
turns her head away from the spent Jerome and, out of his
view, trickles semen from her mouth into a clear specimen vial.
JEROME (VO)
I didn't blame them.
You need to know if a
prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage
or life insurance or can hold down a decent job.
BEACH.
DAY.
17-YEAR-OLD JEROME walks up the beach to find 15-YEAR-OLD ANTON
sitting with the YOUNG WOMAN Vincent had previously dated.
JEROME (VO)
I didn't blame Anton for his free ride.
You
can't blame someone for winning the lottery.
The Young Woman hastily departs.
LATER the two brothers face each other on the sand.
Anton is
the more statuesque of the two.
ANTON
(cocky)
You sure you want to do this?
Vincent's answer is to walk towards the water.
Anton smiles
mockingly at his brother's grim "game face" and
follows.
From an aerial view we watch VINCENT and his younger brother, ANTON,
swim beyond the breakers.
JEROME (VO)
It was the last time we swam together.
Out into the open sea, like always,
knowing each stroke towards the horizon
was one we had to make back to the
shore.
Like always, the unspoken contest.
We watch the two young men swimming stroke for stroke.
They
swim far out, beyond the point.
Suddenly ANTON starts to slow,
his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the
water.
He begins to sink like a stone.
VINCENT, realizing
Anton is no longer beside him, turns back to lend support.
Vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him
back to shore.
Finally the two boys are coughed up onto the
shallows.
They collapse, just beyond the waterline, exhausted,
gasping for air.
ANTONIO and MARIA arrive on the scene.
ANTON
is the first to recover while VINCENT clutches his side, his
face screwed up in pain.
Maria kneels down and starts to
administer to Vincent but his father, Antonio, is unable to
conceal his anger and contempt for Vincent.
ANTONIO
Vincent, you damn fool!
You could have killed
Anton with your ridiculous contest!
Why should
he risk his life to save yours?!
When are you
going to get it through your thick head--you
can't compete with your brother!
Why try?!
Maria takes Antonio aside.
Anton and Vincent exchange a look.
ANTON
Why didn't you say anything?
VINCENT
Why didn't you?
(staring back at his father knowingly)
It's okay.
It's the way they want it.
JEROME (VO)
It confirmed everything in the minds of
my parents - that they had taken the right
course with my younger brother and the
wrong course with me.
It would have been so
much easier for everyone if I had slipped away
that day.
I decided to grant them that wish.
GATTACA.
DAWN.
A pick-up truck, packed with a CLEANING CREW, pulls into the
rear of the building.
They are no longer strictly the migrant
workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of
ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not
discriminate by race.
As VINCENT exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we
discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to
know as JEROME.
The only visible differences are the glasses he
wears and his hair, still naturally dark.
JEROME (VO)
Like many others in my situation, I moved
around a lot in the next few years, getting
work where I could.
I must have cleaned
half the toilets in the state.
We follow VINCENT through the course of a day.
Cleaning
restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing
windows - gazing at the AEROSPACE WORKERS below.
The building
is part of the Gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch
site.
Throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, Vincent
spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky.
Jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up.
Long after
the sun has set, Vincent is still working.
Another rocket ship
lights up the darkness.
Vincent gazes forlornly into the
heavens.
DAY.
VINCENT cleans a window from the outside, staring in at the
arrogant GATTACA EMPLOYEES entering the security channels -
a smaple taken from their fingertips.
Jerome, in a trance,
constantly cleans the same spot of glass.
He fails to notice an
Older Janitor, CAESAR, appear beside him.
CAESAR
When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't
clean it too well.
VINCENT
(confused)
What do you mean?
CAESAR
(glancing to the Gattaca workers)
You might get ideas.
VINCENT
But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier
for you to see me when I'm on the other
side of it.
Caesar smiles at Vincent's cockiness.
GATTACA.
NIGHT.
While his fellow WORKERS sit on the steps at the service
entrance to Gattaca, passing around an unlabeled bottle of clear
liquor, VINCENT sits some distance away studying his text book.
In the absence of a computer, he practices typing commands on a
keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box.
A tiny, seedy-looking man, GERMAN, forties, appears from
nowhere and takes a seat beside him.
GERMAN
(offering his hand)
Vincent, I'm German--
(anticipating Vincent's response)
That's my name.
He looks the apprehensive Vincent up and down.
VINCENT
What do you think?
GERMAN
(shrugs)
I think I could do something
(glancing to the text book)
provided you know what you're doing
and you can meet the terms.
Vincent pulls a plastic e-money card from his overalls.
GERMAN
You got a photo of yourself?
Vincent produces a snapshot of himself - torn from the family
portrait.
German feeds the snapshot into the pocket-sized
computer he carries.
The picture is instantly scanned and
appears on the computer's small color screen.
German returns
the photograph and hastily departs.
CAESAR, the elderly janitor, notices German's exit.
CAESAR
(to Vincent)
I thought I told you not to get any ideas.
High up the side of a building, washing windows, VINCENT pauses
occasionally to practice typing commands on his cardboard keys -
viewing a screen in his imagination - or the nightsky itself.
He hears his name being called.
GERMAN
Vincent...Vincent...
VINCENT
(staring through his glasses)
German, is that you?
GERMAN
Vincent, come down.
I've found him.
STREET OUTSIDE A BAR.
DAY.
EUGENE, glassy-eyed, strides out of a bar, past camera and into
the street.
We hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud.
GATTACA.
DAY.
JEROME, scarcely able to disguise his delight, exits Gattaca,
trying not to stare at the superb specimens who are now his
"colleagues".
JEROME (VO)
The majority of people are now made-to-order.
What began as a means to rid society of
inheritable diseases has become a way to design
your offspring--the line between health and
enhancement blurred forever.
Eyes can always be
brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body
stronger, a life longer.
Everyone seeks to give
their child the best chance but the most skilled
geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.
In a nearby park MODEL CHILDREN from MODEL PARENTS play
together.
JEROME (VO)
Anyone who is the product of an altered
DNA is proudly referred to as a "DAN",
"self-made man or woman", "man-child".
GATTACA - LANDSCAPED GARDENS.
DAY.
A silicon police tape cordons off the crime scene.
From the
landscaped garden, a crowd of GATTACA EMPLOYEES view the
proceedings through the glass walls.
EMPLOYEE 1
(staring at the Director's body)
Awful.
EMPLOYEE 2
Yeah, awful it didn't happen sooner.
Nervous smirks from nearby employees.
We focus on JEROME.
Standing slightly apart from the others, he does not appear to
share the joke, or perhaps even hear it.
Jerome watches, wide-
eyed, as a DETECTIVE approaches his work station with a mini-
vac.
A chill goes through Jerome as the detective's cleaner
passes over his desk.
Jerome is distracted by a smear on the window, obstructing his
view.
Without thinking, he breathes on the glass and rubs the
smear away with his elbow.
Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR
notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's
eyes.
DIRECTOR JOSEF suddenly appears at Jerome's shoulder.
Standing a pace behind the Director, computer notepad in hand,
is IRENE.
DIRECTOR JOSEF
You're lucky to be getting out of this.
JEROME
We're still going ahead as planned?
DIRECTOR JOSEF
The launch window is only open until week's
end.
Tragic though this event may be, it
hasn't stopped the planets turning.
He glances towards a group of Detectives headed by HUGO.
DIRECTOR JOSEF
You'll have to excuse me, Jerome.
I have to
meet with the authorities--naturally, we're
co-operating in any way, although I won't
tolerate a major disruption.
(as he departs)
I wish I was going with you, Jerome.
As the pair depart, Jerome and Irene exchange a glance.
Irene
is also aware of Jerome's unease.
GATTACA - COURTYARD CAFETERIA.
DAY
A chime sounds over the P.A. follwed by an announcement.
ANNOUNCER (OC)
Thank you for your co-operation.
Please
return to your work stations immediately.
The PROGRAMMERS get to their feet en masse and begin filing into
the work room.
EMPLOYEE 3
(sarcastic aside)
What, no counselling?
SEQUENCING LAB / PARKING LOT.
NIGHT.
The TECHNICIAN returns the envelope to IRENE along with a
miniature compact disc.
TECHNICIAN
(remarking on the profile result)
9.4...very nice.
Irene does not appear to share the technician's enthusiasm.
She emerges from the sequencing lab and enters her car.
Taking
a palm-top computer from her purse, she inserts the disc into
the computer.
Jerome's counterfeit genetic profile appears on
the screen.
The details confirm her worst fears.
MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.
NIGHT.
JEROME and EUGENE, dressed to the nines, pull up in the car
to a darkened doorway in a poorly lit street.
A VALET appears
out of the shadows.
Familiar with the car, he goes immediately
to the trunk to retrieve Eugene's collapsible wheelchair.
Jerome tips the valet - a credit card wiped through a device.
CAR.
NIGHT.
Driving along the freeway, Jerome's car suddenly dives down an
escape road.
EUGENE looks sideways at JEROME.
JEROME
You drive.
CAR.
NIGHT.
The car careens around and around a small circular building -
a cloud of dust billowing up behind the car.
We focus on a
BRICK wedged against the car's gas pedal.
EUGENE is at the wheel, JEROME in the passenger seat.
The hard turn is repeated with increasing recklessness, Eugene
fighting to control the bucking car.
EUGENE
(screaming in both fear and exhilaration)
I gotta stop!!
I gotta stop!!
JEROME
Keep going!!
Keep going!!
Finally the car spins to a halt in a cloud of dust.
When the
dust settles it is revealed that they have been circling the
base of a huge satellite dish in a desolate location.
SATELLITE DISH.
NIGHT.
EUGENE lies on the hood of the car, leaning against the
windshield, drinking from a bottle of vodka.
In the
background, the unmanned satellite dish.
JEROME relieves
himself against the building at the base of the satellite.
EUGENE
(gently chiding Jerome over the joyride)
You idiot.
You could ruin everything
with a stunt like that.
Eugene spies a spacecraft launching from Gattaca city.
EUGENE
(gazing up into the night sky)
At least up there your piss will be worth something.
(smiling at the thought)
You'll all be showering in it, right?
JEROME
(zipping his fly)
And drinking it.
It's like Evian by the
time it's filtered.
EUGENE
(referring to the rocket ship)
What is that one?
Jerome doesn't bother to look in the direction of the craft but
merely glances to his watch.
He joins Eugene on the hood of the
car.
JEROME
(looking at his watch)
11.15 to the port.
A maintenance crew.
EUGENE
How long do you stay up there before you go?
JEROME
A day or so.
EUGENE
(beaming)
I still can't believe they're sending you to
the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be
born, on a mission to discover the origin
of life.
Eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to Jerome.
JEROME
You should be going instead of me.
Jerome taps Eugene's lifeless legs with his foot.
JEROME
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
EUGENE
(glancing heavenwards, shaking his head)
You know I'm scared of heights.
GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - WORKOUT CENTER.
DAY.
Twenty GATTACA EMPLOYEES, identically-outfitted men and women,
run in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake of
the picturesque grounds, never getting any closer to their goal.
They run at a steady 10mph on twenty identical state-of-the-art
treadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a
uniform row facing a floor to ceiling window.
The strain is
beginning to show on many of the faces.
The heartrate of each
employee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the
chest.
Outside in the sunshine the next batch of twenty EMPLOYEES
limbers up in readiness for their physical.
JEROME's only
preparation consists of thoughtfully dragging on a
cigarette while staring out at the man-made lake.
His
nonchalant attitude disheartens nearby colleagues, including
IRENE who is amongst a group of workers excused from the run
by benevolent, over-protective TRAINERS.
TRAINER
You're excused, Irene.
You may resume your duties.
On the way into the work-out facility Jerome stubs out his
cigarette in a stainless steel ashtray.
Only we are aware of
the slim credit card-sized recording device that he furtively
slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand.
As he
takes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the
cordless electrode to his chest, Jerome surreptitiously attaches
his device to the underside of the running machine's control
panel.
GATTACA - GARDEN.
LUNCHTIME.
In Gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens JEROME, dressed and
recovered from his ordeal, joins his COLLEAGUES for lunch at one
of the umbrella-covered tables.
While most of the others pick
at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication,
Jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray.
The sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from
his colleagues.
Jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by
liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat.
However when Jerome looks over towards IRENE, she avoids eye
contact.
When she abruptly gets up and leaves, Jerome follows -
thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby
trashcan.
A janitor reaches for the napkin.
It is the Old
Janitor, CAESAR, from Jerome's former life.
CAESAR
I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.
The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile.
GATTACA - WIND FARM.
AFTERNOON.
A forest of wind turbines, supplying energy to the aerospace
complex.
However the blades of the turbines are motionless in
the still afternoon.
JEROME finally catches up with IRENE.
She
turns, unsurprised by his appearance.
Standing beside her, he
looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view.
JEROME
(eyes fixed on the view)
We were looking at each other.
You stopped.
Irene, also keeps her gaze ahead.
IRENE
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.
JEROME
(shrugging as if it makes
no difference to him)
We were just looking.
IRENE
I know about you.
Jerome turns to her, startled, trying to read her face.
Irene
takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long, dark hair from
her head.
IRENE
(offering the hair to Jerome)
Here, take it.
Jerome, confused, takes the hair - more in reflex than intent.
IRENE
(a challenge)
If you're still interested, let me know.
Jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment, then
deliberately lets it fall to the grounf.
JEROME
(never taking his eyes from her)
Sorry, the wind caught it.
Irene meets his gaze.
There is not a breath of wind.
The
hair lies, plainly visible on the ground.
GATTACA AEROSPACE COMPLEX.
AFTERNOON.
As JEROME and IRENE walk between the wind turbines, Jerome
pretends not to notice that Irene keeps furtively checking the
pulse on her wrist.
They pause in the shade.
JEROME
(as if making conversation)
Have they found our friend?
IRENE
Friend?
JEROME
(shrugs)
It was a mercy-killing after all.
IRENE
They found an eyelash.
JEROME
Where?
IRENE
In the South Wing.
JEROME
Does it have a name?
IRENE
Just some In-Valid.
Vincent--
(trying to come up with the last name)
--somebody.
Jerome turns away to disguise his alarm.
He quickly recovers.
JEROME
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
IRENE
(a smile playing around her lips)
You celebrate, Jerome?
IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.
NIGHT.
The music from the piano recital continues under the following
contrasting action.
A huge, brooding housing project.
PEOPLE
hang around on street corners.
Menace in the air - a feeling of
impending violence.
Suddenly unmarked police cars appear from all directions,
blocking any escape route.
Dozens of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES
pour out of the cars and onto the street.
People scatter, many running straight into the arms of the
Detectives.
OTHERS, spilling out of the housing project, are
also immediately apprehended.
The Detectives quickly weed out those suspects not fitting
Jerome's description - WOMEN, OLD MEN and TEENAGERS.
They are
shepherded off the street.
A line of IN-VALIDS is formed
several hundred yards long.
Detectives begin to laboriously
move along the line, taking finger-prick blood samples from each
suspect - instantly confirming their identities with portable
analyzers worn on their hips.
As if having the idea at the same time, TWO SEPARATE MEN
suddenly bolt from the line, knowing that their blood will
incriminate them.
Other Detectives, watching for such escape
attempts, esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting
police van.
With the raid under control, DETECTIVE HUGO indicates to the
INVESTIGATOR that it is safe to exit his car.
The Investigator
appears irritated, only half-glancing at the TWO MEN already in
custody, apparently certain that neither one is his suspect.
DETECTIVE HUGO
(enthusiastic)
Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.
The Investigator clearly does not share Hugo's enthusiasm.
The
Detective offers the Investigator an age enhanced photograph,
computer-generated from the last existing photo of VINCENT as
a 20-year-old.
DETECTIVE HUGO
This is the age enhancement we're working with.
The Investigator ignores the photo, preferring instead to trust
his own eye as he wanders along the line of suspects.
DETECTIVE HUGO
(referring to the line-up)
As you requested, we've kept the parameters
wider than usual.
The MEN they scrutinize are hardly mutants - the differences
between an IN-VALID and a DAN are subtle at best.
Some shorter,
some wearing glasses, some with receding hairlines or bald, many
with no discernable physical difference at all.
The
Investigator is only halfway down the line before he turns and
starts walking back to his car.
The mystified Detective Hugo follows his superior.
INVESTIGATOR
We're in the wrong place.
We're wasting time.
DETECTIVE HUGO
This is the most likely location--
The Investigator wheels on Hugo, suddenly angry, clearly unused
to having his judgement questioned.
INVESTIGATOR
--There's that word again.
I have a feeling
This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.
Not
exactly a slave to probability.
Is it "likely"
that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for
fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come
to us now like a lamb?
DETECTIVE HUGO
(taken aback by the outburst)
Is there something more we should know about this
suspect, Sir?
I mean besides what's on his sheet.
INVESTIGATOR
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid
have shown up at the scene of four serious
felonies.
Do you need any more than that?
DETECTIVE HUGO
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent
citizens have left specimens at as many crime
scenes.
Maybe he's just unlucky.
INVESTIGATOR
I don't like anybody this unlucky.
(pause)
Widen the sweep.
The West side.
Draw a five mile
radius around Gattaca.
Hoover some of the classier
establishments.
Random car stops.
DETECTIVE HUGO
We're already getting complaints about
frivolous search.
INVESTIGATOR
This is a murder investigation.
The public
should be happy to co-operate, to get this
disease off the streets.
IRENE'S CAR.
NIGHT.
IRENE drives, JEROME at her side.
Cars are being flagged down
by uniformed POLICE OFFICERS.
Irene slows down behind the car
in front.
Spying an OFFICER shine a flashlight in the eyes of
the MALE DRIVER up ahead, Jerome wipes the contact lenses from
his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger window when Irene
is not looking.
An OFFICER approaches Jerome and, without a word, opens an
electronic testing kit worn on his hip.
He removes a sterilized
Q-tip and motions for Jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape
a culture.
Jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth,
feigning embarrassment.
JEROME
(conspiratorial)
Better not.
(nodding in Irene's direction)
Don't want to give you a contaminated
specimen...if you get my meaning.
IRENE plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop.
We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of Jerome's hand as he furtively
retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff.
With the
hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from
his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment.
The cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle
and places it in a receptacle in his kit.
After a short moment
the hair confirms JEROME's driving ID which appears on the kit's
electronic screen.
As the cop departs, Irene looks
questioningly at Jerome.
JEROME
Thanks.
(answering her unasked question)
You never know where those swabs have been.
Irene nods, however clearly not convinced.
She shakes the doubt
from her mind.
IRENE
I want to show you something.
She accelerates away.
We see the road ahead from Jerome's POV.
Without his contact lenses, it is a blur.
OCEAN HIGHWAY.
NIGHT.
With no place to turn the car around, IRENE parks on the cliff
side of the six-lane highway.
In the darkness she dashes from
the car and, without a second thought, runs directly out into
the heavy commuter traffic.
Easily negotiating the on-coming
cars, she emerges safely on the other side of the highway.
JEROME, rounding the car from the passenger side, is about to
follow, when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb.
We focus
on his eyes, deprived of the benefit of their contact lenses.
From Jerome's POV, we see that the headlights rushing towards
him are nothing but a series of fast-moving blurs - blurs that
merge together.
He is unable to distinguish between the
vehicles or judge their distance.
IRENE
(calling back urgently from the
other side, mindful of the light
beginning to leak into the sky)
Come on!
We'll miss it!
Irene stares expectantly back at Jerome with her 20/20 vision,
unaware of his predicament.
Jerome puts a foot off the curb at
the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on-coming car.
Irene is taken-aback at his mistiming.
Does she detect a squint
on Jerome's face?
To Jerome, the figure of Irene on the other
side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels
her expectation.
He touches the spectacles, still in his
pocket, but they are an unthinkable option.
He shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly-
flowing highway.
He makes up his mind - he cannot allow himself
to be shamed, even at the risk of life and limb.
Hardly even
glancing at the traffic, he suddenly bolts blindly across the
road.
Headlights hurtling towards him, cars fortuitously
brushing past his heels, horns blaring.
Jerome makes a final
leap to the haven of the far curb, the rush of air from a large,
fast-moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk.
Irene is stunned by the near miss.
She is about to comment but
Jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes.
JEROME
Come on.
We'll miss it.
BEACH.
DAWN.
JEROME and IRENE huddle beneath an overcoat as the sun crests
the horizon, staining the sky with an ochre blush.
IRENE
What did I tell you?
Jerome nods.
However, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing
but an out-of-focus, abstract ink blot.
IRENE
I envy you, Jerome.
JEROME
You'll be next.
IRENE
I don't think so.
The only trip I'll make
in space is around the sun--
(letting a handful of sand
slip through her fingers)
--on this satellite right here.
Irene turns to Jerome.
IRENE
(blurting out what's really on her mind)
--Listen, I don't want to waste your time
and I really don't want you to waste mine.
I don't know what you're after but I have
a feeling I'm not it.
Irene suddenly takes Jerome's hand and puts it up her
sweater, onto her breast.
Although taken aback, Jerome makes
no effort to withdraw his hand.
IRENE
(enjoying his unease)
It's here.
My heart.
(adding quickly)
I'm careful--weekly check-ups.
I'm on a
drug maintenance program, blood thinners,
diet--
(slowly removing his hand)
I just want you to know what you'd be getting
yourself into.
JEROME
What exactly is wrong?
IRENE
Nothing yet.
I'll start experiencing
symptoms in my late-fifties.
(matter-of-fact)
But unless they come up with something between
now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the
statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.
IRENE
Of course I think about it every day.
JEROME
(still not quite recovered from his surprise)
Of course.
JEROME'S POOL.
MORNING.
JEROME sits at his own poolside in his robe, feet dangling over
the edge, smoking a cigarette.
EUGENE, from his wheelchair, is
applying bleach to Jerome's hair and eyebrows with gloved
hands.
At the same time, Jerome plays a sleight-of-hand game with a
syringe.
EUGENE
How was your evening?
JEROME
Complicated.
I couldn't stop her apologizing.
EUGENE
(teasing)
You are a catch.
No doubt she's worried that
she would lower the standard of your offspring.
Everybody wants to "breed up".
(idly curious)
What's wrong with her?
JEROME
(trying to be blas)
You know how it is with these altered births
--somebody told her she's not going to live
forever and she's been preparing to die ever
since.
EUGENE
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
JEROME
Of course not.
But she's have to know eventually.
EUGENE
(adamant)
She doesn't have to know.
She doesn't want to know.
The camera travels down Jerome's scarred legs to find that the
pool is completely drained.
We now realize that it never
contained water.
A BARREN WASTELAND.
A desolate landscape, resembling the surface of the planet Mars.
We pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding
desert through a circular aperture.
MICHAEL'S CLUB - SIDE ALLEY.
NIGHT.
Spilling out of the exit, JEROME and IRENE find a burly
plain clothes DETECTIVE barring their way.
Before the Detective
can say a word, Jerome has wrapped his fist in his jacket sleeve
and smashed him in the face.
He continues to beat the Detective
until he lies motionless on the ground.
IRENE
(stunned)
Jerome!
Spying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot.
Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate.
IRENE
What about the car?
JEROME
(grabbing her by the hand)
Let's walk.
IRENE
Who are they?
JEROME
(holding his bruised knuckles)
It's not safe.
I shouldn't have brought you here.
Jerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by
moonlight.
Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run.
IRENE
I can't.
JEROME
(anxious)
Come on.
IRENE
My medication.
I left it back there.
JEROME
We'll get it later.
(forcing her to look him in the eye)
Irene, please.
Irene realizes his seriousness.
She begins to run with him.
The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated.
They are only
halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo
look in their direction.
DESOLATE LOT.
NIGHT.
JEROME and IRENE continue to sprint across the enormous vacant
lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and
water.
Just as the gate opens in the distance, Jerome hurls
Irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side.
Irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse.
IRENE
(upset, a strangled protest)
Are you trying to kill me?
Are you?!
Don't you understand, I can't do that!
Jerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse.
JEROME
You just did.
Irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just
negotiated, realizing what she has just done.
From across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing
cry from the center FIGURE.
INVESTIGATOR (OC)
Vincent!
Vincent!
MICHAEL'S.
NIGHT.
The INVESTIGATOR is about to cry out Vincent's name once again
when he realizes DETECTIVE HUGO and the other DETECTIVES are
watching him, askance.
INVESTIGATOR
(to Hugo, covering his frustration)
What are you waiting for?
DETECTIVE HUGO
Where do we start?
INVESTIGATOR
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
DETECTIVE
(handing the Investigator Irene's pill box)
We caught them trying to flush these, Sir.
The Investigator carefully examines the heart pills.
IRENE'S APARTMENT.
NIGHT.
JEROME walks IRENE to the steps of her apartment.
Jerome thinks
about departing but Irene takes him gently by the hand.
IRENE
So sure of what you can't do.
Jerome follows her inside.
A FIELD.
DAWN.
A light shroud of mist hangs over the trees that encircle a
grassy clearing beyond Irene's building.
Something lies in the
center of the clearing.
We jump-cut to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of two or three blades of
grass.
Bristles rain down on the blades.
Withotu access to his
incinerator, the crouched, naked figure of JEROME disposes of
his whiskers, skin and hair in an open field.
His clothes sit
in a neat pile at his side.
He pours glycolic acid over his
body and scrubs at his back, feet and hands with a brush.
There
is a haunted, tortured look in his eyes as he tries desperately
to rid himself of himself.
GATTACA.
MORNING.
JEROME and IRENE walk towards the entrance to Gattaca.
Spying
the Homicide Investigation trucks parked at the rear of the
building and the silhouette of the INVESTIGATOR in the doorway,
Jerome pulls up sharply.
Irene notices his unease.
IRENE
What is it?
JEROME
I forgot something--something at home.
I'll see you later.
Jerome kisses her.
Irene, also aware of the trucks,
interrogates Jerome with her eyes.
IRENE
I'll miss you.
Jerome is still focussed on the entranceway.
IRENE
(looking skywards)
--when you go away.
JEROME
We could go together one day.
Irene considers the idea.
She enters Gattaca alone.
STREET OUTSIDE GATTACA.
DAY.
Outside the entrance to Gattaca, trying to hail a taxi, JEROME
is startled to see a car carrying the INVESTIGATOR, DETECTIVE
HUGO and IRENE roar out of the driveway.
JEROME calls on his
portable wristphone.
CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.
DAY.
The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO emerge from their car with
IRENE in tow.
They take in the impressive complex - the
Investigator gets a glimpse of the empty pool.
They approach
the intercom at the entrance.
IRENE'S CAR OUTSIDE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.
NIGHT.
IRENE, sitting in her car outside Jerome's condominium, hangs up
her portable phone.
In her agitation, her finger involuntarily
goes to her pulse.
She catches herself and removes the finger
from her wrist as if it has burned her.
She exits the car.
BEACH.
NIGHT.
JEROME and ANTON walk down a dune together towards the beach not
far from Gattaca - an ocean beach pounded by an angry, black
sea.
Jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end
of his thumb.
A drop of blood oozes out.
He offers the shell
to Anton but Anton does not take it.
Both men begin to disrobe.
The brothers stand beside each other
on the sand once again - Anton still the more athletically-built
of the two.
Together, they enter the raging surf.
Diving through the
breaking waves, they begin to swim.
In the moonlit night, we watch their two bodies swimming side by
side.
They swim a long distance, Anton waiting for his brother
to tire.
But the pace does not slacken.
Anton pulls up in the
water.
Sensing his brother is no longer beside him, Jerome also
pulls up.
They tread water several yards apart.
ANTON
(attempting to conceal his distress)
How are you doing this, Vincent?
How
have you done any of this?
JEROME
Now is your chance to find out.
Jerome swims away a second time.
Anton is forced to follow
once again.
Angry now, gritting his teeth, Anton calls
upon the same determination we have witnessed during his
constant swimming in the pool.
He puts on a spurt, slowly
reeling in Jerome.
Anton gradually draws alongside Jerome, certain that this effort
will demoralize his older brother.
But Jerome has been foxing -
waiting for him to catch up.
Jerome smiles at Anton.
With
almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again.
Anton is
forced to go with him.
They swim again for a long distance.
It is Anton who gradually becomes demoralized - his strokes
weaken, his will draining away.
Anton pulls up, exhausted and
fearful.
Jerome also pulls up.
However his face displays none
of Anton's anxiety.
They tread water several yards apart.
The ocean is choppier
now.
The view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the
peaks of the waves.
ANTON
(panic starting to show)
Vincent, where's the shore?
We're too far out.
We have to go back!
JEROME
(calling back)
Too late for that.
We're closer to the other side.
Anton looks towards the empty horizon.
ANTON
What other side?
How far do you want to go?!
Do you want to drown us both?
(becoming hysterical)
How are we going to get back?!
Jerome merely smiles back at his younger brother, a disturbingly
serene smile.
JEROME
(eerily calm)
You wanted to know how I did it.
That's
how I did it, Anton.
I never saved anything
for the swim back.
Anton stares at Jerome, aghast.
The two men face each other in
silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling
ocean.
Jerome turns and heads back towards the shore.
Anton is left
alone with the terrifying realization.
The only sound, the wind
and the water.
CONDOMINIUM.
NIGHT.
JEROME, dishevelled and distressed, arrives back at the
condominium.
He notices IRENE standing at the edge of the pool.
She turns.
He approaches her.
They stand several yards apart.
Looking into each other's eyes, they do not speak.
Jerome
abruptly pulls a hair from his head - for once one of his own.
JEROME
(wry smile, offering the hair to Irene)
Here, take it.
Irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.
JEROME
(echoing Irene's words from
their first encounter)
If you're still interested, let me know.
Irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then
deliberately lets it fall to the ground.
IRENE
(never taking her eyes from him, echoing
Jerome's words from their first encounter)
Sorry, the wind caught it.
Once again there is not a breath of wind.
The hair lies,
plainly visible on the edge of the pool.
From an upstairs window, EUGENE observes the couple.
LAUNCHPAD.
NIGHT.
A CLOSE UP of the flame of a rocket's engines igniting - the
ball of fire engulfs the launchpad - filling the screen.
GATTACA - LAUNCHPAD.
NIGHT.
As we have seen so often in the past, a rocket launches into
the sky over Gattaca - however on this occasion it carries
Jerome.
