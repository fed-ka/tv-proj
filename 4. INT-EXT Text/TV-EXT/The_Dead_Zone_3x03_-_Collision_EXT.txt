          A steady rain falls on JOHN SMITH and SARAH BRACKNELL. 
          He's holding his jacket over her so she won't get too
            soaked...they study each others' faces for a beat... he
          kisses her on her raindropped nose, smiles gently...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't I go rent us some old
                        movies for a rainy afternoon...?

          As he moves away, she watches him with love... he glances
          back and sees her one last time - she waves good-bye...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Love you.

          He gets in his car and drives away.



          P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

          The frantic THUP-THUP-THUP of windshield wipers is no
          match for the MACHINE-GUN RAIN punishing the cab roof on
          this epic night; nor for THE MACARENA, which BLASTS at
          top volume from a tinny A.M. radio.

          Then, abruptly, the screen goes DARK and SILENT.  But
          only for a second or two; then --


          P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

          The same view a little further down the same road, and
          the same sounds: WIPERS.  RAIN.  MACARENA.  And then --
          BLACKNESS.  SILENCE.  Just for a beat.  Then we see --


          THE DRIVER

          IN SILENCE.  Late twenties.  Friendly face.  Five-o'clock
          shadow.  And, oh, he's ASLEEP.  A BUMP in the road awakens
          him and we hear WIPERS, RAIN, MACARENA again.  He grabs
          the wheel, straightens out the truck and, and then the
          driver--



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - TEASER - 2/13/04 - YELLOW       2.

          WINKS OUT AGAIN, just for a second this time, to SILENCE --
          his audio P.O.V., so to speak; then he AWAKENS and we
          hear WIPERS, RAIN, MACARENA.



          The truck hauls ass, going screen right to screen left,
          past a yellow sign with a black squiggle and the legend
          SLOW CURVES NEXT 8 MILES.

          SUPERTITLE: June 6 1995.



            A classic seventies Eldorado drives through the same deluge
          on the same night.  It goes screen left to screen right.



          Idealized, overbright rural splendor.  KATY MERCER, 11,
          pretty, swings on a rope swing in front of the picturesque
          Mercer farmhouse.  Each arc of the swing takes her just
          high enough to see -- but not to hear -- her parents,
          JANET, 30, and WAYNE, 33, a mechanic.

          CLOSER.  We see that the parents are arguing.

                                        JANET
                        Just because you're gone doesn't
                        mean the rent went down.

                                        WAYNE
                        I'll have it in a couple days --

                                        JANET
                        And what do I tell the landlord
                        while you're getting your act
                          together?

          REVEAL JOHNNY SMITH, standing there, but not interacting:
          we are, and have been, in a VISION. 

          Johnny watches as Wayne stomps to his car.  (Johnny sees
          that he drives away alone.)

          Johnny looks up to where Katy was; the swing is empty
          now, but still swinging; she's just gone.  He looks in
          the dirt and sees --

          A GIRL'S HELLO KITTY DIARY, dropped below the swing. 

          Day becomes night, and we return to reality --



          Johnny leans on the frame of the swing set (now illuminated
          by police floodlights) and stares at the ground.  Walt,
          Janet and Rebecca stand closest; half a dozen others watch
          from a polite distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was a diary here.

                        Katy's diary?  It's in the house. 
                        I found it here earlier.

                                        WALT
                        We'll need to see that.

          Janet heads into the house.

                        Johnny, you don't have to do this.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Roscoe told me what happened when
                        you touched the earring.

                        Bangor P.D. and the Highway Patrol
                        are working with us.  We have a

          Strobing red lights illuminate the spray of firehoses
            extinguishing the last flames of a fire that has nearly
            destroyed a mobile home; thick white smoke billows into
          the night.

          A second building on the same property is unscathed; a
            firetruck and several patrol cars are parked nearby. 
          Rick's rescue vehicle pulls up and Johnny and Rebecca get
          out, just in time to see --

          Rush into the smoldering mobile home.

          Walt staggers out; soot clings to his face and his clothes. 
          Several hopeful fire fighters look to him for an answer;
          he shakes his head back and forth; he didn't find her.

                        I couldn't see anything.

          Johnny approaches the smoking wreckage and lays a hand on
          a beam.  Nothing: no hit, no whoosh.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's not in there.

          The rescue vehicle is parked at the site of Johnny's car
          wreck on that rainy night in 1995.  Johnny-2004 watches
          as Rick and another paramedic haul his broken body up
          into the emergency vehicle.

          Johnny-1995 is barely conscious; trying to speak.

          A look of terrible pain crosses Johnny's bruised face as
          he's hoisted into the Rescue Vehicle, the doors slamming
          behind him.



          The ambulance pulls to a stop by the side of the road;
          Johnny and Rebecca are exit the rear of the vehicle. 
          Rick joins them.

          It's an eerie night; anything could happen; a light fog
          hanging in the air evokes strangeness and uncertainty.

          Johnny is trepidatious: this is, after all, where the
          worst thing that ever happened to him, happened.

          Once he collapses to the ground, Johnny lies perfectly

          FADE IN:


          Seconds after we left them last.  Johnny lies on the ground
            unconscious, with Rebecca kneeling at his side.  She feels
          for a pulse.

                                        REBECCA
                        I'm not feeling a pulse.

          Rebecca tips Johnny's head back to clear his airway, then
          begins CPR, first with two breaths, then chest
            compressions.

                                        REBECCA
                        C'mon, Johnny... C'mon...
                                (to Rick)
                        Hurry!

          She cradles Johnny's face, pausing before the next breath,
          their lips almost touching as she tries to communicate
          with whatever is left of Johnny's consciousness.

                          Johnny... BREATHE!!

          Another round of breaths and chest compressions, then...


          JOHNNY

          abruptly comes to, eyes popping open, startling Rebecca
          as he suddenly sits up, coughing for air.  Rebecca
          reflexively throws her arms around him.

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny!  Thank God...

                          I thought you were dead.

          Johnny soaks in the hug for a beat, getting his bearings. 
          Rick returns with his kit and a portable defibrillator.

                                        RICK
                        This psychic thing's a bitch,
                        huh?

          Rick gives him a quick checkup.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My whole body was on fire.

          Rick takes Johnny's pulse, checks his pupils.

                                        RICK
                        You went into cardiac arrest. 
                        This ever happen to you before?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  It's the vision.  I keep
                          reliving that night, but I can't
                        see past the fire.  I've got to
                        try again.

                                        REBECCA
                        You've got to stop this, Johnny,
                        before you kill yourself --

                        The man.  The man I kept talking
                        about that night.  He's the key
                        to the whole thing.  If I don't

                        need to see without the pain.

                        from moving forward with their
                        lives by some trauma they've
                          repressed...  I try to help them
                          remember what happened, relive
                        the experience in a safe
                          environment so they can get past
                        it.

                        Can you help me remember that
                        night?  Guide me through it
                          somehow?

                        I don't know.  I can try.  First
                        let's get you back to the hospital.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  The answer is here.  I know
                        it.

                                        REBECCA
                        Fine.  I'll do it.  But first
                        sign of trouble and we go back.

          Off Johnny's nod...

          Rick has moved the truck down to the crash site.  The
          headlights illuminate Johnny and Rebecca as they sit on
          the ground, facing each other.  Rick returns from the
          truck with a portable EKG and finishes hooking Johnny up
          as Rebecca preps him.

          Johnny takes one long last look into Rebecca's eyes, then

          Johnny nods yes.  Rebecca and Rick exchange a quick glance. 
          Rick has the defib paddles fired up -- he's ready too.

          Johnny 1995, is still hanging upside down, when Johnny-
          2004 leans down and peers into the wreck.

                        Oh my God, I'm dead.  I've left
                        my body, I'm dead.

          Johnny-1995 struggles to stay conscious -- to stay alive --
          He unbuckles his seat belt and drops the last few inches
          to the ground, but is still stuck.

                          I can't.  You have to do it
                          yourself.

          Johnny-1995 struggles; extends his arm; pulls himself
          forward, letting out a ROAR of pain as he rips his injured
          leg free -- Johnny 2004 grabs his own leg, as if he too
          can feel the pain.

          black smoke pours out of the hood of the Caddy; it's almost
          ready to blow.

            Johnny-1995, his leg crushed, uses every drop of strength
          left in his broken body to crawl away from the smoldering
            Cadillac; Johnny-2004 remains just out of reach -- yelling,
          coaching him every inch of the way.

          gas tank and pools below.

          Johnny sees Katy's DAD hanging upside-down behind the
          wheel, unconscious.

          draws Johnny to the trunk.  He can hear Katy inside and
          sees her fingers clawing at a small opening.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT FOUR - 2/13/04 - YELLOW    54.



          Half a dozen rescue vehicles gather around the aftermath. 
          As Johnny and Rebecca watch the firemen mopping up from a
          safe distance, they fall silent, wondering what all this
          means.  After a beat an exhausted Walt approaches.

                                        WALT
                        Just heard from the hospital. 
                        Katy and her Dad are going to be
                          alright.

                                        REBECCA
                        So why was she in the trunk?  Was
                        he kidnapping her?

                                        WALT
                        No... she was mad at her mom and
                        wanted to go live with her dad,
                        so she climbed in the trunk when
                        they were arguing.  He never knew
                        she was there.

          Somebody calls Walt from off screen.

                                        WALT
                        I've got to go... Johnny?

          Johnny gets a bear hug from Walt.

                                        WALT
                        Another good day's work.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll send you my bill.

                                        WALT
                        Ms. Caldwell...

                                        REBECCA
                        Good night Sheriff.  Get some
                        rest.

          Johnny and Rebecca watch Walt go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        By the way, thanks.

                                        REBECCA
                        For what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        For saving my life... twice.

                                        REBECCA
                        Twice?  I only performed CPR once.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT FOUR - 2/16/04 - WHT-2     55.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That was the first time.  The
                        second time was when you gave me
                        the strength to save myself.

                                        REBECCA
                        So you were the man you saw the
                        night of your accident?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess my first vision was of
                        myself.

                                        REBECCA
                                (what do you say?)
                          ...that's ...wow...
                                (thinks more)
                        How does...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're asking the wrong guy.

          Their eyes meet.  On an impulse, Rebecca kisses Johnny. 
          It's a small kiss, but it means a lot, and it catches
          Johnny off guard.

                                        REBECCA
                        Thank you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For what?

                                        REBECCA
                        For being who you are.  For showing
                        me that good things can still
                        happen. 
                              (a beat)
                        After Rachel died, I wasn't sure
                        that was possible.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (empathetic)
                        Come here.

          Their defenses long since abandoned to exhaustion, Rebecca
          puts her head against Johnny's chest as he wraps her in
          protective hug.  They watch the sun start to come up across
          the lake, neither of them knowing what lies ahead.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
