      Jimmy is dragged outside by two GROOMSMEN and the GROOM.  
      They throw him to the ground.

                                  GROOM
                    Talk to her again and me and my 
                    boys will mess you up.

                                  JIMMY
                    Who talks like that?

                                  GROOM
                    I m serious, Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                    Fine.  Not a problem.  Enjoy your 
                    sham of a marriage.

      The guys head back inside.  Jimmy gets up.  Immediately 
      lights a cigarette.  Doesn t bother dusting himself off.

                                  GRETCHEN (O.S.)
                    You have another one of those?

      He turns to see Gretchen standing outside with a fresh bottle 
      of champagne, a large wrapped gift on the ground next to her.                                                                                        5.


                                  JIMMY
                    These are pretty expensive.

      She stares at him.  He reluctantly hands her a cigarette.  
      She lights it.  Exhales a thick plume.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Good job taking the bride down a 
                    peg or two on her special day.

      During the following, Jimmy doesn t really look at her, too 
      wrapped up, as he is, in himself.

                                  JIMMY
                    Getting married doesn t remove you 
                    from the burden of having to act 
                    like a human being.  She just 
                    invited me as some backwards way of 
                      demonstrating what I was missing 
                    out on, which, if she d ever 
                    actually paid attention, she d know 
                    would have the opposite effect.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yeah.  Those two are doomed.

                                  JIMMY
                    Right?  Has any couple ever had a 
                    more dishonest start to a marriage?  
                    The balls to have a traditional 
                    Catholic ceremony.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    When she s already had two 
                      abortions.

                                  JIMMY
                    And can only orgasm through anal.

      They are interrupted by GASPS.

      PAN OVER to reveal THE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS OF THE BRIDE 
      standing nearby, horrified.  Jimmy nods.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Mr. and Mrs. Cottumaccio.  Old 
                      Cottumaccios.

      The parents and grandparents quickly head back inside.

      Jimmy and Gretchen immediately return to their conversation, 
      unfazed.  Jimmy finally actually looks at Gretchen.                                                                                        6.


                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    You re pretty.

      Gretchen is used to hearing this, but from him it didn t 
      sound like a compliment.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Thanks?

                                  JIMMY
                    So how do you know her?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I m friends with the sister.

                                  JIMMY
                    You re friends with Fat Lindsay?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yeah, me and Fat Lindsay are super-
                    close.

                                  JIMMY
                    So you must have heard of me.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Vaguely.

                                  JIMMY
                    What d you hear?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Just that you re the worst.

                                  JIMMY
                    Says the girl who just stole a 
                    blender from a wedding.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No!  Shit.  Really?

      She tears at the wrapping paper.  It s indeed a blender.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Crap.  I thought it was a food 
                      processor.

      She heaves the whole thing into the bushes.

                                  JIMMY
                    Who s the worst now?                                                                                        7.


                                  GRETCHEN
                          (shrugs)
                    Yeah, well.

      She blows smoke.  Their eyes meet.  He smiles.  She furrows 
      her brow.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Gretchen storms out onto the roof to find THREE SULLEN 
        AFRICAN-AMERICAN SKATER KIDS (early 20s) smoking pot.  
      Gretchen is the publicist for a breaking hip-hop act, lead by 
      SAM HALTON (AKA  THE PITBOSS ).  Sam is skinny, smart, 
      unpredictable, and prone to depression.  The other two guys, 
      SHITSTAIN and HONEY NUTZ, watch something on a phone, sharing 
      earbuds.  Sam sees Gretchen.  Puts his hood on.  Sulking.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    What the crap?!

                                  SAM
                    You know I get nervous at these 
                    shits.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You re paying the guy to take your 
                    photo and you trash his studio?

                                  SAM
                    You weren t here!  Unprofessional 
                    as fuck.  A publicist who can t 
                    show up at publicity events.  Don t 
                    even know what I m paying you for --

                                  GRETCHEN
                    The label pays me.                                                                                        20.


                                  SAM
                    You know it all gets charged 
                    against my end, bitch!  Label is 
                    villains.  From now on I m just 
                    gonna drop free mixtapes and 
                    fuckin  Vines of my guinea pigs.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You need to go apologize to Nestor 
                    so he doesn t sue you.

                                  SAM
                    Let  im.  I ll lawyer the fuck up.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Nestor s a great photographer.  We 
                    need him.

                                  SAM
                    Anyone s a good photographer now.  
                    Shitstain take amazing Instagrams.

      Shitstain nods.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Anyway, bitch, this is your fault!  
                    You apologize to him for being such 
                      a no-showing-up bitch.

      Gretchen stares at Sam.  Sam stares back.  A showdown.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Gretchen knocks on the door of a nice place with a killer 
      view.  The door opens.

      ANGLE ON GRETCHEN.  She smiles.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Hey you.

      REVERSE ANGLES TO REVEAL: TY WYLAND, 45, rugged, intense, 
      smiling.  He s wearing yoga pants and a deep-v over his 
      chiselled, hairy chest.

                                  TY
                    Kiddo.  What a surprise.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I was just in the neighborhood.

      Gretchen s manner with Ty is quite different than with Jimmy.  
      Almost supplicant.  Talks quieter.  Her light dimmer.

                                  TY
                    I have an early call time.  But... 
                    yeah, come in.

      He opens the door for her.

                                  TY (CONT D)
                    The last time you said you were 
                    coming over, you never showed.  I 
                    thought you d grown sick of me.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Nah.  You re all right.

      Ty touches her face.  It feels like a rehearsed moment.

                                  TY
                    You re so beautiful, Gretchen.

      Gretchen frowns.  Normally she d be flattered.  To end the 
      disquieting feeling, and, by way of reply, she kisses him.                                                                                        27.


      Ty quickly looks outside to make sure no one saw her come in, 
      then shuts the door behind her.

                                                                            CUT TO:
