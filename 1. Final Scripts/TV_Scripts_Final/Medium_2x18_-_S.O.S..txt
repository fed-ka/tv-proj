                                          TEASER

    A  PREVIOUSLY ON MEDIUM  RECAP TAKES US BACK TO LAST YEAR S 
  EPISODE  S.O.S.  - IN WHICH ALLISON FOUND HERSELF PITTED 
  AGAINST A SERIAL KILLER WITH THE ABILITY TO PICK UP THE 
  PSYCHIC DISTRESS SIGNALS SENT OUT BY PEOPLE IN JEOPARDY...WE 
  SEE THE VARIOUS MURDERS COMMITTED BY THE S.O.S. KILLER (WHOM 
  WE HAVE NAMED  SONNY WAYNE  IN THIS EPISODE)...ALLISON S 
  GROWING AWARENESS OF HIS PSYCHIC GIFT...AND FINALLY, THE 
  PHONE CALL, FROM THE KILLER TO ALLISON, IN WHICH HE CONFRONTS 
  HER WITH THEIR SHARED PARANORMAL ABILITY...

  ...AND OFF THE FINAL SCENES, AS ALLISON SENDS THE POLICE 
  AFTER S.O.S. BASED ON ONE OF HER DREAMS...

  FADE IN:

  AS A SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE PUTTERS ACROSS THE VAST SKY11

  ...a mite among huge, billowing clouds...the sound of the 
  plane s engine is a tinny rattle in the big blue-and-white 
    expanse...and over that, and the sound of the rushing wind, 
  the voice of a man we will come to know as KEN...

                              KEN (O.S.)
                Would you please stop rooting around back 
                there?  I need to talk to you...

  INSIDE THE PLANE22

  ...a nervous-looking Ken (45), with sunglasses and a khaki, 
    multi-pocketed vest and a tinge of a Texas accent, looks back 
  to address his girlfriend, AMY (23), cute and playful in a 
    home-fried southern girl kind of way, as she digs through 
  some duffel bags in the back seat of the plane...

                              AMY
                I could have sworn I packed some candy 
                bars for the trip.

                              KEN
                For the love of god, Amy...would you 
                please stop that...I need you up here...

  Amy looks up from the back seat, puts a hand on Ken s 
  shoulder, Cheshire cat grin spreading across her face...

                              AMY
                Why don t you come back?  Join the mile-
                high club?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      2.

                              KEN
                      (shaking his head)
                 Cause I don t have an autopilot?

                              AMY
                All right, all right...I m coming...

  ...Amy gets into her seat and turns to look at her boyfriend, 
  who looks a little sweaty and agitated...

                              AMY
                Geez, Ken, you look a little on edge, are 
                you OK?

  ...Ken smiles, but it s true, there is a definite hint of 
  nerves in his voice...

                              KEN
                Yeah...I gotta admit, I am a little 
                  anxious...

                              AMY
                Why?

                              KEN
                  ... cause I was kind of hoping 
                  that...when we land in Las Vegas...

  ...Ken fumbles around his vest, finally producing a small 
  jewelry box.

                              KEN
                ...that maybe you d like to become my 
                wife.

  Amy s face turns into that unmistakable DeBeer s commercial 
  mask of surprise and joy as she opens the box to see the 
  large rock inside.

                              AMY
                  Ohmygod...oh.  My.  God.  I will 
                  absolutely marry you...
                      (finding the words)
                ...it s so beautiful...a princess cut on 
                  a platinum band...just like in my 
                  dreams...

  ...and as she speaks...

  ...his sweating getting more and more profuse as his 
  breathing becomes ragged...

                              AMY
                ...this is just such a wonderful 
                  day...quick: what time is it?

  Ken looks at his watch...

                              KEN
                  It s...ten nineteen...

  ...and as she speaks, Ken clutches his left wrist, an intense 
  pain building in his arm, radiating from his chest...

                              AMY
                ...ten nineteen.  The exact time I 
                decided to become your wife!

                              KEN
                Amy...

                              AMY
                I love you, Ken, I love you so...  
                      (then, off his now-obvious 
                        suffering)
                ...Ken?

                              KEN
                  I...can t breathe...

  ...and with that, Ken slumps forward - ramming the plane s 
  yoke into the dashboard...the plane lurches into a steep 
  angle, sending Amy CAREENING forward as we...

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  THE PLANE33

    ...pitching, head first back to earth...as...

  AMY44

  ...wrestles herself into her seat and grabs the yoke as we...

  SCAN FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE DASH

  ...to show the multitude of gauges, dials and indicators: 
  going crazy as the plane SPIRALS out of control as Amy 
  SCREAMS her head off...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      4.

                              AMY
                Somebody help me!  Somebody!

  ...and finally, a VOICE chirps from the radio...

                              VOICE
                Do you have a call sign?  Repeat.  Do you 
                have a-

                              AMY
                  I don t...I DON T KNOW HOW TO FLY!  
                Please help me please!

  ...the Radio voice CHIRPS on again...but it s useless... 
    garble...she is losing the battle against the plane s 
    controls...the engine s usual drone becomes a more and more 
  desperate BELLOW of mechanical struggle and we...

  ANGLE ON THE WINDSHIELD - OVER AMY S SHOULDER

  ...where the horizon line vanishes, replaced by the ground 
    below...coming at us, fast and inevitable...

  ...and then, for a brief moment...a BUILDING APPEARS DEAD 
  AHEAD...a blur streaking toward the plane...and then...

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  BLACK55

  ...as we hear the sickening CRASH: the sound of buckling 
  metal, breaking glass and lives ending fills the darkness...

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  EXTREME CLOSE UP66

  On Allison s eyes, SNAPPING open...and as she tries to get 
  her breath back...

  FADE IN:

77ON JOE 

  ...stepping out of the BATHROOM wrapped in a towel, rummaging 
  for his clothes as Allison perches on the side of the bed 
  beside an open phonebook, her face stuck to the receiver of 
  the bedside phone as she navigates what appears to be an 
    exasperating conversation...

                              ALLISON
                I don t know if it s a Cessna or a 
                  Mooney...no, I don t know if it s a 
                  Beechcraft either...

  ANGLE ON THE PHONEBOOK

  ...open to a page on regional airports...

                              ALLISON
                ...yes, single engine, like you said - 
                with the propeller up in front.  Look, I 
                know the information I have is pretty 
                sketchy but all I m asking is that you 
                alert your manager to keep an eye out for 
                  a couple: a man in his forties named 
                 Ken  and a woman in her...it s a little 
                plane with four seats, what s so -

  ...then, off the CLICK of a hang up on the other end...

                              ALLISON
                What is wrong with these people? 

                              JOE
                What happened?

                              ALLISON
                That s the third airport I ve called and 
                they all just treat me like I m crazy.  
                This guy hung up on me.

                              JOE
                OK, that s pretty rude but...you 
                  know...you gotta admit...

  ...Joe s voice trails as he pulls on a pair of pants and 
  Allison rears up on him...

                              ALLISON
                What do  you gotta admit,  Joe?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      6.

  ...Joe regards Allison, treading lightly but steadily...

                              JOE
                That it s kind of a tough sell...asking 
                an airport to put out some kind of an 
                advisory for a plane you can t describe, 
                piloted by a man and a woman you can only 
                identify by first name because...

  ...Joe regards Allison as he speaks, keenly aware of her 
  growing annoyance at his picking her apart...

                              JOE
                ...and this part you can t tell 
                  them...you know that he s going to have a 
                heart attack during a flight for which 
                you don t have a date or a location.

    ...Allison taps the phone book, looking for another number, 
  not bothering to conceal her annoyance...

                              ALLISON
                Well, forgive me for wanting to save some 
                lives.

                              JOE
                Allison.  It s seven-thirty in the 
                morning and you have children who need 
                you and a job to go to at the District 
                  Attorney s office, protecting innocent 
                people from dangerous criminals whose 
                names and addresses you actually know - 

                              ALLISON
                  Seven-thirty?

                              JOE
                ...like I said...

  Struck, Allison springs up and heads for the bathroom...

  - oh no -
                                              What?

                I m supposed to meet the District 
                Attorney early today - I m gonna be 
                  late...would you mind...

                Dropping the kids off at school?  Making 
                sure they have their breakfast? 

    ...Allison pokes her head out the bathroom door and kisses 
  Joe on the lips...and she lingers, then...

                              JOE
                I d be delighted to.

  ...then, as she ducks back in and starts the shower...

                Good lord, I m easy.

                              ALLISON (O.S.)
                I called some of the local airports, and 
                got a couple of people on the line...

  INSIDE THE CAR99

    ...Devalos steers, listening patiently...

                              ALLISON
                ...but they weren t exactly helpful.

    ...Devalos opens his mouth, but Allison is there already...

                              ALLISON
                I know, I know.  It s far-fetched.  And I 
                don t know what kind of a plane it was.  
                Or its call sign.  Or the date of the 
                crash.  Or the location...

                I was going to say that I believe you.

                              ALLISON
                Oh.

                I was also going to say that maybe...when 
                we get back...you can sit with an artist 
                and make sketches of the people you saw 
                in the plane...we can put them out to 
                regional airports, say they re persons of 
                interest in an investigation, if they 
                file a flight plan or somebody spots 
                them...

                              ALLISON
                What if they re flying in from out of 
                town?  Or if it s gonna happen a year 
                from now?  Or -

    ...Devalos turns to look at Allison, the patient look on his 
  face not quite complemented by his tone of voice...

                              DEVALOS
                I was hoping you d say thank you...

                              ALLISON
                        (remembering herself)
                Thank you.

                              DEVALOS
                ...and that I could get you to focus on 
                the task at hand.  We re about to walk 
                into a meeting with Sonny Wayne and I 
                need you on your game.

                              ALLISON
                On my game?

                              DEVALOS
                We apprehended Sonny Wayne because of 
                  information you gave us...because you 
                were having the same dreams he was.  
                Maybe I m just being superstitious, but 
                when we got a call that he wanted to 
                confess to another murder, I figured I 
                should have you with me.  

                              ALLISON
                What do you want me to do?

                              DEVALOS
                Just keep your eyes open.  He s saying he 
                killed Debbie Jacobson.

  Allison processes this...the name resonates with her...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      9.

                Debbie Jacobson.  So in addition to all 
                those helpless women he raped and 
                  strangled, he s also saying he abducted 
                and killed a real estate mogul s daughter 
                three years ago?

                              DEVALOS
                The Mayor and all his little helpers are 
                all over this.  I think I finally got on 
                DiNovi s speed dial.  Lucky me. 

                              ALLISON
                It doesn t make sense.  He s serving 
                three life sentences...why confess?

                              DEVALOS
                Actually it does.  The Amarillo P.D. 
                cracked a cold case based on our DNA 
                samples of Sonny Wayne.  Now they want to 
                  extradite him for trial and he s been 
                doing everything he can to fight it...
                      (connecting the dots)
                ...so if he actually killed Debbie 
                Jacobson and can lead us to the body, we 
                close a high-profile unsolved case...and 
                in exchange, we keep him from being sent 
                to Texas, where they do tend to pursue 
                the death penalty a little 
                  more...zealously.

  ...and off Allison...

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:

                And how are your dreams, Allison? 

                              ALLISON
                None of your business.

                              SONNY WAYNE
                I m sorry you feel that way.  I don t get 
                a lot of visitors, much less ones with 
                whom I share so much.
                      (then)
                Every night, I see them...all those 
                helpless people who get in over their 
                  heads...find themselves in danger...their 
                souls sending a call out there...hoping 
                for someone to find them...rescue them.

                              ALLISON
                Must be frustrating for you.

                              SONNY WAYNE
                You don t know the half of it.

    ...Devalos steps up, taking charge of the meeting...

                              DEVALOS
                I d like to get started.  Are we waiting 
                for your legal representation?

                              SONNY WAYNE
                No.  I fired my lawyer after the third 
                  consecutive life sentence.

                              DEVALOS
                Then get on with it.  You have something 
                to confess, we don t have a lot of time. 

  Devalos pulls out a chair as Allison sits, taking a legal pad 
  from her briefcase and placing it on the conference table...

                              SONNY WAYNE
                You sound nervous, Mr. District Attorney.  
                I can hear it in your cadence...Arizona 
                born but when the pressure kicks in, that 
                little bit of your parents  native

                ...I remember noticing that during your 
                cross examination.

                              DEVALOS
                Tell us what we came to hear.

                              SONNY WAYNE
                I met Debbie Jacobson at a border bar 
                  frequented by Mesa University kids road-
                tripping for cheap booze.  She was more 
                than a little drunk and I was more than a 
                little charming.

                              ALLISON
                You met her.  You didn t find her the way 
                you did your other victims?

                              SONNY WAYNE
                Raised in Oklahoma.  Right?  I never got 
                a close listen to your voice...the one 
                time we spoke...but there it is, 
                  diphthongization of short vowels and all.

                              DEVALOS
                Did you become Henry Higgins in the 
                prison library or was it always your 
                other hobby along with serial murder?

  Sonny lets the question hang there, then...

                              SONNY WAYNE
                It s how I charmed little Debbie.  I 
                sidled up to her at the bar and mentioned 
                that she had the cutest little Arkansas 
                twang to her voice...my guess is the 
                  councilman and his wife moved to Phoenix 
                when she was young.

                              ALLISON
                Where did you bury her body?

                              SONNY WAYNE
                Now that s the end of the story, Miss 
                  Dubois...I m still at the beginning.

  ...Sonny shoots them a smug glare...and off Allison and 
  Devalos, realizing that they are going to be here a while...

                  Absolutely, Ms. DiNovi...we do have a 
                  confession...a very full confession, and 
                the moment the police have completed 
                their investigation of the alleged burial 
                  site...and if they find a body...you ll 
                be the first to know...no, thank you.
                      (clicking off)
                I swear, that woman must have me bugged.

  ...but Allison s thoughts are elsewhere...

                              DEVALOS
                  Something bothering you?

                              ALLISON
                I just have this feeling like he s 
                  lying...he s telling it like it s his own 
                memory, but I didn t get the sense that 
                he lived it...

                              DEVALOS
                        (considering)
                It is possible that he heard the story 
                from another inmate.

                              ALLISON
                ...or that he saw it in a dream.

                              DEVALOS
                      (not quite ready to go there)
                Either way.  He may be leading us 
                  somewhere...and if we find Debbie 
                  Jacobson, that s one step closer to 
                closing this thing than we were before.
                      (making up his mind)
                I m going to block the extradition for 
                the time being and hope we get a body out 
                of this.

                we don t get this one right there will be 
                more than egg on our faces.

  inside.

                Hey, don t shoot the messenger.

    ...Allison lets herself drop back on the bed...

                              ALLISON
                I don t understand...there s been no 
                calls to the police...nothing off the 
                  sketches...I ve called every regional 
                airport in the state...

                              JOE
                It s been a week, Allison.

                      (finally hanging up)
                So?

  ...Joe shrugs...isn t it obvious?  She shoots a look back at 
  him - it isn t...so he explains...

                              JOE
                So maybe your couple showed up at one of 
                these airports...maybe they saw the 
                sketches on a bulletin board somewhere, 
                and got so creeped out that you used your 
                  influence to have them declared persons 
                of interest in a nonexistent criminal 
                  investigation that they decided never to 
                fly again.

                              ALLISON
                That s not funny.

                              JOE
                      (sliding into bed)
                No, but it s possible.  You dreamt this a 
                week ago, and the plane hasn t 
                  crashed...maybe you stopped it and you 
                don t even know it.

                              ALLISON
                Why would the universe torture me like 
                that?

                              JOE
                As opposed to the myriad of other ways it 
                tortures you?  How would I know?
                      (nuzzling closer)
                Get some sleep, baby...we have the whole 
                rest of our lives to wait for this plane 
                to crash.

  Joe turns on his side, and off Allison, seeing the reason in 
  his argument, and reaching out to turn off the light...

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:

                Hey.  Sonny.  You have any action on the 
                game last night?  Navahos handed the 
                Wildcats their asses.

                              SONNY WAYNE
                I don t bet anymore.  Got other things to 
                look forward to.

                              LUKE
                Like what?  All you ve done all week is 
                come out here and crouch in that exact 
                same spot, looking at your watch.

  Yep.*

                Let s just say, I d stay clear from the

                              LUKE
                Man, what are you...

  ...but before Luke can finish, the sky FILLS with a familiar 
  sound...the DOPPLERING BELLOW OF A PLANE ENGINE...coming 
    closer...a few of the prisoners look and point to the 
    sky...Luke follows suit...but not Sonny...

  MOVE IN TIGHT ON SONNY S FACE

    ...concentrating on his watch with absolute focus and 
  certainty as the CLAMOR of the other prisoners, all scanning 
  the sky just beyond the wall grows around him...as does the

  CRASH!

                to crash into the prison...he must have 
                  recognized the building.  They were gonna 
                  extradite him to Texas, so he lied about 
                killing Debbie Jacobson...so that we 
                wouldn t send him to Texas before he got 
                his chance to use the crash to escape.

                I m not at liberty to discuss the 
                  particulars, but it is crucial that you 
                initiate an immediate lockdown, and that 
                you evacuate your perimeter at once.

                You need to do this, Warden, I ll take 
                full responsibility, and in conjunction, 
                I would also appreciate it if you could 
                locate inmate number 16309 and place him

                Sonny Wayne knew.  He read the dream well 
                enough to do everything he could to be 
                  there...at the right place at the right 
                  time...when the plane crashed.  He 
                noticed things I didn t...or couldn t...

                              DEVALOS
                Like their accents?

  ...but before Allison can reply, Scanlon enters the office...

                              SCANLON
                Hey.  We just went over Sonny Wayne s 
                  cell...we found his clothes and linens, 
                his mattress, all doused with rubbing 
                  alcohol...apparently, he also switched 
                clothes with another inmate before he 
                went out on the yard this morning.

                              DEVALOS
                To throw off the dogs?

                              SCANLON
                I would assume.  He planned for this 
                  escape...and there s something else you 
                need to see.

                                                                              CUT TO:

  A SERIES OF BOOKS2121

  ...at least two dozen, all in clear evidence bags - laid out 
  on the CONFERENCE ROOM table...the titles all share something 
  in common as Devalos ticks them off...

                              DEVALOS
                The Scientific Foundations of E.S.P., 
                Psychic Phenomena in the Real World, The 
                Uses and Control of Paranormal Ability...

    ...Allison shakes her head as she scans the table, taking in 
  the sheer volume of reading material...

                              SCANLON
                It s like he s been studying.

                              ALLISON
                You found these in his cell?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      24.

    ...Scanlon indicates a second series of evidence bags, 
  holding several stacks of black and white composition 
  notebooks (the generic grade school-type notebooks with the 
  black marble pattern on the cover)...

                              SCANLON
                It s all he had.  Clothes...all these 
                psychic books...and the notebooks.  
                      (favoring Allison)
                Given your history with Sonny Wayne, I 
                thought it might be useful for you to 
                look through these, see if you have any 
                insight.

  Allison picks up one of the bagged notebooks...pulls it out 
  of the evidence bag...looking through the pages...reading... 
  and as she does we...

                Now why would your friends do that?

                                BRIDGETTE
                Because of the bad man.  What if they

                Oh really?   Cause we were talking about 
                Sonny Wayne at school, and Heather s mom 
                read a book someone wrote about him, and 
                she said that there was this one girl 
                that he took out into the woods and -

                They can see at night.  So you worry 
                about the important things - like having 
                enough brownies for your friends - and 
                let the cops worry about the bad man, OK?

                                BRIDGETTE
                OK.

                              JOE
                Now take Marie to bed.

  Joe turns to Allison as Bridgette complies.  Once she s out 
  of earshot, Allison lets her true colors out...

                              ALLISON
                That was very reassuring.

                              JOE
                You lie.

                              ALLISON
                You know...most prison breaks...when it s 
                a weird opportunistic thing...they 
                usually have everyone rounded up within 
                six hours.  I mean...where is he hiding?  
                He s one man.  On foot.  In an orange 
                  jumpsuit, how hard can he be to find?

                              JOE
                I don t know...if he caught a break, he s 
                probably halfway to Mexico by now.

  Allison turns to the dishes, her mind swimming in frustration 
  and anxiety as Joe steps in to load the dishwasher...

                              ALLISON
                You should have seen his journals...it s 
                like he was preparing for this.  Trying 
                to figure out how to be better at reading 
                his own dreams.  He wrote everything down 
                to the last detail, he was obsessive and 
                    methodical...being in jail made him even 
                more focused...he sat in that cell for a 
                year, getting these dreams, seeing all of 
                these people who were alone and 
                  afraid...every one a potential 
                  victim...people he would have gladly gone 
                out and murdered...only he couldn t...and 
                it frustrated him.

  Joe regards Allison, sensing her growing unease with this

  world and not knowing the extent of his abilities...

                You think he s going to do it again.

                              ALLISON
                As soon as he possibly can.  It s a 
                  compulsion.

  Joe regards Allison silently, the gravity of her words not 
  lost on him as he puts the last glass in the dishwasher...

  holding a mini maglite, trying to locate the cat...

                              YOUNG WOMAN
                Quincy!  Get down here, Quincy!

  ...but the cat isn t coming down anytime soon...so the woman 
  puts the flashlight in her mouth and starts climbing the 
    tree...mumbling curses through the flashlight clenched in her 
  teeth as she struggles to get her foothold on the trunk...

  ...and then she takes a bad step...slipping off the 
  trunk...and WHOOMP!  The young woman hits the ground, landing 
  on her ankle with a sickening CRACK.

                              YOUNG WOMAN
                Oh god...oh god...

  She tries to stand, but the pain is too great, and it sends 
  her hands to her ankle...cradling the shattered joint...and 
  as she falls back to the ground...

                              YOUNG WOMAN
                Oh god...ow...
                      (looking around)
                ...Is there anyone here?  Help!

  ...and off her cries for aid...

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:

    ...ALLISON STARTS UP IN BED AGAIN...2626

  Another dream?
                                                You re awake.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)"This Time It's Personal"    1st Draft(White)           1/17/07      31.

                              JOE
                You ve been twitching the last ten 
                  minutes...what was it?

  Allison bounds out of bed, putting the pieces together...

                              ALLISON
                  A girl...she was trying to get her cat 
                down from a tree and she fell...

                              JOE
                Did you see any landmarks...buildings or -

                              ALLISON
                Just these woods...it was dark and there 
                were trees everywhere...

                              JOE
                Like one of the State Parks or something?

                              ALLISON
                I don t know...I know the damn cat s name 
                is Quincy, but that s it!

                              JOE
                Allison.  It s late and -

  Allison SNAPS Joe off at the bud...she is on the edge about 
  Sonny Wayne and Joe s well-meaning, and accurate, skepticism 
  is nevertheless rubbing her the wrong way...

                              ALLISON
                - and there s people out who are going to 
                die because I can t figure this out!

  Joe gets out of bed and turns on the light...if they re going 
  to have this argument, and it looks like her emotions are up 
  and running, he might as well be up on his feet for it...

                              JOE
                Then if he is having the same dreams 
                you re having...if...there s no way he 
                can figure it out either.

                              ALLISON
                If that was true, he wouldn t be out of 
                  prison...he had the dream about the plane 
                  crash...he figured it out when I 
                  couldn t...now god knows what he s going 
                to do if I can t keep up.

                You can t take all of this on yourself.  
                You put the guy away once already, you 
                have to trust that the police -

                              ALLISON
                What are you gonna tell me, Joe, that the 
                cops can see at night?  I m sorry, that 
                may work with Bridgette, but it s not 
                gonna cut it for me, not now.

  ...and before Joe can respond...

  RING!

  ...the PHONE.  Joe and Allison exchange glances.  RING!  Joe 
  reaches over, but Allison springs for the night table, 
  beating him to it, and clicks on...

                              ALLISON

  SONNY WAYNE, SEEN ONLY IN CLOSE UP2727

  ...a cell phone stuck to his ear, the rest of his environs 
  shrouded in darkness...

                              SONNY WAYNE
                Hell of a tough situation...that poor 
                woman with the cat and the broken 
                  ankle...I don t think she s getting up 
                any time soon...

  And it s everything Allison can do to control her emotions...

                              ALLISON
                Don t you dare - 

                              SONNY WAYNE
                All right.  Maybe I ll just go after the 
                nurse in the elevator...

  ...Joe shoots Allison a look...she points to the phone, puts 
  her hand on the microphone and whispers...

                              ALLISON
                It s him.

      (a whisper to Allison)(whispering back)
  Sonny Wayne?Call Scanlon.

    ...Allison nods...Joe reaches for Allison s purse and pulls 
  out her cell phone...as he searches the speed dial...

                              ALLISON
                What do you want?

                              SONNY WAYNE
                You know what I want...and you ve made it 
                so hard.  Cops everywhere, my mug-shot in 
                all the newscasts...I had to pay a 
                homeless guy twenty five bucks to buy me 
                this cell phone.

                              ALLISON
                Where did you get the money?

                              SONNY WAYNE
                      (a chuckle)
                Nice try, bitch.  Let s just say...I have 
                a nice place and plenty of time to sit 
                and dream...and, of course, the one perk 
                to having the whole city in anxiety over 
                my escape is that the dreams are coming 
                fast and furious...so many people afraid 
                that I m gonna come out of the shadows 
                and do unspeakable things...

                  understand why a woman with your figure

                There s the rub.  I have my dreams...you

                How about you get out of town a few 
                  days...go somewhere so far you can t

                              ALLISON
                I don t think so.

                              SONNY WAYNE
                Too bad.  I d hoped we could reach an 
                  accommodation...because I know you re 
                  afraid...I know where you live...and I 
                know you have a daughter named

  FADE IN:

  ON BRIDGETTE, ARIEL AND MARIE2828

    ...sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE with Joe and Allison.  But 
  breakfast isn t on yet: this is a family meeting...but, 
    strangely, we can hear the faint sound of a POLICE RADIO 
  somewhere in the background...  

                                BRIDGETTE
                Are we going to have to leave our house?

                              ALLISON
                No, we aren t leaving our house, this is 
                just going to be a little while.

    ...Ariel s tone makes her distaste for this situation clear 
  as she looks out the kitchen window...

                              ARIEL
                Can I get ready for school?

                              JOE
                  Actually, we think it may be better if 
                you stay home from school today.

  ANGLE ON THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR

  ...to show several UNIFORM COPS standing on the patio outside 
  - the source of the radio noise - talking to Scanlon...

  RESUME ON ARIEL

                              ARIEL
                We can t go to school?  What about dance 
                  practice?  I m on a committee at student 
                  government, we re supposed to -

                You re just going to have to skip out for 
                the time being.  It s not permanent.

  ...Ariel shoots her parents a dubious look, but knows enough 
  to be quiet when her father puts on that tone of voice...

                today and tell them we ll have it 
                sometime later.  I promise.

                              ARIEL
                What if they don t catch him today...what 
                if they don t catch him tomorrow?  How 
                long are there going to be policemen in 
                our house...

  Joe and Allison lock eyes, the truth is they have no idea...

                They re not going to be in our house,

                              ALLISON
                No.  Protecting us.

                couple days, after that we ll re-evaluate 
                the threat...we still have to get a judge 
                to sign a warrant for the phones, that ll

                He said he was calling from a cell phone.

                              SCANLON
                Probably pre-paid...hard to trace, but 
                it s worth keeping the phones on tap.

                than a little strange.

                              DEVALOS
                There s nothing strange about it.  I 
                called the Warden because I had credible 
                  information about a possible attack on 
                his facility.

                                DINOVI
                You called him ninety seconds before a 
                civilian plane - a plane with no 
                  connection to any of the escaped 
                  criminals - crashed into his perimeter.

                              DEVALOS
                My information wasn t specific.  This was 
                probably a very strange and unfortunate 
                  coincidence.

                                DINOVI
                  Unfortunate coincidence.  
                      (digging in)
                So why was your office circulating 
                sketches of  persons of interest  to 
                several local airports a week before the 
                crash?  Sketches matching the passengers 
                in the plane that crashed into Mariposa 
                County?

  Devalos looks at DiNovi, he doesn t have straight answers for 
  her, but he is not about to let that break his cool fa ade...

                              DEVALOS
                We conduct investigations here.  
                  Sometimes that requires that we follow up 
                on leads.  Is that all?

                                DINOVI
                Did any of these leads have to do with 
                the escape of Sonny Wayne?

                              DEVALOS
                We won t know that until all the facts 
                about the escape are in...or we ve 
                  recaptured Sonny Wayne.

                                DINOVI
                Which we d better...or all of these loose 
                ends are going to be fodder for the 
                mayor s investigation.

  Devalos stops and turns on DiNovi, trying to put a quick end 
  to the conversation...

                              DEVALOS
                Right now, we re focusing on catching the 
                guy, what are you focusing on?

                                DINOVI
                A hunch that you aren t telling me the 
                entire truth.

  Dinovi holds on Devalos, but he isn t about to take the bait, 
  he merely holds up his hands: this conversation is over.  
  Devalos then turns to go...and off DiNovi, stymied...

  A CLOSE UP OF SONNY WAYNE S JOURNALS3131

                              SCANLON
                Find anything useful?

    ...Allison looks up, clearly exhausted...

                              ALLISON
                Not really.  Just that he has some dreams 
                that recur.  One about a boy who hides in 
                his closet when his father comes home 
                drunk looking for somebody to smack 
                around.  One about this poor old woman 
                named Clementine, who keeps waking up in 
                a panic because she doesn t know where 
                she is...

    ...Allison s voice trails off as she reads Scanlon s 
  expression, he has something to say to her...

                              SCANLON
                Anything in there about a woman who got 
                in a fight with her boyfriend, who then 
                left her stranded at a truck stop in Deer 
                Valley?

                              ALLISON
                  No...why?

                              SCANLON
                The boyfriend got second thoughts and 
                called the police when he couldn t locate 
                  her...she must have tried to walk home on 
                her own and gotten lost.  We found her 
                body in an embankment off a service 
                  road...looks like the attack took place 
                in the early morning, before sunrise.

    ...Allison shakes her head, her thoughts all storming toward 
  the worst possible spin on this...

                              ALLISON

  cigarette in her mouth and strikes up her lighter...but 
  before she can light up, a GUST blows the lighter out...

  ...and closes the roof access door with a SLAM!

  Claire looks over, then rushes to the door...it s locked from 
    inside...she grabs the handle and pulls, but the door won t 
    give...she keeps trying, nothing...then, as she scans around 
  the roof...noticing that there are no other doors...

                Wait, that looks familiar!

                visiting from out of town. 
                      (re: THE BAG)
                I got you extra groceries this week to

    ...wrapped in a gray blanket, seated across from Allison... 
  finishing her recitation just in time to break into freaked-
  out tears as Scanlon puts a hand on her shoulder.

                              CAROL
                ...and that s it.  That was the message. 
                I didn t know what the hell he was

                is...but I didn t care.  All I know is 
                that he didn t kill me.

                Thank you Ms. Weldon.  You ve been not

                Your aunt is with an officer outside... 
                he ll take you to her...

  Scanlon gently guides Carol to the door and closes it behind 
  her.  All three are silent for a beat, then...

                              DEVALOS
                      (looking for the bright side)
                At least we ve got him on the run now.

                              ALLISON
                That message didn t sound like any kind

                              SCANLON
                Beg to differ, Allison.  Leaving that 
                girl alive was something he did on the 
                fly.  I think we rattled him.

  Allison gathers her things and heads toward the door.

                              ALLISON
                You don t get it.  He s not scared, or

                The only reason he didn t deliver his 
                message in that girl s blood is because 
                he knew you were coming...he s got all 
                the time in the world now to wait and get 
                me alone.

                I don t know how much longer I can do 
                this. 

  Scanlon heads her off at the door.

                              SCANLON
                We are going to catch him. I promise.

                              ALLISON
                You can t promise...and you can t shadow 
                my entire family around the clock from 
                now until the end of time, and you can t

                that we re airlifting her to roof tops in 
                the middle of the night on the city dime?

                dragnet, we re pulling off three officers 
                to guard her house around the clock? 

  Scanlon is momentarily thrown for a loop by DiNovi s 
    questioning, but quickly begins to dissemble...

                              SCANLON
                These things weren t done on a whim, 
                  Lynn...without reasons...

                Attorney let me save you a step.  I ve 
                heard it. I m not buying it. And I m NOT 
                leaving until I get some answers. 

  Scanlon shrugs, then heads for the door.

                              SCANLON
                Well feel free to wait right here.  I ve 
                got a serial killer to catch.

  DiNovi jumps up, and gets in right in Scanlon s face.

                                DINOVI
                Fine.  What if, from here on out, it s

                Yes...

  ...and we...

                                                                      INTERCUT WITH:

  LYNN DINOVI5757

    ...sitting in the driver s seat of her car, parked in an 
    INDISTINCT PARKING LOT, talking on her cell phone.

                                DINOVI
                This is Deputy Mayor Lynn DiNovi. 

                              ALLISON
                  Yes...what can I do for you...?

                                DINOVI
                I ve just had a very illuminating 
                  conversation with Lee Scanlon...so for 
                  starters, we can cut the crap.  

                              ALLISON
                  ...excuse me?

                                DINOVI
                I know who you are.  I know what you do 
                for the District Attorney. 

                              ALLISON
                What did Detective Scanlon -

                                DINOVI
                I know everything.  And if you think I 
                had a problem with the city keeping a 
                psychic on the payroll, just imagine how 
                  I reacted when he told me that our serial 
                killer is supposedly psychic too.

    ...Allison s eyes close in disbelief...

                              ALLISON
                Oh my gosh...

                                DINOVI
                Do you realize the political apocalypse 
                that s gonna go down if it gets out that 
                the city of Phoenix is being led on a 
                leash by a...palm reader? Have you any 
                idea?

                              ALLISON
                I...I don t know what to say.  Maybe we 
                could sit down tomorrow with District 
                Attorney Devalos...

                                DINOVI
                No.  You and I are going to talk.  Now.  
                And we are NOT having this discussion 
                over the phone.  You re going to meet me 
                in Municipal parking structure number 
                five, in say...
                      (checks watch)
                ...15 minutes.  Don t tell anyone. Don t 
                call anyone. And don t keep me waiting.

  CLICK, as DiNovi hangs up the phone...and Allison is left 
  staring at the dead phone in her hand, stunned.

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:

  message  NO SERVICE ...

  PULL BACK TO REVEAL

  Allison GLUED to her cell phone...climbing up the steps of 
  the stairwell...PAUSING...walking back down...PAUSING...and 
  then walking back up...searching desperately for a signal.  
  She passes that same FIRE EXTINGUISHER encased in EMERGENCY 
  GLASS we saw earlier.  Clearly she s having NO LUCK...and 
  then we hear...

  THE SOUND OF A CAR

  ...from somewhere inside the parking structure.  Allison 
  SHOOTS UP THE STAIRS to the nearest landing...the sign on the 
  door says  LEVEL THREE ...she looks through the window to 
  discover...

    A DESERTED FLOOR (ALLISON S P.O.V. THROUGH THE WINDOW)

  ...but after a moment, the OUTLINE of a FIGURE becomes 
  visible through the darkness...

  ON ALLISON

  ...her face LIGHTING UP at the sight of someone...she BANGS 
  her fists AS HARD AS SHE CAN on the door...

                              ALLISON
                      (screaming)
                Hello!  Can you please open this door for 
                me?

  BACK ON THE FIGURE (ALLISON S P.O.V.)

  ...who must be at least forty feet away...but he seems to 
  notice her, seems to look over at her...

                              ALLISON
                OVER HERE!

  ON THE FIGURE WALKING TOWARDS HER

  ...she s clearly gotten his attention...he pulls out a 
    FLASHLIGHT and SHINES it directly into the camera...

    ...blinded by the BEAM of LIGHT...she puts her HANDS UP to 
  shield herself until it goes away...then she looks through 
  the window to find...

  SONNY WAYNE

    ...walking towards her, only thirty feet away...that EVIL 
  CHESHIRE CAT GRIN still plastered across his face...

  ANGLE ON ALLISON

  ...just standing there...in UTTER SHOCK...until her brain 
  starts working again and she BOLTS down the stairs AS FAST AS 
  SHE CAN.  And the next thing we see is...

  THAT SAME FIRE EXTINGUISHER ENCASED IN GLASS

  ...as Allison SHOOTS BY IT...but then she QUICKLY STOPS...she 
  turns and looks back the way she came to find...

  AN EMPTY CONCRETE STAIRCASE

  ...she looks back at the fire extinguisher...her mind 
  RACING...

    UNLOCKING...

  TIGHT ON ALLISON S EYES

      ...TERRIFIED...watching this from somewhere nearby... 
    WAITING...

  BACK ON THE DOOR

  ...as it begins to open toward us...three fingers creep 
  around its edge...when...

  ALLISON

  ...fire extinguisher in hand...LUNGES at the door, SWINGING 
  with ALL her MIGHT...she MISSES the fingers, but the IMPACT 
  SLAMS the door shut with a LOUD BANG...

  his next attempt...when...

  And THROUGH THE WINDOW we see a nervous hand appear, holding 
  a POLICE BADGE...

  ON ALLISON

  ...seeing that...the panic melting away...being replaced with 
  COMPLETE CONFUSION...

                                A FAMILIAR VOICE
                I m coming in.  Don t take my head off.

  Allison stands back as the door opens...and REVEALS...

  SCANLON

  ...just standing there...SMILING...right where Sonny Wayne 
  should be...

                              ALLISON
                I don t understand.

                              SCANLON
                We got him, Allison.  Look.

  ...and he points through the open door to...

  A SQUAD CAR

  ...some thirty feet behind him inside the parking 
    structure...several UNIFORM COPS stand guard, weapons at the 
  ready as others lift a handcuffed Sonny Wayne from the face-
  down arrest position, then get him on his feet and walk him 
  into the squad car...

  ON ALLISON

  ...trying hard to absorb the surreal sight in front of her... 

                              ALLISON

                        anything else)
                I don t understand.

  Scanlon is nervously eyeing Allison s right hand...

                Before I say anything...why don t you

                Now don t, please.  Don t get mad.  The

                              ALLISON

                              SCANLON
                It was all a set up, Allison.
                      (a self-congratulatory grin)
                Pretty good one too.

                              ALLISON
                What was a set up?

                              SCANLON
                  Everything.  DiNovi s phone call, the 
                broken elevator, the locked doors in the 
                  stairwell.  After all the threats, we 
                figured if you were in a tight spot, he d 
                come after you.
                      (gauging her reaction)
                So we led you here.  Jammed your phone. 
                Made sure you were good and scared.

                              ALLISON
                Good and scared?!?  I was jumping out of 
                my skin!!

                              SCANLON
                Allison, we had guys everywhere.  I had 
                sharp shooters on all the nearby roofs.  
                We had this whole place covered.  As soon 
                as he showed up, we nabbed him.  You were 
                safe.  I made sure of it.

                              ALLISON
                Safe?  You think dangling me like a 
                porkchop in front of a serial killer is 
                safe?

                              SCANLON
                It was the only way, Allison.  And it 
                worked.  It s over.
                      (off Allison)
                You can t argue with success.

    ...Allison wrestles with that, not sure whether to feel 
  relieved or hurt...but before she can speak...

                Oh, Allison...that thing we talked about 
                on the phone?  Don t worry about it.
                      (with a flick of her hand)

                Good.  Then I m going home.

    ...Allison turns to go...then she pauses...looking up at the 
  stairs, then at Scanlon...still not knowing whether to thank 
  him or deck him...so she just shakes her head and turns 
    away...and off Scanlon feeling like he just ducked a 
  bullet...

                                                                              CUT TO:

    BRIDGETTE6969

    ...sitting in PJs in the living room as we go WIDER to reveal 
  that she is surrounded by a gaggle of EIGHT YEAR OLDS, all in 
  PJs as well...all of them watching the television as an 
  ANIMATED MOVIE comes to an end...

                                BRIDGETTE
                That was awesome...you guys want to watch 
                it again?

  ...but one of the eight-year-olds rears up on Bridgette, a 
    dissatisfied expression on her face...

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #1
                What about the brownies, Bridgette?

    ...Bridgette stares at her friend, caught in the 
    headlights...

                                BRIDGETTE
                  Brownies?  I...didn t...

  ...and it s like a switch has been thrown, because all the 
  other eight-year-olds start turning on Bridgette...

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #2
                  Yeah...you said there d be brownies...

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #3
                Where are the brownies?

                              EIGHT YEAR OLD #4
                We want brownies!

  ...and as the CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL grows louder, we...

  ...her anxiety mounting...her pulse quickening...her breath 
  getting shorter as her friends turn against her...and we...

                                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:

  ...waking up in bed to see Joe, already up, getting 
    dressed...

                              JOE
                Is everything OK?
                      (off Allison)
                Someone stuck somewhere?  Someone 
                injured?  Something going to crash into 
                some other thing?

    ...Allison starts to get up off the bed...

                              ALLISON
                  No...it s not that.

                              JOE
                Then sleep in, for god s sake...you 
                earned it...it s Saturday...the kids are 
                plopped in front of the TV, there s no 
                cops to feed...

  ...but Allison s already up and at it, putting on a robe and 
  heading for the door...

                              ALLISON
                I have one last disaster to avert...
                      (out the door)
                  ...Bridgette...do you want to make some 
                  brownies?

  ...and off Joe, watching as his wife goes off to make the 
  world safer for everyone...

                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
