	FADE IN:

1	EXT. METROPOLIS SKIES - (NIGHT #1)			1

	SUPERMAN is on patrol, keeping the city safe.  It's a
	stormy night, full of lightning in the sky.  As he flies,
	he cocks his head to the side.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		Help!  Help!  He stole my car!

	We hear the sound of TIRES SCREECHING.  Superman looks
	downward, and changes course.

					CUT TO:

2	EXT. METROPOLIS STREET - NIGHT			2

	A late model luxary car roars down the street.  Without
	warning, the CARJACKER slams on the brakes, bringing the
	car to a sudden stop.  Before him stands Superman.

	The carjacker tries to back up, but Superman grabs the
	front bumper, literally LIFTING THE CAR OFF THE GROUND,
	preventing it from moving.

	The carjacker jumps out of the car, races down the street.
	Suddenly, Superman is before him there, too.  The
	carjacker uses his weapon to rain a barrage of automatic
	weapons fire against Superman.  The Man of Steel literally
	CATCHES THE BULLETS IN MID-AIR.  As the smoke clears,
	Superman is still standing.  The carjacker, visibly
	shaken, throws down his weapon and slowly raises his hands
	in a gesture of surrender.

				CARJACKER
		Man, don't nothin' hurt you?

				SUPERMAN
		Not so far.

	Superman seems all powerful and invincible.  LIGHTNING
	illuminates the sky.

3	EXT. KENT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT			3

	Where another bolt of LIGHTNING highlights the face of
	farmer WAYNE IRIG, a man weathered by the elements and
	years of hard work, as he moves to the front door.  He's
	carrying a metal tool box.  He knocks on the door.
	JONATHAN answers, shouts inside.

				JONATHAN
		Martha, it's Wayne Irig.  Put on
		some coffee.
			(to Irig)
		Come on in.

	Irig, a man who doesn't waste words, shakes his head.

				IRIG
		Better out here.

	Irig gestures outside to Jonathan who grabs his coat,
	steps onto the porch, closing the door behind him.

				JONATHAN
		What brings you out on a night like
		this?

				IRIG
		You know that big oak tree I got
		out back?  Well, Tuesday's storm
		blew it right out of the ground.

				JONATHAN
		Need some help chopping it up?

				IRIG
		No, uh-uh.  I found somethin' under
		that tree -- a rock -- and I sent a
		little bit off to the state lab to
		check out.  Today I got federal
		agents asking me a lot of
		questions.  They got bulldozers
		showin' up tomorrow.  That's all I
		know.  I need you to keep this for
		me till I figure it out.

	Irig holds out the box and Jonathan takes it.

				JONATHAN
		What do you think it is?

				IRIG
		Somethin' I never seen before,
		Jonathan.  Somethin' weird.  See
		for yourself.

	Jonathan opens the box.  It's a football sized chunk of
	crystalline rock, GLOWING GREEN as if from an inside light

	CAT passes JIMMY, fiddling with a high-tech watch.

				CAT
		You start being on time, Jimmy,
		it'll ruin your reputation.

	Jimmy smiles, holds up his wrist for her inspection.

				JIMMY
		Morning, Cat.  What do you think?

				CAT
		I prefer... leather.

				JIMMY
		I wasn't talking about fashion.

				CAT
		Neither was I.

				JIMMY
			(taps watch)
		It's a S.T.A.R. Labs prototype.
		The Air Force needs help finding
		their lost pilots, but I was
		thinking we could use it to get in
		touch with Superman.

	At the mention of Superman, Cat seriously takes note.

				CAT
		May I see that?


5	CLARK'S DESK					5

	LOIS, CLARK, and PERRY argue an assignment.

				CLARK
		So here's this decent guy -- a
		farmer -- who gets thrown off his
		property by the feds who then start
		tearing his place up with
		bulldozers.

				PERRY
		Sounds like a story to me.

				LOIS
		Let Clark go then.  I'll stay and	*
		watch for Superman.	*

		Now, Lois let's keep an open mind
		here.  'The Poisoning of America.'
		I'm seeing a Planet special
		investigation.

				LOIS
		Really?  I'm seeing guys in 
		overalls discussing hog futures.

	Suddenly, Clark hears an EAR-PIERCING SHRIEK.  He looks
	around the room, his brow furrowed.  Business continues
	around him per usual.  He can barely hear the following:

				PERRY
		Private property rights versus the
		public good.

				LOIS
		We've got that story here in
		Metropolis.

	Clark sees Jimmy continuing his show-and-tell with Cat by
	pressing a button on the wrist device.

				PERRY
		Urban and rural.  It's the same
		story.  Same problem.  Sometimes
		it's easier to understand in a
		smaller setting.  A microcosm.

	Perry turns to Clark, concerned.

				PERRY
			(continuing)
		You okay, son?

				CLARK
		Sure.  Excuse me.

	Clark takes off.


6	CAT AND JIMMY					6

	Cat shakes her head to Jimmy.  Big disappointment.

				CAT
		I can't hear anything.

		It's a signal watch.  Superman has

	Perry shrugs his shoulders.

				PERRY
		Okay.  I'm done arguing.

				LOIS
		Perry...
			(self-explanatory)
		It's Smallville.

				PERRY
		Yeah, I got you. That's probably

9A	EXT./INT. RENTAL CAR / TRAIN CROSSING - DAY			9A

	Lois and Clark's rental car pulls to a halt.  The gate is

	railroad employees take their time looking for the
	trouble.

				CLARK
		You can joke, but take away Middle
		America and what have you got?

				LOIS
		Art, music, theater --

				CLARK
		-- crime, drugs, poverty.

				LOIS
			(sighs)
		How long is this going to take?

				CLARK
		It takes as long as it takes.

				LOIS
		I didn't realize Zen was popular in
		the country.

				CLARK
		It always takes people from the
		city a while to decompress.
		Fortunately for you, this weekend
		Smallville's holding the annual
		Corn Festival.

				LOIS
		This is a good thing?

	A typical farm property that's been invaded by earth
	movers, men in protective suits and two large tent	*
	structures.  Clark and Lois exit the convertible and	*
	approach CAROL SHERMAN, a highly-efficient
	African-American field operative.  She wears a name tag	*
	with the acronymn E.P.A.	*

				SHERMAN
		Sorry.  Off limits to the public.

				LOIS
			(showing press pass)
		We're not the public.  We're the
		press.

				SHERMAN
		We've already issued a statement to

				CLARK
		I'm Clark Kent.  This is Lois Lane.
		We're with the Daily Planet.

				SHERMAN
		I'm Carol Sherman, EPA Field
		Liaison.  What's a newspaper like	*
		yours doing here?

				CLARK
		That's why we're called the Daily
		Planet.  We cover the world.

				SHERMAN
		That's it.  Public safety.  No big
		story, I'm afraid.

				LOIS
		We'll need to speak with the
		property owner.

				SHERMAN
		Mister Irig's been given relocation
		money during the testing.  He
		didn't say where he went.

				LOIS
			(pointedly)
		I'm sure you've got that
		information somewhere.  We'll check
		back.

	Lois and Clark walk back to their car.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		I think the big impact here is
		probably that 'Farmer Jones' is off
		in some motel, eating take-out and
		watching cable TV on the
		government's dime.

				CLARK
		His name's Wayne Irig.

				LOIS
		Oh, that's right, you know him.

				CLARK
		He's a friend of my dad's.  I

11	INT. CLEAN-UP SITE - COMMAND TENT - DAY			11

	The elusive Irig is seated in a chair.  He is the object
	of attention of a man wearing military fatigues, JASON
	TRASK, the paranoid leader of the renegade UFO 
	organization, Bureau 39.  Several agents stand guard and 
	are heavily armed.  A strong, hot light shines in Irig's 
	sweaty face.

				TRASK
			(seemingly reasonable)
		We have two possibilities.  Either
		you buried it somewhere on your
		farm or you gave it someone.  Now,
		which is it?

				IRIG
		There wasn't anymore.  That's it.

	Trask's face clouds and he turns the light higher.  Irig
	seems blinded by it.  His skin is red, the perspiration
	builds.

				TRASK
		Wrong answer.

	Sherman enters.  She looks shocked to see Irig in this
	state.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Problem, Ms. Sherman?

		Now, if you're still determined to

	Clark and Lois park their car on main Street.  Across the
	way is a grassy area with a bandshell.  A banner sign
	reads: "Smallville Corn Festival."  Despite the small
	town flavor, it's a well organized affair, complete with a
	hip logo.  The feel is part carnival, part craft fair,
	part harvest celebration.  Under the gazebo, a	*
	country-rock band plays MUSIC.	*

				CLARK
		If Irig's around, somebody here
		will know about it.  That's the
		great thing about a small town.

		What is it?

				LOIS
		I feel like Dorothy.  Shouldn't a

		Bad metaphor, Lois.  Dorothy

	Jimmy nods.  Not exactly a confidence builder.

		This Lois.  Does she love Clark?

		I don't think so.  She pretty much
		loves her work.

		I've got a woman on the line.
		She's talking about UFO'S,

		Irig and the Daily Planet and
		Superman.  I think it's a crank.

		Forget it!  That's where I am.
		Everybody else is gone.  Get to the

	Jimmy gestures to take the microphone and she hands it over.

				JIMMY
		Lois, it's Jimmy.

				LOIS
		Jimmy!  Listen, I don't know
		exactly what's going on, but
		Superman's in danger, too.  We've
		got to warn him somehow.  Got any
		ideas?

	Jimmy looks down to his signal watch.

				JIMMY
		Just one.  But it's kind of a long
		shot.

				LOIS
		Try anything!

	Jimmy pokes his head out the window, looking upward toward
	the sky as he keys the signal watch.

				JIMMY
		Come one, big guy.  I promise to
		ask nice later.  But just this
		once...

	The car blasts off down the road, lights flashing, SIREN
	blaring.

					CUT TO:


42	INT. TRASK'S VAN - DAY				42

	Head bowed, arms chained above him, Clark waits, half	*
	asleep.  Suddenly, for a second time, he hears the EAR
	SPLITTING NOISE of the signal watch.  And he knows:

				CLARK
		I'm back.

	Clark sets himself, flexes his muscles against his
	restraints.  The CHAINS BREAK around his ankles.
	Another flex.  The HANDCUFFS SNAP.  His powers are
	on-line once again.

					CUT TO:


43	EXT. KENT FARM - DAY				43

	Trask throws a match to the ground and the trail of flame
	races toward the shed. The van is parked nearby, ready
	for the getaway. Clark suddenly BURSTS THROUGH THE BACK
	DOORS of the van.

	He sees the flames.  With his super-breath, he INHALES
	THE FLAMES, then he BLOWS THE FLAMES SKYWARD from his
	mouth like a human flame-thrower.


44	EXT./INT. KENT SHED - DAY (CONTINUOUS)			44

	Clark races inside, where Jonathan, Martha and Irig are
	held, begins to set Martha free first.  As he does, he
	whispers to Jonathan:

				CLARK
		Superman's back.

				MARTHA
		Clark!  Behind you.

	Clark turns, sees Trask approaching in the distance. He
	moves to the doorway.

45	EXT. KENT FARM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)			45

	Clark exits the shed, moves to confront Trask, moving
	toward him, arms behind his back in a military "at ease"
	posture.
				CLARK
		Don't take another step.

				TRASK
		Fighting words, Mister Kent. Or
		should I call you, 'Superman?'
			(considers this)
		A secret identity. Very clever.

	Clark begins moving toward Trask, closing the gap.

				CLARK
		You're going to prison. For
		murder, kidnapping, for abuse of
		power.

				TRASK
		But I'll tell everyone your secret.

				CLARK
		I don't care.  This ends now,
		Trask.

				TRASK
		Agreed.  But the question is, for
		whom?

	In an instant, Clark CLOSES THE DISTANCE to Trask at
	SUPER SPEED.  Shock crosses his face.  Trask smiles.
	Behind his back, Trask has been holding the green rock.
	Clark recoils in searing pain, staggers back.  His knees
	begin to buckle.  Soon he collapses, fighting to even
	breathe.

	Trask stands towering over him.  Clark can only look up at
	Trask.  Speaking seems to be too much effort.  Trask turns
	away, then suddenly spins and kicks Clark, sending him
	sprawling across the dirt.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		You think you're better than we
		humans, don't you?  Flying around,
		oh-so-perfect and superior.  But
		those days are over, aren't they?

				CLARK
		You're... wrong.

	Trask holds the green rock close to Clark as a weapon.

				TRASK
		No. You're wrong.  It's over, and
		I have won.  This little piece of
		home is going to be the death of
		you, Superman.

	In the far distance, there is the faint sound of SIRENS.
	Trask sets the green rock at Clark's side.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Unfortunately, I won't be able to
		stay for the services.

	Trask moves off toward the waiting van.

46	ANOTHER ANGLE					46

	Shifting our perspective on the van, as seen parked next
	to a small pond on the property.


47	CLARK						47

	Fighting against the pain, Clark forces himself to reach
	out and grab the Green rock.  It has the effect of
	touching fire.  With all his will summoned, Clark throws
	it toward the pond.	*

				CLARK
		No!


48	THE GREEN ROCK					48

	Sails past Trask and hits another rock projecting above
	the water-line.  We see its ENERGY RELEASED as it
	explodes into a million small pieces that sparkle as they
	dissipate into the wind and pond.

				TRASK
		Oh, very brave. And very foolish.

	Trask upholsters his weapon.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Now, let's see.  Who should go
		first?  You, or the human traitors
		who have sheltered you all these
		years?

	Clark, only human now, picks himself up from the ground at
	great pain, and charges Trask like an enraged bull.  Trask
	is knocked off his feet, but Clark seems spent by the
	effort.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		You're right, Superman. I don't
		need a gun.

	Trask advances on Clark and in a lightning display of
	martial arts, sends him sprawling back to the ground.
	Clark holds onto Trask's boot and pulls him to the ground
	with him.

	What follows now is a display of courage which proves it
	isn't just super-powers that make Clark Kent a Superman,
	but a super-heart.  Clark and Trask battle man-to-man.
	Trask is the superior street fighter, but Clark has the
	most to lose.  They tumble into the pond.

	Finally, Clark is on top of him, could easily bash his
	brain to smithereens on the rock that shattered the
	meteorite.  The SIRENS are louder now, more imminent.  The
	van races off, not waiting for Trask.

				TRASK
			(continuing)
		Go ahead.  Kill me.  I would have
		killed you.

	Clark throws Trask back in the water.

				CLARK
	That's not how I work.

	Clark walks out of the water.  Several sheriff's vehicles
	arrive in quick succession.  The first has Rachel and
	Jimmy.  The second contains Deputy Hank driving Lois and
	Sherman.  As they pile out of the cars, Clark staggers
	against a tree, supporting himself, fighting for
	consciousness.  Lois screams:

				LOIS
		Clark!

	It's Trask emerging from the water, producing a miniature
	weapon from his boot, aiming for Clark.

	Rachel tenses.

	Clark winces, preparing for the worst.

	Jimmy brings his camera up into action.

	A SHOT is fired. Trask falls back into the pond.  Rachel	*
	looks at her smoking gun, in awe that she fired it.  Lois
	runs to Clark's side.  They embrace.  They have survived,
	and we:

		Now, Kent, I usually tell my
