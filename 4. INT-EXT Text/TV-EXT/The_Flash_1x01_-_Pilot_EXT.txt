                    I am that fast.  

      And then we see something we haven t seen a million times -- 
      as the CARS speed down the busy street -- something speeds 
      past them -- a CRIMSON BLUR -- a FLASH of ELECTRICITY -- what 
      the hell was that?  

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    And the faster I go... the more the 
                    world slows down.

      THE WORLD SUDDENLY STOPS!  The people -- the cars -- the 
      flags blowing in the wind -- EVERYTHING FREEZES -- (this 
      effect will come to be known as  FLASH TIME ) 

      But the world isn t really frozen -- this is how our HERO 
      experiences time -- everything so slow -- except him -- and 
      we finally glimpse the blur -- A MAN -- in RED -- he takes in 
      the city, watching, observing.  

      We move to our HERO S FACE -- eyes peer through the ICONIC 
      COWL -- SPARKS in his pupils -- confident grin on his face --

                    my city like a guardian angel...  

      A BIKE MESSENGER -- talking on his CELL -- stacked PACKAGES 
      blocking his view -- runs a RED LIGHT -- a TAXI threatens -- 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    To make sure no one loses someone 
                    like I did... 

      The same FLASH OF LIGHT ROARS by -- FLIES OVER THE TAXI -- 
      the bewildered Messenger and his bike are suddenly on the 
      street corner -- each RECEIPT stamped:  DELIVERED

      SCARLET SPEEDSTER RACES FORWARD!

                    did you just make my dad mad for no

                    A girl?  Wow, good for you.  When s 
                    the last time you went on a date?  
                    All you do is hang out with me.

                    kinda like brother and sister, 
                    because we re not brother and 
                    sister, it can get really... weird 
                    and awkward talking to me about 
                    girls.  But I want you to know, it 
                    shouldn t be awkward.  There s 
                    nothing I want more than for you to 
                    meet the right person that totally 
                    loves and adores you for the 
                    amazing guy you are.  

      After a long horrifying beat -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Took the words right out of my

                    Aren t you glad I know you so well?

      The crowd CHEERS (some BOOS) cutting Barry off as HARRISON 
      WELLS (40) strides onto the stage with a smile -- He s Steve 
      Jobs and Elon Musk rolled into one -- and this is his day -- 
      he is flanked by several YOUNG SCIENTISTS we will meet later.

                    For those of you who don t know

                    My name is Harrison Wells.  
                      Tonight... the future begins.  The 
                    work my team and I do here will 
                    change our understanding of 
                    physics.  It will help us bring 
                    about advancements in power and 
                    medicine.  I want to live in that 
                    future.  And I want you all to join

      Suddenly -- Barry s shoved aside by a THIEF (late teens) -- 
      the Thief grabs Iris s LAPTOP BAG -- runs off -- 

                                  IRIS
                    My laptop!  It s got my dissertation!

      Barry doesn t hesitate -- he takes off after the Thief --


      Barry, huffing and puffing, tries to keep up as the Thief 
      turns around a corner -- Barry rounds it -- 


      -- and GETS WHACKED in the face by Iris  laptop -- catching 
      us up to the scene we saw at the top of Act One -- before the 
      Thief can take off again --

                                  BARRY
                    Hey man, you don t want to do this.  
                    Just give me back my friend s bag.  
                    And we ll call it even.  

      The Thief looks like he might do the right thing... until 
      Barry reaches for it -- and THWACK!  The Thief takes Barry 
      out with a FEW QUICK PUNCHES -- Barry goes down just as Iris 
      rounds the corner --

                    Barry!

      The Thief leaps at a CHAIN LINK FENCE -- a quick climb to 
      freedom when -- CLICK!  The Thief looks down to see --

      DETECTIVE EDDIE THAWNE (late 20 s, early 30) -- handsome, 
      your classic square-jawed hero-type -- gun aimed --

                    way you re not faster than a 
                    bullet? 


      Detective West s car moves down the dirt driveway, up to the 
      farmhouse -- the RAIN coming down now -- as they get out --

                                  DET. WEST
                    This is the last farm on Barry s list.  

                                  DET. CHYRE
                    I know the kid s smart.  But you ve 
                    said it yourself, sometimes he s 
                    chasing flying pigs. 

      West gets out of the car -- Chyre reluctantly follows -- as 
      STORM CLOUDS continue to rumble overhead --


      West and Chyre -- make their way across the farm -- towards 
      some FARM EQUIPMENT covered by TARPS -- West gets closer -- 
      curious -- pulls aside one of the tarps revealing -- A 
      CORVETTE!  Damn, Barry was right... 

                                  DET. WEST
                    Mardon.

      Both Detectives pull their guns when BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  
      GUNSHOTS ricochet off the farm equipment forcing the cops to 
      take cover -- we get a good look at CLYDE MARDON (late 20 s, 
      cold) -- our episode s villain -- he holds a smoking gun -- 

                                  DET. CHYRE
                    You can leave this farm in cuffs or 
                    a body bag, Mardon.  Your choice.

                                  MARDON
                    I ll take option three.

      Suddenly, A SINGLE PROP PLANE -- propeller spinning -- ROARS 
      out of the BARN -- Chyre steps out to shoot -- when -- BLAM!

      A bullet hits him in the neck -- BLOOD SPRAYING -- as he 
      falls, West pulls Chyre clear, avoiding a hail of bullets. 

      West FIRES at Mardon as he runs and leaps into the plane -- 

      West kneels down -- puts a hand over Chyre s wound -- knows 
      it s fatal -- West can only watch as the plane TAKES OFF into 
      the air -- heading up INTO the STORM CLOUDS -- 

                                  DET. WEST

                    an officer down!


      West holds Chyre -- dead -- watches the same EXPLOSION OF 
      ENERGY rise up from the ground and into the sky -- CRACKLING 
      into the storm cloud over Central City --


      Working behind the counter, IRIS pours coffee -- chats with 
      CUSTOMERS -- as she POURS HOT COFFEE into a REGULAR S MUG, 
      she casually glances up through the FRONT WINDOW -- her eyes 
      going wide when she sees -- 

      Barry -- alive and awake -- the shock causes Iris to overflow

      Iris leaps the counter as Barry rushes in -- a movie moment --

      He takes her hand -- reassuringly puts it on his chest -- 

                                  BARRY
                    It s still beating.

                    Oops!

      Barry s attention is drawn as -- a BARISTA -- gets jostled by 
      another CUSTOMER -- dropping her TRAY OF ITEMS -- 

      Barry suddenly reacts because -- THE WORLD HAS SLOWED!

      Iris, the customers, even the traffic behind Barry -- all 
      appear frozen -- the falling TRAY and its CONTENTS hang 
      suspended in mid-air -- we saw this effect in the prologue -- 
       Flash Time  -- but Barry is experiencing it for the first 
      time -- then, without explanation -- 

      -- TIME RAMPS UP AGAIN -- the world moving again -- Iris

      Barry emerges from the station house -- every nerve in his 
      body tingling -- as if his body were a race car at the 
      starting line -- desperate for motion... 

      And so Barry puts his weight on his toes -- leans down -- a 
      tiny SPARK in his eye -- an ignition... and then --

      FTHWOOM!  Like a bullet FIRED from a gun -- Barry hurtles out 
      of the alley at a hundred miles an hour -- SHATTERING a 
      PARKED POLICE CRUISER S WINDOWS -- BLOWING out TRASH CANS -- 
      RACING down --


      -- THE ALLEYWAY -- BLOWING out windows -- careening down the 
      corridor -- CRASHING into the back of AN OPEN LAUNDRY TRUCK --

      drifts into unconsciousness -- as WE INTERCUT WITH -- THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      28.



      Nothing but flat arid OVERGROWN TARMACS in all directions -- 
      a gleaming stainless steel S.T.A.R. Labs MOBILE UNIT is 
      parked in the wide expanse -- Wells, Caitlin, Cisco and 
      Hartley, at their stations, look down from the truck.

                    This is a joke.  There s no way he

                                  CISCO
                    How does it fit?  

      A beat of anticipation -- as we wait for Barry Allen to step 
      out -- dressed as the iconic superhero -- but instead --

      Barry comes into view wearing an ILL-FITTING HELMET with 
      GOGGLES -- RUNNER S SHIRT, SHORTS, ELBOW and KNEE PADS, a 
      MONITORING BAND around his bicep, and RIDICULOUSLY SOLED 
      BOOTS WITH TREADS -- FAR FROM the Flash... for now.

                    He designed a cochlear device that 
                    restored partial hearing.  It s not 
                    the same.  And it left him in a 
                    perpetual state of being unpleasant

      runway -- sending a PLUME OF WATER into the air -- shaken, 
      Barry looks up -- sees the S.T.A.R. Labs van driving towards 
      him -- then he winces -- sees his arm is broken -- oww --


      Barry and Iris walking, coffee in Iris  hands --

                    You can t tell my Dad.  He doesn t

                                  BARRY
                    Doesn t seem like anyone s in on 
                    the secret.

                                  IRIS
                    I was going to tell you.  

                                  BARRY
                    I thought you said he was a jerk.

                    When you were in the hospital, 
                    Eddie covered my father s shifts so 
                    we could both be with you.  I just 
                    assumed he was doing it to suck up 
                    to my father.  I accused of him as 
                    much.  Then he told me, he d spent 
                    some time in a hospital himself.  
                    Alone.  And how much it would ve 
                    meant to him to have loved ones 
                    there.  He wanted that for you.

      A GREEN CORVETTE tears down the street chased by TWO POLICE 
      CRUISERS -- the Corvette VEERS into one of the cruisers -- 
      KERASH -- and is now heading straight for Barry and Iris!  

      Barry super-speeds him and Iris out of the way -- both of 
      them hitting the ground -- Barry looks back -- FLASH TIME --

      Mardon stops and looks back -- eyes roll back into his head -- 
      neck muscles taught -- sweat trickling down his forehead -- 

      Suddenly, the sky darkens -- the CLOUDS overhead swirling -- 
      THUNDER barking from above --  Mardon is controlling the 
      weather!  The road enveloped in a THICK FOG -- Off Barry, 
      seeing the impossible... again -- when he hears a CAR 
      CAREENING through the fog -- right for him!

                    Joe, I need to talk to you.  Now.  
                    I know who did this.  Who caused 
                    the pile up.  It was Clyde Mardon.  
                    He s the one who s been knocking 
                    over banks this past week --

                                  DET. WEST
                    Clyde Mardon s dead.  So s his 
                    brother.  The night of the S.T.A.R. 
                    Labs explosion, their plane went 
                    down in the storm. 

                                  BARRY
                    Clyde walked away from it. 
                    Something happened to him that 
                    night...  
                          (here goes)
                    I think he can control the weather.  

      West reacts -- not this, not now.  But Barry presses on --

                    The crime scenes of the recent 
                    robberies, they all happened during 
                    freak meteorological events.  Rain, 
                    high-speed winds, a hailstorm -- 
                    none of which were being tracked.  
                    They just came out of nowhere.  And 
                    when I just confronted Mardon, it 
                    was instantly enveloped in fog.  I 
                    know this sounds impossible...

      Barry reacts -- his mother s words echoing from the past --

                    Wear a mask.

      With that, the Arrow NOCKS an ARROW and FIRES -- THWIKT! -- a 
      CABLE trails after the arrow -- which pierces a nearby CRANE  
      -- The Arrow LEAPS off the roof -- Barry smiles -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Cool...

      Then, Barry turns and super-speeds away --

6363ANGLE ON ANOTHER ROOFTOP 

      Where the Arrow has landed -- looking down and seeing Barry 
      ZOOM DOWN the street -- Arrow can t help but smile.

                                  ARROW
                    Cool.

      Det. West and Det. Thawne s CAR pulls up -- no sign of Mardon 
      or any other car -- the cops alight -- 

                                  DET. WEST
                    I m not saying Mardon s alive, but 
                    if he was, this was the last place 
                    he and his brother hid out.  

                                  DET. THAWNE
                    Why would he come back here?

                                  DET. WEST
                    Criminals are creatures of habit.  

      They draw their GUNS as they hear A CREAK from THE BARN -- 


      GOLDEN BOOTS pound across the pavement -- an arm covered in 
      METALLIC RED slices the air -- LIGHTNING conducting down his 
      arm -- light glints off the end of a GOLDEN WING -- 


      West lugs Thawne out of the barn -- rushing for safety when --

      BOOOMMM!!  The barn roof explodes into the sky!  A SECTION OF 
    THE BARN ROOF heading straight for West and Thawne -- 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      50.

      The cops hit the ground -- Thawne out of it -- West bracing 
      for the end -- when --

      -- a CRIMSON BLUR miraculously TACKLES the debris away from 
      the cops -- a shaken West looks up, amazed -- 

      And we finally get our first look at Barry as THE FLASH 1.0 -- 

      Barry tears off the gas mask -- which leaves the cowl with 
      its iconic design -- before West can speak -- Barry ZIPS away 
      -- coming face to face with the GROWING TORNADO generated by 
      Mardon --

                                  CISCO (O.S.)
                    Barry, can you hear me?

                    Yeah, loud and clear.

                    Barry, wind speeds are 200 miles-
                    per-hour and increasing.  If it 
                    keeps up, this could become an EF-5 
                    tornado.

                                  BARRY
                    How do I stop it?  Guys??

      BACK IN THE CORTEX -- The threesome all look at each other -- 
      they don t know...

                                  BARRY
                    What if I unravel it?

                                    HARTLEY
                    How the hell are you going to do 
                    that?

                                  BARRY
                    Run around it -- in the opposite 
                      direction.  Cut off its legs.   

                                    HARTLEY
                    You d have to clock 500 mph to do 
                    that.

                    I have to try.  

      Barry takes a breath.  And then runs -- ducking and dodging 
      debris -- racing towards the tornado --  

      Barry becomes a RED BLUR moving faster and faster, running 
      counter to the tornado --

      BACK IN THE CORTEX 

      The trio monitor Barry s vitals -- they re not good -- 

                                    HARTLEY
                    The suit is holding up.

                                    CAITLIN
                    But he s not.  

                                  CISCO
                    He can do it.  I know he can do it.

      But the cyclone is too powerful -- A TENDRIL whipping out -- 
      SLAMMING into Barry who SKIDS out -- out of breath -- 

                                  BARRY
                    It s too strong...    

      Mardon looks out at CENTRAL CITY in the distance -- 

                                  MARDON
                    Time to think big...

      The TORNADO begins to move -- towards the city -- Barry is 
      overwhelmed -- until he hears --

                                  WELLS (O.S.)
                    You can do this.

      Barry reacts -- IN THE CORTEX -- Wells has wheeled into the 
      Cortex, moved by Barry s heroism -- 

                                  WELLS
                            (passionate)
                    You were right.  I created this 
                    madness.  But you can stop it.  You 
                    are more than your speed.  You can 
                    do this.  

      Invigorated by Wells  words -- Barry takes off again -- this 
      time running harder -- crackling with lightning -- faster and 
      faster -- until the tornado is violently unraveled --




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      52.

      Barry on the ground, struggles to rise, pulls off his cowl -- 
      can t catch his breath -- CHAK!  Mardon stands over Barry 
      with a gun, out of power and winded himself --

                                  MARDON
                    I didn t think there was anyone

                                  BARRY
                    I m not like you.

      Barry braces for the end -- when:  BLAMM! BLAMM! BLAMM! -- 
      Mardon s body falls, dead -- Barry looks up and sees -- WEST!

                    It s okay.  I m okay.  It s over.

    IN THE CORTEX -- our team breathes a sigh of relief -- and 
    for the first time since we ve met her... Caitlin smiles.  A 
      small one.

      BACK AT THE FARM -- West slumps down beside Barry -- West, 
      finally having seen the impossible -- as the SUN BEGINS TO 
      RISE -- off the two men -- the two partners -- facing a new 
      day --

      Now a crime scene -- POLICE CRUISERS surround the property -- 
      Mardon in a BODY BAG -- Thawne is getting his head bandaged 
      by an E.M.T. -- West crosses to Barry -- a quiet beat -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Thanks for covering for me.  As 
                    usual.

                    What you can do... it was the

                                  BARRY
                    More or less.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    You weren t crazy to chase the 
                      impossible.  You really did see 
                    something the night your mom died.  
                          (then)
                    Your dad is innocent.  

      Barry reacts -- words he s longed to hear his whole life --

                                  BARRY
                    I could free him, Joe.  I could be 
                    in and out of that prison with both 
                    of us before anyone could even see 
                    me.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    And then what?  You d make your 
                    father a fugitive.  He d be running 
                    for the rest of his life.  And he s 
                    not nearly as fast as you.  
                          (beat)
                    But things are different now.

                                  BARRY
                    How?

                                  DET. WEST
                    Because I believe you.  And you and 
                    me, we re going to get him out 
                    together.  And catch the son-of-a-
                    bitch who really killed your mom.

      Barry nods, grateful beyond words --

      Just then, West and Barry see Iris arrive, she looks at 
      Thawne, who nods her way -- I m okay -- so that Iris  dad 
      does not realize -- West turns back to Barry --

                                  DET. WEST
                    But you do not tell Iris.  She can 
                    never know about what you can do.  
                    About any of it.  I want her safe.  
                    If there s more people out there 
                    like Mardon, or the man who killed 
                    your mom, I don t want her anywhere 
                    near this.  

      As Iris reaches them --

                                  IRIS
                    Are you both, alright?  I was at 
                    Jitters when half the cops got 
                    called out here.  They said there 
                    was a shooting. 

                                  DET. WEST
                    We re fine.  We re all fine. 

      West flashes Barry a warning look before walking away -- 

                                  IRIS
                    What happened here?    

                                  BARRY
                    Just your every day kind of bad guy 
                    shoot out.  Promise.

                                  IRIS
                    The news report said there was a 
                    tornado.  More freak weather.  Just 
                    like the other day.  You ve been 
                    saying your whole life you ve seen 
                    the impossible.  I feel like I ve

                    can t lie to me.  I know you too 
                    well.  

      Barry catches sight of West looking back, challenging Barry 
      to keep his promise --

                                  BARRY
                    I would never lie to you, Iris.  

      Barry wants so badly to share -- but instead --
