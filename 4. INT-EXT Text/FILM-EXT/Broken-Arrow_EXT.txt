Planes taxiing, vehicles moving.
Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
doors open revealing...
THE GHOST
An enormous black flying wing.
Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
painting in progress.
A PARK RANGER TRUCK
Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...
A RANGER
We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
walks over and taps on the tent.
RANGER
Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to
somebody about this fire.
7.
We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.
JIM (O.S.)
Wha--? Oh, hell.
WANDA (O.S.)
I'll talk to him, Jim.
JIM (O.S.)
Wanda, you stay put.
Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.
JIM
I know -- no wood fires in the
Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
cold and I wanted her to stay warm.
RANGER
Sir, you see any other hikers,
campers anywhere around here?
JIM
Not this time of year. What's the
fine for something like this?
RANGER
Your life.
Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.
BAKER
Done.
HEADLIGHTS
Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...
MR. PRITCHETT
A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.
PRITCHETT
(to Baker, re: Jim in
FIRE)
Jesus. Do you think maybe you
could get him out of the fire?
Unless you like that smell.
8.
The Ghost flies overhead, roaring.
Establishing shot of McMurran Air Force Base.
The plane's running lights go out. The roar of the engines
quickly drops to a low rushing sound. The plane in in full
stealth mode.
The Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the
moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding
silver ribbon five miles below.
A PARK RANGER TRUCK
Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's...
TERRY CARMICHAEL
Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.
CLYDE (V.0.)
Terry? You been through the
Needles entrance tonight?
TERRY
(grabs mike, answers)
No. Why?
CLYDE (V.0.)
Mrs. Parker called --
TERRY
Oh, God. What is it this time?
UFO abduction? Ritual human
sacrifice?
CLYDE (V.0.)
She said she saw a bunch of trucks
going through the Needles entrance
an hour ago and thought they
looked suspicious.
TERRY
Yes, well, this is a woman who
chopped off one of her own fingers
because it'd "turned on her."
CLYDE (V.0.)
Thing is, she said one of the
trucks was ours, and you're the
only one out.
TERRY
(arches eyebrow)
She was probably hallucinating,
but I'll check it out.
We feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to
the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley.
12.
Baker gives a sign. Johnson, standing beside the missile
launcher-like device, hits a button. Instead of a missile, a
brilliant light shoots out.
Terry is standing by her truck, talking on the radio.
TERRY
Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that
there's nothing weird going on. No
truck, no UFOs, and, except for
the odd human head on a stick, no
sign of Satan.
She feels it before she hears it or sees it.
15.
THE GHOST
Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty feet above the ground. The
jet-wash rocks the truck, almost knocks Terry down.
TERRY
Holy shit.
Heads into the beacon light.
The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind.
HALE'S POV
As he rockets up out of the cockpit.
HALE
When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the
severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on.
16.
Terry, on the radio with Clyde.
TERRY
Somebody ejected!
Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk
helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is...
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES
40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look.
Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into...
THE HELICOPTER
And it lifts up and flies off.
Hale lies, unconscious, his parachute whipping in the wind.
The helicopter glides over wind-whipped sand, searchlights on.
Rhodes sits with MCKELLAR, the pilot. Lieutenants KELLY, REED
and THOMAS are in the back.
IN THE SAND
Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on.
RHODES
Hold it. Come back.
The lights sweep back, find...
THE TIP OF BLACK WING
Sticking out of the sand.
CUT TO:
Establishing shot.
Rhodes and his men are on the ground. Wind is whipping the
sand. Rhodes is walking under part of the wing that is exposed.
He's yelling into a headset microphone.
RHODES
(into mike)
Cockpit's empty! We're checking
the payload!
Rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the
bomb bay doors manually. The doors are open a foot. Rhodes
signals his men to stop. Rhodes steps up, shines a light into
the bomb bays.
INSIDE BOMB BAYS
Rhodes' light plays over the bomb racks -- empty.
RHODES
(into headset mike)
Colonel?
(takes breath)
We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow.
Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's
the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure
reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and...
HALE
Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to
punch. He hesitates when he sees it's...
22.
TERRY
She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.
HALE AND TERRY
Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun.
Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending
her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun.
Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.
HIS POV
Jarring, racing over rock and then...
HALE
Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.
HALE'S POV
He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.
TERRY (O.S.)
That would be the wrong way.
TERRY
Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.
TERRY
Turn around.
HALE
(TURNING)
Look, I --
TERRY
(not interested)
Gimme your hands.
Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.
HALE
I'm going to tell you something I
can't tell you.
Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
him off.
HALE
There were nuclear weapons on that
plane. The guy I was flying with
is trying to steal them.
Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.
23.
HALE
I have to stop him, and I need
your help.
TERRY
(STOPS)
Look, pal, all I know is, I saw
you come down, I come in to help
you and you grab me, kick me and
run away.
HALE
I only ran because you punched me.
TERRY
What, we're ten years old now?
"You started it. No you started
it."
HALE
He has men on the ground. I --
TERRY
Save it. My dog's waiting for his
breakfast.
Terry starts to push Hale along again and...
HALE
Jumps up and through the handcuffs.
TERRY
Reaches for her revolver, but...
HALE
Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...
TERRY
Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.
HALE AND TERRY
Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.
HALE
This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've
got a gun.
TERRY
Yeah, well, I never keep my gun
loaded.
Terry taps her belt.
24.
CLOSE ON HER BELT
A line of bullets.
HALE AND TERRY
Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
his finger. Just as Terry takes it...
HALE
Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her
knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.
HALE
I'm telling you the truth.
TERRY
This is a good way to convince me.
HALE
I could kill you now. Right?
Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.
HALE
I need your help.
Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.
The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap.
ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN
Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots
appear on the outer edge of the screen.
RHODES
Got 'em!
Terry unlocks Hale's handcuffs.
TERRY
I've got a radio in the truck. We
can call McMurran and get the
Marines in here.
25.
HALE
(shakes head)
Deakins'll be monitoring any radio
transmissions out of here.
(off her look)
That's what I'd do.
TERRY
Who is this guy?
HALE
(a flash of the
horrible betrayal he
FEELS)
Someone I would've trusted with my
life.
(BEAT)
You've gotta get to a phone.
TERRY
Me? What are you going to do?
(no answer, she
REALIZES)
Wait. You're gonna go after this
guy? Isn't he going to have a lot
guns and shit? I don't want to
sound insulting or anything, but
... you're just a pilot.
HALE
I don't have any choice. The
nukes are my responsibility.
Besides...
(pulls something from
POCKET)
I do have one thing going for me.
TERRY
What's that?
Hale sticks...
A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
Under a rock.
HALE
The last thing in the world he
expects is for me to come after
him.
Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at
the $20 bill.
The helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice.
26.
DOWN IN THE CREVICE
Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the
crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on
a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece.
RHODES
(into mike)
We've got one intact.
(to his men)
Let's go find the other one.
Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice.
McKellar is sitting in the pilot's seat, eating a candy bar. He
turns at the unexpected sound of a truck-driving up.
A HUMVEE
climbs up the slope toward the helicopter.
MCKELLAR
Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter.
NOVACEK AND LETT
Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out.
NOVACEK
Hey, you guys need any help?
MCKELLAR
It's an Air Force training
exercise, sir. I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.
NOVACEK
Hey, no problem. We just --
LETT
Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots.
MCKELLAR
Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops.
ANOTHER HUMVEE
Drives up fast.
BAKER, JOHNSON AND PRITCHETT
Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.
27.
NOVACEK
Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite.
BAKER
(to Novacek)
Any sign of Deakins?
Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head.
PRITCHETT
He better be dead.
DEAKINS (O.S.)
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
Pritchett.
They all look over to see...
DEAKINS
Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.
PRITCHETT
You said nothing would go wrong!
DEAKINS
Well, point of fact, nothing has.
PRITCHETT
You didn't drop the nukes where
you were supposed to!
DEAKINS
Ah, but we always planned on the
search and rescue team finding the
weapons for us, and they have. Mr.
Pritchett, I really have thought
of everything.
Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.
JOHNSON
Newsflash. Two gunships just left
from McMurran and they're headed
this way.
PRITCHETT
You thought of that?
DEAKINS
That'll take care of itself.
PRITCHETT
What about the other pilot? We
saw him eject.
28.
DEAKINS
You don't have to worry about
Major Hale. He's probably hiding
behind a rock somewhere, praying
I don't find him.
JOHNSON
Someone else might find him.
(off Deakins' look)
A Ranger called her base, said she
saw a pilot come down and was
gonna go look for him.
Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.
DEAKINS
Get ready. You'll go when the
clean-up's done.
Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter.
Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail
Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's
truck. Terry taken a look at Hale's ripped and torn flightsuit.
TERRY
Is that the new uniform?
HALE
Yeah. Less constricting.
TERRY
The dayshift guy left some work
clothes in the truck. You can
have them if you want.
Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.
TERRY
Don't walk there.
HALE
Don't walk where?
TERRY
On that black stuff. That's
cryptogamic soil. It's very
fragile. One footprint takes
centuries to repair.
HALE
That's a new one. Endangered dirt.
Terry gives Hale a look.
29.
Rhodes, Reed, Thomas and Kelly move along the shadowy crevice.
Rhodes hears the connection go dead. He taps his headset.
RHODES
Hello? McMurran? Come in.
Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops.
RHODES
Reed? What the --?
Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say
another word, there's a fusillade of soft popping sounds as
silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around them. Thomas goes
down.
Lett aims a sniper's rifle down into the crevice. He flips a
switch and a red laser beam stabs out from the scope.
Rhodes and Kelly are pressed against the crevice wall.
THE RED LASER BEAN
Dances along the wall, heading for them.
RHODES
Raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser.
Lett pitches back, dead.
30.
PRITCHETT AND DEAKINS
Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins
is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it.
Rhodes whispers to Kelly.
RHODES
We'll open up the access panels,
put in a couple grenades. The
nukes won't go nuclear, but they
will go dirty. I won't lie and
say we'll be all right. We won't.
But if we're gonna go, might as
well take those bastards with us.
Rhodes scrambles off.
KELLY
Just one thing, sir.
RHODES
(TURNS)
What?
KELLY
This.
Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead.
Kelly yells up top.
KELLY
Done!
Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.
Mr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting
on new clothes -- just grins. Deakins takes...
THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket.
KELLY
Climbs into view.
Kelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind
him, shaving with an electric shaver.
KELLY
Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir!
They're all dead!
WILKINS (V. 0.)
What happened?
Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly.
KELLY
It's the nuke, sir! It's open!
Wide open! Oh, God, what am I
going to do?!
Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He
reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch,
then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the
helicopter.
Novacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away.
Deakins turns to Kelly and applauds his performance.
DEAKINS
Brought a tear to my eye.
32.
KELLY
I'd just like to thank the members
of the Academy.
PRITCHETT
(to Deakins)
I hope you've got another surprise
up your sleeve. If I'm not
mistaken, there are two attack
helicopters headed this way.
JOHNSON
Not any longer.
They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.
JOHNSON
They've just been recalled.
DEAKINS
You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think
they've got an exposed core.
They'll want to get a satellite to
take a look, but it'll take ninety
minutes minimum to shift the
orbit. Until then? Well, people
get a little weird when it comes
to radiation. No one'll have the
balls to come near here unless
it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency
Search Teams --and it'll take the
nearest team at least two hours to
get out here, and we only need an
hour to reach our connection with
the transport squad.
(GRINS)
Not that I'm not delighted with
your presence, but you really
don't need to be here.
Hale and Terry are riding in Terry's truck. Terry drives. Hale
is wearing work clothes. After some silence...
HALE
What's your dog's name?
TERRY
Bear. I was going to call him
Death, so I could say things like,
"I walk with Death," and "Death
chewed my boots," but I chickened
out. You?
HALE
No dog.
33.
TERRY
Do you have a name, or is that
classified?
Before Hale can answer...
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
button and machine guns on the sides open up.
TERRY AND HALE
Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...
THE TRUCK
is riddled with bullets and explodes.
TERRY AND HALE
Sprint up the trail.
HALE
We've gotta hide!
TERRY
Follow me!
Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.
HALE
Hide where?
IN THE HELICOPTER
Novacek grins, shoots.
HALE
Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he
turns back, Terry's gone.
HALE
What the --?
TERRY (O.S)
Come on!
Hale runs in the direction of her voice.
NOVACEK'S POV
Aiming at Hale's back. But then Hale suddenly drops from view.
34.
HALE
Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.
TERRY
This way.
Terry runs. Hale follows.
HALE
How do you --?
TERRY
(looks back, still
RUNNING)
I'm a Ranger. I've been over
these trails a million times.
Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
and drops like a rock.
IN THE HELICOPTER
Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.
TERRY AND HALE
Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.
TERRY
Please don't tell anyone I did
that.
IN THE HELICOPTER
Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
a grenade and drops it.
TERRY AND HALE
Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
goes off. They run.
THE HELICOPTER
Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
around, looks up.
HALE
Can you climb up?
TERRY
Yeah ...?
HALE
Give me your gun.
35.
TOP OF CLIFF
Terry climbs up into view of...
NOVACEK
Who sees her.
TERRY
Pull herself up, stands, hands up.
THE HELICOPTER
Novacek swivels the helicopter around.
TERRY
This has nothing to do with me.
NOVACEK
Tell me where he is!
HALE
Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.
HALE
Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat
back a foot ... Puts him right
about ... here.
Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
takes a breath and starts shooting.
IN THE HELICOPTER
The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
pushing the joystick to one side.
THE HELICOPTER
Starts to lean over sideways.
HALE
Is surprised -- it worked!'
TERRY
Watches in horror as...
THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES
Angle toward her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over.
36.
TERRY
Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...
THE ROTOR BLADES
Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The
blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings...
THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER
Up and over, in a high arc.
TERRY
Looks up.
THE TAIL --SECTION
Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.
HALE AND TERRY
Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...
THE TAIL SECTION
Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
split-second after...
HALE AND TERRY
Run clear.
Deakins and Pritchett watch a fireball from the exploding
helicopter rise up in the distance.
PRITCHETT
We don't have to worry about the
other pilot?
Deakins shakes his head.
PRITCHETT
Then how come the helicopter
crashed?
DEAKINS
(a flicker of worry)
Pilot error.
Deakins turns and walks away, over to...
37.
BAKER AND KELLY
Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each
nuke. They are loading them into the back of one Humvee.
Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging.
PRITCHETT
Tell me again how I don't need to
be here.
DEAKINS
Mr. Pritchett, I understand your
concerns. You and your associates
gave me a lot of money to mount
this operation. But they're
getting ten times that back if we
succeed.
PRITCHETT
If we succeed?
DEAKINS
All I can do is my part. We've
got the weapons, we're ...
(checks watch)
... seventeen minutes ahead of
schedule and everything will be in
place within two hours. But I
can't guarantee that the assholes
in Washington won't do something
stupid like not pay.
PRITCHETT
What if they don't?
DEAKINS
Then the next census for this
region is going to show a very
sudden drop in population.
A sleek, very serious-looking helicopter.
The helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain.
HALE
How do they get out of here?
TERRY
Get out? I don't think that
helicopter's going anywhere.
41.
HALE
Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be
prepared.
TERRY
If they've got trucks they could
take the four-wheel-drive trail we
were on.
HALE
He wouldn't want to go towards
town.
TERRY
He could go to the river.
Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do.
The two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail.
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back.
DEAKINS
You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?
PRITCHETT
I think it's barbaric.
DEAKINS
Me, too! I love it! Two men
trying to do as much damage to the
other as he can. As basic as you
can get, don't you think?
PRITCHETT
I think it should be banned.
DEAKINS
So do I! God, wouldn't that make
it more exciting? Having to go
into dark alleys and basements to
see a fight? I bet we see eye-to-
eye on a lot of things, Mr.
Pritchett.
Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams.
Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail.
42.
THEIR POV
The two Humvees make their way along the trail.
HALE
See the one in front? It just has
a driver? They wanted to keep the
weight down. It has the nukes.
Hale takes Terry's gun from her.
TERRY
You gonna shoot out the tires?
HALE
Humvees can reseal and inflate
with the flick of a switch. That's
why Deak chose 'em.
Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?
HALE
I'm gonna steal it.
(checks gun)
You get to a phone and call
McMurran.
TERRY
The nearest phone is a two-hour
walk.
HALE
Then you better start walking.
TERRY
Look, I know my way around here.
You're gonna need me.
HALE
(very serious)
I appreciate what you've done so
far. But now it gets hairy. Go
to the phone.
He scrambles off over the rock.
THE HUMVEES
Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff...
HALE AND TERRY
Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...
43.
IN THE HUMVEE
Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
shoots up through the ceiling.
HALE AND TERRY
Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...
HALE
Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.
DEAKINS
Run him down.
HALE
Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.
TERRY
Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.
TERRY
Here!
She slides the pistol along the truck roof.
HALE
Grabs the gun out of the air as...
BAKER
Slams on the brakes.
TERRY
Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.
HALE
Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate
facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.
DEAKINS AND KELLY
Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.
44.
IN THE LEAD HUMVEE
Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the
back of his head.
HALE
Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.
HALE
Gimme the gun and get out.
BAKER
(SMIRKING)
I don't know. I think we got
ourselves a little stand-off.
HALE
No, we don't.
Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.
TERRY
Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...
HALE
Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.
BAKER
Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...
DEAKINS' HUMVEE
And is run over.
HALE
Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.
HALE
You drive!
TERRY
Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
Baker's gun into her belt.
HALE
I'd yell at you for coming after
me, but you did just save my life.
45.
There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an
emergency tool box.
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
DEAKINS
What're you doing, Hale?
IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE
Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...
A FLARE
Out of the tool kit.
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
KELLY
Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd
show us.
BETWEEN THE HUMVEES
Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.
THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE
Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
side of the plastic can.
ECU TIP OF FLARE
As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
DEAKINS
Stop!
But it's too late and...
THE JERRY CAN
Explodes.
THE SECOND HUMVEE
Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover.
DEAKINS
Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.
46.
IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE
Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
genuinely impressed.
HALE
We need somewhere to hide.
TERRY
(THINKS)
I know a place.
Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam.
Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in
front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains.
The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.
TERRY
It was a copper mine, barely
squeaking along for years. They
shut it-down a few months ago when
they hit an underground river.
The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
He motions for Terry to drive it in.
Kelly drives the blackened Humvee as fast as he can. Johnson
looks at his scanner, grins.
JOHNSON
Got it! They're --
DEAKINS
In the mine.
(off their looks)
I could tell he was inside
something. There was an echo.
The Humvee takes the turn-off to the mine entrance.
Deakins's Humvee comes into the clearing. The Humvee stops and
Deakins and Kelly jump out, followed by Pritchett and Johnson.
The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and
Terry drag the nukes out.
TERRY
We'll each drag one down a tunnel?
HALE
No. I'm only going to set off one.
We'll leave the other one here.
It'll be buried under a billion
tons of rock.
They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them
HALE
We better hurry.
(nods down tunnel)
Let's try down there.
52.
They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel.
Flying over Canyonlands.
Deakins comes out, looks up, sees...
THE NEST HELICOPTER
Coming toward him, two miles away.
Deakins and Pritchett drive out of the mine in the Humvee.
Deakins punches the trip odometer, setting it to zeroes.
Terry and Hale come to the surface, coughing, sucking in air.
Deakins drives fast along the 4WD trail, glancing in his
sideview mirror at...
64.
THE NEST HELICOPTER
Closing in on him.
PRITCHETT
Is holding on tight as Deakins drives wildly.
PRITCHETT
I think I've finally figured out
your plan. Those guys in the
helicopter are going to kill us,
but we're going to rise from the
dead and
DEAKINS
Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his
hand hits Pritchett in the throat.
PRITCHETT
Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his
throat, even pounds himself in the back of the neck. No go. He
slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.
DEAKINS
Maybe now you'll shut up.
Hale and Terry are swimming toward the bank.
Deakins barrels along in the Humvee, the NEST helicopter getting
closer behind him.
IN THE HUMVEE
Deakins has a thought and looks over at Pritchett, dead, held up
by the seatbelt.
DEAKINS
I just realized I've never killed
anyone before. I mean, I dropped
bombs on Baghdad, but never face
to face.
(MORE)
65.
DEAKINS (cont'd)
(thinks about it,
SHRUGS)
I don't know what the big deal is.
The NEST helicopter closes fast on Deakins. They are a couple
hundred feet above him, a quarter mile back.
HUNT
Let him know we're here!
A line of bullets kicks up dust in front of Deakins' Humvee.
The Humvee stops and Deakins gets out, arms above his head.
THE NEST HELICOPTER
A hundred feet in the air, slowly coming in toward Deakins.
Deakins is watching the helicopter. Strangely, he is grinning.
Then the camera CLOSES IN fast on...
DEAKINS' HAND
He's holding a small black box. He presses a button and...
DEAKINS
Watching the helicopter, listening to Hunt over the loudspeaker.
HUNT (V.O.)
Do not move or you will be fired --
THE GROUND
Rises up beneath Deakins.
HIGH ANGLE - WIDE SHOT
The ripples of the shockwave shoot out from the mine, shaking
dust and dirt into the air with an incredible, deafening roar.
DEAKINS AMD THE HUMVEE
Fly ten feet into the air.
67.
Terry and Hale are pulling themselves out of the water when the
shockwave hits, knocking them off their feet.
Deakins and the Humvee land. In the b.g...
THE NEST HELICOPTER
Drops out of sight behind a rock formation. There's an
explosion and a ball of fire shoots up.
Terry looks over at Hale -- holy shit.
Deakins picks himself up.
DEAKINS
(to himself)
At least I know they work.
The Humvee races along the trail.
69.
IN THE HUMVEE
Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to
Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a question.
DEAKINS
The helicopter? It was hit by
EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's
released in a nuclear detonation.
It wipes out anything electronic
for miles. That"s another reason
I wanted to set off a nuke. I
knew it'd bring down any
helicopters coming for us. It'll
also shut down all radio
communications for a few hours,
which will severely screw up their
response.
(GRINS)
You see, Mr. Pritchett? There
really is nothing for you to worry
about.
Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee.
BUTTERFLIES
Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light.
HALE
Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out.
TERRY (O.S.)
Goddamn it!
He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to
her fingers are too numb.
TERRY
Stupid buttons. I hate these
shirts. They're ugly and stupid
and --
Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset
about. Hale holds her.
HALE
It's okay.
TERRY
We just ... I mean, we almost...
HALE
I know.
70.
TERRY
A nuclear bomb went off.
HALE
That it did.
TERRY
Are we...?
HALE
Look.
(points at
BUTTERFLIES)
If the butterflies are okay, then
we'll be okay.
TERRY
Really?
HALE
Absolutely. It says so in the
manual. "If you see butterflies
after a detonation, you are fine."
Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she
appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ...
but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off.
HALE
We better get moving. We might be
able to reach Deakins when he gets
to the river.
They start off along a trail by the river.
HALE
Something I've been meaning to ask.
(Terry looks at him)
How did someone like you end up
with a gun?
TERRY
I hit a bankrobber with a frozen
chicken.
HALE
Excuse me?
TERRY
I came out here one summer during
college. It was the campaign to
stop the dam in the Grand Canyon.
I loved it here. I came back,
worked as a river guide and
eventually stayed year-round. When
a Park Ranger job came open, I
applied.
71.
HALE
I'm still waiting for the chicken.
TERRY
The local Parks Department wasn't
sure how I'd do with the law
enforcement part of the job. Well,
one night I was coming home from
the store and Tommy Drewson part
of the local brain trust was
robbing old Bob Kearney in front
of the ATM. I bear old Bob
yelling and I see Tommy heading
for his car, so I tossed a bag of
groceries at him at thirty miles
an hour. A frozen chicken in the
bag hit him in the forehead and he
dropped like a rock. Next thing
I know, I'm a Ranger.
Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.
Deakins pilots the Humvee along the trail.
Hale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down.
THEIR POV
A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with
an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet.
TERRY
Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and
he's a dead man.
There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands,
gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later...
DEAKINS
Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.
SHEPPARD
Where is everyone?
DEAKINS
I am everyone. Let's go.
Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.
72.
HALE AND TERRY
HALE
Shit.
TERRY
What?
HALE
We're the only ones who know
what's going on, and I don't have
the faintest idea how we're gonna
stop them.
TERRY
You'll think of something.
HALE
Why do you say that?
TERRY
You have so far.
Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him
off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself
and starts off down toward the raft.
TERRY
Sink it?
HALE
Steal it.
They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the
engine throttle, slumps.
HALE
Keys.
Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the
riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging through it when
they hear grunting and feet approaching.
Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry
tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin
bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.
WITH DEAKINS AND SHEPPARD
Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.
THEIR POV
Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere to be seen.
73.
HALE
Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very
silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the
raft.
SHEPPARD (O.S.)
Why were you driving around with
a dead guy?
DEAKINS (O.S.)
Because I like him. He doesn't
ask a lot of annoying questions.
All right?
A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under
water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the
raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.
ON THE RAFT - MOVING
The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.
A TARP
Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.
DEAKINS
Grabs the tarp and pulls.
UNDER THE TARP
There's no one there.
DEAKINS
Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...
A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"
Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth
is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a
shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.
BACK ON THE RIVERBANK
Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
what to do.
The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.
74.
MAX
Your friends in Washington should
be getting the package about now.
DEAKINS
I wish I could see their faces.
Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for...
A MARINA
Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
with a picture of a phone on it.
The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.
TERRY
Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds
on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.
75.
Army helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already
down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it.
HALE, WILKINS AND GILES
Are walking toward the second helicopter.
WILKINS
We found the raft on the other
side of the lake. Tracks from a
heavy truck ran out when they hit
the paved road.
HALE
If we get a rad scanner we can
track them.
A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.
WILKINS
Actually, Major, we're going back
to McMurran.
HALE
What?
76.
GILES
We'd just like to ask you a few
questions.
HALE
I'm not wasting time answering
questions. We've got --
WILKINS
No debate, Major. I was given
orders. Now, you can come with us,
or you can go with them.
Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded.
Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.
HALE
Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
thinks it's over. You've got to
let me go after him. I can help.
I know how his mind works.
WILKINS
Major, I know this is personal for
you, but I think we can handle it.
We're putting a wall of men and
machines around Salt Lake City as
we speak. That truck is not
getting through.
A freight train -- engine, a car carrier (carrying a load of
Toyotas), several boxcars and a caboose. A hatch opens up an
the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and...
79.
DEAKINS
Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck,
they're in a train. The "nuke boxcar" has a small satellite
dish mounted on the roof.
THE FOUR GUNMEN
Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis.
Deakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on. We
ANGLE DOWN to reveal...
TERRY
Crouching down between the two cars.
Terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the
ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal...
DEAKINS
As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.
A RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and
heads for his old pickup truck. He starts to open his door when
he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as...
WILKINS' HELICOPTER
Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps
out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and
flies away, leaving the Rancher agog.
The GUNMAN at the caboose is firing on Wilkins's helicopter,
hanging a hundred yards off the back of the train.
85.
Deakins joins his man on top of the caboose, firing on Wilkins,
helicopter.
Deakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as...
THE HELICOPTER
Comes swooping in.
DEAKINS
Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...
THE HELICOPTER
Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three
feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward.
DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
Run from the blades as fast as they can.
THE HELICOPTER
Closes fast.
DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the
helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins...
DEAKINS
Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right
over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut
short.
HELICOPTER POV
Swooping fast over the train when suddenly...
TERRY
Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter.
HALE (O.S.)
Pull up!
87.
THE HELICOPTER
Pulls up fast.
TERRY
Watches the helicopter bank away. Bullets-start whizzing by her.
DEAKINS
Has climbed up and is shooting at her.
TERRY
Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max's pistol behind her blindly.
TWO GUNMEN
Appear two cars ahead of Terry and start toward her, shooting.
TERRY
Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with no way out when...
THE HELICOPTER
Comes along the length of the train, flying low. It rises up
and there's...
HALE
Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and
he's firing a pistol, shooting right over Terry at...
THE FIRST GUNMAN
He's hit, falls off the train.
THE SECOND GUNMAN
Aims at Terry and starts firing.
TERRY
The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her. She jumps up and
grabs onto...
HALE
As he swings in on the cable, shooting his pistol.
HALE AND TERRY
Are lifted up and over...
88.
THE SECOND GUNMAN
Who turns, firing a shotgun. Hale's bullets find him. He falls.
SHEPPARD
Appears, firing an Uzi at Hale, Terry and the helicopter.
IN THE HELICOPTER
Bullets rip through. Wilkins is hit, knocked back.
THE CABLE HOLDING HALE AND TERRY
Is severed by one of Sheppard's bullets.
HALE AND TERRY
Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.
SHEPPARD
Is hit and drops.
THE HELICOPTER
Banks away fast, making ugly sounds, smoke billowing out. The
engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a hard landing
beside the tracks.
HALE AND TERRY
Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at
each other.
TERRY
You stop the nuke. I'll stop the
train.
Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.
TERRY
I'd yell at you for coming after
me, but you did just save my life.
Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look
over to see...
A RED CROSS HELICOPTER
Coming in fast.
HALE AND TERRY
Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...
89.
A MAN
Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross helicopter, holding a
gun.
TERRY
That's Deakins' escape route.
HALE
Not any more.
Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male
coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads
for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...
THE SHOTGUN
Left by deceased Gunman #2.
Makes her way past the Toyotas.
Wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter.
The train is way off in the distance. They hear honking and
turn to see...
A PICKUP TRUCK
Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.
CLOSE ON PICKUP
The RANCHER from the mini-mart is driving; Giles beside him.
Bullets stream up through the hatch cover, but Hale is nowhere
in sight. One end of Hale's helicopter winch cable is tied to
the hatch cover.
90.
We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to
find...
HALE
Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness.
Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of
the train.
Terry has a three-foot length of gasoline-soaked cloth stuffed
into the gas tank opening of a Toyota on the lower level of the
car carrier. She lights it and hurries off.
Deakins steadies himself as...
THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER
Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway
holds out a hand to Deakins.
DEAKINS
Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...
HALE
Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.
91.
HALE AND DEAKINS
Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter
and is pulled onboard.
THE HELICOPTER
Moves sideways over the train.
IN THE HELICOPTER
Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as...
THE HELICOPTER
Moves back sideways over the train.
DEAKINS' POV
No sign of Hale on the train roof.
DEAKINS
Get us out of here!
THE PILOT
Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd
expression. The helicopter isn't doing what he wants.
THE HELICOPTER
Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because...
HALE
Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid.
The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch.
THE HELICOPTER
Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap.
IN THE HELICOPTER
DEAKINS
Hurry!
POWER LINES
Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead.
DEAKINS
Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...
92.
HALE
Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the
train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down
through the hatch as...
DEAKINS
Sees what's coming and jumps.
THE HELICOPTER
Hits...
THE POWER LIKES
Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.
THE HELICOPTER
Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.
The flame burning up the gas-soaked cloth goes into the Toyota
gas tank and...
THE TOYOTA
Explodes.
It's a chain reaction, with one flaming Toyota setting off the
one above it or next to it.
BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER
Terry is looking under the car carrier.
TERRY'S POV
The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
from the flaming Toyotas.
CU TRAIN AXLE
The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.
TERRY
Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears
a horn honking. She turns.
Snaps and...
THE TRAIN
Jumps the tracks.
The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,
steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.
FLAMING TOYOTAS
Fly, tumble, explode.
THE NUKE BOXCAR
Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.
THE TRAIN
The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.
Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the
train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.
98.
A TV NEWSVAN
Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.
HALE
Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
when he sees...
A FOOT
In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.
HALE
Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.
HALE
Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no.
Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...
TERRY (O.S.)
The Air Force pays you so little
you have to steal shoes off dead
people?
Hale turns to see...
TERRY
Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.
WILKINS AND GILES
Are behind her, grinning.
HALE AND TERRY
Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing,
only to be interrupted by...
THE TV REPORTER AND CAMERMAN
REPORTER
What happened here?
Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.
HALE
Uh...
(looks at flaming
TOYOTAS)
... somebody was trying to steal
some Toyotas.
99.
The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
around each other. As they go, Hale sticks out his hand to
Terry.
HALE
Rawley Hale.
TERRY
Terry Carmichael.
They shake hands and walk on as we...
