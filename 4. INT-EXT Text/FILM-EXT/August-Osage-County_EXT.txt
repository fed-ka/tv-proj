A battered Honda Civic makes it's way up the long drive from
the highway below, dust swirling behind it. It's hot. Bright.
The Honda parks. IVY WESTON, forties, shy and soft-spoken,
attractive enough but expert at hiding it, climbs out.
Stares up at the trees surrounding the old farm house. The
precarious old barn out back and untended flower beds.

I'm saying if you did, I'll give you

Jean heads for the relative privacy of the fence at the edge
of the yard. Leaving Bill and Barb alone, watching.

You've encouraged that.

I haven't encouraged anything.

I didn't tell you about the parakeets?
She got a parakeet for some insane

They head for the house with suitcases, wilting in the heat.

Those are small circles.
He opens the book, perusing the first pages.

"Dedicated to my Violet." That's nice.
Christ, probably every word he wrote

"What are they going to say, are they
going to compare it to Meadowlark?"

I'm sure that's what you tell Sissy,

you, "No, Billy, you haven't done

We're on the old wooden dock, watching a man walking away
from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the
dock in the moonlight. He leans down to untie the boat,
looks back at us, directly into camera -- Beverly.
Now we're traveling BELOW the surface of the lake, through
its dark, tenebrous waters on the moonlit night. The
rhythmic SLAP of gentle waves. We're underwater, light
fractures and scatters above us. We've been here before as --
A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision.
It's aluminum
bottom cuts through the calm above.
Oars dip on either side, propelling the small craft. It
slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch --
Until, suddenly, something hits the surface above, exploding
the calm, coming at us fast, sinking.

Sheriff walks to his cruiser, kills the flashers. Bill joins
him, still barefoot.

Couple old boys running jug lines in
the lake hooked him. Pulled him up.
BILL
He drowned. That's how he died, from
drowning?
SHERIFF
Looks it.
Yes, sir.
Bill looks off.
Song birds begin their pre-dawn chatter.
BILL
Is there any way to determine if
he... I mean is this an accident,
or suicide --?
SHERIFF
There's really no way to tell.
BILL
What's your guess?
SHERIFF
...Suicide.
And now the full weight of it hits Bill. After a moment --
BILL
How does a a person jump in the
water... and choose not to swim?

The sun's just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows
across the flat expanse of prairie. Scattered trees, a

Neither did I.

I didn't tell anyone except Charles.
That's where it started between us.
BARBARA
Why not?
IVY
And hear it from Mom the rest of my
life? She doesn't need another excuse
to treat me like some damaged thing.
BARBARA
You might have told us.
IVY
You didn't tell us about you and Bill.
BARBARA
That's different.
IVY
Why?
Because it's you, and not me?
BARBARA
Because divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat. Cancer's
fucking cancer, you can't help that.
We're your sisters.

IVY
I can't perpetuate these myths of

connected by genetics, a random
selection of cells.

BARBARA
When did you get so cynical?
IVY
That's funny, coming from you.
BARBARA
Bitter, sure, but "random selection
of cells?"
IVY
Maybe my cynicism came with the
realization that the responsibility of
*
caring for our parents was mine alone.
BARBARA
Don't give me that. I participated --
IVY
Till you had enough and got out,
you and Karen both. I'm not
criticizing. Do what you want. You
did, Karen did.
BARBARA
And if you didn't, that's not my

That's right, so don't lay this sister
thing on me, all right? When I leave

KAREN
I get embarrassed just thinking
about it.
Karen takes a tube of hand creme from her purse.
VIOLET
Oh... nothing to be embarrassed
about. Secret crushes, secret
schemes. Province of teenage girls.
I can't imagine anything more
delicate, or bittersweet. Some part
of you girls I always identified
with... no matter how old you get, a
woman's hard-pressed to throw off
that part of herself.
(to Karen, re: hand creme)
That smells good.
KAREN
It's apple. You want some?
VIOLET
Yes, please.
Violet puts out her cigarette. Karen passes her the creme.
VIOLET (CONT'D)
I ever tell you the story of Raymond
Qualls? Not much story to it. Boy I
had a crush on when I was thirteen or
so. Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis,
messy hair. Terrible underbite.

VIOLET (CONT'D)
But he had these beautiful cowboy
boots, shiny chocolate leather. He
was so proud of those boots, you could
tell, way he'd strut around, all arms
and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. I
decided I needed to get a girly pair
of those same boots and I convinced
myself he'd ask me to go steady. He'd
see me in those boots and say "Now
there's the gal for me."
Violet lights another cigarette.
*
VIOLET (CONT'D)
Found the boots in a window downtown
and just went crazy: praying for those
boots, rehearsing the conversation I'd
have with Raymond when he saw me in my
boots. Must've asked my momma a
hundred times if I could get those
boots. "What do you want for
Christmas, Vi?" "Momma, I'll give all
of it up just for those boots."
Bargaining, you know? She started
dropping hints about a package under
the tree she had wrapped up, about the
size of a boot box, nice wrapping
paper. "Now, Vi, don't you cheat and
look in there before Christmas
morning." Little smile on her face.
Christmas morning, I was up like a
shot, boy, under the tree, tearing
open that box. There was a pair of
boots, all right... men's work boots,
holes in the toes, chewed up laces,
caked in mud and dog shit. Lord, my
momma laughed for days.
Silence.
BARBARA
Please don't tell me that's the end of
the story.
VIOLET
Oh, no.
That's the end.
Ivy shakes her head, goes inside. She's had enough of Violet
to last a lifetime.
KAREN
You never got the boots?

VIOLET
My momma was a nasty-mean old lady.
I
suppose that's where I get it from.
An awkward moment.
KAREN
You're not nasty-mean. You're our
mother and we love you.
VIOLET
Thank you, sweetheart.
Karen leans her head against her mother's shoulder, takes her
mother's hand. Off Barbara, watching this --

*
Barbara stands in the door. Closes her eyes, letting the
*
early morning sun warm her. After a long moment, Johnna
appears with a coffee mug. Barb takes it, nods her thanks.
BARBARA
Last time I spoke with my father, we
talked about the state of the world,
and he said, "You know, this country
was always pretty much a whorehouse,
but at least it used to have some
promise. Now it's just a shithole."
I think maybe he was talking about
something else, something more
specific, personal... this house? This
family? His marriage? Himself?
There was something sad in his voice--
not sad, he always sounded sad --
hopeless. As if it had already
happened. As if whatever was
disappearing had already disappeared.
And no one saw it go. This country,
this experiment, America, this hubris:
what a lament, if no one saw it go.
JOHNNA
Mrs. Fordham, are you going to
fire me?
BARBARA
What? No. But I'll understand if
you want to quit. I mean, there's
work. And then there's work.
JOHNNA
I'm familiar with this job. I can
do this job. I don't do it for you
or Mrs. Weston. Or even for Mr.
Weston. Right? I do it for me.
BARBARA
Why?
JOHNNA
I need the work.
BARBARA
Johnna, did my father say anything to
you?

Thank you. That makes me feel better.
Knowing that you can lie.
Johnna smiles.

The sun parched Indian grass and Turkey Toot are wilting but
stirred by prairie winds. Bev's old Lincoln follows a thread
of blacktop through the tall grass. Barb drives, Ivy up
front. Karen's in the back with Violet.
VIOLET
Pull the car over.
BARBARA
We'll be home in a few minutes.
VIOLET
Pull the car over.
(beat)
I'm going to be sick.
Barbara looks back, sees her mother means this literally,
pulls to the side of the road. Violet gets out quickly.
We stay with Barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares
across the road, waiting for Violet, who can be heard
retching. Karen and Ivy still in the car.

The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a
long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home.
Her expression is unreadable, enigmatic.
Then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of Violet
running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass.
Barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees Violet
running through the field.
BARBARA
Mom?
Violet keeps running.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Mom?!
Where are you going?
Barbara watches for another moment.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Goddamn it. Mom!
Barbara takes off after her. Ivy and Karen climb out, but
don't follow. Shield their eyes to watch the chase.
It's an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass.
One almost seventy, the other nearing fifty.
Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her
shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly. Then realizes
that Violet is not stopping... not unless Barbara stops her.
Violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes
down. Barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses. They
lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Where the fuck are you going, Mom?
And now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant
horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky.
Barb and Violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
There's nowhere to go.

Barb pulls the Lincoln in beside Charlie's Caddie and Ivy's
Honda. Shuts off the engine. Ivy and Karen climb out, start
back for the house. Barbara turns to Violet.

Truce.
They take a long moment, then --

BARBARA
What now?
VIOLET
How do you mean?
BARBARA
Don't you think you should at least
consider a rehab center?
Karen turns, realizing they're not following. Should she go
back to the car? She decides no, continues inside.
VIOLET
I can't go through that again. No, I
can do this. You got rid of my pills,
right?
BARBARA
All we could find.
VIOLET
I don't have that many hiding places.

want you to know, you're not alone.
If you need any help --
VIOLET
I don't need help.
BARBARA
I want to help.
VIOLET
I don't need your help.
BARBARA
Mom.
VIOLET
I don't need your help. I've gotten
myself through some... I know how this
goes: once all the talking's through,
people go back to their own nonsense.
I know that. So, don't worry about me.
I'll manage. I get by.
Violet gets out, heads inside.
Barbara watches her go.

It's late, the house still. We MOVE through dark rooms,
drawn to the murmur of SOUND and a faint sound coming from
outside the kitchen --

Slowly DISCOVER: Jean and Steve sharing a joint, out by the
fence. She wears a long T-shirt; he wears sweat pants and a
sleeveless T-shirt. Both are barefoot.
STEVE
Number one by far. Want a shotgun?
(off her look)
You don't know what a shotgun is?
JEAN
I know what a shotgun is.
STEVE
Not that kind of shotgun, here. Just
put your lips right next to mine and
you inhale while I exhale.
JEAN
Okay.
He puts the joint in his mouth, lit end first. Their lips
nearly touch as he blows marijuana smoke into her mouth in a
steady stream. She nearly chokes.
STEVE
Hold it.
Don't let it out.
She finally gasps, exhales, coughs.
STEVE (CONT'D)
That's a kick, huh?
82

Karen bursts through the screen door, rushes down the steps
to Steve's waiting Ferrari, it's lights already on, engine
running. Throws her suitcase in the back.
Barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses, SLAMS into gear
and accelerates down the drive, spewing gravel as it goes.
Bill comes out, watches it disappear with Barbara.
Then:
BILL
I'm taking Jean with me, heading back
to Colorado in the morning.
But Barb's still focused on the distant Ferrari.
BILL (CONT'D)
She's too much for you right now.
BARBARA
Okay.
BILL
I'm sure you'll find a way to blame
me for all this.
BARBARA
Yeah, well...

I can't make it up to Jean right

A blistering hot late August day. The Weston house sits in
bucolic, heat-weary silence. The driveway no longer crowded
with cars. Barb stands nearly where she did the night
before, in her sweats and robe. Watching yet another car go.
Their rental, Bill behind the wheel, backing up. Jean in the
seat beside him. Jean stares blankly at her mother, as she
rolls past. Bill never looks back.
The rental heads down the drive, passing Ivy's Honda
arriving. Bill slows for a moment to let Ivy pass. Then
continues on it's way back to Tulsa and the airport.
Ivy pulls in next to Bev's big Lincoln. Climbs out.
Walks
to her sister, looks back to the rental leaving.

Where are Bill and Jean going?
Barbara doesn't answer, just stands there.

Ivy rushes to her car, still followed by Barbara.

tries to open the car door.
BARBARA
This is not my fault.
Barbara pounds on the car window.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
I didn't tell you, Mom told you!
It wasn't me, it was Mom!
The car window slides down.
IVY
There's no difference.
Ivy floors the car, roars out of the driveway, leaving Barb
standing there. After a moment, Barb turns, stares up at the
house, angry, resolute. Starts back inside.
91

Barbara is nearly catatonic as she drives, the house receding
in the rear window behind her.
A few large rain drops splatter her windshield, the rumble of
distant thunder, lightning and towering, ominous clouds in
the distance.
