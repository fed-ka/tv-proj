      FADE IN:

      EXT. PELICAN COVE MARINA. SAUSALITO, CA - DAY (D/1)11

      Light from the morning sun warms the pristine waters of 
      Sausalito s exclusive harbor, Pelican Cove.  Slips here are 
      filled with million dollar yachts; status symbols of the Bay 
      Area s rich and powerful.  A small gathering of LOCAL POLICE 
      have cordoned off a section of DOCK, isolating one of the 
      larger yachts.

      JANE and LISBON arrive and meet up with VAN PELT and a 
      noticeably peaked RIGSBY; congestion, coughing, etc.

                                  LISBON
                    What have we got?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jim Gulbrand.  CEO and founder of 
                    the software company Gaia Matrix 
                    was reported missing by his live in 
                    brother yesterday.  Local police 
                    responded to the call, but didn t 
                    check out his boat until this 
                    morning.  They found blood on the 
                    deck, but no sign of a body.

                                  LISBON
                    Why did they call us in?

                                  VAN PELT
                    The marina is privately owned, on 
                    lease from the city of Sausalito.  
                    It was local PD s choice whether to 
                    take the case.

                                  LISBON
                          (droll)
                      High-profile missing person s case?  
                    Can t imagine why they gave it up.

      Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt climb on board the yacht.  Rigsby 
      thinks about following, but has second thoughts.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    You coming?

                                  VAN PELT
                    He s not feeling well.
                          (mouths the word)
                    Stomach.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      2.
      CONTINUED:11

                                  RIGSBY
                    I m fine.

      Clearly, he is not.  Lisbon steps back.

                                  LISBON
                    Get me sick and you re working 
                      stake-outs the rest of the month.  

      Rigsby covers his mouth with his hand.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (muffled)
                    Yes, boss.

      Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt survey the crime scene; what little 
      there is of one.  Lisbon crouches over a large blood stain.

                                  LISBON
                    This is it?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Uh-huh.

                                  LISBON
                    Nothing else.  No weapon?  No sign 
                    of a struggle?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nothing.  

      Jane climbs back onto the dock, careful to avoid Rigsby, who 
      is busy coughing up something awful.  Jane walks along the 
      dock to the side of the yacht.  From his POV, he sees the 
      gangway door, noting that it s open.

      ANGLE:  Back with Lisbon and Van Pelt.  Lisbon, independent 
      of Jane, also heads toward the side of the yacht, mirroring 
      his movement.  Van Pelt follows with her note pad.

                                  LISBON
                    What else do we know about the 
                    victim?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jim Gulbrand is thirty-three years 
                    old, lives here in Sausalito, and 
                    has an estimated net worth of... 
                    whoa.  A hundred million dollars.

                                  LISBON
                    Rich.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      3.
      CONTINUED: (2)11

                                  VAN PELT
                    Very rich.  He was also recently 
                    divorced from one Kathryn Stubbs-
                    Gulbrand.

      Just as Jane did, Lisbon now notices the unlatched open 
      gangway door on the side of the boat.

      ANGLE:  Jane walks back along the dock toward the front of 
      the yacht.  Rigsby stands and makes a move to follow.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Do you need any...

      He feels the effects of the flu and sits back down.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                      Nevermind.

      Jane peers around the front of the yacht s massive hull and 
      looks at the ANCHOR CHAIN hanging taut, and notes the 
      NUMEROUS LITTLE FISH that swarm around it. 

      ANGLE:  Lisbon, again independent of Jane, mirrors his 
      movement toward the front of the yacht.

                                  LISBON
                    Did the victim have a criminal 
                    record?

                                  VAN PELT
                    No, but the company he founded, 
                    Gaia Matrix, is being investigated 
                    by the SEC on securities 
                      violations.  He was facing heavy 
                    fines and possible prison time.

      Lisbon sees the same chain hanging from the yacht s 
      hawsehole.  The same milling fish.  Then she sees Jane 
      standing on the dock, also inspecting the chain.  The two 
      share a look and realize their searches are perfectly in sync 
      with one another s -- Lisbon from the deck of the yacht, and 
      Jane from the dock.

      Van Pelt and Lisbon walk back toward the wheelhouse.  Van 
      Pelt has a realization.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                      Millionaire victim looking at time 
                    in a Federal Prison, disappears.  
                    Maybe this is all an elaborate 
                    hoax.  It would explain why there s 
                    no body.  
                                  (MORE)


                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      4.
      CONTINUED: (3)11
                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    You take a boat out and go missing, 
                    everyone will assume you re at the 
                    bottom of the ocean.  Your body and 
                    your killer are never found.

      Jane is now back on board in the wheelhouse.

                                  JANE
                    That would explain it perfectly.  

      Lisbon is in the yacht s wheelhouse playing around with the 
      various instruments at the control panel.  Jane joins her.  
      Both begin flipping switches, etc.

                                  LISBON
                    I think it s one of -- Nope.

                                  JANE
                    Mmm.  Maybe one of, uh...

                                  LISBON
                    Oh, didn t try that one.

      Jane pulls a lever and the FOGHORN BLASTS.  Rigsby grabs his 
      head in pain.  Jane pokes his head out from behind the wheel.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What are you doing?

                                  JANE
                    There s no need to drop anchor when 
                    you re tied up at a dockside.   

                                  LISBON
                    And all those fish are there for a 
                    reason.  

      Jane and Lisbon both find a switch marked  ANCHOR WINCH. 

                                    LISBON/JANE
                    Ahhh...

                                  JANE
                    Please.  After you.

      Lisbon flips the switch ACTIVATING THE WINCH.  Jane, Lisbon 
      and Van Pelt all move to the front of the yacht.  Local 
      Police and Rigsby watch from the dock as the massive anchor 
      rises above the waterline.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      5.

      Chained to it, dead as a mackerel, is the body of Jim 
      Gulbrand, somewhat gnawed upon by the fish.

      If Rigsby wasn t sick before, he is now...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. JIM GULBRAND S MANSION - DAY (D/1 CONT D)22

      A huge, sprawling, obnoxious mansion.  More space than one 
      man should be allowed to possess.

      INT. GULBRAND MANSION. DEN - DAY33

      The den has been converted into a makeshift RECORDING SPACE.  
      Guitars and amps fill corners.  Mic stands set up here and 
      there.

      Jane and Lisbon are shown in by KEITH GULBRAND (40 s).  Keith 
      is dressed in beads and linen and leather in a new age rock 
      fusion kind of style, lean and weathered like an aging rock-
      star, or someone who has lived like one for many years.

                                  KEITH GULBRAND
                    Jim and I talked every day.  I knew 
                    something was wrong when he didn t 
                    come home.

                                  LISBON
                    You live here with your brother, 
                    Keith?

                                  KEITH GULBRAND
                    For a few months.  Semi-
                      temporarily.  Jim wanted company 
                    during his divorce.

                                  LISBON
                    Tell us about your brother. 
                    What kind of people he associated 
                    with.  What drove him. 

                                  KEITH GULBRAND 
                    Jim s life was Gaia Matrix.  That s 
                    the company he started with Rick.  
                    Green platform software.  Don t ask 
                    me what that is.

                                  LISBON
                    Rick being Rick Bregman.

                                  KEITH GULBRAND
                    Rick and Jim are best friends from 
                    grade school.  Built the whole 
                    empire out of our parent s garage. 
                    At the time I was totally bummed.

                    drum kit now?  Little did I know.

                                  LISBON
                    Your brother and Mr. Bregman were 
                    also being investigated by the SEC 
                    for securities violations.

                                  KEVIN GULBRAND
                    Yeah.  Wild uh?  They said he was 
                      manipulating the company s stock 
                    price or whatever, but that s crap.  
                    Jim s the most honest person I 
                    know.  Eccentric, intense, honest. 
                    That was Jim.

      Jane scans a few wall PHOTOS leftover from the days when this 
      room was used as a den; Jim and Rick Bregman together in 
      front of the Gaia Matrix offices.  Jim skippering his yacht.  
      Jim and Keith some years back.

                    What about his personal life?  Was

                    Brooke Harper.  Cool woman.  For a 
                      psychiatrist.

                                  LISBON
                    She s a psychiatrist?

                                  KEITH GULBRAND
                    Yes.  Works at the Sausalito Rehab 
                    Center.  I was in there for like, a 
                    refresher course.  That s how they 
                    first met, when Jim came to visit.

                    arguments recently?

                                  KEITH GULBRAND
                    Nope.  Jim was crazy about her.  He 
                    said she s the only woman who could 
                    figure him out.  I think he was 
                    going to propose to her.

                    was a nightmare.

                                  LISBON

                    She was a giant greed head.  All 
                    she wanted was a bigger house, a 
                    bigger boat, more jewelry.

                    No.  But I m not in it for the

                    Yes it is.  But so is money.  
                    All that exists has a spiritual 
                    essence.  Or nothing does.

      psychiatrist.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Dr. Harper, how long had you been

                    here from Boston, seven months ago 
                    now.  His -- an acquaintance of his

                    Not much in the way of motive, but 
                    he doesn t have an alibi for the

      the scrip on the desk for everyone to see.

                    Last year, Gulbrand made a series 
                    of cash withdrawals from various 
                    accounts totaling ten million

      INT. RESTAURANT - DAY1414

      A high-end  ladies of leisure  place.  Spa salads and 
      Chardonnay.  Van Pelt and Rigsby approach KATHRYN STUBBS-
      GULBRAND (28) at a table with TWO WOMEN.  Kathryn is 
      beautiful, well-dressed, rich, and utterly miserable.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Kathryn Gulbrand?

                    Ma am, we have some questions 
                    regarding your ex-husband s death.

      A look of scandal between the other women at the table.  
      Kathryn clocks this.

                    Really?  You want to talk to me 
                    now?

      Rigsby, still flu-y, is in no mood for this woman.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We can question you at our station 
                    if you d prefer?

      Kathryn gives in.  She ll talk.

                                    KATHRYN
                    Fine.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Thank you, ladies.

      Which they do.  Rigsby and Van Pelt sit across from Kathryn.

                    Can I just say, for the record, 
                    that this is a total waste of time.

      Rigsby gives a stern look.

                                    KATHRYN (CONT D)
                    Fourteen months.  That s when I 
                    moved out.  The divorce was final a 
                    year ago.

                                  RIGSBY
                    How did you feel afterwards?

                    Peachy.  How do you think?

                                  RIGSBY
                    You were angry?

                    What about the settlement?  Court 
                    documents show you sued your ex-
                    husband on multiple occasions.

                                    KATHRYN
                    You bet your ass I did.  Jim tried 
                    to claim that the money he had in 
                    Gaia Matrix stock wasn t actually 
                    his, but part of the company s 
                    capital.  I disagreed, and I won.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So you weren t upset by the terms 
                    of the settlement?

                                    KATHRYN
                    Why would I be?  I got everything I 
                    wanted and more.

                                  VAN PELT
                    We have reason to believe your ex-
                    husband may have hidden money from 
                    you during the divorce proceedings.

      Kathryn shifts in her seat.

                                    KATHRYN
                    What?

                                  VAN PELT
                    He made withdrawals of ten million 
                    dollars in cash last year.  Were 
                    you aware of that?

                                    KATHRYN
                    That sonofabitch.  I knew it.  I 
                    knew he was holding out on me.  
                    That key wasn t for any damn gym 
                    locker, was it?

                                  VAN PELT
                    What key?

                                    KATHRYN
                    Last year, he started wearing a key 
                    around his neck, under his shirt.  
                    I asked him about it, and he said 
                    it was his gym locker key, but I 
                    knew it wasn t.  I knew it.

                    Half of that money is legally mine.

                    hiding something, too.  She 
                    wouldn t say who she was with at 
                    the time of the murder.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    She told us Gulbrand wore a key 
                    around his neck, that he said was 
                    for his gym locker.  Only there was 
                    no key on his body was there? 

                                  JANE
                    Ah ha!   

      Jane taps the first frame of pictures. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Brooke took the key from him.  
                    That s why she dressed up as a man.

                    So that she could get to his locker 
                    in the men s changing room at the 
                    gym. 

                                  CHO
                    But if she had found Jim s 
                    millions, she would have simply 
                    vanished then and there.  Why stay

      Jane taps the second frame of pictures -- the dress, the gun, 
      and finally, the cigars.

                                  JANE
                    Exactly.  And now she s trying to 
                    get inside somewhere else.  

1717EXT. HIDDEN HILLS BACKGAMMON CLUB  - DAY 

      CU: A cigar is lit, glowing red.

      REVEAL:  A man smokes as he waits for his car at a VALET 
      STAND outside an elegant country mansion where the super rich 
      go to mingle with their own kind.  A top class wine cellar, a 
      luxury restaurant, and a cigar bar (where as we shall see, 
      clients can keep their cigars in secure climate controlled 
      humidors).  Jane and Cho enter.

      INT. RECEPTION. HIDDEN HILLS BACKGAMMON CLUB - DAY1818

      Three Rush Limbaugh-types, planted heavily in bourbon-colored 
      leather chairs, puff away at expensive cigars as women in 
      cocktail dresses flutter past.

      ANGLE:  Jane and Cho approach the drop-dead gorgeous 
      RECEPTIONIST.  Everybody is dressed in evening wear.  There s 
      discreet, but good security.  A FLOOR MANAGER close by.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Good afternoon.  May I help you?

                    here. 

      The Receptionist looks perplexed. The FLOOR MANAGER steps in.

                    Thanks for your help.

      Jane saunters toward the steps to the main salon.  The 
      Manager steps in his path.

                    out.  You need a plan.

                                  CHO
                    We re going to need to look around

                    If we have to obtain a warrant,

                    of your members. 

      The Floor Manager takes a beat, then steps aside.

                    Welcome to the Backgammon Club.

      Jan and Cho enter the main salon...

      EXT. PELICAN COVE MARINA. SAUSALITO, CA - DAY1919

      Rigsby and Van Pelt are in a parked car.  A few rows ahead of 
      them, also sitting in a parked car, is Kathryn Stubbs.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don t get it.  What s she doing?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Maybe she likes the water.

      He reaches in back and pulls out a sandwich, takes a bite.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Feeling better?

      Rigsby finishes his mouthful before speaking. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Much.  It s weird.  I know Brooke 
                    Harper isn t a real doctor, but 
                    whatever she gave me really worked.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Good.  I was worried about you.

      Van Pelt s gazing out the window away from him.  Is that a 
      shy indication that she s reaching out to him, or is she just 
      being blandly polite? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    I um, I ve been thinking --

      A blue PORSCHE pulls into the parking lot and parks next to 
      Kathryn s car.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      30.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No.

      The owner of the Porsche climbs out.  It s Rick Bregman.

                    partner.

      Bregman climbs into the passenger seat of Kathryn s car.  
      Within seconds, they re locked in a passionate embrace.

                    And lover of the ex-wife...

      INT. HIDDEN HILLS BACKGAMMON CLUB - DAY2020

      A Sunday lunchtime crowd.  Going for the ambience of a 
      millionaire s living room in the south of France in the 
      1970 s.  Elegantly dressed people playing backgammon and 
      bridge or chatting in little groups, smoking cigars.  Jane s 
      at a backgammon board, playing opposite a suave SAUDI PRINCE 
      (in tux, not robes).  Cho sits alongside, sipping a coke, 
      scanning the room. 

      Jane throws double sixes and snatches victory at the last 
      minute. 

                                  JANE
                    Double?

      The Prince laughs through his pain.

                                  SAUDI PRINCE
                    No, you win.  Outrageous luck you 
                    have, neh?  You are a monster.  
                    What is it now?

                    Twenty thousand dollars.

      Cho does a slow take on Jane.  Jane avoids his eye.

                    If you insist.

      They start setting up the board for another game.  Cho talks 
      to Jane under his breath.

                                  CHO
                    Jane...

                                  CHO
                    You want me to spell it out?

                                  JANE
                    I m just having fun.

      Cho s about to object further, but Jane sees Brooke Harper 
      enter with a group of beautiful people, all looking fabulous, 
      dressed to the nines. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Thar she blows.

      Brooke drifts away from the group.  She doesn t know them. 
      She used them as cover to get through the door.  We now see 
      that she has a box of cigars in her hand, as well as a clutch 
      bag.  She enters an adjoining room. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Excuse me if you will, I must forgo 
                    this game.  My date is here.

                                  SAUDI PRINCE 
                    Of course. 
                          (shrugs)
                    Maybe that s lucky for me eh?  

      He takes out his wallet.

                    Twenty thousand.

      Cho s giving Jane a hard look.  Jane sighs.

                                  JANE
                          (to the Prince)
                    That s alright.  Forget it.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      32.

                    Certainly not.  You won fair and 
                    square.

                                  JANE
                    Actually, no.  I cheated.  
                      Controlled the dice.

      Jane demonstrates.  By holding and throwing the die with a 
      certain technique, he is able to roll sixes.  Then again.  
      And again...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I was going to take your money and 
                    give it to some worthy charity, but 
                    my friend here is a moralist of 
                    childish simplicity.  Good to meet 
                    you.

      He shakes hands with the astonished Prince, and walks away 
      with Cho, following Brooke. 

                                  CHO
                    You re the childish one.

      In answer, Jane pokes Cho in the ribs. 

      INT. CIGAR BAR. HIDDEN HILLS BACKGAMMON CLUB - CONTINUOUS2121

      Jane and Cho enter.  Sofas, low tables, easy chairs, 
      ashtrays, low lights.  Hunting PRINTS and a fake library.  
      People sitting about smoking cigars and drinking brandy.  

      One end of the room is lined to head height with cherrywood 
      lockers, humidors for member s personal cigar collections.  
      That s where we find Brooke.

      Jane and Cho s POV -- She very casually goes to one of the 
      lockers, and tries to open it with a key from her purse.

      Damn.  It doesn t work.  She keeps trying a couple more 
      times.  Looks at the key, checks the number.  It s the right 
      locker number alright.  Damn.  She doesn t see Jane behind 
      her.

      Offering him the cigar box, Brooke s edging around, preparing 
      to make a run for it.

                    Thanks, no.  I m told they re bad

                    It would be horrible, wouldn t it?
                      Immortality.  Imagine the boredom.

      Cho takes her wrist.

                    arresting officers.

      Brooke smiles, as the three of them stroll out together.

      Jane and Cho with Brooke Harper.  She keeps up an air of 
      amused insouciance, like she s Audrey Hepburn on a jape.  
      (We may notice Brooke s bag on the ground beside her chair.)

                                  JANE

                    Okay.  
                          (in perfect British 
                            accent)
                    My name is Angela Dalibar.  I m 
                    from Birmingham, England by way of

                                  JANE
                    I planted a GPS tracking device on 
                    you.  They re quite advanced, 
                      technologically.  No bigger than a 
                    stick of gum.

      Brooke looks down at her bag with a sense of betrayal.

                                  CHO
                    Tell us more about yourself,

                    Maybe you re just not as enigmatic 
                    and elusive as you think you are.

                                  BROOKE
                      I wouldn t be so sure of that.

                                  JANE
                    No?  You manipulate people because 
                    you take pleasure in it; you enjoy 
                    being the smartest person in the 
                    room.  You re interested in money, 
                    of course, but only so far as it 
                    allows you to continue conning 
                    people.  And you allow yourself one 
                      indulgence.  It s not men 
                      obviously.  It s not drinking, or 
                    drugs -- you fear those would 
                    impair your abilities.  You move 
                    around too much to have a pet...

      Jane studies Brooke s face intently.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I guess chocolate.  You have an 
                    almost obsessive addiction to 
                      chocolate.

      Brooke smiles.

                    So what makes you do this, Brooke?   
                    Neglected as a child?  Is this your 
                    way of getting attention?  Or is it 
                    something darker?  You were hurt by 
                    someone close.  Someone you trusted 
                    deeply.

      Brooke gives Jane nothing.

                    We ve learned that his girlfriend, 
                    Brooke Harper, is a con woman.  We 
                    believe she was after the money and 
                    may have killed Jim to get it.

      Jane pulls out the locker-sized key he took from Brooke.

                                  JANE
                    We found her with this key.  She 
                    was trying to open Gulbrand s 
                    cabinet at the Backgammon Club.  
                    The key didn t work.  Evidently she 
                    took this from Jim, but doesn t 
                    know where the money is.

      Stuart is fascinated.

                                  STUART
                    No kidding.  Wow.  That s some lady.

                                  LISBON
                    If you can help us find the money, 
                    we can prove Brooke was looking for 
                    it, and establish a motive for the 
                    murder.

      Jane tosses the key in the air and catches it, like a coin.

                                  JANE
                    So, Stuart?  Do you know where the 
                    money is?

                                  STUART
                    No.  Well, not the exact location, 
                    anyway.  Jim came to me for some 
                       outside-the-box  security advice, 
                    like you said.  He wanted to hide 
                    the money from his ex-wife.  I told 
                    him safety deposit boxes and 
                    offshore accounts can be traced 
                    rather easily, so they wouldn t be 
                    of any use.

                                  JANE
                    Where did you tell him to hide the 
                    money?

                                  STUART
                    Off the grid.  Out of the financial 
                      institutions.  Any place where a 
                    trail couldn t be established.

                                  STUART
                    No.  Anything on his property could 
                    be subject to search.  It had to be 
                    secure, obviously, hence the key.  
                    But more importantly, it had to be 
                    in a place no one would think to 
                    look.

                                  JANE
                    Hidden in plain sight.

                                  STUART
                    Yes.  But that was the extent of my 
                      involvement.  I have no idea where 
                    he actually hid the money.

                                  JANE
                    I see.

      Jane tosses the key into the air again, but this time 
        accidentally drops it on the ground where it bounces under a 
      table.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Oops.

      Jane kneels down, but can t reach the key.  He has to lie 
      flat on his stomach right beside Stuart in order to reach 
      beneath the table.  Once the key is in hand, he climbs up.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Don t want to lose that now, do we?

                    doesn t know exactly.  And the

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - DAY2828

      Brooke is in the interrogation room.  Jane enters and puts 
      down the locker key on the table, along with a file, 
      unopened.

                                  JANE

                    I m all ears.

                                  JANE
                    Two weeks ago, you took the locker 
                    key from around Jim s neck while he 
                    was sleeping, and replaced it with 
                    an identical one, so Jim was none 
                    the wiser.  But when you went to 
                    open his locker at the gym, the key 
                    didn t fit.  The money must be 
                    hidden somewhere else.  But where?   
                    Last Friday, you got impatient, and 
                    you pushed Jim to tell where the 
                    money s hidden, but he wouldn t 
                    tell, so you got mad, and you 
                    killed him.

                                  BROOKE
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    You probably didn t mean to do it, 
                    did you?  It was an accident. 

                                  BROOKE
                    It wasn t.  I didn t do it.

                                  JANE
                    The sad thing is, for all your 
                    skills, the answer was right there 
                    in front of you and you didn t see 
                    it.  You didn t do enough research.

      Cho watches as Brooke climbs out of her car, heads around to

      figure is sitting inside.

      Cho watches as Brooke lowers a ramp and climbs inside the

      Van Pelt sees Brooke pushing Hanson her way, headed for a 
      commuter locker room.

      Van Pelt moves in, careful not to be seen.

      Brooke wheels Stuart inside the commuter locker area.  A 
      hundred sturdy numbered lockers line the wall.  

      As Brooke and Hanson approach the wall, they stop abruptly.  
      Stuart s chair is stuck up against a small step leading to 
      the lockers.

                                  STUART
                    It s the step.  I m stuck.

                    be the right place.

      Stuart, frightened and helpless, nods that he will follow her 
      commands.  Brooke slips up the step, matching the number on 
      her key, forty-four, to the corresponding locker.  She looks 
      back at Stuart, who in his terror, hasn t moved a muscle.

      Brooke turns back, slides the key into the lock and turns it.  
      It works!  The locker door swings open.  Inside, Brooke finds 
      a large duffel bag crammed down in the bottom.  She lifts the 
      bag and opens it.  Inside, is ten million dollars in cash.

      INT. TRAIN STATION - COMMUTER LOCKER AREA4545

      Brooke is busy stuffing the money back into the duffel.  
      Behind her, Stuart quietly rolls the chair back from the 
      step, keeping his eyes locked on Brooke, her back still 
      turned to him.  For a second, it looks as if Stuart might try 
      to flee.  But then...

      Stuart Hanson stands, steps up onto the locker platform, and 
      silently walks toward Brooke.

      Van Pelt reacts from her vantage point.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Oh, my...

      Brooke has her back turned to Hanson as she zips up the bag 
      of money.  Hanson silently comes up behind her, then, in one 
      swift motion, slips his hand into her coat and grabs the gun.

      Brooke spins around, but it s too late.  Stuart Hanson has 
      the gun pointed right at her.

                                  STUART
                    Hand over the money or I will kill 
                    you.

      Brooke is speechless.  She has no choice but to hand over the 
      money.  Stuart slowly backs away; the gun held discretely at 
      his side, but pointed right at Brooke.  He slips the gun into 
      his pocket and steps through the entrance of the locker room. 

      Cho is waiting with gun raised.

                    Don t move!

      Stuart turns to run out the other door, but Rigsby is there 
      with gun raised.

      Stuart drops the bag to his side and places his hands on his 
      head as Rigsby and Cho move in to make the arrest.

      ANGLE:  Brooke, who has been watching this unfold, tries to 
      quietly slip away.  But Van Pelt is right there to meet her.

      Stuart quietly sneaks up behind Gulbrand, picks up a small 
      fire extinguisher from the wheelhouse, and slams it into the 
      back of Gulbrand s head, knocking him unconscious.  Gulbrand 
      slumps over; a small trickle of blood drips onto the deck.

                    the body.

      Stuart pushes the body over the side.  Noticeably absent, is 
      the sound of the SPLASH the body would make hitting the 
      water.  Stuart peers over the bow of the boat and sees the 
      unconscious body of Jim Gulbrand hanging from the anchor -- 
      caught by his belt.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You never do that?

      Clearly, the answer is no.  Jane shakes Stuart s hand, then 
      exits.  Lisbon gives Stuart a wry smile.

                                  LISBON
                    He s a pistol, isn t he?

      She exits, leaving Stuart to ponder his fate.

      INT. CONFERENCE AREA. CBI HQ - NIGHT5555

      Brooke Harper is seated in handcuffs at the table.           
      A Uniformed Cop watches her in BG.

      Jane enters, sits down with her.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry about the cuffs.

                                  BROOKE
                    My own fault.

                                  JANE
                    I wish I could let you go again, 
                    but you know...

                                  BROOKE
                      I understand.

                                  JANE

                    than the next guy?  It ll keep on 
                    biting you in the ass. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      55.

                    So my butt will hurt occasionally.  
                    I ll still be smarter than the next 
                    guy.      

      An FBI AGENT enters.

                                  AGENT HAYES
                    Brooke Harper?

                                  BROOKE
                    No.  Jessica Waters.  That s Harper 
                    over there.

      She indicates another woman.  The Agent starts to go for it. 
      Jane stops him.

                                  JANE
                    Agent, this is Harper...

      Brooke smiles at Jane.  

                                  BROOKE
                    Worth a try.

                                  AGENT HAYES
                          (a tad irked)
                    Brooke Harper, I m Agent Fred 
                    Hayes.  I ll be in charge of

                    Detention Center in Davis.  Let s 
                    go.

      Brooke rises.

                                  BROOKE
                    See you around, Patrick.

                                  AGENT HAYES
                    I doubt that you ll being seeing 
                    much of anybody for a few years.

                                  JANE
                    I don t know about that, Agent Hayes.  
                    She s very good at what she does.

      Brooke smiles coyly back at Jane, as Agent Hayes escorts her 
      out of the room.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
