                    So what are you saying?  Someone s 
                    bribing a juror?    

      A dismissive Kalinda studies the scrap of paper as the two 
      bang out of the courthouse.  Lunch time.  Everybody rushing 
      out.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I m not saying anything.  I just 
                    found it.

                                  KALINDA
                    This could be anything.  A seating 
                    chart for a garden party.  A 
                    football line-up.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (incredulous)
                    With twelve linemen?

      Okay.  Kalinda studies the scrap again.  Investigator hat on.  
    She notices something in the top corner: something printed 
      there.  Easy to overlook.  A logo of some kind-- right on the 
      rip.  Two cartoon legs.  Cat paws. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      12.

                                    ALICIA(CONT'D)
                    What s that?

      Kalinda takes a moment.  She s seen it before.  She puts a 
      piece of paper under the scrap, draws the completion of the 
    cat paws.  A little cat waiter.  She looks up at Alicia.  
      And...  


      ...the logo matches signage on a restaurant.  The Hungry 
      Kitten.  A lunchtime dive.  Alicia and Kalinda staring up at 
    it.

                                  ALICIA
                          (smiling)
                    Come here often?

                                  KALINDA
                    Got a problem with that?


        ...knock-knock-- we re with Kalinda investigating, first 
      knocking on a suburban door near Juror #2.  It opens, and 
      Kalinda smiles:

                                  KALINDA
                    Hi, my name s Kalinda. I m sorry  
                    to bother you...  My husband and I 
                    were thinking of buying a home in 
                    the area.

    And we cut away to...    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      21.




      ...Juror #2 s suburban neighborhood, Kalinda continues:

                                  KALINDA
                    We re interested in the pre-school 
                    around the corner, and I just 
                    wanted to get a sense of the rest 
                    of the neighborhood...

      Then we cross-cut between Juror #11 and #2 s neighborhood...


    And back at the suburban house, we meet the housewife, LARA 
      (29), bored and therefore friendly.  Points to Juror #2 s 
      house:

                                  LARA
                    They re the Wolks.  She s a 
                    hairdresser.  And he-- Well, I 
                    think he s out of work.

                                  KALINDA
                    Oh, I m sorry.  It s hard times, 
                    isn t it?  But their house is 
                    lovely.  Looks like they put a lot 
                    into it.    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      22.




    And back with the housewife, Lara... 

                                  KALINDA
                    So you were saying about that 
                    house, they ve been fixing it up a 
                    bit?

                                  LARA
                    Yeah, the Wolks. Storm windows in 
                    front. New air conditioning.  They 
                    just bought a car too.  Finally.  I 
                    don t know how he does it actually--
                          (but)
                    Hey, look, there he is now.     

    The Wolk garage door opening.  A hybrid car pulling out.  A 
      moustached man driving.  DEREK WOLK (30).  

                                  LARA (CONT D)
                    That s the husband.  Derek.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      23.

      Kalinda apologizes to Lara...

                                  KALINDA
                    I m sorry.  I forgot I have to meet 
                    the realtor.

    And Kalinda backs away, starts hurriedly toward her car, 
      watching the hybrid pass.  Kalinda jumps in, roars her car to 
      life, speeds off after the hybrid, as... 


      Kalinda.  She eyes the brand new hybrid.  Now parked in a row 
    of employee spaces outside a 75-floor skyscraper.  Kalinda 
      turns to the skyscraper, and...


      A downtown bus stop.  A main hub of some kind.  A lot of 
      people.  Milling, waiting.  A bus pulls up, and...


      ...jogs carefully up the street, around the bus.  Just seeing 
      Tober.  Reaching in the Nissan window.  What s he got?

      Kalinda can see.  It s an envelope.  A thick envelope.  Tober 
      swiftly sticks it in his jacket, turns away.

      It s the pay off.  

      Kalinda is running now, seeing the Nissan pull away!  Dammit!  
      It s the pay off, and she can t tell who did it.  Kalinda 
      runs, concentrates on... 

      ...the Nissan s license plate.  But it s hard to do when 
      running.  She stops, focuses, just catches...

      ...J15.  

    The first three digits on the plate before the black Nissan 
      disappears through an intersection.  Kalinda takes out a pen, 
      writes it on her palm... J15.  While behind her, Kalinda 
      doesn t see...

      ...Calvin Tober watching her.  He saw her.  Uh-oh.      THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      46.




      Alicia exits, finds Kalinda on the courthouse steps...

                                  ALICIA
                    So we were wrong.

                                  KALINDA
                    It happens.

                                  ALICIA
                    People sometimes just look guilty.

      Kalinda shrugs when...

                                  CAROL
                    Alicia.  

      Alicia turns, finds Carol and Ray below in the parking lot.  
    She starts down to them, smiles, hugs Carol.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      52.

                    Thank you.

                                  ALICIA
                    It was all Diane.  

                                  CAROL
                    I want you to have something.

    The shoebox of letters, photos.

                    These are the people you helped 
                    today.

      Alicia smiles, sees Ray and Carol turning to their car.  And 
    her smile drops.  It s... 

      ...a black Nissan.

    Her face still, grim, Alicia takes a few paces, walks to the 
      rear of the car, looks at the license plate.  

      J15772.  

    The same prefix.  Oh fuck.  Fuck.  Alicia stares at it.  
      Looks toward sweet-faced Carol.  Looks toward that shoebox of 
      photos, letters.  

                                  CAROL (CONT'D)
                    Thank you again.  It s kind of amazing.

                                  ALICIA
                    Is it?

                                  CAROL
                    Yes.  Why?

                    Ever been to The Hungry Kitten?

                                  CAROL
                    The restaurant?  Sure.  Ray loves 
                    it.

                                  ALICIA

                    You accidentally left something.

      Alicia takes out the placemat scrap, shows it to Carol who 
      stops smiling, stares at her. 

                                  CAROL
                    What is that?

      Carol s not a good liar.  Alicia shakes her head, disgusted. 

                                  ALICIA
                    You didn t have to do it.  You 
                    would ve won.

    And Carol gets in the car.
