        In a relatively clear area, Riker suddenly 
        materializes... alone! He's woozy, but in one piece.

        It's Geordi! But he's inverted, limply hanging upside 
        down from a higher limb, one foot firmly lodged in a 
        crook... and not moving. 

                RIKER/DATA (V.O) 
            Geordi! 

      41   BACK TO SCENE 

        With difficulty, Riker and Data make their way to their 
        hapless crewmember. Geordi is motionless, maybe dead. 
        Riker reaches through the tangle. 

                RIKER 
            Geordi?! Are you conscious? 

        A beat, then Geordi smiles. Data runs a tricorder 
        nearby. 

                GEORDI 
            Do I look conscious? 

                RIKER 
            No. What are you doing?

            Tricorder is useless here, sir.

        As he begins groggily coming back to consciousness, a 
        small grown HAND WITH BLUE COLORED NAILS roughly rips 
        Riker's Starfleet communicator symbol from his uniform. 
 
      49   RIKER AND CAPTOR 

        Sitting opposite Riker on a crystalline rock is a little 
        Ferengi humanoid, LETEK, leader of this group. His eyes 
        "dart" around birdlike as he studies the Starfleet 
        insignia just taken from Riker. He is fine-boned, small 
        -- looking far different and less menacing than the 
        image transmitted to the Enterprise Main Viewer. 

      50   WIDER ANGLE 

        Two other Ferengi MOVE INTO SCENE, puffing as they drag 
        the heavy weight of Worf into the clearing to be laid 
        out alongside Geordi and Data. They are KAYRON and 
        MORDOC. At this time, Riker becomes sufficiently 
        conscious to groan. 

                LETEK 
            If he moves, kill him. 

                MORDOC 
            Letek, has what we've done broken 
            our agreement with their captain? 

                LETEK 
            We will accuse the hu-mans of 
            preparing to ambush us. It will 
            be our word against theirs and 
            who is more trustworthy, Mordoc?

      51   CLOSE ON LETEK 

        Beady-eyed and marginally blind, this dominant Ferengi 
        male examines his booty... holding it close-up because 
        of Ferengi weak eyesight. 

                LETEK 
              (to himself) 
            Hmmm. Looks like gold... 
              (gives it a lick) 
            ... tastes like gold. 

                RIKER (V.O.) 
            It is gold! 

        The alien leaps back from the unexpected sound, his whip 
        immediately in the air, poised to attack! Nearby, 
        useless to our crewmembers, are their phasers, insignias 
        and tricorders. 

      52   BACK TO SCENE 

        Riker's not going anywhere, having had a taste of the 
        Ferengi electronic whip. The alien over Riker, whip 
        ready... just as another clap of far-off THUNDER causes 
        it to howl and cover its ears in pain, as do the others! 
 
                LETEK

                LETEK 
            What part of the agreement? 

        At that, Riker eases himself up, but the alien gestures 
        him back down, the "whip" its "suggestion"...

        Upon which, Worf rolls to his feet with a LOUD and 
        frightening KLINGON GROWL. The Ferengi immediately clap 
        their hands to their ears and Worf goes for the one 
        called Mordoc nearest him. But Worf finds he has a 
        wildcat on his hands. 

      53   ANOTHER ANGLE (SPECIAL EFFECT) 

        The Ferengi called Kayron moves to aid Worf's opponent, 
        lifting his whip to strike, but Data "leaps" from his 
        prone position, moving with android speed and ease, 
        grabbing him by the wrist and pulling him at arm's 
        length off the ground. We HEAR THUNDER again, LOUDER.

                DATA 
            Careful, Commander, they're much 
            stronger than... 

        Riker finds out how much stronger -- Letek smashes Riker 
        with a savage right-cross which rolls him over twice and 
        leaves him completely unconscious. 

      55   ANOTHER ANGLE 

        Data and Worf have their hands full. 

                WORF 
              (loudly) 
            PYGMY CRETINS... ! 

        Although with hands over his ears, protecting his 
        hearing, one of the Ferengi rolls, clamps his legs 
        around the huge Klingon and brings him to the ground, 
        hard.            STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR     43. 
 
      56   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 

        The remaining two Ferengi go after Data, one hitting him 
        hard and high, the other equally hard and low -- 
        bringing Data to the ground. Letek scoops up his 
        "whip." 

                LETEK 
            Kill them. 

        It sounds no less lethal that the Ferengi says it 
        quietly. As the other two scramble for their whips: 
 
                MORDOC 
              (hissing quietly) 
            Hideous monsters! 

        Kayron and Mordoc raise their "whips" to do the job, 
        when: 

                TASHA (V. O.) 
            NOOO-O-O!! 

        All three Ferengi wheel around, as:

        small men let their "whips" drop, at Tasha's gesture. 
 
                TASHA 
            That's much better, now over 
            there... 

        Letek and his "men" back off, incredulous, as Mordoc 
        points to Tasha. 

                MORDOC 
            Is this a female? 

                KYRON 
            A hu-man... female, Letek? 

        The Ferengi are handling this with all the astonishment 
        of seeing man-eating tigers. The Ferengi squint 
        leeringly at Tasha. 

                LETEK 
              (to Riker) 
            Then it is true. You work with 
            females, arm them, and force them 
            to wear clothing? 

                MORDOC 
            How sickening.            STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT FOUR     44. 
 

        Nearly dark, as the lights weakly radiate. Beyond, the 
        Ferengi vessel is slightly better lit. 


        The Ferengi are clearly unafraid of the larger humans 
        and Tasha has had to be alert with her phaser to keep 
        them in place. But now the Ferengi have evolved a plan. 
        It begins with Letek seeming asleep -- the other two 
        suddenly striding OFF. Tasha brings her phaser up: 
 
                TASHA 
            Stop! Hold it right there! 

      61   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 

        The two Ferengi are ignoring Tasha. (We're also now 
        HEARING the mysterious THUNDER SOUND nearer and LOUDER.)

            Already set. 

        In b.g. WE SEE Letek suddenly moving for his "whip" 
        device as a baffled Tasha sends out a PHASER EFFECT 
        which heads straight for the Ferengi but then ARCS IN 
        A CURVE AND ENCIRCLES THE LARGEST NEARBY CORAL TREE.

      62   ANGLE EMPHASIZING LETEK 

        With the attention of the human on the phaser, Letek 
        snatches up his "whip" device and SNAPS it toward the 
        humans. They turn in time to the WHIP EFFECT HEADED 
        IN THEIR DIRECTION -- BUT LIKE THE PHASER EFFECT IT 
        CURVES TOWARD THE "CORAL" TREE AND DISSIPATES THERE. 
 
                LETEK 
            What is this?! 

      63   ANGLE ON HUMANS AND FERENGI 

        Neither side is certain what to do next.

        Interrupted by a BLAST OF THUNDER. Then more of the 
        strange THUNDER, CLOSER, STILL LOUDER. Pressing hands

        A SPINNING, CLEAR CRYSTALLINE SHAPE, GIVING OFF RAINBOW 
        HUES as it MOVES INTO SCENE with the Humans and the 
        Ferengi, stopping there. Then, HALF-VOICE AND 
        HALF-THUNDER RUMBLE:

        continuing from ACT FOUR FADE OUT. Both humans and 
        Ferengi astonished at the SPINNING, CLEAR CRYSTALLINE 
        SHAPE WHICH GIVES OFF RAINBOW HUES AND THE SOUND OF 
        THUNDER RUMBLING.

        Nobody's volunteering. Letek looks to Riker, then to

      68   ANGLE ON PORTAL EFFECT (OPTICAL) 

        With the LOUDEST SOUND OF ALL, A THUNDER CLAP AND 
        EXTENDED CRACKLING which cues ACCELERATED SPINNING to 
        where the CRYSTALLINE SHAPE BECOMES FUZZY AND DISSOLVES 
        INTO A TALL, THIN, AGED (make-up effect) HUMANOID FIGURE

      71   APPROPRIATE ANGLES - PER ACTION 

        The Portal Figure examines the others, then looks down 
        at itself. It speaks now in a NORMAL VOICE but with a 
        slight ECHO-CHAMBER holdover.

                LETEK 
            Deception is the way of these 
            hu-mans. We Ferengi will gladly 
            make a petition. 

        The away team members react, but Riker motions them into 
        silence. 

                RIKER 
              (to Portal) 
            We invite their petition. 

        Both Geordi and Data smile at what they perceive is

            Excellent idea, sir.

                PORTAL 
            Speak. 

        Letek thinks fast; this has happened almost too rapidly.

        The away team is desperate for Riker to make an answer 
        to this but he remains silent, awaiting the Portal 
        Figure's answer. Again the Portal gestures, but this 
        time to the Ferengi, then he turns back to Riker. 

                PORTAL 
            You have attempted deceit. Next 
            you cannot answer these accusations. 
            Do you give yourself up for

                RIKER 
              (beat; considering this) 
            Yes. If you believe those 
            accusations, you should act on 
            them. 

        The other away team members are shocked at Riker's 
        answer. Before the Portal can answer, Letek decides 
        to go for the "kill."

            They tried to kill us!

              (ignores him) 
            In overt acts of belligerance. 
            Normally, I would have destroyed 
            all of you and your ships, but 
            something confused me. 

                RIKER 
            Which was? 

                PORTAL 
            First you wanted to murder each 
            other, then you were willing to 
            help each other. 

        Letek's not one to be ignored, roughly forcing himself 
        in front of Riker, his cohorts nearby. 

                LETEK 
            What of our vessel? We knew the 
            same answer... 

                MORDOC 
            The truth is I gave those words 
            to this hu-man.               STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT FIVE         58.

                PORTAL 
              (to Riker) 
            What of them? Shall I destroy 
            them? 

                RIKER 
            Then they would learn nothing. 

                PORTAL 
            Admirable conclusion. But what 
            makes you think they will ever 
            learn, Riker? 

                RIKER 
              (beat) 
            Is this a test also? 

        The Ferengi start to intrude again, but the Portal 
        quickly silences them with a deadly wave of his hand. 
 
                PORTAL 
            In life, one is always tested. 

                RIKER 
            I find them very much as we were 
            a few hundred years ago... but 
            with the technology we have now. 
            They're very dangerous... 

                KAYRON 
              (can't help the lie) 
            Untrue! We seek friendship with 
            you... 

                RIKER 
              (unhearing; to Portal) 
            But we can hardly hate what we 
            once were. They may grow and 
            learn... 

                PORTAL 
            ... And learn ways of destroying 
            you. 

                RIKER 
            Our values require us to face that 
            possibility. What of you? With 
            your empire gone... ? 

                PORTAL 
            Even without the empire, the 
            uncivilized must be tested. 
              (sadly)

        as both angle, and in opposite directions, WARP OUT AND 
        AWAY from the mysterious, clouded planet - the "last 
        outpost" of the once-mighty Empire of Tkon, as CAMERA 
        MOVES IN on our starship, which QUICKLY RECEDES FROM 
        CAMERA into a DOT OF LIGHT as we:
