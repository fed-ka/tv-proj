A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
teenage Viking.
HICCUP
...dragons.
He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
appendage.
GOBBER
Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
I thought you'd been carried off.
Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
scattered appendages.
HICCUP
Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
muscular for their taste. They
wouldn't know what to do with all
this.
Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.
GOBBER
They need toothpicks, don't they?
Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.
HICCUP (V.O.)
The meathead with attitude and
interchangeable hands is Gobber.
I've been his apprentice ever since
I was little. Well...littler.
ON HICCUP, looking up from his work, reacting to the same
sound.
HICCUP (V.O.)
But the ultimate prize is the
dragon no one has ever seen. We
call it the--
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 9.
VIKING
Night Fury! Get down!
Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.
A noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to...
STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men.
STOICK
Either we finish them or they'll
finish us! It's the only way we'll
be rid of them! If we find the
nest and destroy it, the dragons
will leave. They'll find another
home.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 15.
He sinks his blade into a...
LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade
pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with
painted sea monsters and dragons.
STOICK (CONT'D)
(DECIDEDLY)
One more search. Before the ice
sets in.
VIKING
Those ships never come back.
STOICK
(MATTER-OF-FACT)
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?
Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts
in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.
VIKING
(FEEBLE)
Today's not good for me.
VIKING (CONT'D)
(EQUALLY FEEBLE)
I've gotta do my axe returns.
STOICK
Alright. Those who stay will look
after Hiccup.
Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
murmurs of prep and packing fill the room.
PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
To the ships!
SPITELOUT
I'm with you Stoick!
STOICK
(DRY)
That's more like it.
The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
attachment and scrapes back the bench.
GOBBER
I'll pack my undies.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 16.
STOICK
No, I need you to stay and train
some new recruits.
GOBBER
Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten
steel, razor sharp blades, lots of
time to himself...what could
possibly go wrong?
Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.
STOICK
What am I going to do with him
Gobber?
GOBBER
Put him in training with the
others.
STOICK
No, I'm serious.
GOBBER
So am I.
Stoick turns to him, glaring.
STOICK
He'd be killed before you let the
first dragon out of its cage.
GOBBER
Oh, you don't know that.
STOICK
I do know that, actually.
GOBBER
No, you don't.
STOICK
No, actually I do.
GOBBER
No you don't!
STOICK
Listen! You know what he's like.
From the time he could crawl he's
been...different. He doesn't
listen.
(MORE)
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 17.
STOICK (CONT'D)
Has the attention span of a
sparrow. I take him fishing and he
goes hunting for... for trolls.
GOBBER
(DEFENSIVE)
Trolls exist! They steal your
socks.
(DARKLY)
But only the left ones. What's with
that?
STOICK
When I was a boy...
GOBBER
(GRUMBLING)
Oh here we go.
STOICK
My father told me to bang my head
against a rock and I did it. I
thought it was crazy, but I didn't
question him. And you know what
happened?
GOBBER
You got a headache.
STOICK
That rock split in two. It taught
me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
He could crush mountains, level
forests, tame seas! Even as a boy,
I knew what I was, what I had to
become.
(BEAT)
Hiccup is not that boy.
GOBBER
You can't stop him, Stoick. You can
only prepare him.
(BEAT)
Look, I know it seems hopeless. But
the truth is you won't always be
around to protect him. He's going
to get out there again. He's
probably out there now.
ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark.
Hiccup enters to see...
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 20.
STOICK, seated on a thick slice of tree-trunk. He is slouched
over the fire-pit, stirring the coals with his axe. Embers
waft around his beard.
Hiccup tries to sneak past, up the stairs to his room. Stoick
seems none the wiser, when...
STOICK
Hiccup.
HICCUP
(CAUGHT)
Dad. Uh...
Stoick stands, takes a deep breath.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
I, uh... I have to talk to you,
Dad.
STOICK
I need to speak with you too, son.
Hiccup and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment.
HICCUP STOICK
I've decided I don't want to I think it's time you learn
fight dragons. to fight dragons.
(BEAT) (BEAT)
What? What?
STOICK (CONT'D)
You go first.
HICCUP
No, you go first.
STOICK
Alright. You get your wish. Dragon
training. You start in the morning.
HICCUP
(SCRAMBLING)
Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh,
'cause I was thinking, you know we
have a surplus of dragon-fighting
Vikings, but do we have enough
bread-making Vikings, or small home
REPAIR VIKINGS--
STOICK
--You'll need this.
Stoick hands Hiccup his axe. Hiccup avoids taking it.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 21.
HICCUP
I don't want to fight dragons.
STOICK
Come on. Yes, you do.
HICCUP
Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.
STOICK
But you will kill dragons.
HICCUP
No, I'm really very extra sure that
I won't.
STOICK
It's time Hiccup.
HICCUP
Can you not hear me?
STOICK
This is serious son!
Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags
him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight.
STOICK (CONT'D)
When you carry this axe... you
carry all of us with you. Which
means you walk like us. You talk
like us. You think like us. No more
of...
(GESTURING NON-
specifically at Hiccup)
... this.
HICCUP
You just gestured to all of me.
STOICK
Deal?
HICCUP
This conversation is feeling very
one-sided.
STOICK
DEAL?!
Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It's a no-win
argument.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 22.
HICCUP
(RESIGNED)
Deal.
Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag... and
heads for the door.
STOICK
Good. Train hard. I'll be back.
Probably.
HICCUP
And I'll be here. Maybe.
Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe.
A storm is brewing outside. The great doors rattle on their
hinges.
GOBBER (O.S.)
Alright. Where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?
The recruits are seated at a table, eating dinner by the glow
of the fire pit.
ASTRID
I mistimed my summersault dive. It
was sloppy. It threw off my
reverse tumble.
Eye rolls from the group.
RUFFNUT
(SARCASTIC)
Yeah. We noticed.
SNOTLOUT
(grabbing Astrid's hand)
No, no, you were great. That was
so 'Astrid'.
GOBBER
She's right, you have to be tough
on yourselves.
CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall,
sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.
GOBBER (CONT'D)
(glaring at Hiccup)
Where did Hiccup go wrong?
He tries to take a seat at the table...
RUFFNUT
He showed up.
TUFFNUT
He didn't get eaten.
... but the recruits keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes,
Hiccup sits at the vacant table next to them.
ASTRID
He's never where he should be.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 30.
GOBBER
Thank you, Astrid.
Gobber stands.
GOBBER (CONT'D)
You need to live and breathe this
stuff.
Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table.
GOBBER (CONT'D)
The dragon manual. Everything we
know about every dragon we know of.
A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall. Rain pours down outside.
GOBBER (CONT'D)
No attacks tonight. Study up.
Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the
book.
TUFFNUT
(you've got to be kidding)
Wait, you mean read?
RUFFNUT
While we're still alive?
SNOTLOUT
Why read words when you can just
kill the stuff the words tell you
stuff about?
FISHLEGS
Oh! I've read it like, seven times.
There's this water dragon that
sprays boiling water at your face.
And there's this other one that
buries itself for like a week...
The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.
TUFFNUT
Yeah, that sounds great. There was
a chance I was going to read
that...
RUFFNUT
...but now...
Snotlout gets up to go.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 31.
SNOTLOUT
You guys read, I'll go kill stuff.
The others follow, with Fishlegs in tow.
FISHLEGS
Oh and there's this other one that
has these spines that look like
trees...
Astrid is the last to go.
HICCUP
So I guess we'll share--
ASTRID
Read it.
She pushes it toward him and leaves.
HICCUP
All mine then. Wow, so okay. I'll
SEE YOU--
Slam.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Tomorrow.
SIGH.
DISSOLVE TO:
ON HICCUP'S HAND
OPENING the massive book. Thunder BOOMS outside. The hall is
vacant and dark, but for the few candles he's pulled
together.
Hiccup pours through page after page of strange and
frightening dragons.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Dragon classifications. Strike
class. Fear class. Mystery class.
Hiccup turns the page.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide
pools.
(MORE)
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 32.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound that
can kill a man at close range.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated
Vikings. Another page, another dragon.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor sharp wings that can
slice through full grown
trees...extremely dangerous. Kill
on sight.
The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own,
shifting and squirming in the candlelight.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at
its victim. Extremely dangerous.
The storm outside rages against the shuttered windows. Hiccup
is startled, but presses on.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on
sight.
He begins flipping through the pages. A blur of dragons...
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.
Burns its victims. Buries its
victims. Chokes its victims. Turns
its victims inside-out.
Extremely dangerous. Extremely
dangerous. Kill on sight. Kill on
sight. Kill on sight...
Hiccup finally lands upon the page he's been looking for.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Night Fury.
It's BLANK -- no image, save for a few, sparse details.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Speed unknown. Size unknown. The
unholy offspring of lightning and
death itself.
(MORE)
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 33.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Never engage this dragon. Your only
chance, hide and pray it does not
find you.
Hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of his vest and opens it to
his drawing of Toothless. He lays it over the book's blank
page and considers it.
CLOSE ON the drawing of Toothless...
MATCH CUT TO:
Hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's
covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a
candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to
the drawing of Toothless.
With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal
stick and re-draws the missing tail.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE ON
... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with
every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals.
They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered,
and dunked in a barrel.
The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in
place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a
mechanical fin.
Hiccup cuts and stitches leather, draws and shapes steel. He
works by candlelight. An overhead shot reveals what he's
building: a harness, complete with handles and foot pedals.
Hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix
himself to Toothless' saddle.
Hiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice
him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving
Astrid alone.
FISHLEGS
Hey Hiccup!
SNOTLOUT
What was that? Some kind of trick?
What did you do?
TUFFNUT
Hiccup, you're totally going to
come in first, there's no question.
HICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of
Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world.
Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and
quickly covers up his desk.
HICCUP
Dad! You're back!
He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
prosthetic fin, and other drawings.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Gobber's not here, so...
He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as
much as possible.
STOICK
I know. I came looking for you.
HICCUP
(CAUGHT)
You did?
STOICK
(STERN)
You've been keeping secrets.
Hiccup's legs give out. He slides, dragging the table's
contents with him.
HICCUP
I...have?
STOICK
Just how long did you think you
could hide it from me?
HICCUP
(IN VAIN)
I don't know what you're...
STOICK
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.
HICCUP
Oh?
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57.
STOICK
So.
(BEAT)
Let's talk about that dragon.
Blood drains from Hiccup's face.
HICCUP
Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was
going to tell you. I just didn't
know how to--
Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
You're not...upset?
STOICK
What?! I was hoping for this!
HICCUP
Uh...you were?
STOICK
And believe me, it only gets
better! Just wait til you spill a
Nadder's guts for the first time.
Hiccup's elated expression sinks.
STOICK (CONT'D)
And mount your first Gronckle head
on a spear. What a feeling!
Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him
into the wall.
STOICK (CONT'D)
You really had me going there, son.
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was
rough. I almost gave up on you!
Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all.
STOICK (CONT'D)
And all the while, you were holding
out on me! Thor almighty!
Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills
the tiny room.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 58.
STOICK (CONT'D)
(RELIEVED)
Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in
the ring, we finally have something
to talk about.
Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick
adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat.
After a long, uncomfortable silence...
STOICK (CONT'D)
Oh, I... brought you something.
He presents a horned helmet.
STOICK (CONT'D)
To keep you safe in the ring.
HICCUP
(SINCERE)
Wow. Thanks.
Hiccup accepts it, looking it over.
STOICK
Your mother would've wanted you to
have it.
(HEARTFELT)
It's half of her breast plate.
Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles.
STOICK (CONT'D)
Matching set. Keeps her close,
y'know?
Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing.
STOICK (CONT'D)
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the
deal.
Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN.
HICCUP
I should really get to bed.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 59.
STOICK HICCUP
(talking over each (talking over each
OTHER) OTHER)
Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house.
We should do this again. I'm Great. Thanks for stopping
glad I stopped by, I hope you by. And for the... the uh,
like the hat. breast hat.
STOICK
Well..uh..good night.
Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more
burdened than ever.
ON HICCUP
Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall.
SLAM! The massive doors rattle and echo. Stoick pushes past
him. He paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and
carved pillars -- a legacy of heroes, all peering down in
angered judgement.
STOICK
I should have known. I should have
seen the signs.
HICCUP
Dad.
STOICK
We had a deal!
Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS
and resumes pacing, repeating the cycle.
HICCUP
(FLUSTERED)
I know we did... but that was
before... ughh, it's all so messed
up.
STOICK
So everything in the ring. A
trick? A lie?
He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting
back words.
HICCUP
I screwed up. I should have told
you before now. Take this out on
me, be mad at me, but please...
just don't hurt Toothless.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 77.
STOICK
The dragon? That's what you're
worried about? Not the people you
almost killed?!
HICCUP
He was just protecting me! He's not
dangerous.
STOICK
They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!
HICCUP
And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM!
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to!
If they don't bring enough food
back, they'll be eaten themselves.
(BEAT)
There's something else on their
island dad...it's a dragon like--
Stoick HUFFS.
STOICK
--Their island?
He stomps back... pointing an accusing finger.
STOICK (CONT'D)
So you've been to the nest.
HICCUP
Did I say nest?
Hiccup goes silent -- he said too much.
STOICK
How did you find it?!
HICCUP
No... I didn't. Toothless did.
Only a dragon can find the island.
Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on
his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick
stomps toward the doorway.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Oh no. No, Dad. No.
Hiccup chases after him, panicked.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 78.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Dad. It's not what you think. You
don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.
He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He
has no effect whatsoever.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Dad. Please. I promise you that you
can't win this one.
Nothing.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
No. Dad. No. For once in your life,
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST LISTEN TO
ME?!
He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor.
Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned.
STOICK
You've thrown your lot in with
them. You're not a Viking.
(BEAT)
You're not my son.
Stoick pushes through the door, leaving Hiccup alone,
devastated.
STOICK (CONT'D)
(CALLING OUT)
Ready the ships!
CLOSE ON
HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow. Healing scars on his
face show that maybe a week or two have passed.
Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently.
Hiccup stirs. Opens his eyes.
HICCUP
(GROGGY)
Oh, hey Toothless.
Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges Hiccup.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you
too, bud. Now just--
Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
UPRIGHT with a YELP.
He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside
the fire pit on the main floor of his house.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
I'm in my house.
(re: Toothless, leaning
over him, excited)
You're in my house.
Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far
too big for the space.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Uh...does my dad know you're in
here?!
Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He
eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with
'happy dog' energy.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
(DISTRESSED)
Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,
come on...
Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing
that something is wrong.
He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles,
horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 102.
ON THE BARE FLOOR
His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical
prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious
spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.
Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing
the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly
aware of what Hiccup is going through.
Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on
it. He winces and stifles the pain...
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Okay...okay...
... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches
Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up,
stabilizing him.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Thanks bud.
Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps
together.
Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make
their way toward the door.
Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),
revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to
Toothless, alarmed.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Toothless? Stay here, bud.
Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks
outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,
revealing...
... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back.
SNOTLOUT
Come on guys, get ready! Hold on
tight! Here we go!
A class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on a
variety of dragons, pulling back the curtain on an amazing
vista in which:
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 103.
Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the
rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there
isn't a sword in sight.
Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire
onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it
into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in
his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats
his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to
check it for size.
Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him
on the step.
HICCUP
I knew it. I'm dead.
Stoick laughs.
STOICK
No, but you gave it your best shot.
He puts his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to
the transformed village.
STOICK (CONT'D)
So? What do you think?
Hiccup just shrugs, amazed.
Below, the plaza, villagers take notice.
VIKING #1
Hey look! It's Hiccup!
They rush over, surrounding him with a hero's welcome.
VIKING #2
Hiccup, how you doin' mate?
VIKING #3
It's great to see you up and about.
STOICK
(SWEETLY)
Turns out all we needed was a
little more of...
(GESTURES NON-SPECIFICALLY
AT HICCUP)
... this.
HICCUP
(PLAYING ALONG)
You just gestured to all of me.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 104.
GOBBER (O.S.)
Well. Most of you.
Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly.
GOBBER (CONT'D)
(re: the prosthetic leg)
That bit's my handiwork. With a
little Hiccup flare thrown in.
Think it'll do?
HICCUP
(bittersweet, coming to
TERMS)
I might make a few tweaks.
Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils
with a grumble.
ASTRID
That's for scaring me.
HICCUP
(PROTESTING)
What, is it always going to be this
way? Cause I...
She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and
hollers follow.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
... could get used to it.
Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and
tail.
GOBBER
Welcome home.
Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several
unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.
VIKING
Night Fury, get down!
Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst
the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a
sheepish grin.
CLOSE ON
CLOSE ON
Hiccup's prosthetic foot, snapping into the modified stirrup.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 105.
The two pieces click together, forming a single shape.
Astride Toothless, he's whole again. He rotates the pedal.
The new tail opens. Bright red with a skull and Viking horns

CUT BACK TO REVEAL...
Hiccup and Toothless, saddled up and ready to fly. Astrid
backs her Nadder into position.
HICCUP
(TO TOOTHLESS)
You ready?
Toothless SNORTS an excited 'yes!'
From his mount, Hiccup looks out over the changed world.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It snows nine months of the year...
and hails the other three.
They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid

While other places have...ponies or
parrots, we have...
Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky,
rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with
blazing, multicolored dragons.
Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the
blinding sun.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(PROUDLY)
... dragons.
