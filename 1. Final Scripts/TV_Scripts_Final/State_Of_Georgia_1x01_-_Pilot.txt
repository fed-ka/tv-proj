                                        SCENE A

  INT. SAKS DRESSING ROOM - DAY

  WE PAN DOWN A LINE OF STALL DOORS.  THE FIRST OPENS AND A 
  SKINNY, PRETTY GIRL EMERGES, MODELING HER TIGHT JEANS.  THE 
  SECOND OPENS AND HER ATTRACTIVE, SKINNY FRIEND COMES OUT, 
  BUTTONING THE CUFF OF A CLINGY BLOUSE.  THE THIRD OPENS AND YET 
  ANOTHER GIRL STRUTS OUT, ADJUSTING A FITTED JACKET.  AND THEN WE 
  ARRIVE AT THE FOURTH DOOR... WHICH STAYS SHUT.  AFTER A MOMENT, 
  THE OTHER THREE GIRLS CROWD AROUND.

                                  GIRL #1

                Cassie?  You coming?

                                  GIRL #2

                We were going up to Five to try on 

                dresses.

                                  CASSIE (O.S.)

                You guys go.  I'll meet you down here 

                later.

                                  GIRL #3

                  (BRIGHTLY)  Okay!

  THE THREE OF THEM RUN OFF.

  INT. STALL - CONTINUOUS

  INSIDE IS CASSIE, A BIG GIRL IN A SHAPELESS, FRUMPY OUTFIT.  
  BESIDE HER ARE STACKS OF CLOTHES SHE'LL NEVER FIT INTO.  SHE 
  LOOKS AT A PAIR OF JEANS RUEFULLY AND TUGS AT THE HEM OF HER 
  SHIRT.

  SUDDENLY THE DOOR FLIES OPEN AND THE STALL IS FILLED WITH LIGHT.  
  GEORGIA STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, BIG, CURVY, CONFIDENT AND 
  GORGEOUS.  CASSIE LOOKS UP, SURPRISED.

                                  CASSIE

                Hey, these are private.  "The Great State of Georgia" - Third Draft - 12/5/082.


                                    GEORGIA

                Not for the girl with the employee key.  

                Listen, I've got to leave for an audition 

                in five minutes, which gives me just 

                enough time to save your life.

  DURING THE FOLLOWING, SHE HELPS CASSIE INTO A BELT, APPLIES SOME 
  LIPSTICK, ETC.

                                    GEORGIA (CONT'D)

                Way I see it, you got two choices: fit in 

                or stand out.  I suggest standing out.  

                It's not always easy, but it's always 

                  interesting, and you get to eat dessert, 

                not just rent it.  For you, I recommend 

                low-cut everything, heels as high as you 

                can stand 'em, pencil skirts that hit 

                right at the knee, and a smile that says 

                  "Everything in my world is delicious -- 

                how'd you like to be next?"

  SHE TOSSES CASSIE AN ARMLOAD OF CLOTHES.

                                    GEORGIA (CONT'D)

                Try these on.  I'll be out here if you 

                need me.

  SHE CLOSES THE DOOR AND FLOUNCES AWAY, LEAVING CASSIE WONDERING 
  WHAT JUST HIT HER.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                                        ACT ONE

                                        SCENE B

  INT. CASTING OFFICE - HALLWAY - LATER

  WE TRACK DOWN A LONG HALLWAY LINED WITH ACTRESSES SITTING IN 
  FOLDING CHAIRS.  GIRL AFTER GIRL AFTER GIRL, RANGING FROM SIZE 
  ZERO ALL THE WAY UP TO SIZE TWO, EACH CLUTCHING HER SCRIPT 
  PAGES, EACH PRIMPING NERVOUSLY.

  ONE REAPPLIES HER LIPSTICK.  THE ONE NEXT TO HER ADJUSTS HER 
    WONDERBRA.  THE ONE NEXT TO HER REFASTENS THE STRAP ON HER 
  SANDAL.  ANOTHER FUSSES WITH HER EARRING.  ALL ARE DRESSED TO 
  SHOW OFF THEIR BODIES -- FOR IT IS AN AUDITION, AFTER ALL -- BUT 
  CLEARLY EACH IS WORRIED SHE DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP.

  AND THEN WE LAND ON A GIRL WHO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY OF THE 
  OTHERS, WHO SPRAWLS IN HER CHAIR PERFECTLY AT EASE.  YES, IT'S 
  GEORGIA.

                                    GEORGIA

                Well, this is it.  I have arrived.

  NEXT TO HER IS YET ANOTHER SIZE TWO STUNNER -- BUT AGAIN, THIS 
  IS A GIRL WHO DOESN'T FIT WITH ALL THE REST.  SHE WEARS NO 
  MAKEUP, HER HAIR'S A MESS, ALL HER CLOTHES ARE SOMEWHAT WRONG, 
  AND HER NERVOUSNESS ISN'T BECAUSE OF AN AUDITION -- IT'S HER 
  NATURAL STATE OF BEING.  THIS IS JO.

                                  JO

                Great.  Now can we leave?  I think 

                someone in here's eating peanuts, and my 

                throat's closing up.

  SHE MAKES SOME UNPLEASANT NASOPHARYNGEAL NOISES.

                                    GEORGIA

                Don't do that.  We talked about that.  

                Just behave.

                                  JO

                I'm worried about work.  We have to get 

                back.  I don't like lying to people.  "The Great State of Georgia" - Third Draft - 12/5/084.


                                    GEORGIA

                Relax.  I took care of all that.

                                  JO

                Yeah, I don't like how you "took care of 

                all that."

                                                                    FLASH BACK TO:  "The Great State of Georgia" - Third Draft - 12/5/085.

  INT. SAKS PERFUME COUNTER - EARLIER THAT DAY

  GEORGIA AND JO ARE STATIONED BY THE DOORS.  AS CUSTOMERS ENTER, 
  THE GIRLS APPROACH THEM WITH PERFUME SPRITZERS.

                                    GEORGIA

                Would you like to sample Curious by 

                Britney Spears?  New fragrance?  Curious?

                                  JO

                (TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER)  Try Magic, by 

                Celine Dion?  New fragrance?  Magic?

                                    GEORGIA

                (HISSES TO JO)  We have to get out of 

                here.

                                  JO

                (HISSES BACK)  We're working.

                                    GEORGIA

                I have an audition.  And this is not what 

                I meant when I said I was coming to New 

                York to find my destiny.

  ANOTHER SPRITZER PASSES BY.

                                  SPRITZER

                Try Destiny, by Elizabeth Arden?  New 

                  fragrance?  Destiny?

                                  JO

                Our break's at three.  We can go then.

                                    GEORGIA

                Someone else will have gotten my part by 

                then.  We have to go to Plan B.  "The Great State of Georgia" - Third Draft - 12/5/086.


                                  JO

                No no.  Not Plan B.

                                    GEORGIA

                Come on.  You fake an allergy attack, and 

                I'll say I have to take you to the 

                  emergency room.  

                                  JO

                No.

                                    GEORGIA

                Do you not understand how important this 

                is?  Trent Pierce is Broadway's top 

                  heterosexual casting director.  And Lola in 

                Damn Yankees is my signature role.  When I 

                did it back home, people cried -- and it 

                was a comedy!  We're going to Plan B!

                                  JO

                I hate Plan B!  I hated it when we did it 

                to get you out of gym class, I hated it 

                when we did it to get you out of bad 

                blind dates...  You're the actress -- why 

                can't you pretend to suffer?

                                    GEORGIA

                Because as gifted as I am, I cannot act a 

                rash.  Now be a team player and start 

                  coughing!

                                  JO

                No.  "The Great State of Georgia" - Third Draft - 12/5/087.


                                    GEORGIA

                Well, then you leave me no choice.

  SHE GRABS A LARGE PERFUME BOTTLE OFF A NEARBY COUNTER AND 
  SPRITZES JO FULL IN THE FACE.  JO'S EYES GO WIDE.

                                  JO

                Okay, you have just killed me.  You've 

                killed me with Lovely by Sarah Jessica 

                Parker.  Soon my airway will close, and 

                there will no longer be enough oxygen for 

                me to choke out these final words.

                                    GEORGIA

                Speaking as a professional actress, I am 

                totally buying this.

                                  JO

                I'm dying!!

  GEORGIA WAVES TO A SUPERVISOR.

                                    GEORGIA

                (RE JO)  Emergency.  We're just gonna run 

                to the hospital.  Shouldn't be more than 

                an hour -- unless there are call-backs.

  AS GEORGIA LEADS JO TOWARD THE DOOR, JO PULLS SOMETHING OUT OF 
  HER PURSE.

                                  JO

                Epi-Pen -- please --

  GEORGIA TAKES IT AND STABS JO IN THE THIGH.

                You are such a good friend.

                                  JO

                Yeah, thanks again.  I still can't feel 

                my fingertips.

                                    GEORGIA

                Oh, would you hush.  (RUBBING JO'S 

                FINGERS)  Plan B always has a few 

                  lingering aftereffects.  That doesn't 

                mean it's not a good plan.

                  Actually, I suffer from Uncombable Hair 

                  Syndrome, also known as Pili trianguli et 

                  canaliculi, a rare structural anomaly of 

                the hair shaft.  In some cases it's 

                  associated with certain neurologic or 

                mental abnormalities; in my case it's 

                  associated with high IQ and social 

                  awkwardness.  I'm currently awaiting

                they cry?  Not me, sir.  See, you may 

                have a talent for casting, but I've got a 

                talent for talent.  And you ought to be 

                ashamed of yourself, speaking to a lady 

                that way.  Oh, and it's not "honey."

  INT. GEORGIA AND JO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUING

  GEORGIA AND JO ARE AS WE LEFT THEM -- JO SHEEPISH, GEORGIA 
  SHOCKED.

                                    GEORGIA

                That's it??  You just ran out of there?

                                  JO

                Yes!  Everyone had these Ivy League 

                degrees, and they've all been published, 

                and their hair is clearly combable...

                So what?  You're smarter than any of 

                them.

                                  JO

                It's not about that.  You know, when I 

                was a kid, I saw a picture in a magazine.  

                All these physicists with lab coats and 

                thick glasses and dandruff.  And I 

                  thought... these are my people!  They 

                talk the way I talk, they care about what 

                I care about...

                  (TOUCHED)  You remembered!  So I swore to 

                myself: someday I'll go on a quest to 

                find those people, and they'll accept me 

                as one of their own, and I will live

                                  AUNT HONEY

                Sorry to pop in like this.  I would never 

                want you girls to feel like your landlady 

                doesn't respect your privacy.  But I had 

                an eventful evening, and I thought it 

                best to give my gentleman caller a little 

                time to himself.

                It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

                                  AUNT HONEY

                I know.  The instructions on the package 

                say this is right around the time you're

                                    GEORGIA

                Awful.  The casting director was such a 

                pill.  Does it ever occur to these people 

                that maybe eating carbs makes you nice?

                                  AUNT HONEY

                Thanks, but this is Trent Pierce we're 

                talking about.  He may be tough, but no 

                one knows more about actors than he does.  

                So if he says I'm never going to make

                You may be on to something.  But it was a 

                mistake, and I'm here to undo it.  'Cause 

                when two people belong together, it's 

                like a force of nature.  It's elemental.

                for anyone to try and tear those two

  LUKE EXITS.  JO STARES AFTER HIM FOR A MOMENT.  THEN AUNT HONEY 
  EMERGES FROM THE KITCHEN WITH A FRESH DRINK IN HER HAND.

                no picking, there will be no devouring.

  INT. TRENT'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

  TRENT SITS ON THE FLOOR, DOZENS OF HEADSHOTS SPREAD OUT AROUND 
  HIM.  HE PICKS ONE UP, STUDIES IT -- THEN SCOWLS AND TOSSES IT 
  ASIDE.  CLEARLY, HE HASN'T FOUND HIS LOLA YET.

  THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  TRENT OPENS IT TO FIND GEORGIA, 
  BEAMING, A PICNIC BASKET LOOPED OVER HER ARM.

                Hey there!  Hope you haven't eaten yet.

  SHE BREEZES IN, TRAMPLING ON THE OTHER GIRLS' HEADSHOTS.

                Great, NASCAR in a bag.  I'm just going 

                to throw all that away.

                                    GEORGIA

                I wish you wouldn't.  My mama always 

                taught me, never waste food.

                Mmm, that smells good.  (WAVING AROMA

                Let me fetch some proper silverware.  

  AS SHE MOVES TO THE KITCHEN, SHE PASSES SEVERAL FRAMED PICTURES 
  ON THE SIDEBOARD AND PICKS ONE UP.

                her, but I'm sure she's got a lovely 

                  personality.  Have you ever felt a real 

                breast before?

                What?

                                    GEORGIA

                I'm sorry, never mind.  Sometimes I say 

                  inappropriate things when I'm hungry, and 

                that aroma is driving me wild.  (RE 

                BISCUIT)  Mind if I take the teensiest

                Yes, Luke's great, but you're talking 

                about the past.  We're in the future now.

                Wake up.

                                  JO

                You know how you always want me to tell 

                you when you're acting terminally 

                  narcissistic?  You're doing it now.  

                You're doing it a lot.  And you -- you're 

                not even there, are you?  You're gone.

  JO CLICKS OFF.  THEN HEARS A VOICE OVER HER SHOULDER:

                                    NATALIA

                Excuse me.  Why were you calling my 

                  boyfriend's apartment?

  JO SLOWLY TURNS TO FACE NATALIA, TRYING TO PLAY IT COOL.

                                  JO

                Well, hello there... tall... scary... 

                  beautiful lady... legs.

                                    NATALIA

                You were calling my boyfriend.  Why?  "The Great State of Georgia" - Third Draft - 12/5/0842.


                                  JO

                Why?  'Cause I -- am -- fumigating!  I am 

                an exterminator -- and you guys have a 

                huge ant problem up there!

                                    NATALIA

                (NARROWS HER EYES)  I've seen you before.  

                You were at that audition today, weren't 

                you?

                                  JO

                Well, yes.  But I wasn't auditioning, I 

                was -- again, fumigating!  I'm starting 

                to see a pattern here.  Maybe this 

                  boyfriend of yours is -- is an ant 

                carrier!  That is a known thing!

  NATALIA JUST STARES AT HER.  JO BURPS TWICE.

                                    NATALIA

                Why don't I believe you?

                this.

  SHE PUSHES A BUTTON -- AND THE DOORS CLOSE IN JO'S FACE.  JO 
  LOOKS AROUND FOR A BEAT, PANICKED, THEN DASHES TO THE STAIRWELL.

  WE FOLLOW NATALIA TO TRENT'S DOOR... WHERE JO STANDS, OUT OF 
  BREATH, HAVING JUST SPRINTED UP FIVE FLIGHTS TO BEAT HER. 

                                  JO

                  (PANTING; FAUX CASUAL)  Hi.

                Get out of my way.

                                  JO

                Look, you really don't want to go in 

                there.  It's like Ant Armageddon.  

                Twisted ant bodies lying around...  We 

                had to burn the village in order to save 

                it.  It's an ugly scene.

  NATALIA LOOKS AT HER FOR A BEAT, THEN LEANS IN MENACINGLY.

                think you own the world --

                                  JO

                (EYES WIDE)  No, I don't -- I really

                                    NATALIA

                 -- but if you think you're going to take 

                Trent away from me...  I will wreck you.  

                I can ruin people.  I've done it.

                                  JO

                You've got it all wrong!  I'm not an 

                actress!  I don't want a part!  It hurts 

                me even being looked at!

  NATALIA SLAPS HER.  THEN TURNS AND RINGS THE DOORBELL.

                                  JO (CONT'D)

                Ow!  That hurt, too!

  A MOMENT LATER, TRENT AND GEORGIA ANSWER THE DOOR, FULLY 
  DRESSED, MID-CONVERSATION, VERY COOL AND BUSINESSLIKE.

                                  TRENT

                at all.

                                  TRENT

                (TO NATALIA)  Hey, babe.  Come on in.  

                There's chicken on the counter.

                                    NATALIA

                What's going on here??

                                  TRENT

                This is Georgia.  She's an actress.  She 

                flew in this morning for an audition, I 

                didn't get to her today, so she had to 

                come to the apartment.

                                  JO

                Which was refreshingly ant-free, thanks 

                to me.

  A BEAT AS NATALIA CONSIDERS THIS.

                                    NATALIA

                Oh.  Well, I hope she was good. 

                                  TRENT

                She was fantastic.

                                    GEORGIA

                I was fantastic.

                Honey, I think you're gonna be calling 

                me.

  SHE SLYLY FLASHES HIM A LITTLE CLEAVAGE.  HIS BREATH CATCHES IN 
  HIS THROAT.  GEORGIA SMILES AND STEPS ONTO THE ELEVATOR.

    MEANWHILE, NATALIA'S STILL STARING AT JO, PUZZLED.  JO STOMPS ON
