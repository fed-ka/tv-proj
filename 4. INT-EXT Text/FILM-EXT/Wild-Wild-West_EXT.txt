A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop.
The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound.
SUPERIMPOSE:
1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA
But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER --
BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but
a --
SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the
horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME!
The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away,
chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange
metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die.
NEW ANGLE - MORTON
He looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running
forever.
MORTON
(mumbling)
Madman... Hideous spider... Run...
Run! Warn the President...
Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate
attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the
ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the
trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.
NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON
dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field.
Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES
straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit
everywhere! There's no stopping this thing.
NEW ANGLE - MORTON
running for his life -- stops, turns. He turns,
incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life,
cowering.
MORTON
Noooooooo!!!!!

HOOVES THUNDER by. Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels.
Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs.
As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse

West crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. The
only people more shocked than he is are the guards and
the Rebs he just dropped in on. West picks himself up,
smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws.
WEST
Okay, who just made a wish?
Was it you?
He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl, still in the
tank. She hangs on with one hand, the other hand
clutches his clothes.
WEST
I could sure use those clothes
now.
She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down. West picks it
up, with a look... uses it to cover his genitals.

Fought five long years with the

again. And you boys lost,
remember?
As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding
the hat in front of him... and whap! Down that one goes.
West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.
WEST
How 'bout some pants!?
As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap...

MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large,
very striking woman in livery.
As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make
out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer,"
DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab
are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek
of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a
cat...

West spots the contents of an open box.
Eyes widen.
CLOSE - BOX - DOZEN GLASS VIALS
stuck in sand. But clinking together ominously as the
wagon races over the cobblestones.
WEST
Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon
full of nitro...!
West tries to steady the glass vials with his hands...
but it's no use. He quickly climbs over the boxes, onto
the buckboard seat. But the reins are dragging on the
ground beneath the frothing horses.
West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the
street. He pulls himself over the first one's neck...
onto the next horse. And as he tries for the lead horse,
he falls between them!
19
20
West's custom boots drag in the dirt as he's about to be
trampled under the hooves of the freaked-out horses. And
if he hasn't got enough problems, the lynch pin attaching
the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out.

Straining with every ounce of strength in his body, he

CLOSE - WILD-EYED LEAD HORSE
West grabs for the halter.
WEST
Whoa now...!
But it doesn't whoa. The wagon goes around a corner up
on two wheels! It's about to tilt over when West grabs
both the horses' ears, yanks them back -- screaming into
them.
WEST
I said, whoa!!!
This approach seems to work.
21

The team comes to an abrupt stop... and with it the wagon
hanging over the edge of a steep drop.
Jim carefully climbs off. He slaps the dust on his
jacket, straightens the crease in his trousers. When he
looks up, a bitter smile.
WEST
Well, well, this is workin' out to
be a perfect day. My man...
HIS POV - VICTORIAN BUILDING - ACROSS STREET

Dr. Loveless is beside it, face still shadowed.
INSIDE CARRIAGE - FAIR-SKINNED BEAUTY

Can's. Her name is LIPPENREIDER. And now we'll see why.
LIPPENREIDER
(in a monotone)
Get out of my way... get out of my
way... U.S. Army... U.S. Marshal.
LOVELESS
Oh, dear...
The lip-reading is interrupted by the arrival of...
ANGLE - TOP OF INCLINE - HUDSON AND HIS HENCHMEN
who come racing up with the scientist-in-the-sack.
HUDSON
Federal agents inside, sir!
LOVELESS
So Miss Lippenreider informs me.
(sighs)
Still, I believe good manners
dictate we should send out...
His cane telescopes out and Loveless pokes the lynch pin
out of the harness on the nitro wagon. Then he gives the
wagon the slightest push.
LOVELESS
... the welcome wagon.
Once started, the wagon rolls downhill, toward the back
door of Fat-Can Candy's, picking up speed...
Then, as his female coterie pulls the burlap sack into
the carriage, Loveless steps in behind. And they're off.

West rides his magnificent black stallion down
Pennsylvania Avenue.
Besides horse-drawn carriages, West shares the dusty road
with people on bicycles -- the latest craze. He finally
pulls his steed up at his destination...
West dismounts, ties his horse to a hitching post and
winces as he puts his weight on a sore leg.
34
38
West and Gordon, walking toward the hitching post. West
is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage
stud. He glowers at Gordon who goes over to where...
ANGLE - STRANGE-LOOKING BICYCLE
Is parked on the other side of a bush. It has the
customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the
back. (Hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire.
Dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs.)
West shakes his head in disgust.

West swings into the saddle. He looks at the SNORTING
wild HORSE under him, then down at Gordon attaching the
box onto the seat of his Nitro-whatever.
WEST
(snaps off a smug
salute)
Yee-haaa!!
West spurs his horse and leaves Gordon in the proverbial
cloud of dust.
Although West's intentions are clear, for some reason,
Gordon's in no particular hurry. He sighs, climbs on the
bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles.
Then, finally ready...
GORDON
Avant!!!
VROOOM! An ENGINE KICKS IN and Gordon rockets forward.
(Yep, Artemus has invented the first motorcycle!) Fiery
exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels
him down the street at about 60 mph right past...
ANGLE ON WEST AND HIS STALLION
who both look over in wide-eyed shock. The horse rears
as Gordon SCREAMS by -- leaving them in a cloud of
internal combustion.

From in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the
spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired
Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman
pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST
us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger
cars.
Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to
catch up.

riding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of
his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the
rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see
Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to
be sewing.
WEST
Stop this train!! You hear me!?!
If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to.
He just
casually makes the next stitch.
West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the
train. At the last second, West leans over at full
gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He
swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life,
blowing in the breeze like laundry.
Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its
weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh!
He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding
partition in the roof.
40
41
West, eyes wide, is clinging on for dear life, staring at
the ties racing by, inches from his face.
42
43
West reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes
and wires on the underside of the car. As he rips one
tube out of the undercarriage...

45
Gordon appears upside down in the chair, chagrined at
his predicament. West looks from the escape trolley
Gordon was talking about back to his partner.
WEST
Only one doin' any 'egressin'

GORDON
(wide-eyed)
Perhaps the President was right
about us putting aside our petty
differences.

Suddenly they flip OUT OF FRAME and back into the car,

over.

Jim West drops to the ground from where he'd hitched a
ride underneath. He rolls into the shadows of the house.
When he stands, he's face to face with a huge GUARD with
a gun.
GUARD
You got about as much chance of
havin' an invitation as him.
He smirks at a lawn jockey.
West reaches into his coat.
WEST
Matter of fact, got it right here.
He withdraws his hand. While the Guard squints at his
empty palm, West grabs his head with his other hand and
smacks it into the lawn jockey's fist... clang! West
leans the cold-cocked Guard against the house, uses his
shoulder as a step, boosting him up to...

way through the dance floor and spots the Soiled Dove
look-alike out on the floor. West reluctantly
straightens his shoulders and cuts in. This bold move
gets some looks of disapproval from the pecan pie crowd.
ANGLE ON WEST AND SOILED DOVE RINGER

you were trying to decide what
shoes to wear tonight...
(twirl)
I found that our host, Dr.
Loveless...
West looks over to where Loveless is leading a contingent
of foreigners out a side exit.
WEST
... is meeting McGrath and his
troops at Malheureux Point in an
hour.
(bends her back)
So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna
go save the Republic.
The Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless.
Before he
goes, West leans in, smirks.
WEST
But I will say, good work on your
bladders tonight... they're damn
perky.
And just to dig the grave deeper, West lays hands on them
and gives them a little squeeze. This immediately
elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the
bejesus out of the black cowboy. And he's not the only
one.
ANGLE ON CROWD
staring at him. We know what they're thinking, but the
Mountain Man behind West says it for everyone.
GORDON/MOUNTAIN MAN
Hang him!
And with that, Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal
his own rope, which he throws to the mob. West looks
back at the character in amazement. That's Gordon?!
Before West can say or do anything, guns are at his
temple, and he's swept out of the room.

Gordon calmly straightens his coonskin cap, seemingly

the unguarded stairs to the locked room.
As he pulls out his high tech auto-wind lock-pick and
quickly gains entrance to the door...
65

Hand-held torches illuminate. The rope is tossed over a
lamp post. PAN DOWN TO where one of the mob, dressed as
GEORGE WASHINGTON, is binding West's hands behind his
back.
GEORGE WASHINGTON
Looks like we're gonna have to
teach y'all a little lesson on how
to behave in polite society.
WEST
Don't grab a white lady's boobies
at the big redneck dance. Is that
the lesson? Well, I learned it.
Don't scratch your head with the
shrimp fork. I got that one too.
So whaddaya say we call this off?
66
67
West is lifted onto the back of a wagon. With the noose
dangling in front of his nose, West addresses the crowd.
WEST
Can I have everyone's attention
please. I think we've had a
series of major misunderstandings
and I'd like to take a moment to
clear them up. First, the whole
drumming on the boobies thing.
In my native land, Africa, my
ancestors used drums to
communicate between villages. I'm
sure y'all can see that this young
girl here can communicate all the
way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on
a clear day, we might even get
Galveston. All I was saying was,
'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,'
'How's your mama?'

pot-bellied rednecks just like
y'all here.

That slavery thing, I don't see
what the big deal was. Hell, who
wouldn't want somebody to run
around for them doing chores. Are
you going to get your big, fat,
lazy ass out of bed every morning
and pick your own damn cotton.
I don't think so.
(then)
Let's head on inside and knock back
some shine. Come on, back inside.
No. Okay.
(to Soiled Dove)
I stand before you as a man who
realizes he has done something
wrong and I am prepared to do the
right thing. Will you marry me?
Soiled Dove gasps.
WEST
I'll take that as a no. Darling,
would it help at all if I said I
thought you were a man?
The CAMERA FINDS the Soiled Dove.

Nostrils flared and wild-eyed, are having their rumps

He sees his opportunity for rescue, puts a foot into the

This is Rita. I found her locked

And with that... West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands
on the back of one of the horses. He grabs a handful of
mane, leans over and unclips the harness. And with a

Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to

Dr. Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are

McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically
pensive. Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of
champagne.

Well, General, it's been a long

A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down

Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from
the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive
positions. What they can't see through the fog is...
ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK
amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds,
passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the
center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon
and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs
cheer their new weapon.

blinding light...
ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD
Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained
the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart
board appearance.
Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them. Once over
their initial shock, the Rebs FIRE BACK with their
Springfield RIFLES. But the BULLETS PING off the tank's
impenetrable skin like goober peas.

Lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large
binoculars on a stand.
General McGrath turns from the rail and faces Loveless,
outraged.
McGRATH
Why you sawed-off sadistic
bastard! You've betrayed us!
Loveless turns to him, cocks his head.
LOVELESS
My dear General, after donating
half my physical being creating a
weapon capable of doing this...
how did you and General Lee repay
my loyalty? You surrendered at
Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom?
Loveless turns to Munitia holding a steno pad.
LOVELESS
Munitia, make note. Turret speed
needs to be accelerated!
MUNITIA

McGRATH
Loveless, I demand you give the

As Munitia scribbles dutifully, McGrath shoves her aside.
He pulls his pistol.

For the last time, give them the
order to desist!
Loveless, his back to him, is seemingly unconcerned at
having a gun barrel pressed against his skull.

General, I understand your
distress. But believe me, those
men are not dying senselessly. It
is for a far greater cause than
you can imagine.

The dead men are all in the #9 or #10 ring.
Now a rider ENTERS FRAME...

West slowly dismounts, transfixed by the slaughter on the
pre-fab battlefield. There's something hauntingly familiar
about all this for him -- the mangled bodies, the tread marks...
But we'll find out about that later.
West draws his weapon and begins walking through the
victims. The pace of his search quickens when he isn't
finding what he's looking for -- General McGrath.

NEW ANGLE - GORDON AND RITA
have arrived in the one-horse carriage. Gordon is trying
to recreate the crime scene. Rita trails behind him, his
coat thrown over her shoulders, trying not to gag as she
passes the mangled corpses.
GORDON
It came up out of the lake...
from the way these corpses are
positioned, laid down a 360-degree
pattern of cannon fire... then
disappeared in moments.
(puts a foot on a body,
scratches his chin)
My God, what kind of weapon is it?
Rita can't handle Gordon's clinical posturing.
RITA
Excuse me, I think I'm going to be
sick.
As she walks quickly away, West comes over, a haunted
look on his face.
WEST
It just rolls on and on. Makes a
screeching sound -- like a wounded
animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with
a cannon... swivels 'round like an
eagle's head.
GORDON
You saw it?
WEST
Heard about it. Thought it was
crazy survivors' stories.
GORDON
What survivors? There aren't any
here.
WEST
New Liberty, Illinois -- the free
slave town just over the border.
Just one week before the War ended
in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry
that discovered it. Old men,
women, children... they used them
for target practice...

He looks out at the battlefield as if reliving it.
Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts
up. West's grim reverie is interrupted by MOANING coming
from the shoreline. They all follow the sound to find...
76
76
General McGrath, washed up on the shore. West looks down
at him. Now Rita, still looking green around the gills,
rejoins the party.
WEST
That's when I vowed to follow
McGrath to the end of the earth.
As grey as four-day-old mullet, McGrath manages a smile
for his relentless pursuer.
McGRATH
(barely audible)
What's the matter, West? Thought
you'd be happy to find me... like
this.
WEST
I was hoping to kill you myself.
RITA
That's a nice way to talk to
people.
McGRATH
You'll have to live with it... As
I've lived with the blame for New
Liberty.
McGrath fades out.
West grabs him and shakes him.
WEST
What do you mean?
McGRATH
(opens eyes)
It was Loveless... his plan. He
operated the killing machine
there. Smarter now... left it to
others here.
With the meaning of it all sinking in, West grabs McGrath
by the collar and pulls him toward him.
WEST
Where is he?
Where did he go?!

The General tries to speak. West puts his ear to the

closes his eyes for the last time.
West's shoulders sag.
Then from behind...
RITA (O.S.)
Well, I know that.
West turns to her... well?
RITA
I'll tell you if you take me
along.
WEST
(in no mood)
Just tell me.
RITA
The girls at the mansion. They
talk.

Rita gives a forlorn little wave as the TRAIN CHUGS away.

Rita disappears from view in a cloud of steam...

Loveless's TANK/TRAIN CHUGS into a mountain tunnel. The
Wanderer is just behind it... and goes into the tunnel
seconds later.
90

The Wanderer BLASTS out of the tunnel. (In the f.g. we
might notice a metal post that extends up OUT OF FRAME.)
91
92
Up on metal stilts. It lets the Wanderer pass underneath
it. Then it lowers itself back down onto the tracks.
The legs fold to the side, and the tank/train pursues its
pursuers.
93
101
West hanging upside-down. He hand-over-hands himself
back to the escape trolley. He slides his back on top of
it -- then lowers it onto the track.
Little wheels fit on the inside of the track. Once
coupled, West releases the cable and he shoots backwards
-- OUT OF FRAME.

Out the back door, we see West emerge from under the
Wanderer heading for Loveless's tank/train.

Suddenly there's a PING! BONG! PING! POP! The TEETH
of the GEARS can't take the pressure and they're flying
off the WINCH.

Off his wire tether, he flies backwards at 80 mph.
107

WANDERER - DAY
It looks like his head's about to be smashed by
Loveless's tank/train.
108
109
West slides under the train! He lies flat as the death
MACHINE ROARS over him. At the last second, he lassos
the rope around the rear axle. It slows him for a
beat... then stretches. He's gotten Gordon's trick rope.
We see his silent scream -- "Artemus!" He slides way
behind the tank/train, then springs back... past the
tank/train. Finally, West slides back underneath and
manages to grab hold of their caboose. He swings his
legs up, pulls himself around onto the step.

West makes his way forward to the smokestack. He tries
to flip the flue closed, steam scalding his hands. He
doesn't see Hudson come at him from behind. He wraps a
garrote around West's neck, pulls it tight -- practically
crushing his larynx...
111
114
West and Hudson roll around precariously. West claws
desperately at the garrote. It looks grim for our hero
until he knocks his boot heels together. CLICK... his
STILETTO BLADE appears.
Summoning his last ounce of strength, he mule-kicks...
sinking the blade into Hudson's leg. West grabs him and
shoves him head first into the smokestack. The big
Indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle.

A sea of corn tassels waving in the wind. Loveless's
destroyed train is in the b.g. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to
find...
ANGLE ON WEST AND GORDON
lying on the ground with their BACKS TO us. They stir.
West props himself up, looks over at Gordon, who has just
regained consciousness.
WEST
(mimicking him)
An innocent billiard ball this
way, but depress the number and on
impact... a sleeping-gas bomb.
West shakes his head disparagingly and stands. He feels
the metal band around his neck and surveys the 18-inch
wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle.
West is about to step over it. Gordon grabs his leg.

Loveless is sitting in his wheelchair, fifty yards from

West and Gordon.
LOVELESS
Continue, Miss Lippenreider...
MISS LIPPENREIDER
(doing both voices
in a monotone)
West. Let go of my leg! Gordon.
Listen to me. Loveless collared
us with the same metal device we
found on Morton.
Loveless turns to Munitia, who is loading two 36-inch-
diameter metal discs into what looks like a CD
changer/clay-pigeon-thrower.
LOVELESS
Oh, Munitia... I hope we're not
going to leave evidence behind
like we did last time.
MUNITIA
Nitro this time, sire.
As she arms the device, and a red light comes on...
LOVELESS
(through megaphone)
Good morning, gentlemen! I trust
you slept well.

Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita

in the stateroom.
(looks toward bedroom)
Quite lovely, isn't she? Who
knows... I might even become
'familiar' with her myself.
Gordon takes a step.
West stops him.
WEST
And that would become one more
reason why I'm going to kill you.
LOVELESS
Yes, Mr. West, I'm sure a well-
endowed blackamoor like yourself
must find it absolutely
impossible... that a freak like me
could fully enjoy the pleasure of
a woman. But having witnessed my
use of mechinology so far...
wouldn't you think I could provide
myself with something for the
lower half of my body that was
hard-pumping and indefatigably
steely?
Loveless looks O.S.
LOVELESS
... And speaking of 'hard
pumping...' Mr. Coleman, full
steam ahead!

In the engine room.
Amazonia has a gun to his head.

Other than a lack of wheelchair

in Spider Canyon...
(louder, as they
move off)
I'll be seeing President Grant
soon at Promontory Point. What
shall I tell him for you? I'm
afraid it can't be that you're
alive and well...
And as his maniacal giggle hangs in the air...
123

frustrated, as the train pulls away from them.
West tugs
at the metal collar around his neck.
WEST
Gordon, get out your little tool
kit and get this damn thing off of
me!
Gordon unbuttons his shirt to reveal his leather tool
kit... empty except for a note. Gordon opens it and
reads.
GORDON
'Gentlemen, welcome to the
Loveless Experimental Camp for
Political Dissidents. There are
no guards. No barbed wire. As
long as you stay within the
designated perimeter, you will
stay alive.'

Miss Lippenreider is still eavesdropping for Loveless,
through binos.

just bullshit? Gordon. Step over
the fence and find out. Rita and
I will put flowers on your grave

stands next to the little fence, watching Loveless
escape.
WEST
I don't have time for this.
GORDON
Wait, I have an auxiliary tool
kit!
Gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it. But
it's too late. West has jumped over the fence. Then he
hops back inside it. He holds his hands out to Gordon.
WEST
See?
Nothing happened.
West grabs Gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him
over the fence. Now they hear a slight BUZZING in the
air and it's not a bee.
NEW ANGLE - DISC
comes whipping over the corn straight for West's head.
In a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of
the corn off and banks around for a new attack.
GORDON
Oh, really...?
Now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start
running like hell through the cornfield.
WEST
Is it too late to take it off of
me now?
126

The second disc machine light turns green and the second
disc is launched.

Loveless is laughing his head off. Certain of Gordon's

West and Gordon dive to the ground... the discs just
missing them. West stands to run again. We see the back
of his head's been buzzed.
129
129
running a zigzag pattern toward the end of the cornfield.
West sees a gully fifty yards ahead of them.
GORDON
Head for that gully!
West zigs out of the cornfield one way. Gordon zags out
the other. They're both beat-up and exhausted from
running and flopping on the ground.
130
130
breathlessly reaches the edge.
And looks down.
131

It's no gully. It's a canyon that drops 100 feet down
to a ribbon of brown water. And that's not the worst of
it...
132

West is on the other side of the precipice.
They're
separated by about 15 feet of air.
They both see the discs closing in.
Think fast.
WEST
When I give the signal.
Jump off

Are you crazy?! Do you see what's

West and Gordon, caked in mud, are coming up a ridge,

Gordon turns to West, simmering, controlling himself.
GORDON
Excuse me?
WEST
Isn't that why you're here?
'Cause you're the master of,
you know, mechanical stuff?
GORDON

Oh. Oh, I see. Now I'm the master

to five minutes ago, when I was trying
to collect my thoughts and figure
out a way to get us out of these
contraptions! But no!
Gordon starts moving towards West, who is forced to back
up -- looking a tad nervous for the first time in the
movie.
GORDON
-- That wouldn't have been any
fun for a certain somebody, and I
won't mention any names -- Jim
West! -- who decided to take me on
a bracing romp through a cornfield
and play a fanciful game of hide
and seek with serrated, spinning
death discs, while our only mode

Gordon grabs a rock and smashes West's collar.
Suddenly --

West is thrown into Gordon, their collars locking.

That's odd. What did you do?

Oh, I'm peachey. Now help me get
my boot off!
First, Gordon -- trying to get some leverage -- puts his
foot in West's crotch and pulls the boot.
WEST
Ahhhh!
GORDON
Apologies, apologies.
Gordon struggles to free the writhing West from the boot
(attached to Gordon's collar).
Finally, West's foot comes free. But when he sits up
-- THWAP! His collar is sucked into Gordon's belt buckle.
West is face to face with his partner's crotch.
WEST
Do me a favor. When you're
telling this story to your
grandkids, leave this part out.

Don't worry.
West starts unbuttoning Gordon's belt.

Now, when I undo your belt,
I'm going to run as fast as I

We're going to have to discuss

Aha. My auxiliary tool kit.

GORDON
The pinnacle of my life in the
theater came in a production of

Washington. There was this one

Gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet,

West deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with
the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron
railroad tracks covered by drifting sand.
WEST
Arte... when you're right, you're

GORDON
Well I think our partnership is

West helps him up. Then, as or two heroes follow the

Don't push it.

That's the Wanderer.
Gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not

Now they hear a strange sound. To modern ears, a WHINE

rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator.
Up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes
INTO VIEW. Alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards...
all open in an Eiffel Tower-like effect.
West and Gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a
giant metal Tarantula steps over the rim in full
terrifying glory. Eight legs, five stories high.
The thorax of the giant spider bristles with Gatling guns
and all manner of weaponry. As the shadow of the monster
passes over their faces...

Now that's impressive.

Loveless is sitting in a captain's seat 60 feet in the

Munitia and Lippenreider. He spreads his arms wide,
world at his feet.

They watch the Tarantula head toward a narrow opening
between two red-rock outcroppings.
GORDON

We'll see about that. The fool

Two riders galloping TOWARD CAMERA. As they THUNDER

behind him comes... President Grant...?! (It's Artemus
in disguise, of course. And he actually can ride a
horse.)

He's reading an inscription on it.
PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)
May God continue the unity of our
country...
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd present to watch
President Grant knock in the famous spike. Behind him,
two train engines are facing each other. The detectives
scan the crowd for possible trouble.
PRESIDENT GRANT
... as this railroad unites the
two great oceans of this world.
Now he swings back the sledgehammer... but at the top of
his swing...
CLOSE - SPIKE

hole. Very curious. As it begins to hop on the ground,

look across the desert to see...
152
152
The Tarantula in full view. People start screaming
in terror as it appears over a ridge, huge even at
this distance. The metal beast closes the 200-yard
distance in seconds.
The citizens flee. The detectives are not far behind
them. The soldiers take cover and ready their weapons.
Grant stands his ground... even as a huge FOOT CLOMPS
down in front of him, VIBRATING the CAMERA.

Loveless talks into a microphone which BOOMS his
voice out through AMPLIFIED SPEAKERS.

Well, isn't this a coincidence!
I'm out for a little mornin' ride,

We've never been properly

Cool and collected, Grant lights a cigar.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Yes, Dr. Loveless, what can I do
for you today?
(to his military aides)
Flank him, left and right.
LOVELESS
I have a humble abode nearby, and
I hope you'll accept my
hospitality. I have a little
proposition to make.
PRESIDENT GRANT
What proposition is that?
LOVELESS
The unconditional and immediate
surrender of the United States of
America to the Loveless Alliance.
PRESIDENT GRANT
I didn't realize we were at war.
Loveless gives the nod to Munitia.

KABOOM! The CANNON blows the President's train to

How about now...?

The crowd who'd taken refuge behind it runs away in
panic. All but one of them. A second President Grant
(Artemus Gordon). He calmly lights a cigar on the
flaming train, strides up to the other Grant, and
shouts up at Loveless.
GORDON/GRANT
In matters of war, the person to
talk to would be me.
If there's anyone more surprised than the President
himself it's...

Loveless, squinting down at the two Grants. This new
wrinkle has also attracted the attention of the
Love-lettes and everyone else aboard.
LOVELESS
Now just who are you?
GORDON/GRANT
The President.
(turns to President,
snorts)
He's just an actor hired to stand
in for me on public occasions. A
very bad actor, I must say... a
little puffy and overweight.
As the President eyes him, puffs on his cigar,
Gordon/Grant apes his every move, bigger, mockingly.
PRESIDENT GRANT
(aside)
Gordon, you've got a lot of brass.
Where's West?
GORDON
You know him, sir...
Gordon/Grant shifts his eyes toward...

West running undetected to the rear leg. As the lone
cowboy starts to climb up toward the belly of the beast...
161

Gordon/Grant turns to an Army officer, standing behind.
GORDON/GRANT
(loudly)
Captain, get this man out of my
sight! And next time get me a
real actor!
As the bewildered captain starts to lead the President
away...
162
162
Loveless has had enough.
LOVELESS
Take them both!!!
Munitia, manning a sort of cannon, takes a bead on
the two Grants. She pulls the trigger...
163
163
... and a sticky white silk shoots out covering both
Grants with spider web material.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Well, Gordon... was this part of
your plan?
GORDON
I'm by your side, sir.
That's
what's important.
Now Munitia hits a lever and they're hoisted up off the
ground. They only get a couple of feet when... BLAM!
West shoots the mechanism and it jerks to a stop.
All eyes turn to the source of the sharpshooting...
164

West has almost reached the lowest deck. Now all the
firepower of the Tarantula is trained on him.

Amazonia's on the Gatling gun. Munitia and several other
goons on lower decks OPEN UP on West, too.

Loveless, wearing a black tunic festooned with medals
and a Prussian-style helmet with a horse hair plume,

Most expensive cup o' tea in

West's body hasn't moved. The only change is that now
a line of ants crawls across his face. We watch, hoping
for a twitch, something... But there is none. The ants
march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on
his head. If we're not convinced he's dead...

As

EXTREME CLOSEUP - WEST'S EYES
A shadow falls across them. But instead of the pecking
red beak, a human hand appears IN the FRAME. Brushes the
ants away. We hear an INDIAN INCANTATION over. Then
finally... West's eyelids flutter open.
WEST'S POV - NAVAJO SHAMAN

COLEMAN
This is diabolical! They've got

GORDON
(freaking out)
C'mon we gotta go! We gotta ride
horse! Something!
West is watching the Tarantula, turns to calm him.
WEST
No, Arte.
Right now, we need
a plan.
Gordon tries to compose himself.

PANNING an expanse of canvas comprising a 20-foot wing
span. In the b.g., we hear Gordon SCRIBBLING.
GORDON (O.S.)
Now Bernoulli's Principle states
that the air flowing over a bird's
wings... is moving at a lower
pressure than the pressure below
the wing... that's called 'lift.'
Course, it's just a theory... it's
never been tested.
NEW ANGLE - GORDON'S DRAWING
It depicts a wing cutting through the air. Arrows
indicating airflow. Circular lines indicating "life."
Only one problem, it's upside down. Gordon remedies
that. Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing
a leather flight jacket and goggles.
WEST
You're not makin' me feel any
better.
Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is
connected to the Nitro-cycle.
Coleman, his ever-present cigarette dangling from his
mouth, readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and
Gordon's design. They look like Flash Gordon's
spaceship. He passes them out.
COLEMAN
Here's a coupla bon voyage
presents.
GORDON
Coleman! Must you smoke when
handling explosives!
Gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of
the Nitro-cycle. West looks at Coleman apologetically as
he stuffs the bombs into his jacket.
WEST
He's just a little nervous 'cause
no one's ever flown before.
West is barely on the back when Gordon kicks it over and
they BLAST OUT OF FRAME.

West gives him an encouraging pat.
WEST
Avant...! Avant!!!
But their speed is not enough to get them airborne.
GORDON
We're not getting enough lift!
We need more speed!
Then in an uncharacteristic move by Gordon, he turns the
machine around and heads for the cliff.
WEST
Hey, uh... that's the cliff over
there, you know?
He guns the accelerator.
GORDON
Yes, I do know.
And with that, the Nitro-cycle goes off the cliff! It
disappears for the count of five. Then suddenly it
swoops up and PAST CAMERA. They're flying!
186

GORDON
(amazed)
It worked...? It worked!!
WEST
(looking down)
If you had to get one right, I'm
real glad it was this one.
GORDON

West-like abandon)
Yeee-haaa!
And with that, they bank the Desert Wasp around and fly
off to save the Republic.

Loveless turns to Grant, his face beaten and bruised.
LOVELESS
Mr. President, I'll ask you once
again. Sign the surrender or I
decimate this town!
PRESIDENT GRANT
You've had my answer.
Loveless's face darkens as Amazonia hands him a tray of
cotton balls.
LOVELESS
(as he puts in earplugs)
I find the sound of people
screaming while they get blown to
smithereens, ruins the ear for
music. Don't you?
He offers them to the President.
Grant swats them away.
LOVELESS
Commence firing!
And with that the Tarantula OPENS FIRE on the town.
There's a lot of stomping and smashing, too.

flight, turns to West who is more of a white-knuckler.
GORDON
I think I'll call it...
WEST
Lemme guess... an Elevation Enhancer?
GORDON

call it that?)
No, Air... Gordon.
Now West points to the Tarantula and chaos below.
WEST
Go down, down there!

GORDON
(as if to a child)
You can't just 'go down there.'
Flight depends on lift, which must
be calibrated to the angle of
descent...
WEST
Shut up and go down there, will
ya?
West reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward.
As the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the Tarantula
and Gordon strains to keep control...
190

Loveless and Grant are oblivious to our heroes above.
He
unlocks one of Grant's handcuffs, presents him with a
pen.
LOVELESS
Well, Mr. President. Have you had
enough yet? Would you like to
sign the surrender or shall we set
a course for Denver? Wichita?
Washington, perhaps?
Suddenly there's a LOUD WHOOOSH and...
191
191
DUSK
West and Gordon swooping down low. West unfastens
BOMBS from his vest, waits for the right moment. As
they swing past the Tarantula cannon, he drops them.
BOOM! BOOM! The big gun falls limp.
192
192
The dumbfounded Tarantula crew, which has been whittled

Loveless wheels his chair amid the smoke and chaos,
shocked. WARNING HORNS are GOING OFF.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Well, I'll be damned... it's West
and Gordon... flying!
Grant chuckles at the dauntless pair's pluck.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Keep that surrender handy. I
think you're going to need it!
LOVELESS
Don't be too sure...
Loveless thinks for a moment, pushes Grant out of the
way, and rolls over to the controls. He pushes a lever
and the Tarantula bends down on its knees. He barks to
Munitia.
LOVELESS
I'm through with diplomacy... Take
him away and kill him!
195

On its front knees...
196

Now its rear end is tilted up in the air giving
Amazonia at the Gatling gun a shot at...

DUSK
The BULLETS PERFORATE the Desert's Wasp's wings and BLAST
through its STRUTS. They're going down!
WEST
What does your boy da Vinci say

ever work, so he didn't get that
far. I'm open to suggestions.

West and Gordon, bruised but alive, climb off the wasp

GORDON
Sorry about that, sir. Nose up,
flaps down. Have to remember that
next time.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Son, never apologize for saving a
President's life.
As Gordon realizes that he's finally made amends for that
night long ago in Ford's Theater...
AMAZONIA (O.S.)
Soon you all can fly again. This
time with little angel wings.
West, Gordon and Grant turn to see Amazonia and
Lippenreider with the drop on them.

West, Gordon, and Grant are now under Loveless's control.
LOVELESS
Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by
your effort and ingenuity. Why
not swear an oath of loyalty to
me... and forego your executions.
WEST
Why not? Well, I guess maybe I'd
rather see what happens when I
stuff your ass into that cannon
up there and fertilize the
landscape.
GORDON
Uh, Jim, I think a polite 'no'
would suffice...
Loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens
up beneath West. He goes crashing down a story.
Loveless sics Amazonia on Gordon and Grant and proceeds
down the ramp to the level below.
LOVELESS
Lippenreider, take over the
controls.
(looks down at West)
We may not have a woodshed on
board, but that boy is gonna get a
whoopin' anyway!

Gordon tries to come to West's aid, but Amazonia points
a gun barrel at his temple. Gordon can only watch
helplessly as...
204
205
Gordon watches in a tortured sweat as his partner tries
to hold off the metal foot. But he's slowly losing.
Gordon turns to his female captors, throws his arms out
beseechingly. When he does, the derringer comes snapping
out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his
pen.
GORDON
Stop this violence!
Gordon blinks at the gun. So do Lippenreider and
Amazonia. Grant knows what to say, if Gordon doesn't.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Drop 'em.
They obey, chucking their guns overboard.
206
207
Gordon turns to see Grant gesturing at the horizon. His
eyes widen when he sees the flat mesa they are travelling
comes to a sudden halt at a 1000 foot cliff.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Let's see how clever you really
are...
Gordon frantically starts pulling this lever and that.
Meanwhile...

Gordon and Grant are trying different combinations to

He doesn't know what else to try when suddenly the
Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack
and tilts forward.

The Tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter-
totters on the brink.

It's driven finally into place to a rousing cheer. PULL
BACK to reveal that President Grant, his sleeves rolled
up, has delivered the blow.
Hats in the air, handshakes, pictures. The specter of
Loveless and his evil plot a fading memory.
Grant turns to West and Gordon.

Gentlemen, I now strongly believe
the United States is going to be

GORDON
Uh, just out of curiosity, sir...
who's Agent No. 1?
Grant just shakes his head, some things never change.
PRESIDENT GRANT
I don't think that matters very
much, do you? Gordon? Besides,
you'll have plenty of time to
discuss it on your new assignment.
(hands them piece
of paper)
See you back in Washington.
He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.
Gordon looks up, very troubled.
GORDON
But, sir... what about our train?
PRESIDENT GRANT
(over shoulder)
Well, I'm taking it of course.
Hell, you let Loveless blow up
mine.
As they look at one another in dismay...
RITA (O.S.)
Jim... Arte...?
They turn to see Rita approaching them from a crowd of
scientists. She's looking extraordinarily fetching
in a print dress and parasol.
West and Gordon sit up like dogs.
WEST
Rita!
You look great.
GORDON
Ravishing, a vision.
She hugs West, she hugs Gordon.
Who's it gonna be?

to people I still know in the
theater...
WEST
She's not really an entertainer,
remember?
RITA
(intercedes)
I can't go with either of you.
She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.
RITA
It's not that you both don't have
your attributes.
(to Gordon)
You're so sophisticated and such a
wonderful cook.
(to West)
Jim, you're good with a gun... and
have great legs.
(to both)
And you're both so brave. But...
I'm afraid I haven't been
completely honest with you.
WEST AND GORDON
Uh-oh...
RITA
Professor Escobar's not my father.
He's my husband.
She gestures to a handsome goateed Latino waiting for
her. Shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we
thought.

us that in the first place?

RITA
Well, I was going to... but would
you have really brought me along
if I said I was married?
Honestly.
Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say.
RITA
I didn't think so.
She turns and starts to walk away.
Stops and smiles.
RITA
At least you still have each
other.
As West and Gordon look at one another...
217

We gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful John
Ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices.
WEST (O.S.)
You know, Arte...
GORDON (O.S.)
What's that, Jim?
WEST (O.S.)
Maybe Rita's right...
Suddenly intruding into the f.g. is a huge metal leg.
Then another LEG CLOMPS down... and the Tarantula comes
INTO FULL VIEW. As our heroes ride slowly into the
sunset.
WEST
Besides... there's a lot of
other women in the world.
GORDON
That's easy for you to say. She
didn't walk off with your best
dress.
FADE OUT.
