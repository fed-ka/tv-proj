      Charleston zips into Virginia on her Triumph. Over this we 
      hear a NEWS REPORT.

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    European authorities are scrambling 
                    to explain the internet slowdown 
                    sweeping the continent... 


      LUCAS WRIGHT (34) pulls into a spot --

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    While in Asia, tensions are running 
                    high as North Korea prepares for 
                    another long range missile test --

      Lucas shuts off the engine, quieting the radio. He climbs out 
      of his car, not used to the ungodly hour. 

      He puts his coffee on the roof. Adjusts his tie using the 
      window reflection. Smooths down his hair. First impressions 
      are important. He turns to head for the building --

      VROOM

      Charlie races past on her bike, forcing him to jump back, 
      coffee spilling on his pants. Great.


      NICOLE FISHER (34) is out for a run. We recognize her as the 
      woman from the backseat of Charleston s nightmare. The Metal 
      cuts out as her phone rings.

                                  NICOLE
                          (answering)
                    This is Nicole.

      INTERCUT WITH CHARLESTON

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Don t tell me you re jogging.

                                  NICOLE
                    Every morning. And I get regular 
                    massages, too.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I hate you.

                                  NICOLE
                    Don t hate me, join me. Life in the 
                    private sector is awesome. Not to 
                    mention Stoker-Jacobs  ridiculous 
                    expense account.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Sorry, I m not ready to sell my 
                    soul just yet. 

                                  NICOLE
                    Well, when you are, everyone in 
                    town is going to want to hire you.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Did your guys help with the 
                      retrofitting on the USS Missouri 
                    last year?                                                                                    15.


                                  NICOLE
                    I think so. Why?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Can you have someone call me about 
                    it ASAP. I have a question about 
                    the engine upgrade.

                                  NICOLE
                    Sure. Hey, did I just see Scott 
                    Cooper doing the walk of shame 
                    outside your building?

                                  CHARLESTON
                    No comment.

      She hangs up as Brett appears in the doorway.

                                  BRETT
                    We got trouble. I m hearing rumors 
                    that the Missouri was in Chinese 
                    waters to pick up a CIA asset.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (shit)
                    Who s running the op?

                                  BRETT
                    I m working on that.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    If the Chinese find out we re 
                    exfilling an asset, they ll send 
                    the entire South Fleet to get  em 
                    back. And we start talking World 
                    War Three.

                                  BRETT
                    I ll work faster. 
                          (hesitates, then)
                    Listen, Grace s divorce just 
                    finalized --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    So?

                                  BRETT
                    So maybe cut her a little slack 
                    today.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Did she ask you to say something?                                                                                    16.


                                  BRETT
                    No. And she d kick my ass if she 
                    knew I had.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    For good reason. Grace is a tough 
                    operator. She knows how to keep her 
                    personal life at home. She doesn t 
                    need you looking out for her. And I 
                    don t need you lusting after her 
                    now that she s single --  

                                  BRETT
                    What? I m not --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Please. You ve been sizing her up 
                    every since they separated. Stick 
                    to the Congressional interns. And 
                    get me that run down on the asset.

      Chastened, he leaves, replaced by Miles.

                                  MILES
                    Swenson s here.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    Ask Lucas to get started. I ll join 
                    him in a minute. 

                                  MILES
                    He went down to IOC about the 
                    SPIRNet slowdown.
                          (off her)
                    He said you discussed it.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (annoyed)
                    We did. I told him to leave it 
                    alone. 

                                  MILES
                    I ll get him back up here.

                                  CHARLESTON
                          (as he turns)
                    Did we hear back from British Intel 
                    on the doctor?

                                  MILES
                    Not yet.

      This doesn t sit well with Charleston. She checks her watch.                                                                                    17.


                                  CHARLESTON
                    Is Porter Jefferies in town?

                                  MILES
                    You can t call him.

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I know --

                                  MILES
                      Seriously, there are strict rules --

                                  CHARLESTON
                    I know. I was just asking.
                          (off his skepticism)
                    Go away.

      Miles exits. She looks at her secure telephone -- hesitates --


      A GRAY SUV moves through traffic. 


      The SUV pulls up at the curb. A well-tailored man, PORTER 
      JEFFRIES (40), James Bond s rounder cousin, steps from a 
      doorway. He opens the back door.

                                  PORTER
                    A bit early for cloak and dagger, 
                    isn t it? 


        Establishing shot of the iconic building.


      TWO BLACKHAWKS on the Tarmac -- blades spinning. Nolan and 
      the SEALS charge inside -- loaded for war. As they take off --


      A shanty town of cement buildings and rusted tin roofs. A 
      mongrel DOG scampers across an empty street. 

      Suddenly, the night is shattered by the BLACKHAWKS landing in 
      a trash-filled FIELD -- birthing Nolan and the SEALS. As they 
      move away --


      A PREDATOR DRONE circles, keeping an eye on the team as --


      Nolan s team move up the street at a jog. Late night passers-
      by get the hell out of their way.

                                  NOLAN
                    Whole neighborhood s gonna know 
                    we re here in two minutes.

      They slow as they near the Target Location. 

                                    ADVANCE SCOUT (V.O.)
                          (on radio)
                    Alpha One. I am in the doorway on 
                    your three o clock.

      The SEALS land there, hidden from the house.

                                    ADVANCE SCOUT
                    I count one guard around the 
                    corner. At least three unfriendlies 
                    inside. Best guess, the hostage is 
                    being kept in the rear. 

                                  SEAL TEAM LEADER
                    Copy that. Prepare to breach.

      ON CHARLESTON: as she watches the team move into place -- 
      tension rising -- until -- an explosion of VIOLENCE -- the 
      guard is brought down as -- the team BREACHES the building.
