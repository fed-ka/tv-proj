    Close on IAN TRAYNOR, fifteen, athletic.  He dodges and ducks 
    with ease as a bigger boy, DEX, tries to hit him.  

    Other kids crowd around to watch the fight, including ANDREW, 
    a bespectacled kid nursing a bloody lip given to him by the 
    bully. 

                                DEX
                  Who asked you to jump in, Traynor?  
                  It s not your fight!

  Ian slaps away Dex s blows.

                                IAN
                  It is when you pick on my friends. 

  Dex throws another punch that Ian eludes.

                                IAN
                  Last warning, Dex.  Only one 
                  getting hurt here is you.  

    This infuriates Dex who charges Ian again.  

                                DEX
                  Stand still!

  Ian sidesteps, grabs Dex s arm and forces it up behind his 
    back.  Dex is restrained and not in serious pain, as long as 
  he doesn t struggle.  Like any bully, he cries out in fear at 
    suddenly finding himself helpless.  Some of the kids watching 
    look uncomfortable.

                                DEX
                        (screams in fear)
                  Let go!  Let go!                                                                                  2.



                                IAN
                  Sure.  As soon as you apologize to 
                  Andrew for knocking him down and 
                  calling him those nasty names.

                                DEX
                        (Blurts out)
                  I m sorry!  I m sorry!

    Even Andrew, the kid who was bullied, starts to show concern.

                                ANDREW
                  It s okay, Ian.

                                PRINCIPAL
                  Traynor!

  The SCHOOL PRINCIPAL hurries in, separating the two boys.

                                PRINCIPAL
                  Get your hands off him!

                                IAN
                  I didn t start it.  Dex was 
                  hitting...

                                PRINCIPAL
                  No.  That s it.  You re done.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    IAN S HOUSE - NIGHT 

    A nice middle class suburban home.  

                                MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  Suspension.  Wonderful.  How many 
                  times have we warned you, Ian?  How 
                  many?



    Ian, hastily dressed in a shirt and pants, exits the dorm 
    room.                                                                                    11.


  He walks slowly around the school grounds, very much the 
    outsider.  Through Ian s eyes we get the first glimpses of 
    this strange place.

  It is indeed a private school and a very unique one.  
    Definitely NOT Hogwarts, but a stately, somewhat austere 
    campus reeking with tradition, old money and secrets.  

    Beyond the school and dormitories can be seen high trees.  
  The school seems to have been set down in the middle of a 
    vast forest -- somewhere.  

  In the center of the school grounds is a gathering area, and 
    nearby, a high flagpole.  Flying from the top is a flag with 
    a stylized Tower on it.  Beneath the Tower is written what 
    appears to be the school motto: Excellentia per obsequium - 
    Latin for  Excellence through obedience.   One small but 
    disturbing detail, there is no state or country flag flying 
    from the pole. 

  As Ian takes this all in, he hears that familiar voice again, 
    this time over a PA system:

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  All new students, Orientation 
                  begins in fifteen minutes.  Don t 
                  be late.  

  Ian stops a passing GIRL STUDENT.

                                IAN
                  That voice, where s it coming from?

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  What, Echo?

                                IAN
                  Yes!  Echo!  Where is she?

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  Reception.  

  She points to a building.

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  Over there.

                                IAN
                  Thanks.

  As he heads for the building, the girl adds:

                                GIRL STUDENT
                  You re out of uniform.                                                                                  12.





  He turns a bend in the road and comes to an enormous FENCE.  
  No openings of any sort on it, not even a gate with a visible 
    lock.  A huge barrier preventing escape in any direction. 

  Ian backs away, his heart sinking.

                                IAN
                  Oh.  This is bad.

  Ian pulls out the paper Don gave him. He notes the directions 
  and hurries off.                                                                                  13.





  Ian hurries up to this odd-looking building.  He consults his 
    directions, then enters.   



    Ian s roommates Don, Ray and Zack are idling in front of the 
    Orientation building.  Ian runs up and angrily confronts Don. 

                                IAN
                  Hey!

                                DON
                  You re out of uniform.                                                                                  16.



                                IAN
                  Why d you send me to that, whatever 
                  that place was?  

                                DON
                  Just a joke.

                                IAN
                  Yeah.  Not funny.  

  Ian tries to enter the hall.  His roommates block him.  

                                RAY
                  You can t go in once Orientation s 
                  started.

                                IAN
                  I ll catch up.  

                                ZACK
                  It s against the rules.  

                                IAN
                  I m done listening to you guys.

  Ian shoves Zack into Don and Ray.  The roommates are caught 
  off guard and Ian is able to duck inside.  



  Ian walks the campus in the company of the older student 
    Monitor.  She has opened up a bit to Ian, but reveals no 
    useful information.  

                                MONITOR
                  The program saved my life.  Sure, 
                  it took a while to get used to, but 
                  now I see I m so much better off 
                  here than I was at home.

                                IAN
                  And where was home again?

                                MONITOR 
                  The faculty doesn t like us talking 
                  about our time before the school.  
                  Helps us stay focused. 

                                IAN
                        (dryly)
                  Right.  On our  unique potential.  

                                MONITOR
                  You re getting it. 

    Just then a wild-eyed RED-HAIRED KID runs up to Ian.  The kid 
    seems unhinged, desperate. 

                                RED
                  Hey!  Hey, new kid!  Listen to me! 

  The Monitor frowns, having encountered situations like this 
    before.

                                MONITOR
                  Oh, boy.  We got a snapper.

  The red-haired kid grabs Ian.

                                RED
                  They ll force you to follow the 
                  program.  Don t do it.  

  The Monitor moves to intercede.  She means business.

                                MONITOR
                  Back off.  One warning.                                                                                  22.



  As the Monitor reaches to grab Red, the boy grabs the Monitor 
  and flips her.  Ian is so stunned he can t react at first.  
    Suddenly Red is clutching at him again.

                                RED
                  Don t give in.  We can beat them.  
                  We can get out.  I know the way!

                                IAN
                  Where is it?

  Red suddenly regards Ian with suspicion.

                                RED
                  Oh wait, that s what I d expect you 
                  to say.  

  Ian gets creeped out as the strange boy recoils from him.

                                RED
                        (laughs)
                  I see it now.  You re with them, 
                  aren t you?  Another trick.  It 
                  won t work!

  Ian reaches out to calm the kid.

                                IAN
                  What are you...

                                RED
                  Stay away!

  Red shoves Ian down.  The hysterical redhead dashes off.

                                RED
                  Stay away!

  Ian watches as Red runs toward the woods beyond the edge of 
  the school.  The Monitor stands and helps up Ian, who looks 
  in the direction of the fleeing boy.

                                IAN
                  That happen a lot?

                                MONITOR
                  Couple times a year.  Maybe more 
                  around the holidays.  Kids get 
                  homesick, y know?

                                IAN
                        (pointed)
                  I know.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  23.

                                IAN (cont'd)
                        (nods toward the woods)
                  Now what, they sic the dogs on him?  

                                MONITOR
                No dogs.

  Ian follows the Monitor toward the school buildings.  He 
    doesn t get far before he hears a distant SIREN-LIKE SCREECH 
    rising from the woods.  The sound is alien and unnerving, a 
  human screech mixed with an electronic wail.  It comes from 
  the same direction taken by the fleeing kid.  The siren is 
    followed by A SCREAM, then silence.  

  Ian looks back at the Monitor, his eyes wide with fear.  The 
    Monitor just motions impatiently.

                                MONITOR
                  You re missing science.  



  Ian walks away from the dorms, across the common and toward 
  the trees ringing the forest.  It s starting to get dark.  
  Ian rants to himself as he walks.

                                IAN
                  No fence here, just trees.  Easy.  
                  No problem.  I trip an alarm, I ll 
                  just keep running.  Keep running 
                  until I find something.  There s 
                  always something.

  Ian enters the forest.  So far nothing happens.

                                IAN
                  This is America.  It s never more 
                  than a five minute walk to the 
                  nearest mall, or some place with a 
                  pay phone.

    Just then Ian notices the trees have taken on a labyrinth-
    like quality.  He  turns back, but he seems to have instantly 
    lost his way.  The school grounds and common can no longer be 
    seen from where he is, a stark contrast to just a few seconds 
    before.   

  Ian runs back the way he came only to encounter more trees.  
  He runs down another trail that dead ends into a thick 
    cluster of thorn bushes.  

                                IAN
                  No way.

  Ian starts back up the trail but again finds himself in 
    another unfamiliar part of the forest.  Even worse, it is 
    starting to get dark.

    Then it starts -- Ian becomes aware of a rustling noise, as 
  if creatures were moving through the trees around him.  Then 
  he hears another sound - low crackles like radio static.  Ian 
    runs off his fears mounting.                                                                                  28.



  Ian hears the rustling again, closer this time, and the 
    static, now louder.  He cranes his neck to look through the 
    trees.  He sees something and grows cold.


  IAN S POV - GNOMES

    A number of black-clad, inhuman CREATURES are slowly moving 
    through the trees.  Their heads are hidden under helmets.  
  The only discernible features are their glowing red eyes.  
  The creatures (called GNOMES by the students) communicate in 
    unintelligible static-like WHISPERS.  

  One of the Gnomes looks up, its eyes seemingly scanning the 
    surrounding woods.


  ON IAN 

    Terrified, pressing himself hard against the ground, hoping 
    against all odds to remain unseen.



  The Gnomes continue to scan the area.  Satisfied no one is 
    there, they move back the way they came.


  ON IAN

    Looking out fearfully from his hiding place.  Once he is sure 
  the Gnomes have left, he cautiously moves out.  Taking pains 
  to remain silent, he hurries back through the woods.  



  Ian finds a trail and takes it.  He runs through the trees 
  and almost pitches over the edge of a cliff.  He jumps back 
    just in time.  Far below is water, wide and black, possibly a 
    lake, possibly the ocean.  It seems to go on forever.  Off 
    Ian s scared expression, we...

                                END ACT TWO                                                                                  29.




                                PREP

                                 NEW KID 

                                ACT THREE



  Ian cautiously backs away from the edge of the cliff.  For a 
    second or two it looks like he might slide over the rim.  
    Then, regaining his footing, he turns and heads back into the 
    forest.



  Ian leads the three kids back to where he last saw the 
    Gnomes.  Sure enough, they are still in the clearing just 
    ahead.  Ian gives a hand signal to indicate how many there 
    are.  The reaction of the other kids shows they were not 
    prepared to deal with that many.  It s clear if they had 
    continued that way, they would have been caught.  Ian nods to 
  the others and they follow him away from the Gnomes.

  One the kids are a safe distance from the creatures, Ian 
    breaks the silence.

                                IAN
                  Proges?

                                C.J.
                  The kids who mindlessly buy the 
                  Headmaster s spiel.  We re 
                  different, we have potential...

                                IAN
                  Heard that.  

                                C.J.
                  Those kids are too deep into the 
                  Program to ask questions.

                                SUKI
                  Or too scared.

                                GABE
                  Finally the three of us decided to 
                  risk the forest run.  Planned it 
                  for months.

                                IAN
                  Like that kid my roommates said I 
                  replaced, Phillips.  What happened 
                  to him?

    Gabe shrugs.

                                GABE
                  The Gnomes got him, most likely.

                                IAN
                  The things in the woods?

                                GABE
                  We call them Gnomes because if we 
                  really thought about what they 
                  might be, we d start screaming.                                                                                    32.



                                IAN
                  What are they? Guards?

                                SUKI
                  Possibly.  No one s ever come back 
                  to say.    

                                GABE
                  Fun school, huh?

                                IAN
                  Like something out of a nightmare.  
                  But with those things on patrol, 
                  we re probably better off back 
                  there. 

    Suki is still reluctant to call it off.  She shows off her 
    phone.

                                SUKI 
                  Took me weeks to rework my touch 
                  phone into a GPS.  If we don t go 
                  now, we won t get another chance.

                                C.J.
                  Maybe we can circle back.

                                IAN
                  Do you know how these Gnomes 
                  maneuver?  Do they attack together, 
                  or split up?  How do they 
                  communicate?  What are their 
                  weaknesses?  Anyone know?

  The kids silence says they don t know.

                                IAN
                  You ve got to do this right.  

  Ian grows more focused as his father s words come back to 
    him.

                                IAN (CONT D)
                  Can t just lash out. Until we know 
                  what we re dealing with, we re 
                  better off watching and waiting.

    A moment of indecision from the three other kids.  Suki 
    finally nods, giving in.  C.J. steps forward.  She offers her 
    hand to Ian.

                                C.J.
                  Candice Judge.  I prefer C.J.                                                                                   33.



  She nods toward the other kids.

                                C.J.
                  I think you remember Gabe Flores 
                  from class.  

                                GABE
                  Hey.  Sorry about the fart joke.

                                IAN
                        (still a bit pissed)
                  Forget it.  

                                C.J.
                  And that s the brains of our group, 
                  Suki Sato.  

  Ian finally starts to believe he is among friends.  He smiles 
  for the first time that day.

                                IAN
                  Ian Traynor.



  The bizarre Gnomes race through the forest, their frightening 
    sirens rising.  They move like a coordinated strike team, 
    vaulting over downed trees and thick bushes.  Think storm 
    troopers mixed with ninjas.


  ON IAN AND KIDS

  Ian stands in front of the others, trying to fend off the 
    first Gnome attacker.  The figure is taller than Ian, but Ian 
    moves faster.  As the Gnome reaches to grab him, Ian 
    sidesteps, grabs the Gnome and sends him spinning into the 
  side of a tree.   

                                IAN
                      (to other kids)
                  Run!

    They all dash off through the forest.  

  As the kids run, the red lights of the other Gnomes sweep the 
    woods behind them.  The red lights glance off them and the 
    Gnomes sirens grow louder.  Suki makes a decision.  

                                SUKI
                  I got this. 

  She starts to break off from the others.  C.J. moves to stop 
    her.

                                C.J.
                  Suki!  No!

  But Suki darts around C.J., not about to be stopped.

                                SUKI
                  Whatever you hear, keep going!

    Suki dashes off to side.  She runs back a short way, then 
    hides in the trees.  She calls out:                                                                                  40.



                                SUKI
                      (in Ian s voice)
                  This way, guys!  
                      (in C.J. s voice)
                  Head to the clearing!


  ON GNOMES

  The first Gnome has rejoined the others.  They hear Suki 
    calling in different voices.

                                SUKI (O.S.)
                      (in C.J. s voice)
                  Everyone stay together!


  ON SUKI 

  She scrambles up a rock and calls out:

                                SUKI 
                      (in Gabe s voice)
                  I m right behind you!


    BACK TO GNOMES

  The lead Gnome directs a few of the Gnomes to follow the 
    voices.  They run off in search of the voice.


    BACK TO SUKI

    Smiling, she slides off the rock and runs ahead, luring the 
    pursuing Gnomes away.  

                                SUKI
                      (in Ian s voice)
                  We re home free!

    Suddenly Suki reacts with fear to something she sees ahead.  
  She quickly throws herself off the trail and hides.

    A brand new SECOND COMPANY of even MORE Gnomes, also alerted 
  by Suki s voices, runs in, just missing Suki.  This second 
    company meets up with the first company.  The two company 
    Leaders communicate in low STATIC CRACKLES.  

  In a nearby ditch, a scared Suki tries to make herself as 
    small as possible.                                                                                    41.



                                SUKI
                        (quietly, her own voice)
                Oh great, there s more.

    After a few seconds, the two companies of Gnomes move off as 
  one united larger company.  

  The second they leave, Suki leaps to her feet and runs to 
    find her friends.


  ON IAN, GABE AND C.J.

    Racing through the woods.  Ian calls back to the others:

                                IAN
                  How far is it?

                                GABE
                  Just over the hill. 

  Ian breaks away.  

                                IAN
                  Go on.  I m going back for Suki.  

  But Suki is hot on their heels.

                                SUKI
                  I m here.  The Gnomes are coming on 
                  all sides.  

  And suddenly the forest is swept with red lights from the 
    advancing Gnomes  eyes.  The creatures push in from both 
    sides, the kids caught between them.  

  Ian is ready to fly at the Gnomes, but Gabe steps forward.   

                                GABE
                  My turn.  Finally.

    Gabe starts to speak with confidence to the Gnomes.  His tone 
  is easy-going, trustworthy. A master manipulator just before 
  he takes you for everything you ve got. The Gnomes stay where 
    they are, not attacking, just waiting.  Their sirens have 
    faded to a low whine, barely audible.  

                                GABE
                  Guys, how are ya?  Look, there s 
                  obviously been a misunderstanding.  
                  We took a wrong turn after study 
                  hall, chased a sick raccoon into 
                  the woods, call it what you want...                                                                                  42.



    Gabe gestures for the other kids to start walking.  They do.  
    They head slowly into the trees and Gabe starts backing away 
    after them.   

                                GABE (CONT D)
                  ...mistakes were made.  I m the 
                  first one to admit it.  


  ON IAN AND C.J.

    Edging toward the trees.

                                IAN
                        (whispers)
                  Does this really work?

                                C.J.
                        (whispers)
                  I dunno how he does it, but yeah.  
                  Gabe can talk his way out of 
                  anything. 


    BACK TO GABE AND GNOMES

    Gabe is inching away from the Gnomes who are still hovering 
    nearby, not attacking, but not withdrawing, either.  The 
    Gnomes closest to Gabe relax slightly, standing at ease as 
    they listen to him talk.

                                GABE
                  That said, there s no reason to go 
                  screaming through the forest, we ll 
                  just head on back to campus, and 
                  you can fly back to the batcave, or 
                  wherever you guys hole up.  That 
                  cool?

  The lead Gnome notices several of his  men  relaxing their 
    fighting stances.  A burst of sharp STATIC from the Leader s 
     mouth  snaps the other Gnomes back to attention.  The Leader 
    raises his  voice  to a SHRIEKING SIREN again and the other 
    Gnomes do the same.  The Gnomes quickly dart forward to cut 
  off Ian, C.J. and Suki from escaping.

  As the Gnomes push the four in closer, the SIRENS take on the 
    strange BUZZING SOUND that he first heard over his 
    headphones.  

    Suki, C.J. And Gabe start to fall under the spell of the 
    strange droning sound.                                                                                    43.


    They lose their fear and start to weave back and forth, as if 
    they are falling into trances. Ian shakes them awake. 

                                IAN
                      (to others )
                  Don t listen! 

  The kids snap out of it and quickly slap their hands over 
    their ears.  

  Ian launches himself at the lead Gnome.  Though Ian is much 
    smaller, he manages to tackle the Gnome.  The other Gnomes 
    quickly move to close in.  Ian manages to shout to C.J.:

                                IAN
                  Run!  Trust me!

    C.J. nods back.  She and the other kids dash up the hill 
    toward the school.


  ON IAN

  For the first time we really see Ian cut loose.  It isn t 
    that he s an immensely strong fighter, but an amazingly fast 
  and agile one.  Imposing as the Gnomes are, they are too slow 
  to grab him.  Ian ducks between their legs, dodges away from 
    their blows, and when he connects, he connects HARD.  Every 
    time a Gnome pauses to get its bearings, that s when Ian 
    strikes.  Not wasting his fists on the Gnome s hard helmets, 
  he concentrates with kicks to their mid-sections.  Seeing him 
    bravely take on the Gnomes, we understand why Ian rose so 
    quickly in his karate class.  As he deftly hobbles his 
    attackers one after the other, we also understand why his 
    folks took him out.  

    Staggering the Gnomes for the moment, Ian runs off after his 
    friends.



    Gabe, Suki and C.J. have come to the edge of the forest.  
    Before them is the school common and beyond that, the 
    dormitories.  But to the kids dismay, a series of low 
    infrared SENSOR LIGHTS are sweeping over the grounds. The 
    lights sweep down in one direction, withdraw for a few 
    seconds, then swing back in a new direction.  There appears 
  to be no way to get across in time without being it by one of 
  the beams. 

                                SUKI
                  We re too late.  Security is on.                                                                                  44.



  Ian runs up to the kids.  He sees the lights and guesses 
    their purpose.

                                IAN
                  Do you know the way across?

                                C.J.
                        (shakes head)
                  We weren t planning on coming back.

    C.J. glances toward the woods.

                                C.J.
                  Now we can t.

                                GABE
                  We re screwed.

  Ian studies the sweep of the lights for a second.

                                IAN
                  Hold on.  There s a pattern to the 
                  lights.  

                                GABE 
                  You re crazy.  It s all random.

                                IAN
                  No.  I can see it.  Not sure how, 
                  but I can.   You can make it across 
                  if you stay together and do as I 
                  say. 

  Ian studies the lights again, then nods.

                                IAN
                  Get ready... 

    They wait until the lights finish their sweep.  

                                IAN
                  Three steps ahead.  Go.

    Suki, Gabe and Ceej step out onto the common.

                                IAN
                  Two steps to the left.

  The kids follow his commands.

                                IAN
                  One step right.  Stop.                                                                                  45.



    They do it perfectly.

                                IAN
                  Ten steps ahead.  Duck!

  The kids duck low as the beam sweeps over her head.  Suki 
    barely makes it.

    QUICK REACTIONS on C.J., Suki and Gabe, looking worried.  
  They stay stock still as the light sweeps back and forth 
  above them.  It passes and they straighten.

                                IAN
                  Twenty feet ahead. Stop, wait and 
                  jump.

  The kids run ahead, stop and leap as the beam sweeps under 
  them at ankle level.  At the end Gabe trips instead of jumps, 
  and comes down at a weird angle.  He bends his body in an 
    uncomfortable but funny-looking way to elude the last of the 
    beams.  Suki and Ceej reach back to yank him out of the path 
  of the last beam.  The kids collapse breathing hard but safe 
  on the other side.  


  ON IAN

  He is just starting across when one of the Gnomes darts out 
    from the forest and jumps him.  


  ON OTHER KIDS

  On the other side, the kids see this and react with alarm.  
    C.J. starts back, but Ian gestures for her to stop.

                                IAN
                  Stay there!

  The kids are concerned for Ian but unable to do anything 
    except watch.


    BACK TO IAN AND THE GNOME

    Really going at it.  The Gnome grabs Ian by both arms and 
    starts up its eerie wail again.  The creature s  face  is 
    very close to Ian s.  He bends and twists but can t get away 
    from it. 

                                IAN 
                  That s really starting to piss me 
                  off!                                                                                  46.



  Ian head-butts the creature, then fires his fist into the 
    Gnome s  mouth.   There is a crackle of static and the siren 
    shorts out.  

  Its power source seemingly corrupted, the Gnome collapses. 
  Ian bends over the strange figure.  We and Ian get a good 
  look at the thing.  It is dressed in a close-fitting black 
  suit, with thick-soled boots that make it seem taller.  Ian 
  takes hold of the helmet and pulls it off.  He sees the face 
    beneath it and swallows hard.

    Staring blankly up at Ian is the dazed face of the frantic 
    red-haired kid that ran up to him earlier that day.  The kid 
  is still breathing, but it seems like his brain has shut 
  down.  What the hell?

  Ian looks up to see distant flickering red lights in the 
    forest, drawing closer.  He picks up the Gnome s shattered 
    helmet and runs with it.


  ON SCHOOL COMMON

  Ian runs onto the lawn.  Moving deftly, he eludes the sweep 
  of the infrared lights and joins his friends on the other 
  side.  

                                GABE
                        (points to the helmet)
                  You re some awesome fighter.

                                IAN
                  I just charge in swinging.

  The kids head for their dorms.



    Ian, seen from the back, wearing a jacket, races onto the 
    lawn and drops off the robes before bolting away.  The 
    bullies charge after him.  The second they hit the lawn, the 
    infrared security beams flash over them, triggering the 
    alarm.  Tensor lights mounted on top of the dorm flash down 
  on them.  All the room doors open as the boys look out to see 
  who got nailed.  

    Remarkably Ian himself looks out of his room.  The bullies 
  see him, can t believe it.  They just saw him run the other 
    way, right?                                                                                  48.



                                RAY 
                  Traynor?!

  Ian shakes his head, seemingly disgusted with his roommates 
    behavior.

                                IAN
                  Keep it down, guys.  I m trying to 
                  study.  

    Gabe knocks on the dorm door marked DORM MASTER.

                                GABE
                  Excuse me, Sir.  Ugly naked dudes 
                  dancing on the common.  

  The teacher called MATH steps out.

                                GABE
                  Kind of cool in a grotesque way, 
                  but really just creeping everyone 
                  out.  Thought you should know.

    Math catches sight of the trio, wet and naked in the security 
    lights.  He can t suppress a smile.

                                MATH
                  Oh good.  And out after curfew, 
                  too.  Mr. Blonsky, please cover 
                  yourself.  

  The shamefaced Zack does so.

                                MATH
                  I m sure Headmaster will have 
                  something to say about this.  Step 
                  into my apartment while I call him.  

  The angry bullies grab their robes. 

    Math notes Ian grinning at the bullies embarrassment. 

                                MATH
                  Everything copacetic, Mr. Traynor?

                                IAN
                  No complaints, Sir.

    Math gives Ian a look that says he might know more than Ian 
  is telling about the incident, and he doesn t think that s a 
  bad thing.  C.J. approaches Ian s room as the sullen bullies 
    file past.                                                                                  49.



                                IAN
                      (to C.J.)
                  You picking up anything besides 
                  embarrassment and the desire to 
                  inflict pain?  

    Ceej looks at the bullies.

                                C.J.
                  I can feel Zack tearing up.  Going 
                  to lose it.

  The Dorm Master s door closes. 

                                ZACK (O.S.)
                        (sobs)

    Ceej gives Ian a  told ja  look.  Suki enters, taking off 
    Ian s jacket.  

                                SUKI
                  I think this is yours.

                                IAN
                  Thanks.  It looked good on you.  

    A shy smile from Suki.

    They are rejoined by Gabe.  He nods to Ian:

                                GABE
                  Well.  Do we show him?

                                IAN
                  What?

  The other three are obviously in on some secret.  Ceej and 
    Suki are in agreement.

                                C.J.
                  It s okay.

    They move off casually in the direction of the classrooms.  
  As this is all within the campus, there are no alarms here.  
    Ian, curious, follows them.



    Establish the dark old building at the edge of the campus.  
  Ian quietly follows Gabe, Ceej and Suki to the old building.                                                                                  50.





  It is the next day, just before the home room bell rings.  
  Ian steps out of his room completely dressed in the school 
    uniform.  His tie is straight, his jacket is neat, not a 
    detail is out of place.  With books in hand, he sets off for 
  the classroom.  He appears to be just another model TowerPrep 
    student.  From some unseen PA system comes the voice of Echo, 
    presumably welcoming any new students that were dropped off 
    during the night.

                                ECHO (V.O.)
                  All new students, orientation 
                  begins in fifteen minutes.  Don t 
                be late.  

  On his way to class, Ian crosses paths with Headmaster. 

                                HEADMASTER
                  Mr.  Traynor.  Math says there was 
                an incident with your roommates 
                  last night.

                                IAN
                  Guys just being guys I guess, 
                  whooping it up naked on the lawn, 
                  setting off the security system 
                  just for fun.

                                HEADMASTER
                  You saw nothing unusual?  

                                IAN
                  I did mention they were naked?

    Headmaster frowns.  Ian continues:                                                                                   54.



                                IAN
                  I was inside studying.  Ask anyone.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  I did.

    Headmaster notes Ian s appearance.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Good to see you in full uniform. 

                                IAN
                  I can t understand the Program if 
                  I m not part of it. 

    Headmaster studies Ian, trying to decide if the boy is on the 
    level.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  You ll find that s the best way to 
                  succeed here.

                                IAN
                  Well, you were right when you said 
                  I like a challenge.

  Ian nods as he moves away from Headmaster.  


  ON HEADMASTER

    A few students run by him, attracting his attention. 
    Headmaster walks after the excited students, curious to see 
    that has grabbed their attentions.  The kids are headed for 
  the center of the school common, and the flagpole.  



  At the top of the flagpole, in place of the flag, hangs the 
    broken helmet Ian took off the defeated Gnome the night 
    before. 

  PAN DOWN from the top of the pole to show the students 
    looking up at it in wonder.

                                STUDENT #1
                  Is it really a Gnome?

                                STUDENT #2
                  No one s ever seen them.                                                                                  55.



                                STUDENT #3
                  You mean no one s seen them and 
                  come back.  

                                STUDENT #1
                  Someone did.

  As Headmaster approaches, the students quickly scatter and go 
    about their business.  Headmaster is joined by Math.  They 
    both look at the helmet.

                                MATH
                  First time that s happened.  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  We ll make it the last.  

                                MATH
                  Shall I implement disciplinary 
                  procedure?  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  No reason to punish the entire 
                  student body for a message sent by 
                  one person.  If we ignore it, 
                  they ll become over-confident, 
                  careless. We ll catch him next 
                  time.  

                                MATH
                  You re sure it s a  him?  

                                  HEADMASTER
                  I have some ideas.  

    Math speaks quietly and personally to Headmaster.  

                                MATH
                  Not every student can deal with 
                  what we do here, Penemue.  Some of 
                  them break.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  The strong ones must follow the 
                  Program without question.  It s the 
                  only way they can deal with the 
                  outside world.  

    Headmaster looks back the helmet on the flag pole.

                                  HEADMASTER
                  Or themselves.                                                                                    56.



    Headmaster exits, leaving Math to lower the helmet.

    A short distance away, Gabe watches the action at the 
    flagpole, then turns and passes by Ian.  They don t speak, 
  but Gabe touches his nose, a signal to Ian.  Ian responds 
    with a touch to his ear.

  Ian continues on past C.J.  They also share a signal of 
    silent communication.  

    Nearby Don, Ray and Zack watch Ian.  The signals are lost on 
    them, but their sullen expressions say they don t like or 
    trust Ian one bit.

  As the bullies move off, Suki is revealed sitting on a bench.  
  She is seemingly playing with her picture phone.  To anyone 
    else, it looks just like a basic phone, but Suki is giving it 
    a once-over with a small screwdriver.  


    CLOSER ON PICTURE PHONE

  The simple graphics suddenly scramble, becoming a swirling 
    electronic jumble.  Suki frowns and tries to fix it.  Just 
    then, the graphics reform into words.  The message on the 
    screen reads:

    SUKI - I KNOW THE WAY OUT.  TRUST ME - ECHO

    Suki s eyes widen in shock.  She quickly sticks the phone in 
  her backpack and runs off to find Ian and the others.


                                                                        FADE OUT
