  Varro slams his shield into a GLADIATOR'S unprotected face. 
  Blood and teeth fly.  PULL WIDE to find --

  VARRO AND SPARTACUS,

  both without helmets and tethered together by fifteen feet 
  of chain attached to a belt each has around his waist.  They 
  are in the midst of a CHAIN BATTLE, fighting





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  THREE GLADIATOR PAIRS

  also tethered together, sans helmets. Remnants of other 
  dueling teams lay slain on the blood-soaked sand.

  STEEL CLANGS

  as Spartacus drives his pair back.  BLOOD SPRAYS in a shower 
  of gore as he dispatches them.  Varro is knocked back, 
  struggling to fend off an attack.

  SPARTACUS CHARGES,

  using the chain between him and Varro to sweep the opposing 
  team off their feet.  As their opponents scramble to their 
  feet, Spartacus rushes in --

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Shield!!

  Varro swivels on his knees, holding up his shield for 
  Spartacus, who uses it as a RAMP to launch into the air TIME 
  SLOWS AND ACCELERATES as Spartacus' twin swords violently 
  RIP OPEN both Gladiators on his way down.

  THE PULVINUS

  NUMERIUS, the Magistrate's son, presses against the railing.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Even chained to an inferior 
                        gladiator, Spartacus prevails!

  BATIATUS laughs in agreement from his seat next to 
  MAGISTRATE TITUS CALAVIUS.  His wife DOMITIA sits with 
  LUCRETIA. NAEVIA serves wine.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We would expect no less from the 
                        Champion of Capua!  See how he 
                        ignites the crowd!
                                to Calavius)(
                        His presence at your son's birthday 
                        will be the talk of the Republic.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        A far cry from my own fifteenth 
                        year. When I put on the Toga 
                        Virilis and passed into manhood, it 
                        was a stuffy, formal ceremony 
                        ridden with corpses and hags.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                      My father deemed himself an orator. 
                        Lulled our guests to slumber, some 
                        never to awaken!

                                          DOMITIA
                      We would not have it so for 
                        Numerius.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      He has been clamoring for a pair of 
                        your finest, to battle in 
                        exhibition at his celebration.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We would see him well satisfied.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And by extension his noble father.

  Batiatus considers Numerius, his wheels turning towards 
  increased advantage.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Although thought strikes that if 
                        you were to hold celebration 
                        beneath my humble roof, the boy 
                        could bear close witness to all my 
                        gladiators.

  Numerius whips around, eyes pleading.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Could we, Father?  Please?!

  The Magistrate frowns, feeling he's being fleeced.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        And the additional cost associated 
                        with such generosity?

                                        BATIATUS
                        A favor between friends.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Received with much gratitude!

  Calavius warmly clasps Batiatus on the shoulder.  Numerius 
  beams in excitement -- as does Batiatus, who shares a smile 
  with Lucretia.  His plans to ingratiate himself to the 
  Magistrate advance ever forward.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                        Are you certain it will not cause 
                        imposition?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Place it from your thoughts.  A boy 
                        becomes a man but once in his life.  
                      He should be richly indulged in his 
                        interests.

  Domitia takes in Numerius, intently watching the games.

                                          DOMITIA
                      He never seems to tire of the 
                        games.  He is of the same obsessive 
                        ilk as Ilithyia regarding blood and 
                        sport.

  Domitia glances at an EMPTY SEAT next to Lucretia.

                                          DOMITIA(cont'd)
                        Her absence comes as surprise.  Has 
                        she returned to Rome, absent 
                        farewells?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No.  She has been feeling... 
                        unwell.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Nothing serious, I pray?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It will pass, as all things born of 
                        a weak stomach.

  Numerius erupts in a CHEER, pulling their attention back to 
  --

  THE ARENA

  TIGHT ON A GLADIATOR as a sword PIERCES through his throat 
  in a SPRAY of blood.  POP WIDE as the man collapses, 
  revealing SPARTACUS behind him, pulling his sword out of the 
  guy's neck.  Spartacus turns, locking eyes with the last 
  opponent standing:

    A SUMO-SIZED CATAPHRACTARIUS,

  wielding a large BATTLE-AXE, but no shield, his enormous 
  frame armored in Lorica Squamata (scale armor linked in 
  horizontal rows).  Sumo winds up and brings his axe down, 
  SEVERING the chain from his dead partner.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.
  CONTINUED:

  SUMO

  charges in, his newfound mobility causing problems for 
  Spartacus and Varro, who stumble backwards as they defend, 
  their slashes and thrusts impenetrable against his metal 
  scales.  They fall back, bruised and bleeding.

                                        VARRO
                                (winded, to 
                                  Spartacus)
                        His armor gives pause.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  grins)(
                        Then we shall aim higher.

  Spartacus takes off, rushing Sumo.  As he nears the 
  behemoth, Spartacus barely dodges the man's axe and soars 
  through the air, whipping his chain around the man's neck as 
  he goes. Spartacus lands and rolls to his feet, shouting at 
  Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        The chain!

  Varro drops his sword and shield and grabs the chain, 
  Spartacus doing the same from the opposite side.  Sumo 
  struggles to free himself as Spartacus and Varro pull with 
  all their might.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Pull!

  Spartacus and Varro grunt as they give one last mighty yank, 
  POPPING THE SUMO'S HEAD CLEAN OFF.  A GEYSER of blood erupts 
  from Sumo's neck stump as he falls dead to the sand.  The 
  CHEERS are deafening as Spartacus and Varro stand 
  victorious.  The two men clasp hands and raise their arms as 
  one.  OFF SPARTACUS AND VARRO, basking in their triumph...


  NIGHT

  DURO crashes to the ground, sent there by his brother AGRON 
  while they spar.  Agron snorts in disgust.

                                        AGRON
                        Get up.

  The exterior gate SWINGS OPEN, pulling his attention to 
  Spartacus, Varro, DOCTORE and other Gladiators returning 
  from the games.  CHEERS erupt for the triumphant heroes.  

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.
  CONTINUED:

  All the men that didn't fight rush over to hear today's 
  tales from the arena.

  CRIXUS,

  bitter as fuck that he didn't fight today, doesn't join 
  them. He hangs back, striking a palus with contempt.  ASHUR, 
  unable to resist a little passive aggressiveness, sidles up 
  as he surveys the boisterous scene.

                                        ASHUR
                      It pains me to watch others claim 
                        your laurels.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your pain shall increase if you 
                        continue to stand beside me.

  Ashur moves off with a barely contained smile, passing Varro 
  and Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You fought well today.

                                        VARRO
                        The gods favored me, to count you 
                      as ally.

  Something catches Spartacus' eye behind Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Their favor extends beyond the 
                        arena...

  Varro turns to find his wife AURELIA and his son JANUS being 
  led into the MESS HALL by MIRA and a GUARD.  Her belly shows 
  slight evidence of her pregnancy's progression.

                                        VARRO
                        Aurelia...

  Varro rushes over, tears of joy filling his eyes as he 
  sweeps them up into his arms.

  SPARTACUS

  catches Mira's eye, graces her with a smile of gratitude. 
  Mira returns the smile and moves off into the villa.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I feared I would never hold you 
                        again. Ashur said he found only 
                                        (MORE)

                        Titus had returned.

                                        VARRO
                        Did he hurt you?  I will see his 
                        heart from his fucking chest --

                                          AURELIA
                        The blood was not mine.
                                (off Varro's 
                                  confusion)
                        I cut him, deep and low.  He will 
                        never force himself on a woman 
                        again. Afterwards I sought refuge 
                        with my brother's family, in the 
                        hills.  The slave girl found me 
                        there, by Spartacus  direction.

                                        VARRO
                        Thank the gods you are safe.

                                          AURELIA
                        Where were they when Titus first 
                        laid hands on me?  I still carry 
                        his child. Nothing has changed, 
                        Varro.

                                        VARRO
                        The entire world has changed.  And 
                        I along with it.

  Varro looks into Aurelia's sorrowful eyes, regretting how 
  much pain he has caused her.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        The child.  It springs from your 
                        belly, a part of you. I would love 
                      it as such... if you would have it 
                        so.

  Tears fill her eyes as he takes her in his arms, finding 
  warm comfort there once again.  OFF the reunion...



  Ashur, Solonius' mole, chews seeds as he glares at Crixus 
  training with the rest of the men.  Crixus hammers Duro 
  under Doctore's watchful eye.  ADJUST to find Varro sparring 
  with Spartacus.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                          entertainment? Something the boy 
                        will never forget.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      It is only exhibition.  Dominus 
                        gave us instruction to avoid 
                        grievous injury.

  CRACK!  Crixus sends Duro crashing to the ground, dazed and 
  bloody.  He raises the two-fingered missio in surrender. 
  Crixus shoots Spartacus an unpleasant grin: you're next. 
  Varro frowns.

                                        VARRO
                        I do not believe he was listening.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia watches Crixus with appreciation.  Naevia attends 
  her close by, attempting to mask her own appreciation.

                        Your Gaul is restored.

  Lucretia turns to find Ilithyia stepping out onto the 
  balcony, perfectly composed, returned to form. Lucretia 
  takes her in with a smile.

                        Nor is he alone.  The sun revives 
                        what night had withered.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Due to kindness of a dear friend.

                        And is kindness returned?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The Magistrate's celebration will

                        Gratitude.

  Ilithyia smiles warmly, masking her venom for Lucretia's 
    manipulation.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Would that I had words to multiply 
                      it in response.

  watching the Gladiators with rapt fascination. The two 
  Guards follow at a respectful distance.

                        What is it like, having the life of 
                        another resting in your hands?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      My sword may deliver the final 
                        blow, but a gladiator's fate is for 
                        the crowd and the editor to decide.

  Numerius absorbs this, then clocks something nearby.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        You have no wall by the cliff!

                        remember.

  Spartacus gathers two practice swords, hands one to 
  Numerius. As they begin to trade mock blows, we CRASH IN to 
  the other men training, their chiseled bodies glistening in 
  the sun. ADJUST off the manly display to

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia, Ilithyia and Domitia gaze down at the men 
  training. Domitia is clearly entranced. Ilithyia smiles, 
  knowing the look all too well.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The view never ceases to astound.

  Lucretia shares a subtle  well played  smile with Ilithyia 
  as the women exit back into the villa.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus glares at Numerius mock sparring with Spartacus. His 
  jealousy boils over as he brutally smashes his opponent to 
  the ground. He calls out loudly to the other men, although 
  his words are meant for Spartacus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The Magistrate's son graces our 
                        sands...

                        ...and this is what greets him? 
                        Would that I had an opponent worthy 
                      of his interest.

  He shoots Spartacus a pointed look. A tense beat, broken by 
  Duro stepping forward, practice sword clutched in his hand.

                                        DURO
                        I would spar with you.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  Agron shots him a look. What the fuck is he thinking? Crixus 
  snorts in dismissal.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I meant a real gladiator.

  Duro flares and attacks, swinging his sword with everything 
  he's got. Crixus easily deflects the assault, then SLAMS his 
  shield into Duro's face, sending him CRASHING to the ground. 
  Agron frowns in shame as the other men LAUGH.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Crixus shows impeccable form.

                        I shall prove otherwise at your 
                        ceremony tonight.

  Numerius grins at the shit-talking as Crixus eyeballs the 
  other Gladiators.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Does anyone else dare challenge 
                        Crixus?

                                        DURO (O.S.)
                        Our fight is not yet finished.

  Crixus looks over his shoulder to see that Duro has risen, 
  bloody, but ready for Round Two. Crixus chuckles.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Stand down, pup. Before your 
                        shriveling cock wets the sand.

  Duro charges once more and the two exchange a quick flurry 
  of blows. Crixus GROWLS as he arcs his sword down and 
  SHATTERS DURO'S NOSE, blood SPRAYING as the German collapses 
  to the sand. The Gladiators erupt once more in LAUGHS and 
  CHEERS.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        The man is beaten.

  Spartacus watches Duro intently. Sees something.

                      In body, perhaps. Yet confrontation 
                      is often not won by force, but by 
                        will...

  Numerius turns his attention back to the square, where Duro 
  painfully rises to his feet. His face streaked in blood. 
  Agron watches, concern rising.

                                        AGRON

                        Stay down, you ignorant shit.

  Duro glares at Agron, then bullrushes Crixus. Crixus 
  viciously dismantles Duro, sends him crashing back to the 
  sand, a bloodied mess.  Crixus laughs, but it's cut short by 
  Duro impossibly rising once more. The men MURMUR.

  DURO WEAKLY ATTACKS,

  barely able to raise his sword. Crixus has had enough. He 
  sends Duro to the ground and leaps on top of him, slamming 
  his fists into the man's face until his knuckles are 
  dripping with blood.

  PAN ACROSS THE GLADIATORS

  as Crixus rises.  No one is laughing anymore.  Agron's face 
  falls, knowing his brother may be severely injured.  Crixus 
  starts to move away when the men suddenly break into a wild 
  cheer.  Crixus grins, thinking it's for him until he 
  realizes

  HALF-DEAD DURO

  is staggering to his feet again.  Face caked in blood.  But 
  eyes alive with purpose.

                        Fucking Germans.

  Agron muscles his way in.  He hooks an arm around his 
  brother with a proud nod, helping him to the infirmary.  
  Numerius gawks as they pass by.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        The man is soundly defeated, yet
