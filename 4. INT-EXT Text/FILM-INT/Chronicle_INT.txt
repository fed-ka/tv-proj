The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on
its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around
off screen.
The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.
Then nothing.
Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.
Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.
He speaks
with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.
ANDREW (O.S.)
What do you want, I'm getting ready
for school-
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
Why is the door locked, unlock this
fucking door right now.
The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.
MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I said unlock this door. UNLOCK
THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You're drunk-
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M
DRUNK, OR-
ANDREW (O.S.)
It's seven thirty. In the AM.
You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
What're you doing in there.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm filming this.
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
What?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I bought a camera. I'm filming all
your shit from now on.
2.
There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away
from the door.
Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in
bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking
in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Mom? Will you say hi to the
camera?
SANDRA DETMER
Who's the audience?
ANDREW (O.S.)
The millions of people watching at
home.
SANDRA DETMER
Hello world. Do I look awful?
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, you look great.
SANDRA DETMER
I've been looking a little better,
yeah?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oh yeah, definitely.
SANDRA DETMER
It's a nice camera.
Andrew's filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and
does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway.
ANDREW (O.S.)
This is my school, I guess.
This
is the hallway-
GIRL
Vote "Kaz!"
A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.
GIRL (CONT'D)
Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior
class president!
5.
ANDREW (O.S.)
...yeah-
GIRL
Every vote counts.
Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and
featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before
something yanks the camera away.
For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer, 17, pale, awkward
and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard.
He looks anxious, if not afraid.
BRYCE (O.S.)
Yo this camera is a piece of shit.
It's like from 2004 or some shit.
WAYNE, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy T-shirt, appears
wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew.
WAYNE
Hey, how do I look?
(starts muscle posing)
Like this? Ooh, that's good.
Like
this? That's sexy, right?
ANDREW
Bryce, gimme my camera back-
BRYCE (O.S.)
Fuck you Andrew, shut up.
This
camera's a piece of shit.
WAYNE
You got me, let's go.
Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrew's locker.
Bryce starts to walk away with the camera.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-
The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly
kicked back to Andrew. He picks it up, checking on it.
ANDREW (CONT'D)
(quietly, sad)
Oh come on...
6.
Matt's driving.
Andrew's filming from the passenger seat.
MATT
There's a party tonight.
A barn
party at Haven Hills.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I thought Haven Hills was closed.
MATT
It's abandoned, yeah. That's why
it's a good place for a party. Two
kegs.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Why are you telling me?
MATT
You wanna go? I don't wanna go
alone.
ANDREW (O.S.)
...Nah...
MATT
When was the last time you went to
a party?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't like parties.
MATT
You're a senior.
Just come, you'll
have fun.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'll think about it.
MATT
Okay, right. Andrew, can I give
you like, a pro tip?
ANDREW
Yeah?
MATT
Keep the camera at home.
It's
weird.
ANDREW
It has a purpose-
8.
MATT
I'm trying to be a good cousin,
here. This is me being your
friend, yeah? Okay?
The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room.
Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working.
ANDREW
I'm uploading what I shot
today...you have to keep a back-up,
you know.
The door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s,
Andrew's father. He doesn't look as white trash as you'd
expect.
9.
Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working.
Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair.
MR. DETMER
When I say open this door, you open
this fucking door.
Mr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out.
Andrew
sits on the floor in silence.
It's almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing.
It's claustrophobic in here. Eerily quiet. The camera
searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Hello-
STEVE
ANDREW (O.S.)
(suddenly appearing)
Aah!
I'm right here.
ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Does it go down much deeper, or-
STEVE
Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,
it's like a tunnel- do you hear how
loud that's getting?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Do you think it could be like wind,
or-
STEVE
Come on, man. Come on.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Then what do you think it is?
17.
STEVE
Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in
ghosts.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Who said anything about ghosts.
Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.
Andrew follows.
CUT.
Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.
MATT
-shouldn't have come in here.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Steve's up ahead-
MATT
At first I thought this was a
solutional cave, but now...I dunno,
it's like a lava tube, or
something.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't know what you're talking
about.
MATT
Look at the walls. Look at how
smooth they are. It's just
straight shot down, I mean, we
must've already gone forty or fifty
feet-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Don't talk about it, you're making
me nervous.
MATT
You ever hear of Plato's allegory
of the cave?
ANDREW (O.S.)
No.
MATT
Nevermind.
CUT.
18.
Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The light
flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out
completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the
nightvision mode comes on.
CUT.
The nightvision is scrambling badly.
All the forms are
distorted and then-
STEVE (O.S.)
Can you believe this, this is NUTS-
The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt. They've come
into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from
within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise
glow.
They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't
hear.
MATT
Is that, is that showing up on the
camera?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't wanna film it, it's messing
with the camera-
Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next
to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing
from, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,
float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.
Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the
light.
STEVE
Touch one!
We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora
borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent
little explosion of light, beautiful.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...
A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand
to extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burst
badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.
CUT.
19.
Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed
up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The light
clouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside the
structure, pressing it with his palms.
MATT
-changes color, see? It must be
reacting to the heat, some kind of
exothermic reaction-
ANDREW (O.S.)
WHAT? I can't hear you over the-
you know-
STEVE
Make it change again!
This is
awesome!
Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss as
the light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of
them is released from beneath the structure. The camera
jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.
STEVE (CONT'D)
AGHHHHH!
Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth
and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly
and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline
structure.
It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,
revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we
can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the
camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the
tunnel-
CRACK.
DIGITAL
CODE.
BLACK SCREEN.
HOLD ON BLACK.
FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.
Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over
bread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and
Andrew watching.
ANDREW
The trick is to pretend like it's
on a plate. You get it on the
plate and then you wrap the plate
around it, and you can move it
however you want.
STEVE
Mhm.
MATT
I've been pretending I was like,
holding it in a fist, like a
floating hand.
22.
ANDREW
Yeah?
Plate's easier for me.
STEVE
Guys, check it out.
Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter
floating freely. They slap together and then down onto the
bread, which slaps closed.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Ha!
(notices his bloody nose)
Shit, shit-
Matt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.
Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a
LEGO set with his telekinetic abilities. Andrew's filming
from the bed, where he's laying down.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Try to imagine that your squeezing
the entire piece in your hand.
MATT
That's what I'm doing, it's just,
it's hard. You're better at this
than me, you do it.
ANDREW
(mocking)
Really?
Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.
MATT
(wowed, laughing)
Dude, holy shit!
CUT.
Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his
cell phone.
STEVE
Guys, listen, listen.
Samantha.
Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker.
SAMANTHA Pezon, 16,
sounds a bit frustrated.
23.
SAMANTHA (ON PHONE)
I know you're over at that guy
Matt's house right now, okay, cause
they said you didn't show up for
soccer practice, but you said the
only reason you couldn't come see
Bound By Love with me was because
of soccer practice, so...You know,
I just, I don't know what to think.
I feel like we never hang out
anymore, you've just been hanging
out with those two guys for the
last like three weeks, and I...ugh,
call me back.
STEVE
What would you suggest, as like, a
course of action for me, here?
MATT
Why are you asking US for advice on
girls?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Because we're his mistress.
Steve laughs.
Steve is driving Andrew home.
STEVE
-new camera's working out for you,
that's good.
CUT.
STEVE (CONT'D)
I have to admit, though, I don't
understand the filming thing.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I told you, it's just my thing for
right now.
STEVE
You don't feel like it's a little
weird? Like it puts a barrier
between you and everything?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Maybe I want a barrier.
24.
STEVE
Okay.
I respect that.
CUT.
ANDREW (O.S.)
My dad is actually a fireman, or
was, I don't know. He got injured
like two years ago, and now they
just pay him out of, like,
insurance. He doesn't do anything,
I mean he goes out during the day,
but I don't know where. He drinks
a lot.
STEVE
So how do you pay for your shit?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I do computer repair, and stuff.
I
actually make a lot of money...
STEVE
What about your mom.
ANDREW (O.S.)
My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-
she can't work or anything, and the
insurance doesn't cover all of her
medicine, so a lot of my money has
to go into that. I figure if I get
enough on camera, maybe I can, I
dunno, get custody of her or
something.
Steve mulls this over.
CUT.
STEVE
I've actually been having some
problems with my parents, too.
ANDREW (V.O.)
Yeah?
STEVE
Nothing like yours, though.
Not-
Never mind.
There's a long beat.
25.
STEVE (CONT'D)
They've just been fighting a lot.
I think my mom is cheating on my
dad.
ANDREW (O.S.)
...That's intense.
STEVE
Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah,
I'm sure my mom is cheating on my
dad.
ANDREW (O.S.)
How-
STEVE
I just, you know, I saw some stuff.
It's weird, you don't think about
your parents as like...people, or
whatever. I don't know.
The two guys drive in silence.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Don't tell anybody about that-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Haha no of course, no way.
STEVE
Good.
It's dark. We can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house;
"useless bitch," "carry your ass long enough," etc. Andrew
reaches over and turns off the camera.
Steve is driving, Matt's shotgun, Andrew's filming from the
back.
STEVE
If anyone criticizes you, just call
them a hater. It's like calling
someone a racist, they'll just drop
whatever they're complaining about
and be like "I'M NOT A HATER."
Nobody wants to be a hater.
27.
The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an
aisle where shoppers stand.
STEVE (O.S.)
That girl, with the cart.
A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling
on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes
careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We
can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet.
MATT (O.S.)
She's chasing- she's chasing it-
CUT.
Toy aisle. A toddler is looking at teddy bears.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I got this.
One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the
little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly
takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled
laughter.
STEVE (O.S.)
Oh my god Andrew, look-
Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she
saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed.
CUT.
They're by the check out.
28.
MATT (O.S.)
See that guy chewing gum?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Umm...
(camera finds the guy)
Got him.
MATT
I'm gonna get the gum right out of
his mouth- watch this.
There's suddenly a little air ripple in front of the man's
mouth, and he's yanked face first into the gum and candy
rack, which all crashes apart. The guys all crack up and
start running.
STEVE
(laughing)
GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We
don't need to run, we don't need to
run!
None of the guys are visible.
They're filming a woman park
her car.
STEVE (O.S.)
I just always feel like I miss
stuff.
MATT (O.S.)
We were just sitting around
throwing rocks, it was nothing.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Yeah, until all those chicks showed
up.
STEVE (O.S.)
What?
Shut up.
MATT (O.S.)
Okay, here we go, here we go.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Are you sure there's no one around-
MATT (O.S.)
There's no one, I just looked, just
go, ready?
(beat)
Ready?
(MORE)
30.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Okay, Andrew, remember, get under
it, you're the strongest, Steve get
the sides, I'll get the front and
back, we gotta do this quick.
Countdown. Three. Two. One. GO.
The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately
dips right.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Steve Steve Steve-
STEVE (O.S.)
Got it, got it.
Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in
the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles
through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then
sets down, neatly in place.
STEVE (CONT'D)
MATT (O.S.)
FUCK YEAH! BOOYAH!
YES! FUCK YES! OH SHIT,
blood-
Matt's driving, Steve's shotgun, Andrew filming from the
back. It's raining.
MATT
-sfucking insane, we just changed
her life. We did-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Her face, I can't get her face out
of my head.
STEVE
That was fucking great. I mean,
this just gives me so many ideas,
already, stuff we could do-
There's honking from outside.
MATT
Oh come on, what is this?
32.
STEVE
He's like right on your bumper,
too.
Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass.
More honking.
MATT
Can you fucking believe this guy?
STEVE
He's just some asshole redneck,
look at him. He's fucking with us.
They are driving out over a bridge in the woods.
MATT
I don't know what to do, what
should I-
ANDREW (O.S.)
(laughing)
Here, take the camera, take the
camera.
He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting
in the back seat. Behind him, through the back window, we
can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close.
ANDREW (CONT'D)
Abracadabra.
Andrew flicks his hand at the truck. The effect is
instantaneous: THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK CAVES IN LIKE IT JUST
HIT A BRICK WALL, WHAM, AND SENDING IT CRASHING OFF THE
BRIDGE, OUT AND DOWN AND INTO THE WATER.
STEVE (O.S.)
...I...what...
Andrew's filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very
quickly.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Are you mad?
MATT
Stop, just stop.
It's morning. The camera lays on the bed.
Andrew can be
heard breathing.
CUT.
LATER.
36.
The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it
moves across the floor. It crawls up onto the side of the
bed, then onto the sheets. Andrew's finger points at it.
The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.
It hangs
struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.
He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates
into all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging
lifeless.
Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider.
Rings
again.
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
(from downstairs)
Andrew! Answer the fucking phone!
Andrew's filming Matt from shotgun.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Did he say what it was about?
When
he called, what did he say?
Matt's quiet.
ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Are you still mad at me?
MATT
I'm not mad.
ANDREW (O.S.)
(beat)
You seem mad.
MATT
...Power corrupts, is all I'm
saying, man.
ANDREW
What does that even mean?
MATT
I just mean that we have to think
about things more now, okay? We
can't just DO things, we have to
think first.
ANDREW
...I understand.
37.
MATT
It's just- nah, nevermind, we're
here.
The guys are in that sleepy mode, now. Andrew's filming, but
not really focusing on anything. Matt's sprawled out on a
couch opposite him. Steve's in a chair nearby.
MATT
But how does she not notice?
STEVE
Well, I mean, she notices that it's
gotten better, definitely. You
just have to be subtle.
ANDREW (O.S.)
That's so cool. Doesn't that count
as breaking rule #1 though?
STEVE
Pfff, technicalities.
MATT
Man, I haven't had sex since
like...a year.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I haven't had sex since ever.
STEVE
Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so
cool?
MATT
Liquid nitrogen.
CUT.
43.
Later. Drowsier. Light's coming from the TV. The camera is
laying haphazardly on Andrew. They're all nearly asleep,
drowsy drunk.
MATT (CONT'D)
Hey guys, are you up?
STEVE
Yeah.
ANDREW (O.S.)
YO.
MATT
Today was like...the best day of my
life. Like I was thinking and I
can't think of any day I liked
better than today.
There's a silence.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Yeah.
STEVE
Unanimous.
Yes.
MATT
Okay...good.
Beat.
Silence.
Steve is filming Andrew and Matt across the table.
STEVE (O.S.)
I'm live on scene here with Matt
and Andrew, boys, can you tell us
what's happening?
ANDREW
Well, uh, it would appear that a
Virgin Mary has appeared in the
maple syrup on a young local man's
pancake.
MATT
In a second it will, wait...
Matt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary.
STEVE (O.S.)
That is, that is some very uh,
definitely supernatural shit, going
on there.
CUT.
MATT
Well, when I was really little, I
wanted to be police officer.
STEVE (O.S.)
Oh, no shit?
ANDREW
Fuck you, pig.
MATT
No, I just really got into on the
idea of altruism, you know?
ANDREW
What's that mean?
45.
MATT
Like making things better for
everyone.
ANDREW
So what, you wanna do like, a
charity? That's lame.
STEVE (O.S.)
Why is that lame?
ANDREW
I dunno.
MATT
I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't
matter, you know. I'm never gonna
get out of this piece of shit town.
You know, we're all just little
pieces. One person can't really
make a difference. I used to think-
I don't know. I don't know.
Matt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the
camera; it plinks off.
STEVE
AAH!
DOUCHEBAG!
CUT.
Now Matt has the camera, filming Steve.
MATT (O.S.)
So what's it feel like to be good
at everything?
STEVE
I'm not good at everything-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Name something you're bad at.
STEVE
I'm not GOOD at everything, I just
do my best at everything. That's
what it's about. I mean you talk
about philosophy and shit all the
time, but you never really do
anything. Have you even applied to
colleges yet?
MATT
I'll get to it-
46.
STEVE
You could use some of that, man,
I'm just saying.
MATT (O.S.)
Oh yeah? Well you could use some
shut the fuck up.
STEVE
You lack initiative.
MATT
You lack...a dick.
Sandra's in bed, sicker than ever.
SANDRA DETMER
You look handsome.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's
gonna do my hair.
SANDRA DETMER
I'm glad you are spending so much
time with your friends.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oh yeah, me too.
CUT.
Andrew's camera is down at his side.
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
-getting to school?
ANDREW
I don't know what you mean-
MR. DETMER (O.S.)
Don't bullshit me idiot. Matt
doesn't come, he don't drive up.
You leave the house, and who the
fuck is giving you rides to school?
ANDREW
Matt.
49.
MR. DETMER
No, wrong. Something's fucking
going on with you, you can't hide
it. Think you can slink around,
sneaking- sneaking around the
house, smiling, I know your shit.
And we ain't got no more fucking
money for your mother's pain
medication, either.
ANDREW
...I'm sorry, I'll try to-
MR. DETMER
Sorry isn't good enough, fuck up!
You're a fuck up. You fuck
everything up. Put that fucking
camera away-
At first, it's just a shot off Matt's feet, the camera
pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around. It goes
to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to
normal.
MATT (O.S.)
(grumbling)
Fuck...the stupid...
The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditorium's
stage. A group of kids are playing screamo music. Cut, a
little later. A girl is singing. Cut. Casey, the girl with
the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty
dancing. She's good. The camera lingers on her.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
...s'fuckin awesome...
CUT.
It's a few minutes later. "Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!)
begins to play. There's a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo,
rushes out onto stage. The applause is DEAFENING, girls
screaming, etc.
He raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" Andrew,
also in a tuxedo. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Andrew's
carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto
the floor. Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in
exasperation.
50.
Andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands.
There's a beat, and then the audience goes APESHIT.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Yes!
Fuck yes!
CUT.
Andrew is juggling, six balls at once. Steve is drinking a
soda, and offers Andrew the soda. Andrew is annoyed. Steve
pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda. Andrew
stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and
snatches away Steve's soda.
Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have
all the balls drop out of the air and hit him. The audience
is LOSING THEIR FREAKING MINDS.
CUT.
People around Matt are buzzing about how awesome it is.
Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage,
spilling water everywhere. Steve is pantomiming anger at the
shoddy job he's doing. Andrew pantomimes "Well, you try."
Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the
bucket flying out over the audience-
-only for it to seemingly REWIND back into the bucket!
The
place GOES BERZERK.
CUT.
Steve and Andrew take their bows to overwhelming cheers,
separately. Andrew bows again, and people freak out. We
hear Matt cheering behind the camera.
Andrew's filming from shotgun.
MATT
Just amazing dude-
ANDREW (O.S.)
You really think so-
MATT
Are you fucking kidding, I've never
seen a reaction like that in the
auditorium, you guys- it was
fucking like- it shook the
building. You guys are rockstars.
51.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Yeah, it did- it did feel like
that. All the girls screaming-
MATT
Ah, see, here's the first stage of
your downfall, hubris.
ANDREW (O.S.)
What's that?
MATT
What?
ANDREW (O.S.)
What's "hubris?"
MATT
Seriously?
ANDREW (O.S.)
What "seriously," fuck you
seriously!
MATT
(laughing)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Hey Matt.
(beat)
What's "seriously" mean?
We can hear it raining hard outside.
The camera is laying on its side on the floor, and turns on
when Andrew fumbles with it. There's screaming from
downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds.
Andrew drops the camera and rushes out the door.
The camera
lays on the floor. Time passes.
ANDREW (O.S.)
(faintly)
Mom, it's going to be okay, okay?
Just try to get through, it's going
to be okay.
Mr. Detmer enters, and notices the camera.
He reaches down
and picks it up.
In the squalid living room of the Detmer residence. The
camera is being held off at an angle by Mr. Detmer, as Andrew
tries to get it back. It moves around a bit, so Andrew and
his father are both on/off screen.
MR. DETMER
-think you can fucking use me,
you're abusive, you're a fucking
user little piece of shit. I went
through your camera.
ANDREW
What'd you...You- what'd you see?
MR. DETMER
Just you fucking being a drunk
mess, spending my money, drinking
with your fucking friends-
56.
ANDREW
I didn't spend any of your money,
RICHARD-
MR. DETMER
Cause I don't have any fucking
money to spend, it all goes to
school for you, for medication for
your mother-
ANDREW
School doesn't cost any money, I go
to public school you idiot-
MR. DETMER
-now we can't afford your mother's
pain meds anymore, up there
screaming- did you just- what THE
FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME? CALL ME
A FUCKING IDIOT?
Mr. Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrew's face.
It
knocks him down and clatters to the floor.
ANDREW
(clutching his face)
You asshole, you fucking crazy
asshole-
MR. DETMER
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! YOU'RE DONE
LIVING HERE, GET OUT!
Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and
again, and again, and WHAM! Andrew backhands Detmer HARD,
flooring him. Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling
it coolly on his father as he tries to stand.
Andrew's arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat,
lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall.
MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
I can't- can't move-
ANDREW
MR. DETMER
I COULD CRUSH YOU. YOU KNOW
Get- off- let me go- you're
THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH
hurting me-
YOU. I CAN KILL YOU WITHOUT
*
EVEN FUCKING TOUCHING YOU.
Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips
on the impact. We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked,
as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE
AIR.
57.
The camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror.
Andrew
suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.
ANDREW
(addressing the camera)
-wanted to show you what I was
talking about.
Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. He
takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh
of his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way to
his elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabs
himself several times...but no penetration.
ANDREW (CONT'D)
See, it's- I put a little sheet
between myself and the knife, and
the barrier, the sheet, is too
strong. The knife can't cut it. I
mean like, what I'm saying is if I
concentrate, I can't be hurt. I
can't be injured. Because of the
little sheet.
Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker. He's
suddenly shoved into the locker roughly. The camera turns,
revealing Wayne walking away.
The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes
back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Hey Wayne!
WAYNE
What, you got a probl-
One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly
gushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately
tended to by other students.
Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of
the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.
They're Wayne's bloody teeth.
ANDREW (O.S.)
See, this one, I got clean, cause I
did a little lasso around the root,
but these two, they're broken cause
I think I pulled them from the
middle. Matt was always better at
the little, the intricate stuff, he
got good at that. See how broken
it is, ugh, sloppy.
Mike FERNANDEZ, 30s, serious but warm, sits across the desk
from Andrew. The concern in his voice is very real.
FERNANDEZ
Could you put the camera away?
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, I'm filming this. I film
everything.
63.
FERNANDEZ
I understand that things have been
very hard for you recently, Andrew,
but the camera kind of- it
alienates a little, you know?
ANDREW (O.S.)
What did you want to talk about?
FERNANDEZ
(beat)
There's concern for your grades,
Andrew. And as far as I know
you've yet to apply to any
colleges, so-
ANDREW (O.S.)
It's not doable. Financially,
they're not- I mean, my dad didn't
go to college either.
FERNANDEZ
Well, yes, but I still think it's
worth thinking about. There are
three different community colleges
locally that offer great programs
for-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't need college, Mr.
Fernandez.
FERNANDEZ
(beat)
I think that's a very close-minded
attitude, Andrew. I know that you
come from a difficult background,
and I know how horrible the pain
can be when you lose a friend. But
I don't think you should let this
make you lose hope. I mean, this
is your future. You don't want to
compromise your future.
(long beat)
Andrew?
The camera is sitting on the floor. We can hear screaming
from downstairs. Andrew picks up the camera, and goes to the
mirror, filming himself filming. After a beat, he steps out
from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air.
64.
He stands looking at himself, and then the camera. The
camera turns to face Andrew. He doesn't look good, but gives
a weak smile.
We're peeking in through the door. We can see Sandra Detmer
writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain. She
lets out a long scream, and then seems to notice us watching.
SANDRA DETMER
Richard is that you? Richard, you
have to let me have my medicine, I
can't...Andrew? Who is that?
Look, please come in here, I need
help to turn over. It hurts,
please, Andrew, you have to tell
your father...tell your father to
get my medicine...
Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto
her side.
SANDRA DETMER (CONT'D)
Andrew...thank you Andrew...was
that you? Did you-
The door closes.
We're looking at the door to a bathroom, only a crack open.
It's pushed open, revealing Matt, shirtless, brushing his
teeth.
CASEY (O.S.)
AHHHH!
Casey runs up and hugs Matt from behind, startling him.
Matt is cooking; he's got four different things on the stove.
CASEY (O.S.)
How'd the interviews go?
MATT
I told you how the interviews went.
CASEY (O.S.)
But now we do it for the camera.
MATT
CASEY (O.S.)
UGHHHHHH-
Come on.
MATT
UCONN not so good, Columbia was
good, University of Miami was
really good, Arizona State was
okay.
CASEY (O.S.)
Who ended up paying for all of the
airfare? Did your parents-
MATT
Haha, no, I told you they wouldn't.
CASEY (O.S.)
Did you pay?
MATT
Nope. Nobody. I flew myself.
I
needed the exercise.
CASEY (O.S.)
(beat)
You are a man of mystery.
Matt smiles.
67.
CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
God, how do you always cook so many
things-
Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal
that she's topless; Casey has already covered up with her
arms.
CASEY (CONT'D)
(running away)
AAH! AHH OH MY GOD MATT AAAHHH!
CUT.
They're at the breakfast table. Matt's eating, and Casey,
filming, is talking between bites.
CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
You have to do at least one of your
tricks for the camera, though.
MATT
I am so sick of being filmed, you
have no idea, Casey-
CASEY (O.S.)
No I know, but I'm not going to use
any of this. I just want you to do
a trick, one of your good ones.
MATT
When do your parents get back from
Spain?
CASEY
A week.
MATT
(beat)
Okay, if you don't film me for one
week-
CASEY (O.S.)
Ahhhh-
MATT
One week, I'll show you my new
trick. I guarantee you will shit
bricks. Yeah?
CASEY
...Ughhhh.
68.
Matt's asleep in bed on a different day.
Casey's filming
from next to him.
CASEY (O.S.)
(whispering)
I'm filming you and you don't know.
I'm terrible. I'm gonna show you
this later and you're gonna be like
"whaaaaaaaaaat!"
It's dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing
Matt, groggy, half awake.
CASEY (O.S.)
What happened?
MATT
Ughhhh camera...I had that dream
again.
CASEY (O.S.)
Tell me.
MATT
It's like I'm...I'm not me, I'm
something else. And I'm out in
this...out in space. And stars are
all around me, and I'm zooming past
them; everything is really like
three-D, I can see the shape of the
stars. I'm looking for somewhere
to sleep, or something, and I see
earth, and I go down to earth. And
then...I don't know, just the main
part is that I'm out and there are
the stars and they just look like
millions of little points of
light...And Steve is there.
CASEY (O.S.)
Steve is there?
MATT
Yeah but he feels like he's not
part of it. Like he's there
separately, inside my head. Andrew
is there too. I don't know. I'm
worried about Andrew.
(beat, slyly)
Why don't you put the camera away?
CASEY (O.S.)
Oh yeah? What's gonna happen to me
if I put the camera away-
MATT
Oh I think you know. I think you
know what's going down.
CASEY (O.S.)
We could leave the camera on.
70.
MATT
You arrrrreeee...C'mere.
Matt advances on Casey, and the camera falls off to the side
of the bed. We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly
muffled by kissing.
DIGITAL
DISTORTION TO
BLACK.
Screaming from Sandra's bedroom. The heater rattling. The
TV from downstairs. There's a knock on the window. The
camera is picked up, to reveal Matt floating outside, looking
around nervously.
After a moment, Andrew opens the window.
CUT.
Matt stands fidgeting, clearly uncomfortable, as Andrew films
him.
MATT
You haven't been returning my
calls, so I thought I'd just...you
know, ambush.
ANDREW (O.S.)
That's rude.
MATT
I just- I've been getting, you
know, bad vibes or whatever.
Andrew is silent.
MATT (CONT'D)
I know you stopped coming to
school, and my mom said you guys
are having a lot of problems with
money. I'm worried about you.
71.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Why?
Your life's great-
MATT
Dude, don't be like that, okay-
ANDREW (O.S.)
You don't need to worry about me.
I'm stronger than ever now. I can
lift a whole car by myself. I
could fucking crush this entire
house, I'm fine.
MATT
That doesn't- that actually sounds
like the opposite of fine. Andrew,
come on, let's get out of here,
your room's a mess, it smells like
a Denny's bathroom in here.
ANDREW (O.S.)
So what?
MATT
You're my cousin. You're my friend-
it's my responsibility to take care
of you.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I think you should go. I have to
pick up my mom's medication.
MATT
...Are you going to break the
rules?
(beat)
We're too strong now, Andrew.
We're too strong for that. If you
did that, you know I'd have to-
ANDREW (O.S.)
You'd have to what. You were
always the weakest. You couldn't
do shit to me.
MATT
...Andrew-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm not gonna break your stupid
fucking rules, just fuck off and
stay out of my life.
72.
Matt stands staring at Andrew. The camera fidgets
uncomfortably. Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows
him as he goes to the window, gives Andrew one last look, and
then rockets off into the sky.
The camera sits in silence, pointed at the window.
The camera approaches the counter.
PHARMACIST
Hello, how can I help you.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm here to pick up a prescription
for Sandra Detmer.
PHARMACIST
Um, yes, hold on. That's Imuran,
Baclofen, Glatiramer and Vicodin.
ANDREW (O.S.)
That's right.
PHARMACIST
Okay, and the copay on that
is...Seven hundred and fifteen
dollars, eighty three cents.
Silence.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I have to come back.
PHARMACIST
Okay, we'll hold it for you.
Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.
His stereo plays David Bowie. Once his dad's car is gone,
Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the
mirror, and leaves the room.
Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. He
opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. We
do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at
it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof
inner lining is exposed.
"Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo.
73.
Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror,
his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks something
up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.
It's a gas mask.
He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless
figure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts the
mask.
Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly
yanked across the room.
The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.
Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who
says something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown out
of frame.
After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter,
and floats over to Andrew.
Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him;
as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. He
goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.
The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat
distorted audio. The image is a little blown out.
Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutely
scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper,
blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged are
already soaked through with blood.
He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.
Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensured
by the handcuff on his left wrist.
The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and
Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the
other side of the door.
MR. DETMER
-come down to the city, cause his
mother's all alone right now.
She's got MS, I had to leave her at
the house all a fucking alone.
POLICE DETECTIVE
I understand, Mr. Detmer.
MR. DETMER
Shit. Jesus, look at this.
Can I
have a moment with my son.
POLICE DETECTIVE
Yeah I- I'll be outside the door,
yeah?
77.
MR. DETMER
Okay.
The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits
down in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring at
Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in
his hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits
like that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.
MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
I want you to apologize to me.
Andrew is comatose.
MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
I said I want you to apologize to
me. I know you can hear me. So I
want you to sit up and apologize to
me. I want you to stop this
bullshit right now.
Andrew is comatose.
MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
Do you know how much this shit is
going to cost me? Do you know what
you've done to your family?
(beat)
You don't even care, do you? You
just don't give a fuck, you've got
your fucking morphine, don't you.
There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt
shoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on
the monitor.
MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,
you can't just play this off like a
fucking
(slap)
Game, this is real. You really
fucked me, me and your mother you
know that, you little
(slap)
Shit.
Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding
molten welts. Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a
quick pace forward and back.
MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
Goddamn it, goddamn it!-
78.
Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.
Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.
He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes
rigid.
Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates
into all of his component parts.
They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground
in a bloody mess.
Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball
hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of
agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.
The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to
the gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time to
scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and
lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart
everything in the room including the camera.
SMASH CUT TO:
FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.
All of Casey's family is present, along with lots of little
kids. Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother,
who's being presented with a birthday cake. Matt looks
happy.
EVERYONE
-appy birthday to you!
Everyone let's out a cheer, including Casey, but then she
notices Matt abruptly duck out. She follows him to the
bathroom...
CUT.
...where he's holding his nose, which is bleeding badly.
CASEY
Matt-
MATT
Do you hear that, how can you not
hear that?
79.
In the background, we can hear the house phone ring.
Then
cell phones.
CASEY
Matt, what hap-
MATT
The singing, how can you not hear
that!? Something's wrong, okay,
something's wrong with Andrew, or-
CASEY
Matt, please, okay, you're scaring
me, are you okay-
MATT
No, something's wrong, something's
wrong.
Matt pushes past her, running upstairs. Casey starts to
follow, but then stops, lowering the camera.
CASEY'S MOM (O.S.)
Casey, you have to come in here.
CASEY
Mom, Matt is-
CASEY'S MOM
Come in here right now.
Come in
here right now.
CUT.
Casey's filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.
REPORTER
-going to have a feed live on the
scene in the second, we apologize
for the delay but as of right now
every news helicopter in the
greater Multnomah County is headed
to Portland- again, right now we
have very little information, but
the word is that the bombings
started just over nine minutes ago,
and haven't subsided yet, with-
okay, here's the feed from NBC
Chopper 5.
We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland,
everything seems okay, and then something streaks by,
crashing headlong into the side of a building.
80.
The impact is like a wrecking ball, office furniture blowing
out into the air along with glass, steel and concrete, WHAM.
FIELD REPORTER (O.S.)
Wait, that was- that was not a bomb-
I repeat, not bombings, it's
something else-
The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his
winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex. We hear another
of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes
back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old
Town toppling down into the street.
MATT (O.S.)
I need your car.
CASEY (O.S.)
What? Matt, look, what's
happening, look at what's happening-
MATT
I see, I know, I have to go, okay-
CASEY (V.O.)
Don't leave, don't leave me-
MATT
Give me your keys.
CASEY (O.S.)
I- Matt-
Casey's sitting shotgun as Matt drives. His face is
unreadable. They're driving on the I-5. More helicopters.
Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires.
Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.
MATT
This is all my fault.
CASEY
No! No it isn't!
It isn't your
fault!
We hear and see the lights of ambulances and police cars as
they zoom past, but Casey keeps the camera on Matt.
CASEY (CONT'D)
Matt, it's not safe. It's not
safe. What's going on. What's
happening. Why are we doing this,
Matt, please. Please take me home.
You don't have your license, you
can't drive without your license.
CUT.
They're getting into downtown now. We can hear sirens.
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,
until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to
reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed
on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.
82.
CASEY (CONT'D)
How- how is that possible, that's
not possible-
There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains
down onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking up
through the windshield, searching the sky.
MATT
Where are you, man?
There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on
the passenger's side, next to Casey.
POLICE OFFICER
Listen, you can't be here, I need
you to turn this car around right
now and-
The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight
for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.
Casey screams.
CASEY
What's...What is...What's...Matt
please, please-
The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping
end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes
to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. Casey's
breathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out into
the night sky.
He flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospital
gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and
twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.
A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a
moment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.
His eyes flash to the car.
ANDREW
(screaming)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?
The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED
OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his
seatbelt with him.
CASEY
No NO NO
83.
The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew,
plummeting down, down, down. Casey's screams are barely
audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush
past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to
her death.
And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,
the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred
views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...
Stillness. Casey's camera is pointed down, showing her
adidas...and Matt's high-tops.
MATT (O.S.)
Stay here, okay? You have to stay
here.
CASEY (O.S.)
(barely coherent)
You can fly?
MATT (O.S.)
Stay here.
I have to talk to
Andrew.
CASEY (O.S.)
Matt..what...
MATT (O.S.)
Casey, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.
CASEY (O.S.)
Matt wait!
WAIT PLEASE!
MATT!
NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen in
glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.
Much of what happens should be seen through implication,
rather than direct effect.
Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can
fully keep track.
FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.
The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio,
meaning no narration from the reporter. There are several
chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and
we intercut as necessary.
84.
Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s,
as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle.
Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room,
crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down
the camera.
CUT.
They're in the car, driving fast through town. All around we
can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the
road up ahead.
CUT.
They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped
into gridlocked, dead-end traffic. Kim Hai-Su's father
begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which
triggers his younger brother crying again. Kim shouts to
calm down.
CUT.
Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting
out of their cars, hopelessly trapped. Someone screams, and
Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.
92.
Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which
splits further. Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, an
enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the
side of the hills into the valley.
Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,
when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.
All around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,
but rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,
panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest
on
Matt Garrety.
Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. He
pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!" This gets the
intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAH
KOREA!"
He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the
first time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casually
as it closes in: "I should deal with this." Another huge
ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!"
and turns.
There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less
than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing
into the distance over the flood.
After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to
stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS
TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.
The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,
embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars. Kim's
father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and
Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his
lungs.
The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going
positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and
down, screaming, smiling...
An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to
rise, rise, singing and we-
