The ROAR of thirty million dollars landing near tall grass.
Robert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac,
followed by Gavin and the aides.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 4.
They approach a waiting MERCEDES MAYBACH. The aides hand file
BOXES and BRIEFCASES to the Hispanic driver, RAMON, who loads
them into the trunk.
The blur of city lights as the limo passes over bridges and
towards the city and Park Avenue and finally approaches
An enormous turn-of-the-last-century Stanford-White-designed
red-brick MANSION- two already-giant townhouses combined.
Robert and Gavin exit the limo and head inside.
A TAXI stops in front of a large frosted-glass apartment
entrance. Robert exits, paying the DRIVER through the window.
ROBERT
(into his phone)
Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When
you get this -- I want you to call
Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I
need to see him right away, okay?
Robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as Julie
watches him from inside the loft, not moving.
After a second, the door BUZZES open.
Robert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate
18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark
contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking
British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive
glass conference room. They arrive at
Off Robert as he storms the pavement.
Robert exits his MAYBACH in front of a big scene in progress:
trendy FOLKS overflowing into the street, cameras FLASHING...
A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards
Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More
Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie
rests her head on Robert's shoulder.
And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled
next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into
tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's
respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off
into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...
A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to
Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where
the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,
flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 27.
He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still
rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP
BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.
He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger
side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to
touch her, then stops.
Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in
his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.
Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.
Robert walks and walks through tall grass.
In the distance behind him, A MASSIVE EXPLOSION lights up the
sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches, incinerating
the car and its contents.
Robert picks up a PAYPHONE by the bathrooms, cradling it to
his ear with his sleeve and dialing with his other finger
through his shirt fiber.
ROBERT
(INTO PHONE)
Yes, I wanna make it collect...
OPERATOR
Your name, sir?
ROBERT
Lawrence Grant.
RINGING, then...
JIMMY (O.S.)
Who the fuck is this?
ROBERT
Jimmy, it's me.
JIMMY (O.S.)
Robert?
ROBERT
I want you to listen to me very
closely...
POLICE CARS flash lights. An EMT unloads Julie's charred
CORPSE into a BODY BAG. INVESTIGATORS sift through rubble.
DET. MICHAEL BRYER (43) sits in a TAN SEDAN, drinking a cup
of deli coffee. Barely awake, he stares out the window at a
bunch of STATE TROOPERS arguing with his partner, MILLS.
MILLS breaks away from the uniforms and approaches, shaking
his head. Bryer gets out of the car.
BRYER
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
MILLS
Catching detective wants us to rule
before he calls it.
BRYER
We've been having the same fuckin'
argument for twenty years.
(MORE)
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 29.
BRYER (CONT'D)
They can't handle one drunk
motorist kills herself?
MILLS
I'm not so sure about this...
Bryer heads over to the car, his interest piqued.
Mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side.
MILLS (CONT'D)
Car roll had multiple impacts, but
she was here
(POINTS)
and her feet
(POINTS)
were down there.
Bryer immediately sees what he means-- dented metal, even in
the burnt door.
BRYER
... So who kicked out the door?
Bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side,
looking off into the distance of the path Robert took just
moments before.
About twenty yards down the road, a BLACK SUV hums, waiting.
Robert opens the passenger door and gets in.
The SUV stops a few blocks from Robert's house.
JIMMY
(through the window)
Call me, alright, and let me know
it's okay.
ROBERT
(as he exits)
Better we don't talk for a while.
JIMMY
(can't believe it--
through the window)
So what you get in a bind and just
call up the only nigger you know?
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33.
Robert looks at Jimmy, eyes tearing.
ROBERT
I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just
go home.
JIMMY
Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.
Jimmy's car drives off. Robert hobbles up the block.
SYD FELDER (64) sits next to Robert.
SYD
Hypothetically, the situation
you're describing would be
involuntary manslaughter.
ROBERT
And such a person...
SYD
...would be in a lot of trouble,
especially if that person was closing
a merger with a large public bank
where any publicity or arrest could
delay or derail the transaction.
(MORE)
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 35.
SYD (CONT'D)
But that's only if there was some
evidence that could link him to
the crime.
ROBERT
Fingerprints, DNA?
SYD
Very hard to collect after an explosion.
The real world's different from television.
ROBERT
What about cell phone records?
SYD
Did this person make any calls from the area?
ROBERT
Not from a cell phone, no.
SYD
Then they won't be able to place him there.
ROBERT
What would you advise such a person
to do?
SYD
To confess immediately.
ROBERT
Failing which?
SYD
To put as much distance between himself
and the event as possible, if possible.
But let me tell you something, and I'm
speaking to you as a friend now: there
are about fifty things that person
wouldn't have thought of. And the more
time that passes, the more lies that
are told, the worse it gets for him.
Robert stands.
SYD (CONT'D)
(FRENCH ACCENT)
Robert...
ROBERT
Yeah.
SYD
They're going to come to you.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 36.
ROBERT
I know.
SYD
An accident's not the worst
trouble. If we talk to them now we
can probably work it out.
ROBERT
You tell me what happens if the
Standard deal does not close, and I
gotta tell my investors about our
real losses?
SYD
Nothing good.
ROBERT
And what'd you say about the Justice
Department? Depending on what they
decide to arrest me on-- fraud
conviction gets me twenty years?
SYD
I did.
ROBERT
(laughs in pain)
What choice do I really have?
We follow CHRIS VOGLER (52) through the busy lobby out to the
street. He crosses Park Avenue and gets into Robert's limo.
Ellen exits the building, passes the doorman and then Bryer,
who is waiting in his car outside the multi-unit townhouse
where she keeps her office.
She doesn't notice him as she passes and enters a TOWNCAR.
She's about half-way into the car when he approaches.
BRYER
(calling after her)
Mrs. Miller?
ELLEN
(STARTLED)
Yes?
BRYER
(shows his badge)
Detective Bryer.
ELLEN
Did you just call my office?
BRYER
Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.
ELLEN
Well, I don't have time right now,
sorry..
BRYER
(turning on the charm)
Just take a couple a seconds. It's
about your husband.
ELLEN
Well, fine, but, make an appointment.
She closes the door and rides away. Bryer smiles in
frustration, walks back to his car.
PEDESTRIANS hurry by this busy stretch of Upper Manhattan.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 50.
MILLS
Mr. Grant?
JIMMY
Yes?
MILLS
NYPD Homicide, would you mind
stepping into the car?
JIMMY
What's this about?
BRYER
(through the window)
Just get in the car, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Am I under arrest?
BRYER
(through the window)
You wanna be?
Jimmy and Earl exit the buidling.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 53.
EARL
I'll call you tomorrow if there's any
news. Don't worry about anything. And
don't talk to anyone else. You take care.
Jimmy nods and walks up the street towards Syd's limo in the
distance.
Syd steps out of the limo and watches as it rolls away up
Tenth Avenue.
Robert exits the building with what looks to be, for the
first time in the film, a real smile.
He walks towards his limo, DIALS his cell.
ROBERT
(INTO PHONE)
Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James
Mayfield, please...
(as he enters his car)
Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time
we had a talk.
We see Brooke and Robert from overhead like little dots as
they cross 5th Avenue towards Central Park.
They walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake.
Robert sits, motions to Brooke.
ROBERT
You wanna sit?
BROOKE
I'll stand.
(as he sits)
Didn't you think I'd find out?
ROBERT
I did.
BROOKE
Then why didn't you tell me?
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 64.
ROBERT
Because I hoped you wouldn't.
BROOKE
Oh, come on. You tell me the truth
now -- or I am done.
ROBERT
I made a bad bet.
BROOKE
No, you committed fraud.
ROBERT
That's a dangerous word, Brooke.
BROOKE
What would you prefer? That you
cheated? That you stole money from
people who trusted you? That you
lied? That you lied right to my
face? Why?
ROBERT
Because we were going broke!
Everything was finished. We'd have
nothing.
BROOKE
How. How does that happen?
ROBERT
You remember Alexanderov? Well he
came to see me one day last year.
He said "Robert, we've got a great
opportunity- there's a copper mine,
it's in Russia, it's under-
exploited- there's billions under
the ground, and to get it out, all
we need is a couple hundred
million, you put in a hundred,
we'll put in a hundred- we'll
triple it all in six months." So, I
go check it out. And the geological
survey's right, friendly
government. And to lock it in, you
hedge it, right? Sell the copper
ahead on the commodities exchange
and it all works, it's fine, and
you're making a fortune.
(beat, then real fast)
(MORE)
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65.
ROBERT (CONT'D)
But then there's something I hadn't
accounted for-- variation margin--
and that friendly Russian
government all of a sudden not so
friendly anymore and they're
blocking the export of the copper
so I gotta make it up, I gotta put
the cash in to cover the hedge. But
I'm not worried about it because
it's still springing money, there's
so much money coming out of the
ground you can't believe. You can't
stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle,
I've done housing, I've arb'd
credit swaps, I have done it all,
and yes, again, I know it's outside
the charter, but it is FUCKING
MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO
PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY!
FOREVER! IT IS GOD!...
BROOKE
Until...
ROBERT
Until it's not... The money's
trapped. You can't get it out.
Probably never will.
(BEAT)
It's like a plane crash. It just happens.
BROOKE
Well it does not just happen.
ROBERT
Not just happen, honey you are so
naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And
like every father I pray that it
doesn't HAPPEN to you, which,
thanks to me, it probably won't
happen to you...
BROOKE
Thanks to you, we may all be arrested.
ROBERT
Nobody's getting arrested. That's why
I borrowed the money from Jeffrey.
Plug the hole, I put it there for a
month, they see the books are fine, I
transfer the company, I pay back
Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all
of our investors whole, and what's
left we keep. At least we get to keep
the house.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66.
BROOKE
Everybody wins?
ROBERT
Yes.
BROOKE
If the company sells. If I lie for you.
ROBERT
You don't have to lie. You didn't
know about it.
BROOKE
(INCREDULOUS)
I'm the Chief Investment Officer of
this company. What do you think
they'll say at the depositions?
"She didn't know?" They'll take away
my brokerage license- failure to
supervise you -- my name in every
paper and blog while I visit your ass
in jail!
ROBERT
What did you want me to do? Did you
want me to let our investors go
bankrupt? Is that what you wanted?
For people to get really hurt?
BROOKE
What... gives you the audacity to
think you can make those decisions?
ROBERT
(STANDS)
Because it's my job!
BROOKE
No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And
I am your partner.
ROBERT
You are not my partner! You work for me!
(off her bewildered stare)
That's right. You work for me!
(SITS)
Everybody works for me!
They pass a moment in silence. He looks at her destroyed
expression.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67.
ROBERT (CONT'D)
Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please?
Please. Just, just come here. Just
for a second and sit down.
She sits.
ROBERT (CONT'D)
(DEEP SIGH)
There's something I wanna tell you.
And whatever you decide I won't
blame you...
(she turns to look at him)
I'm on my own path. It's up to you
to move with it or against it. But
I'm the patriarch; that's my role.
And I have to play it.
BROOKE
(stares a while, then)
For a moment I thought you were
gonna say you were sorry.
She walks off.
Hold on Robert alone in the park.
ROBERT
(SOTTO)
I'm sorry.
Jimmy approaches the building. Bryer exits his sedan and
walks over to him.
JIMMY
(SEEING BRYER)
Oh, man, what?
BRYER
Jimmy, take a ride with me.
JIMMY
Where? Back to the station?
BRYER
No man, just get in the car.
JIMMY
What if I say no?
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 68.
BRYER
I'm not threatening you. I'm just
asking you -- take a ride with me.
Jimmy considers, gets into Bryer's car.
We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The
prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next
to Jimmy.
DEFERLITO
That was the early morning of April 11th.
JIMMY
Yes.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72.
DEFERLITO
You received a phone call?
JIMMY
Yes.
DEFERLITO
Who called you?
Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.
JIMMY
It was a wrong number.
DEFERLITO
That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?
JIMMY
No.
DEFERLITO
You stayed on the phone one-and-a-
half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it
the case that you know exactly who
called you and exactly why? Why are
you lying to this court?
JIMMY
I'm not lying.
DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He
picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.
DEFERLITO
I'm going to introduce into evidence
People's A. This is a toll booth
photograph taken in the northbound ninth
lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,
directing your attention to the
photograph, would you please read the
date and time stamp indicated on the
lower right hand corner?
Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.
JIMMY
This is crazy.
EARL
(whispers in Jimmy's ear)
You're gonna have to answer that.
DEFERLITO
Mr. Grant, please answer the question.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 73.
JIMMY
April 11th, two thirty-three am.
DEFERLITO
Mr. Grant, directing your attention
to the same photograph, would you
please read the license plate
number of the vehicle passing
through the toll?
JIMMY
D D G five five four two.
DEFERLITO
(handing in another sheet)
This is People's B, a printout from
the Department of Motor Vehicles
plate registry... Mr. Grant,
directing your attention to that
printout, are those numbers on the
toll photograph the same ones that
are on your own license plate?
Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.
DEFERLITO (CONT'D)
Mr. Grant?
JIMMY
Yes.
DEFERLITO
Yes, the numbers are the same?
JIMMY
Yes.
DEFERLITO
How do you explain that?
JIMMY
I can't.
DEFERLITO
But that is your car in this
photograph, isn't it?
JIMMY
No.
DEFERLITO
No, that is not your car?
(off his silence)
Answer the question, Mr. Grant.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 74.
JIMMY
This is not my car in this picture.
I don't know how you all did that,
but this is not my car.
DEFERLITO
You expect this grand jury to
believe that that is not your car
when there is a printout from the
department of motor vehicles...
EARL
That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
DEFERLITO
Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're
not permitted to go on record.
Robert heads through a dark service entrance towards a
buzzer, then down a long hallway.
ROBERT (PRE-LAP)
Hello.
A steady stream of CARS passes through the toll. We follow a
BLUE LEXUS as it approaches the far right lane.
Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE
RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.
RITTENBAND
Well they look a little different to me,
too... Is there a reason you haven't
allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to
conduct his own analysis?
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92.
DEFERLITO
We've had some issues regarding
chain-of-custody...
RITTENBAND
...You don't have them anymore.
You're to meet him with the evidence
in the next hour.
DEFERLITO
I'm afraid that's not possible.
A beat.
RITTENBAND
Where's the tape?
(ANOTHER BEAT)
Am I not speaking loud enough?
BRYER
Your honor...
RITTENBAND
Yes?
DEFERLITO
It seems there's been...
RITTENBAND
...Let him tell me.
BRYER
We don't know where it is.
RITTENBAND
Come again?
BRYER
It's not in the evidence locker.
RITTENBAND
Where is it?
BRYER
We don't know.
Silence. Rittenband leans forward.
RITTENBAND
I'll ask you one last time,
detective. Where is the tape?
BRYER
(after a beat)
We lost it.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.
RITTENBAND
Hmmm... In light of these
developments, and I would think you
should be very happy to hear this,
with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going
to offer Mr. Deferlito the
opportunity to voluntarily dismiss
the indictment to save us all a
bunch of embarrassment.
DEFERLITO
I don't feel comfortable with that,
your honor.
RITTENBAND
Further I'm going to put all charges
against Mr. Grant under seal.
(Bryer starts heading to
THE DOOR)
This case is dismissed with prejudice
and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,
Detective.
(Bryer stops.)
If you have another suspect in the
automobile death then you are to present
him, but Mr. Grant is free from any
further inquiry in this matter. This is
over. Do I have your understanding?
EARL
Thank you.
Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.
RITTENBAND
Close the door, detective,
please...
Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.
RITTENBAND (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
You finessed these, didn't you...?
BRYER
I'm sorry?
RITTENBAND
...You finessed it. I know it, and
you know it.
No response.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 94.
RITTENBAND (CONT'D)
I know who you're after. I saw all the
evidence, not just the toll photo. You
gotta get him the right way.
BRYER
Oh, okay.
(approaches the judge)
So let me get this straight: What
you're telling me is I'm supposed to
sit around with my thumb up my ass
and my fingers crossed hoping that
one of these fucking days, somewhere
down the line, one of these rich
assholes is gonna say the wrong thing
LOUD enough so that we can't choose
to ignore it anymore?
RITTENBAND
(BEAT)
Get the fuck outta of my office.
BRYER
Yes, your honor.
Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.
ROBERT
You didn't hurt anybody. You helped
a lot of people.
Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95.
JIMMY
And this piece of paper makes
everything okay?
ROBERT
No, it makes it easier.
JIMMY
(BEAT)
You worried I'm gonna say something?
ROBERT
No.
Jimmy keeps staring at the document.
JIMMY
Robert, look: you asked me to come
meet you and I'm here, but I came
because I wanted to get something
straight between us: we're even.
ROBERT
Okay, we're even. But just for the
record though, what you did...
(picks up the trust document)
Was way beyond the money.
JIMMY
(LAUGHS)
Nothing's beyond money for you.
ROBERT
(LAUGHS BACK)
Thanks a lot.
JIMMY
(pointing to the document)
And if I take this, then what does
that say about me?
He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in
his pocket.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money
and do something good with it.
Hold on Jimmy.
They arrive at the Plaza Hotel and exit the car
