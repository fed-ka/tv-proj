
      CLARK takes LOIS' hand and they run out of the park, across
      the street to a lighted doorway.



      Lois and Clark step into the dry and shake themselves off.
      Then they look at each other as she hands him back his
      glasses.

                                      CLARK
                     It's the new glasses, isn't it?
                     They just don't work as good as the
                     old ones.

                     I guess the first question is, 'How
                     long have you known?'

                                      LOIS
                     Really?  I thought the first
                     question'd be, 'How'd you figure it
                     out?'

                                      CLARK
                     They're kind of neck and neck with,
                     'How mad are you?'

                                      LOIS
                     How about we save that one for
                     last?

                                      CLARK
                     Oh-kay.                                           (X)

      Lois shivers, dripping, then sneezes.

                     Here.

      He steps back, lowers his glasses and a SPRAY of HEAT VISION
      caresses her body, drying her.

                                      LOIS
                     Thanks.  So.  How long have I 
                     known?  Since yesterday.  And how 
                     did I figure it out?
                           (reaches for his hand)

                                      LOIS
                     I've touched you before.... both of
                     you... but something about almost
                     dying sharpened everything, all my

                     So how mad are you?

                     This is gonna be worse than mad,
                     isn't it?
                           (she turns and walks)
                     Okay, I've been rehearsing for
                     months, let's see if I can get it
                     right:

                     wanted to be the one to tell                      (X)
                     you... so you could understand how                (X)
                     hard this has been... how long                    (X)
                     I've carried this secret by myself                (X)

                                      LOIS
                     -- became a target, so anyone close 
                     to you would be a target, and then 
                     it got more complicated when you 
                     realized you loved me --

                     I get all the reasoning, I really 
                     do, it's logical, it's even 
                     thoughtful but when you get right 
                     down to it, you made me believe you 
                     were two people and you did it by 
                     lying and that makes me wonder if I 
                     even _know_ you and that hurt me 
                     and you know what?

      Before Clark can utter his next syllable, he hears a MAN'S
      SCREAM from around the corner.  He and Lois both turn toward
      it.  Then she looks at him.

                                      LOIS

                     Whoa.

      -- then a second SCREAM from the same man brings them both
      back to the immediacy of the moment.  He's gone in a
      SUPER-BLUR.



      A LEATHER-CLAD THUG is on his knees, arms twisted behind his
      back by TWO MEN IN BLACK SUITS.  The Thug is the one
      SCREAMING, unwilling to let go of his knife.  The Men in
      Black exert more pressure.  The knife drops.  Superman
      SHOOTS into sight.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Let him go.

      A TIMID MAN steps from the shadows.  Torn sweater, glasses
      askew; scared.

                                      TIMID MAN
                     No, Superman, they saved me.  I was
                     walking home and this guy --
                           (the Thug)
                     -- jumped me and these two came out
                     of nowhere.  If it wasn't for them,
                     I... I...

      Lois comes around the corner now.  Superman looks at the Men
      in Black and notices identical insignias on their breast
      pockets: brightly stylized "C's."

                     thanks for trying to help.

      The condescension is not lost.  A brief look between the 
      two.  Superman just nods:  oooooh-kay.  Then, with a 
      no-nonsense efficiency, the Men in Black slide into the 
      sedan with the Thug and the Timid Man.

                                      LOIS
                     I think it was easier talking to
                     Clark...

                                      SUPERMAN
                     You still are.

                                      LOIS
                     That's just it... I don't know
                     anymore.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Let me prove it.

      He produces the ring again.  She looks at it, then him, then...

                                      LOIS
                     No...

      His faces creases.  He's surprised how much this hurts.

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     ... I mean, I can't, yet... I need                (X)
                     to think...

      He nods and closes the case.  A little too sharply.

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     Clark...

      He can't look at her.

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     ... do you understand?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Sure.

                     Oh, I see, it's okay for you to be 
                     mad but I'm not supposed to feel

                     Well, I'm telling you I _do_ and
                     it's fine and... I've got to...
                           (makes flying gesture)
                     ... you know.

      Before she can object, he takes off, leaving Lois alone on 
      the night street.

                                      LOIS
                     I hate it when he does that.



      An eleven year old RUNNER slides into a base clearly out as      (X)
      the ten-year-old BASEMAN tags him. Superman stands near.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     You're out!

                     That's not a very sportsmanlike
                     attitude.

                                      RUNNER
                     This game was a whole lot better
                     before we had some umpire we never
                     asked for. The bats and balls are                 (X)
                     mine and I'm outta here.                          (X)

      The runner gathers his stuff and stalks off.  The game           (X)
      starts to break up.                                              (X)

                     play ball... Guys? Guys?



      Paintings and sculpture being brought in.  We glimpse a few
      famous pieces as they're carried past by WORKMEN.  A beaming
      Senior looks on as his son walks up to him.

                     I mean, what have I been doing with
                     money all these ears, hoarding and
                     investing...?  Ridiculous.

                     Preposterous.

      As Junior laughs with his father, Mindy sidles up to Senior.

                     Well, I had a nice long talk with
                     the newest Mrs. Church.
                           (pulls out cigar)

                     If the nurse says it's all right.

      Junior and Senior both slide cigars into their mouths.
      Mindy is standing between them, looking at father, then son, 
      as both pat their pockets for a light.

      Mindy flicks a lighter, first lights up Senior, then Junior.

                     Rodin wanted to see you about the

                     I have a kind of a thought.

                     Well, one thing I've learned from 
                     my wife... don't ask the price, 
                     when the reward is joy.  Right,

      uncomfortably.

                     Clark, do you realize what just 
                     happened?  We were sent to 
                     investigate and spent the whole 
                     time wallowing.  We wallowed.  I 
                     hate wallowers and that's what 
                     we've turned into -- a couple of 
                     sighing, slack-jawed, self-pitying 
                     wallowers!

                     For whatever it's worth, I x-rayed 
                     under the store and found evidence 
                     of machinery being dismantled.  
                     Church could be telling the truth.

                     to someone changes your life, maybe 
                     gets you to think about things in a

                     Look. Balloons.

                     I want to buy them all... and give
                     then to the children.

      He toddles off across the street, leaving Junior and Mindy
      alone.

                                      JUNIOR
                     He's losing brain cells by the

                     Well, as crazy as he is, he can
                     still read a paper.  If Lois Lane
                     publishes what she knows --

                     invitation to a party she won't be
                     able to resist.

                                      MINDY
                     And what about Superman?

                                      JUNIOR
                     We plan just a little better for
                     him this time.



      The party in progress.  CLUSTERS of PEOPLE in fine clothes;      (X)
      a bar and buffet.  At the center of it all, Bill Church,
      Senior, greeting heartily.  Junior and Mindy linger off to
      the corner.

                     In a few minutes, this museum's
                     going to be the world's most
                     expensive pile of ashes.

                                      MINDY
                     I promise you, Billy, we'll visit
                     your Dad in prison every Sunday.

                     Actually, every other Sunday'd be
                     fine. He wasn't much of a father.

                     Bomb squad boys are in the museum, 
                     dressed as guards, doing a sweep.

                     Good plan.

      He scans the buffet table with X-RAY VISION, looking through
      the clothes of TWO PASSERSBY, seeing their hose, socks and       (X)
      underwear, then --

                     Just found a job for Superman.

      He starts to move, then his X-RAY VISION picks up RIPPLING       (X)
      WAVES of ENERGY, emitted from the bomb, hitting his body,

                     kind of computer clock wired to 
                     these really, really big canisters

                     Uh, so, do I want to detach the 
                     wires?  If I'm right, say 'Lois,' 
                     if I'm wrong say, 'Lane.'
