      EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - MORNING

      JANE TIMONEY is running. From a distance she looks pretty 
      good but up close - it s not going well. Her body is tense, 
      her breathing is ragged. She s focused on something - and 
      some distance ahead we can SEE a mid40s MAN sitting on a 
      bench, sweaty after his own run, talking on a CELL. This is 
      MATT WEBB. As he hangs up and STANDS, Jane SLOWS, then STOPS 
      completely, clutching a stitch in her side. Matt starts to 
      speak - but she holds up a finger -

                                  MATT
                          (sympathetic)
                    Aw, no, you re kidding. Really?

      - then looks away and DRY-HEAVES once, then takes as deep a 
      breath as she can muster and lets it out, panting. 

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    That half banana I tried to made 
                    you eat seeming like a pretty good 
                    idea right about now, huh.

                                  JANE
                    First mile or so was all right... 
                    Then the wheels came off.

                                  MATT
                    So what, you re out here. That s 
                    not nothing. And the more the 
                    nicotine works out of your system, 
                    the easier it ll be. 
                          (gesturing)
                    You ll be Dustin Hoffman-ing all 
                    over this damn park.

      Jane doesn t reply. She SPITS some phlegm into the bushes.  

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    So... Tricia just said she wants to 
                    stop by tomorrow now. 

      - then rolls her eyes.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Sorry. But I just figured let s get 
                    it over with already.

                                  JANE
                    Sure, if this is gonna do that.                                                                                      2.


                                  MATT
                    She says it is. She says she just 
                    doesn t want Owen to be staying 
                    over someplace she s never seen.

                                  JANE
                          (shrugs)
                    Makes sense.

                                  MATT
                    Yeah. Or, it s just more of her 
                    holding me over a barrel with my 
                    own kid - And dragging you into it 
                    too now -

                                  JANE
                    She s just flexing her muscles, 
                    Matty. She s got nothing else to 
                    flex them about. So we just have to 
                    let her. Just bite down and let her 
                    til we get what you want.

                                  MATT
                    Right on. I hope.

      Jane is distracted suddenly. She turns her head sharply -

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    You gonna come home and shower, or 
                    go there and do it?

                                  JANE
                    There.

      - and we SEE a MAN approaching nearby, smoking a CIGARETTE. 
      Jane takes a deep satisfying LUNGFUL of the secondhand smoke, 
      then one more -

                                  MATT
                    Wow, that doesn t seem like the 
                    best idea. 

      - then catches the man s eye.

                                  JANE
                    Hey - No smoking this part of the 
                    park.

                                  MAN
                    Yeah? Go find a cop. 

      Jane unzips the iPod arm pocket of her jacket and produces - 
      a DETECTIVE BADGE. As the man reacts -                                                                                      3.


                                  JANE
                    Yeah? Go put it out.

      As the man steps on the cigarette, then hurries away -

                                  MATT
                    ... Maybe try one of the patches 
                    today, huh? I don t think the gum s 
                    getting the whole job done -

                                  JANE
                          (turning to him)
                    You want some of this?

                                  MATT
                    Hell no? Love you. 

      They kiss. Then Matt smacks Jane on the ass and runs off 
      south toward the Great Lawn. Jane watches him go, then turns 
      and contemplates the reservoir path. As she steels herself, 
      then starts jogging again, toward the North Meadow...

      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

      DETECTIVES REG DUFFY, thin and mean 40s, AUGIE BLANDO, hen-
      pecked class clown, 40s, and PHIL CARTER, former Div II 
      linebacker, 30s, all bootied and gloved, wait and talk. 

                                  BLANDO
                    I thought I wanted the Sig. But I 
                    keep coming back to the Smith.

                                  DUFFY
                    What about instead of getting 
                    another gun you try enjoying the 
                    ones you got.

      DETECTIVE GERRY KEATING, jovial athletic alpha-dog in his 
      early 40s, reaches the landing. The men turn, smiling.

                                    KEATING
                    Morning, heathens.

      Duffy hands Keating gloves and booties. Keating puts them on -

                                  CARTER
                    Hey Skip, you met Brenda, right? At 
                    the racket for Stevie Saracco? Tell 
                    these dummies she s good-looking.

                                    KEATING
                    Sure she is. You take four subways 
                    to work - You re a real catch.                                                                                      4.


      As he speaks, Keating precedes the other three men into -

      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      A grim bloody perversion of a bedroom, framed by incongruous 
      sunshine streaming through the windows. Crime scene photo 
      steps carefully around the destroyed body of a woman. The 
      other detectives wait by the door as Keating approaches her. 

                                    KEATING
                    ... Connie? Corine?

                                  DUFFY
                    Courtney. Edgerton.

                                    KEATING
                    Courtney. She dug deep, huh.

                                  BLANDO
                    Heart like Cinderella Man. 

                                  CARTER
                    I d fight hard too. Far as she knew 
                    the kids were next.

                                    KEATING
                    Right. And the kids were where?

      Duffy points to the closed doors of the bedroom s walk-in 
      CLOSET. Keating sighs. 

                                    KEATING (CONT D)
                    Yeah... That oughta be fun. 

      As Keating shakes gloved hands with a nearby PHOTOGRAPHER -

                                    KEATING (CONT D)
                    Hal, how they hangin. 

                                  HAL
                    Gerry, low and lazy.

                                    KEATING
                    One deluxe package, with extra 
                    shots of the ceiling? Please. 

      Keating heads out followed by the other detectives. As Hal 
      turns his camera toward the blood-spattered CEILING...

      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY/KITCHEN/FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      ... we re back on Keating and the guys, now outside the 
      kitchen door. Inside the room we SEE a stunned MAN in his 40s 
      with blood on his clothes, sitting guarded by two uniforms.                                                                                      5.


                                  DUFFY
                    Family friend. He found her. Curtis 
                    Hall - 

                                  BLANDO
                    Hull. Like Bobby Hull.

                                  DUFFY
                            (raspberries this)
                    Hockey. Anyway, he s in there and 
                    the kids are in their room with the 
                    nanny.

                                    KEATING
                    Augie, get an ETA on the husband?

                                  BLANDO
                    You want a child psych, too? Might 
                    take a while to get em over here.

                                    KEATING
                    - How come the nanny wasn t with 
                    the kids this morning? How come the 
                    kids were with the mom while she 
                    was getting killed?

                                  DUFFY
                    Dentist. 

                                    KEATING
                    Huh. Lucky girl.

                                  CARTER 
                    Not if she got like, a root canal.

                                    KEATING
                    Well, right. Murder and root canal 
                    would be a push. 

      As they head off down the hall chuckling -

      INT. MANHATTAN NORTH HOMICIDE - HALLWAY/SQUADROOM - DAY

      - we FIND Jane at her desk, open file in front of her. As she 
      pulls open a drawer and takes out a fresh pack of GUM, a 
      middle-aged POLICE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT, SUSAN BAKER, 
      approaches her with message slips.

                                  SUSAN
                    Here, Detective - Got any more gum? 

                                  JANE
                    It s nicotine.                                                                                       6.


                                  SUSAN
                          (weighs this, then shrugs)
                    ... First time for everything.

      As Jane hands Susan the pack of gum, Carter and Blando ENTER, 
      talking. They don t see her.

                                  BLANDO
                    Hull and the husband been friends 
                    since college.  87ish. He says they 
                    were supposed to be playing 
                      racquetball at eight a.m. But Doc 
                    Edgerton says, at seven thirty he 
                    was in scrubs at Lenox Hill. He s a 
                    - some kind of surgeon. 

      Blando pats himself down for his notebook. Jane stares at 
      them, her expression turning from disbelief to rage -

                                  CARTER
                    Maybe the doc just forgot. Or maybe 
                     playing racquetball  is code for 
                     nailing your wife while you re at 
                    work .

                                  BLANDO
                    Maybe, baby - Thoracic. Thoracic 
                    surgeon. What the hell even is 
                    that. Dinosaurs?

      - then STANDS, her chair skittering back. 

                                  JANE
                    Hey.

      Blando widens his eyes at Carter, who smirks and looks away. 
      As Susan the PAA makes a furtive escape -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You re kidding me here. Right? 
                    You re gonna do this again? 

                                  BLANDO
                    ... Pardon?

      Jane gestures angrily at a DRY-ERASE BOARD on the wall 
      nearby. It has names written on it in descending order. The 
      one at the top says J. TIMONEY. Below it is Keating s name.

                                  JANE
                    My name was top of the board going 
                    into last night. Right? So you want 
                    to explain to me how now you guys 
                    are working a case and I m not? -                                                                                      7.


                                  BLANDO
                    Well, when a bad man does a murder 
                    and someone calls the police? The 
                      responding officer calls his 
                    sergeant, and that sergeant calls a 
                    homicide detective. And that 
                    homicide detective - Was not you.

                                  JANE
                    Lemme guess. The sergeant is Pratt?
                          (off their silence)
                    So it s his fault. Again. Just want 
                    to be clear - You guys are using 
                    the exact same excuse as last time. 

                                  BLANDO
                    Yeeeah, I don t like living in the 
                    past. 

                                  CARTER
                          (shrugs at Jane)
                    Pratt gets a murder, he calls 
                    Gerry. He s known Gerry since Gerry 
                    was pissing his diaper. He doesn t 
                    know you. 

                                  BLANDO
                    Well, he might a little. I mean - 
                    He has ears. 

                                  CARTER
                    Let s just agree to both be right.

      Jane SEES the squad commander, LT KENNY ROWE, 55ish in a 
      baggy suit, going into his office. She abruptly follows. As 
      Keating now enters, Blando cocks his head toward Jane s back.

                                  BLANDO
                    Think it might be on, this time.

                                    KEATING
                    Yeah? Who s got two thumbs and was 
                    the Brooklyn College intramural 
                    ping-pong champion? And also could 
                    give a rat s ass? - 
                          (suddenly)
                    Nobody move. We gotta call Rosie.

      Keating dials his cell. A huge grin creases his face -                                                                                       8.


                                    KEATING (CONT D)
                    Happy birthday! Who s my girl?
                    But that s why I called - I got 
                    Uncle Augie and Uncle Philly and 
                    we re all gonna sing it together!
                          (aside to Carter)
                    Run get Reg, he s in the can.

      INT. LIEUTENANT ROWE S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      - while Jane stands across from a sitting, frustrated Rowe. 

                                  ROWE
                    So I m supposed to go out there and 
                    tell them what. To not have 
                    opinions? To stop being mean? What. 

                                  JANE
                    If I kept blowing off the catching 
                    order and grabbing someone s cases - 
                    What would happen. Anything?

                                  ROWE
                    What re you asking me for, Jane? 
                    I m not taking it away from those 
                    guys now. They got momentum going, 
                    I don t mess with that -

                                  JANE
                    Is what you said the last time.

                                  ROWE
                            (frustrated)
                    Look, I ll make it right. All 
                    right? You just gotta be patient 
                    and show them you can hang -

                                  JANE
                    Is what you said the last time.

      As they stare at each other, at an impasse, from the 
      squadroom through the closed door we HEAR voices in SONG -

                                    KEATING ETC (O.S.)
                    Near Bannbridge Town in the County 
                    Down
                    One morning last July
                    Down a boreen green came a sweet 
                    colleen
                    And she smiled as she passed me by.

      Rowe can t help smiling a little. Jane does not smile.                                                                                      9.

                                  JANE
                    I ate.

      Jane heads for the door. Rowe is annoyed.

      She PULLS the door open in time for an EXPLOSION of -

                                    KEATING ETC (O.S.)
                    Happy birthday, Rosie! We love you!

      We FOLLOW Jane as she ignores the sound and heads off to -

      INT. SQUAD - HALLWAY - LATER

      - where she passes DETECTIVE DON KORILKO, broad with a healed 
        many-times-broken nose, coming out of an interview room.

                                  JANE
                    Need a hand?

                                    KORILKO
                    Somebody saying I do?

                                  JANE
                    Not you specifically. So?

      Korilko considers, shrugs. He leans over and OPENS the door 
      of the interview room briefly to display a startled African-
      American MAN in his 20s, then SLAMS it.                                                                                      10.


                                    KORILKO
                    He s Russell Moss. He and his girl 
                    go up on top of a building on 
                    152nd, long story short, he throws 
                    the girl off the roof. Or so is my 
                    surmise, since Russell s pretending 
                    he s deaf. 

                                  JANE
                    Okay, so you want to talk to him 
                    together, or me to take a shot 
                    alone, or what?

                                    KORILKO
                    Yeah... I grabbed Russell off the 
                    street, so he didn t have time to 
                    get rid of whatever he might ve had 
                    to get rid of? So actually, I need 
                    someone to go out to Brooklyn and 
                    pick up his stuff. If you could. 

      Jane almost hides her dismay. Korilko raises an eyebrow.

                                    KORILKO (CONT D)
                    He s been at that homeless shelter 
                    in the old Cumberland Hospital?... 
                    Off the Gowanus? -

                                  JANE
                    I know where it is.

      Jane heads off. Duffy appears and watches her go. As he WINKS 
      and overhand-tosses Korilko a plastic-wrapped egg-on-a-roll -

      INT. CUMBERLAND HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY

      A blaring TELEVISION is bolted high on the wall, showing NY1. 
      The sullen  security guard , RAY MORESCO, watches from his 
      counter as Jane uses his keys to unlock a PADLOCKED locker. 
      As she does, Jane indicates the blaring TV with her head.

                                  JANE
                    How s that not make you nuts.

                                    MORESCO
                          (crabby)
                    Getting asked to turn it up fifty 
                    times a minute makes me nuts. 

      Jane OPENS the locker. She pulls out a rumpled dirty shirt, a 
      dirty pair of pants, another shirt, assorted belongings. As 
      she puts them in a plastic bag, she looks over the clothing. 
      We see it has R. MOSS stamped on the inside.                                                                                    11.


                                  JANE
                    Russell just got out of jail, huh?

                                    MORESCO
                    Never been in far as I know. 

                                  JANE
                    Well, but there s Dannemora-issue 
                    stuff here. Shirts and pants -

                                    MORESCO
                    Probly he lets Robert keep his 
                    stuff in there too. 

                                  JANE
                    ... Robert. 

                                  ROBERT
                    He been out for a couple weeks. 
                    Went upstate off some drug thing. 
                    Said he got the same cell Tupac 
                    had, back in the day - 

                                  JANE
                    And Robert s Russell s what, 
                    brother?
                          (Moresco nods)
                    And he s staying here too?
                          (Moresco nods)
                    But he s not here now.
                          (Moresco shakes his head)
                    He comes back can you give a call?

                                    MORESCO
                          (shrugs)
                    I guess. But might not even be me 
                    here when he comes back, so. 

      Jane gathers Russell s stuff, then stands and crosses to him.

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, and when you are, you cover 
                    this whole place - I can see you 
                    can t be looking out for one guy.
                            ( suddenly )
                    Would you be willing to be 
                      deputized? You up for that?

      Moresco stares at her. Then suddenly -

                                    MORESCO
                    Who d do it, you? What do we do?                                                                                    12.


                                  JANE
                    Well, you mind taking an oath?

      Moresco blinks as Jane produces her BADGE and holds it out.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Put your hand on the emblem. Right 
                    between the pilgrim and the Indian.

      Moresco does, staring at Jane with something a little like 
      awe. Jane returns his gaze with a serious expression.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Raymond Moresco, you solemnly swear 
                    to uphold the laws and constitution 
                    of this great state of New York?

                                    MORESCO
                    Uh-huh?

                                  JANE
                    Then you are hereby deputized from 
                    this day forward by Detective Jane 
                    Timoney of the NYPD.
                          (withdraws the badge)
                    Welcome aboard the fight, Mr. 
                    Moresco. You see Robert Moss? You 
                    call me.

      At a loss for how to respond, Moresco suddenly SALUTES. 
      Without missing a beat or condescending Jane SALUTES back, 
      then exits with the bag, biting back a smile as she goes...

      INT. BOROUGH HQ - MEETING ROOM - DAY (LATER)

      Informational Meeting, held to brief all bureau detectives at 
      once on crimes of note/cases in progress, led by the Chief of 
      Manhattan Ds, CHARLIE BONDLOW. It hasn t started yet. 

      Jane enters. She sees Keating and the others, including 
      Korilko, sitting together. Then she spots a MAN with a CAST 
      on his arm, smiling at her. She crosses to him smiling back.

                                  JANE
                    Evrard... You bored here yet? 

      This is EVRARD VELERIO, a friend of Jane s since the Academy. 
      Half-black, half-Dominican, all cool. He worked Midtown South 
      Homicide with Jane before her transfer, but he was shot on a 
      case before she transferred and he s been on medical leave.                                                                                    13.


                                  EVRARD
                    You kidding? I m recuperating. I 
                    answer some phones, I take a little 
                    break. I make some copies, I have a 
                    little lunch. I m telling you, 
                    Janie - Get shot. 

      As Jane starts to reply, Chief Bondlow RAISES his voice.

                                    BONDLOW
                    Simmer down, listen up. First up, 
                    high priority - The Gracie Mansion 
                    area dickie waver strikes again. 
                          (as the detectives laugh)
                    Ha ha, and the mayor s very upset, 
                    his dinner guests choke on their 
                    oysters, it s all very uncivilized, 
                    let s try to help out if we can.

      Bondlow gestures to an SVU DETECTIVE, LOUIE MOORE.

                                    BONDLOW (CONT D)
                    Next up we got a string of rapes on 
                    the East Side, which Moore from SVU 
                    here is going to tell us about.

                                  MOORE
                    Yeah, okay, we ve ID d a pattern of 
                    rapes on Madison Ave. 

      Moore crosses to a MAP of the East Side of Manhattan, studded 
      with red thumbtacks, propped on a stand in preparation. 

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Starting at 87st and Lex, 
                      continuing here, here, and so 
                    forth, they all start as push-in 
                    type attacks. And the guy s a real 
                    freak. No fooling. He does it all. 

      Off Jane as she stares hard at the map -

      INT. BOROUGH HQ - MEETING ROOM - LATER

      - and as the meeting breaks up, she approaches it. Moore is 
      still standing near it. Jane smiles at him.

                                  JANE

                    What can I do for you.                                                                                    14.


                                  JANE
                    Well, you probably noticed how 
                    close your rapes are clustered to 
                    the Edgerton townhouse murder - 

                                  MOORE
                    Yeah, but ours are all early 20s, 
                    single. Ours are all apartments. 
                    None of ours have kids. Or money - 
                    Besides, I thought you have the 
                    guy. The husband s friend. Right?

                                  JANE
                    Okay, but isn t the geography worth 
                    looking into? How many push-in 
                    rapists are there gonna be working 
                    in the same twenty block radius -

                                  MOORE
                    You hear me ask Gerry Keating if 
                    you had a robbery? You didn t. Our 
                    guy s taken jewelry from all of 
                    ours. What you want me to say?

                                  JANE
                    That you ll keep an open mind.

                                  MOORE
                    My ride s gonna leave without me.

      Moore heads off, rolling his eyes. As Jane watches him go, we 
      PULL BACK to SEE - Duffy, Keating and the others coming to 
      form a wall behind her. They stare past her at the map and 
      talk as if she isn t there.

                                  DUFFY
                    This Edgerton case is really 
                    something else. Right, Skip?

                                    KEATING
                    Reg, my son, I am crazy about this 
                    case. To quote the poet, I like 
                    this case like Patton liked war.

                                  BLANDO
                    It s a press case, for sure. Case 
                    like that is where grade is made.

                                  CARTER
                    Case like that you have to deserve. 

                                    KORILKO
                    Some people don t think so.                                                                                     15.


                                    KEATING
                    You know, I ve heard that too?

                                  DUFFY
                    What would you tell those people, 
                    Skip. Assuming they could hear you.

                                    KEATING
                    Well now, I d tell them a story. A 
                    story about the Beef Trust.

                                  BLANDO
                    I love that story.

                                    KEATING
                    A squad is only as good as its Beef 
                    Trust. Because - the Beef Trust 
                    only cares about the work. They 
                    knock on doors. They follow leads. 
                    They hear the words on the streets. 

                                  DUFFY
                    They don t bang Bureau Chiefs to 
                    transfer out of Midtown South.

                                    KEATING
                    Subtle, Reg. But relevant, 
                      nonetheless.
                          (he leans toward Jane)
                    The Beef Trust can t flutter their 
                      eyelashes. All the Beef Trust can 
                    do is the work. That s why they 
                    deserve cases. All the cases. And 
                    that s why they take what they 
                    deserve.

      Keating lets his words settle. Then he turns away. 

                                  CARTER
                      A stirring speech. An epic. 

                                  BLANDO
                    A Song of Solomon.

                                    KEATING
                    Many thanks. Let us commemorate our 
                      fellowship with the adding of 
                    liquor to ice.

      Keating heads out. The others follow, leaving Jane alone by 
      the map. We PUSH IN on her face as she keeps her eyes fixed 
      on it, waiting for them to be gone. When they are she takes 
      one deep BREATH and lets it out slowly...                                                                                    16.


                                        ACT ONE

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DAY 2)

      Jane stands filling a glass with filtered water. 

                                  TRICIA (O.S.)
                    Ours is bigger but yours still has 
                    to be what, eighty pounds?

                                  MATT (O.S.)
                    No one s arguing with you, Tricia.

      Jane squeezes her eyes shut. Then she heads for -

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      -  where Matt sits in an armchair. Across from him on the 
      couch sits his ex-wife, TRICIA. Matt looks up, tense.

                                  MATT
                    Tricia wants us to mount the TV.

                                  TRICIA
                    Also, the instant boiling water 
                    thing, on your kitchen sink? So 
                    something designed for a world 
                    without six-year-old boys. 

                                  MATT
                    I said we d get the super to 
                    disable it. I know you use it but -

                                  JANE
                    Fine. It s fine.

      Jane holds out the water glass to Tricia, who takes it with a 
      vague nose-wrinkle thank-you smile. As she does -

                                  TRICIA
                    Is it going to be hard to not have 
                    your phone around Owen, Jane? With 
                    your job? We really try to not use 
                    our phones around him, I m sure 
                    Matt s told you.

                                  JANE
                    He did. So if we take care of the 
                    TV and the hot water filter, then -

                                  TRICIA
                    Matt has the list.                                                                                    17.


                                  JANE
                    - But then Owen can start spending 
                    the night here?

                                  TRICIA
                          (vaguely)
                    That s the idea - Oh! I can t 
                    believe I almost forgot. 

      Tricia sighs importantly. As Jane stares at her, fed up with 
      everything, not just this -

                                  TRICIA (CONT D)
                    Jane... I know uniformed policemen 
                    carry guns. I ve seen that. But I 
                    didn t know if that meant that you -

                                  JANE
                    It does.

      As Matt looks over at Jane, alerted by her tone -

                                  TRICIA
                    Well. I wasn t sure. But so what do 
                    you do, with your guns?

      As Jane starts to answer, Matt suddenly interrupts.

                                  MATT
                    Actually there s just her duty 
                    weapon. And it used to be cops had 
                    to have that on them all the time. 
                    But they changed that rule, when?

                                  JANE
                    ... The eighties.

                                  MATT
                    Right. So now when she s off duty 
                    she just locks it in her desk at 
                    work. That s okay, isn t it?

                                  TRICIA
                    Why wouldn t it be, Matthew -

                                  JANE
                    Because I don t. 

      Jane leaves the room. As Matt and Tricia hurry after her...

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The door of a STANDING GUN SAFE is OPEN. PULL BACK to REVEAL 
      it sits in the bedroom closet, surrounded by clothes.                                                                                     18.


      Inside are various RIFLES and SHOTGUNS in vertical slots 
      below a shelf that holds a 9mm Glock in a SHOULDER RIG.

      REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL Tricia, blinking in disbelief. Matt 
      is behind her, angry. Jane looks from the safe to Tricia.

                                  JANE
                    Owen s not getting into this. Matt 
                    can barely get into it. If you 
                    still don t feel good about it, 
                    that s fine, I ll take care of it 
                    however you want. But I m not gonna 
                    lie about it. This is a fact.

      Tricia stares at her - then, balefully, at Matt. As he opens 
      his mouth, Tricia storms out. Matt glares at Jane.

                                  MATT
                    You re kidding. Are you kidding me! 

      Matt hurries after Tricia. As we HEAR muffled angry voices 
      and the front door SLAM, we STAY on Jane. She reaches for the 
      shoulder rig on the shelf and methodically PUTS it on...

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      ... then comes out to find Matt standing by the closed front 
      door, staring hard at nothing. 

                                  JANE
                    ... I want this to happen. But not 
                    like that - I don t want to be 
                    faking it in my own house -

                                  MATT
                    Just go.

      Matt disappears into the living room. As Jane blinks, then 
      EXITS, pulling the door quietly shut behind her... 

      INT. SQUAD - COFFEE ROOM - DAY

      Jane comes in - and SLOWS DOWN. REVEAL Keating alone, pouring 
      himself the last of the coffee. He glances over, then puts 
      the empty pot back and attends to his brimming mug. Jane 
      crosses and starts making a fresh pot. As she does -

                                  JANE
                    ... The Beef Trust, huh. Cool name.
                          (then, mildly)
                    They re not around, though, right? 
                    It s just you here now?

      Keating ignores her and takes a test sip. Jane leans in.                                                                                    19.




                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    They agree with you going full-out 
                    at Curtis Hull right from the jump?  
                    Any of them think there might be 
                    any other avenues worth exploring? 
                    Or - maybe they don t want you to 
                    make the case. Maybe they want it 
                    to get thrown out for lack. Because 
                    maybe they know when that happens, 
                    they ll be working for me.
                          (smiles)
                    Maybe the Beef Trust is looking 
                    forward to that. Huh? Maybe they re 
                      fluttering their eyelashes at that.

      Keating suddenly chuckles. He puts down his mug.

                                    KEATING
                    I know some women, all right? My 
                    wife, my daughter s gonna be one - 
                    My mom? So I can see, there s a 
                    couple different ways of doing it. 
                    But I m pretty sure - You re not 
                    doing it right.

                                  JANE
                    Why don t you worry less about me 
                    and more about doing your job. 

                                    KEATING
                    Sure. No hard feelings, right? Not 
                    on my part, anyway.
                          (turns to go, then stops)
                    Chief of Patrol Services Sheridan 
                    may have had them?... But I don t.

      He s gone. Jane stares after him. Her CELL RINGS.

                                  JANE
                    Yeah.

                                    MORESCO (V.O.)
                      Detective? It s your deputy.

                                  JANE
                    My dep - Mr. Moresco. Howareya.

                                    MORESCO (V.O.)
                    Good - It s him. Robert Moss. He 
                    came back. Seems pretty jumpy too.                                                                                    20.


                                  JANE
                    We ll be right there, Mr. Moresco.
                    And, can I just say - With men like 
                    you on our side? I m starting to 
                    believe we can win this thing. 

      Jane hangs up. She looks at Keating s abandoned coffee MUG - 
      then TOSSES it in the garbage. Off her face as she heads out -

      EXT. BODEGA/INT. CAR - MORNING

      - to Korilko, behind the wheel. An African-American man sits 
      in the back. This is ROBERT MOSS. Moss is surprisingly 
      dressed in a button-down, argyle vest, penny loafers and 
      slacks with cuffs. Now the passenger door OPENS and Jane gets 
      in. She hands a soda and a candy bar to Moss.

                                  JANE
                    Those all right, Robert? You good? 

      Korilko PULLS AWAY from the curb abruptly. Jane ignores him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You know, I was gonna say before, 
                    Robert - You are looking stylish.

                                  MOSS
                    They got a bin for the lost and 
                    found, I just got em out of there.

                                  JANE
                    What re you apologizing for? Don t 
                      apologize. Those pants have cuffs. 
                    I just - wasn t expecting somebody 
                    so well-dressed, and articulate.
                          (she faces forward)
                    ... Night and day from your 
                    brother. Amazing.

                                  MOSS
                    You what?

                                  JANE
                    Well, I mean, you come with us like 
                    a man. Not whining and screaming 
                    like he did - They almost had to 
                    restrain him, you know? 
                          (turns and smiles)
                    But not you. You re a gentleman. 
                    Detective Korilko here s got cuffs 
                    on his pants too - But not like 
                    yours. Yours say classy, all the 
                    way. Classy with an edge.                                                                                     21.


      Moss sits back. He likes this, and Jane.

                                  MOSS
                    Classy with an edge, huh. Yeah. So 
                    where we going now.

                                    KORILKO
                    Back to the squad so we can talk. 

                                  MOSS
                          (suddenly nervous)
                    My brother gonna be there? 

                                    KORILKO
                    You don t need to worry about that.

                                  MOSS
                    Cause maybe he cry like a bitch 
                    with you all but that ain t how he 
                    is with me.

                                    KORILKO
                    Yeah, well, you re gonna tell us 
                    all about how he is with you.

                                  MOSS
                    Yeah, well. Maybe I m confused now.

                                    KORILKO
                    ... You what?

      As Korilko starts to turn around in his seat, still driving -

                                  JANE
                          (suddenly)
                    Let s just go to the roof. It s not 
                    that much further than the squad. 
                    We could go there, and you could 
                    show us what happened at the scene. 
                    Instead of tell us at the squad. 
                    Want to do that?

                                  MOSS
                    ... Maybe. Maybe, yeah.

                                  JANE
                    Don t waste Detective Korilko s 
                    time here, though, Robert. And he s 
                    gonna have the DA s office meet us 
                    there, so don t waste theirs 
                    either. We all take this trouble 
                    going to that roof? You re gonna 
                    show us what happened.                                                                                    22.


                                  MOSS
                          (enthusiastic)
                    I will. I ll show you.  

      Jane ignores Korilko s resentful eyes.

                                  JANE
                    Field trip.

      EXT. HARLEM ROOF - EARLY EVENING

      We SEE roof and skyline through a VIDEOCAMERA, which now 
      turns its EYE on Jane. 

                                  JANE
                    Detective Jane Timoney, Manhattan 
                    North Homicide. And we ve also got -

      Off her gesture, the CAMERA swings to each one in turn -

                                  ADA COLLINS
                          (rookie, startled)
                    I, ah, Drew Collins, Assistant 
                    District Attorney. Are we -

                                    KORILKO
                    Detective Don Korilko Manhattan 
                    North Homicide.

                                  CAMERAMAN
                    Mike Mannion on the camera.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    And last but of course not least -

                                  MOSS
                    I m Robert Moss.
                          (leans in)
                    I m the killer.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    ... So Robert, you want to talk 
                    about what happened here with you 
                    and your brother and Lola Arzuaga?

                                  MOSS
                    Okay, so I stay out in Brooklyn but 
                    I came in to see my brother and his 
                      girlfriend. That s Lola. I had a 
                    little money, we got a bottle and 
                    came up here. My brother found a 
                    jay he had, so it was like, let her 
                    drink while we go smoke this.                                                                                     23.


                                  JANE
                    And where did you go to do that?

      The camera follows Moss over to another part of the roof.

                                  MOSS
                    Here, and we re talkin about maybe 
                    go down the street find somebody - 
                    you know. To rob or whatever... But 
                    so we go back to get a drink, and 
                    she had finished the bottle. Lola.

                                  JANE
                      Seriously? And you re out of money, 
                    and you re six flights up?

                                  MOSS
                    And my brother s got this temper, 
                    even when we re kids - so Lola, he 
                    punches her in the face. Knocked 
                    her out cold. And he was in like a 
                    rage, he goes, Let s throw this 
                    bitch off the roof.

      Back on Jane in the flesh. As she starts to speak, Korilko 
      suddenly STEPS forward. He s taking back his case.

                                    KORILKO
                    What d you do when he said that.

                                  MOSS
                    If I m gonna be honest? First off I 
                    was thinking, I m just outta jail. 
                    So I was gonna ask like his 
                      permission, to make love to her 
                    first. But then I don t know how 
                    he s gonna react. He s already mad.

                                    KORILKO
                    So you didn t say anything.

                                  MOSS
                    Uh-uh. I just carry the heavy part. 
                    You know, the head. We go to the 
                    wall, and it was like Uhhh - and we 
                    just throwed her over like that.

      The camera WATCHES Moss mime hurling an invisible body off 
      the roof. It FOLLOWS the arc up and over to SEE - there s an 
      actual BODY-SHAPED OUTLINE in the leaves and branches of the 
      TREES below. As we HOLD on the outline...                                                                                    24.


      INT. LIEUTENANT ROWE S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

      ... Keating, Duffy and Rowe drink Jameson from jelly glasses. 

                                    KEATING
                    So they didn t see Hull. The mom 
                    came and got them and locked them 
                    in the closet first. But they also 
                    didn t not see him.

                                  ROWE
                    But if this is Hull, and he s been 
                    throwing a hump into Mrs. Edgerton 
                    for however long, then why rape.

                                  DUFFY
                    Because the autopsy says it is. 

                                    KEATING
                    She breaks it off? She makes him 
                    mad? Stranger things have happened?
                          (Rowe rolls his eyes)
                    What crawled up your ass and died.

                                  ROWE
                    Jane! Jane did. Because you guys 
                    hijack her cases and leave me on 
                    damage control. Thanks for that.

                                    KEATING
                    Aaaaand there it is.

                                  ROWE
                    She s a good detective, dummies -

                                  DUFFY
                    She s a good something, all right.

                                  ROWE
                    This is about her and Sheridan? 
                          (off their silence)
                    No - You want to talk, talk. 
                          (silence)
                    Obviously to you guys the work is 
                      irrelevant given what went on. No 
                    matter how long ago it was. And I m 
                    sure the Chief s wife d agree with 
                    you Jane shouldn t be rewarded for 
                    anything ever. But Jane got the nod 
                    here off how she handled the girl 
                    in the park. Off closing a good 
                    case. Sheridan never came into it. 
                    From what I hear they ve been done 
                    a long time anyway.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    25.

                                  ROWE (CONT'D)
                          (silence)
                    I m not gonna deny he was happy - 
                    But he found out the same time you 
                    clowns did. After her transfer was 
                    already done.
                          (silence) 
                    I m not a stooge.

                                    KEATING
                          (beat, then, sincerely)
                    We know, Kenny. You re a survivor.

                                  DUFFY
                    And she s an empty suit. 

      As Duffy shrugs at Rowe, CUT TO -

      EXT. HARLEM ROOF - EARLY EVENING - CONTINUOUS

      - Jane on the roof. Watching Robert Moss. 

                                  MOSS
                    We go back downstairs and Russell 
                    goes into some hallway and punches 
                    some guy, takes his money, and we 
                    went and got another bottle. And 
                    then I went back to Brooklyn.

                                    KORILKO
                    Anything else you want to say?

                                  MOSS
                    Yeah - I m Robert Moss... And I m 
                    looking for work.

                                    KORILKO
                    Okay, DeNiro. That s a cut. 

      Korilko hustles Moss to the access door. Collins watches them 
      go, stunned. Then he looks at Mannion, who is also stunned. 
      Then the two of them look at Jane - who is gazing OFF.

                                    MANNION
                    Janie? Whose case is that?

                                  JANE
                    It s a made case. 
                          (as they follow her gaze)
                    Wow. Right?

                                    MANNION
                    Excuse me for not being in the mood 
                    after we just had to listen to that 
                    guy like he s people.                                                                                    26.


                                  JANE
                    So I guess if I bought you a hot 
                    dog right now you wouldn t eat it? 

                                  ADA COLLINS
                          (suddenly)
                    I d eat it.

                                  JANE
                    Two for you.

      As Jane precedes the two men to the access door, REVERSE 
      ANGLE to SHOW - the magnificent SUNSET behind them...

      INT. LIEUTENANT ROWE S OFFICE - NIGHT

      ... and back on Keating, with a fresh glass of whiskey.

                                    KEATING
                    Time bombs. Ticking time bombs.

                                  DUFFY
                    IEDs. 

                                    KEATING
                    Roadside bombs. They lurk, Kenny. 
                    The good ones are urban myths, like 
                    the Yanks wearing pinstripes to 
                    make Ruth not look fat. Women DTs 
                    lurk and they wait to blow up the 
                    careers of good cops. They laugh at 
                    your dirty joke nine times and the 
                    tenth they call their union rep. 
                    One nut scratch is a hostile work 
                      environment. Tom Sheridan aside - 
                    That s just who your Janie is. One 
                    of us until it serves her not to be 
                    - And eventually it always does. 
                    I ll tell you a -

      Keating WINCES. He RUBS his arm, puzzled, as he stares at 
      Duffy, who is leaning forward to hand his glass to Rowe.

                                  DUFFY
                          (chuckles at him)
                    Ger, you all right? -

      Keating reaches for Duffy but misses as he FALLS to his 
      knees, then backward, his face blank with pain. As Rowe 
      snatches up the phone and Duffy goes to the floor to cradle 
      Keating ineffectually, his eyes filling with tears...                                                                                    27.


                                        ACT TWO

      INT. SQUADROOM - MORNING (DAY 3)

      The room is full of detectives, working the phones and typing 
      while keeping one eye on the door -

      - which now OPENS and Duffy enters, in the clothes he was 
      wearing last night. He has a plastic BAG gripped tightly but 
      forgotten in one hand. The noise in the room disappears. 

                                  DUFFY
                    They were prepping him for surgery, 
                    but he didn t... He died.

      The squad stares at Duffy, who lifts the bag helplessly. We 
      SEE something catch the light inside - a detective SHIELD.

      PAN around the room as the men try to take this in. But as we 
      move, one detective returns hushed to his phone call, another 
      phone rings and another answers, the noise starts to RISE - 
      until we re back to Duffy. He s staring off, balefully, at  -

      - Jane against the far wall. She stares back. Then Duffy 
      abruptly turns and EXITS. As he goes, Jane notices - 

      - Rowe, looking wrecked like Duffy, shuffling into his 
      office. PUSH IN on Jane as she stares at him, then at the 
      room full of grieving detectives - and finally at the 
      catching BOARD, where her name still sits at number one. She 
      squeezes her eyes shut, trying to come to a decision...

      INT. LIEUTENANT ROWE S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      ... and PULL OUT to find her seated across from Rowe.

                                  JANE
                    I know it s hard to talk about it 
                    right now -

                                  ROWE
                          (short)
                    Then why are we, Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Because this is a tragedy. And 
                    letting the ball drop on the case 
                    seems like the only thing that 
                    could make it worse.

                                  ROWE
                    The case that was supposed to be 
                    yours to begin with. Right?                                                                                    28.


                                  JANE
                    I m not denying that s part of it -

                                  ROWE
                    The case you thought Gerry was 
                    working all wrong anyway. The case 
                    you were gonna be taking over when 
                    he got run out of town on a rail. 
                    Isn t that the last thing you said 
                    to him on this earth.

      As Jane s eyes fall on the hospital BRACELET on Rowe s wrist - 

                                  ROWE (CONT D)
                    He was in the chair you re in last 
                    night. Your colleague with one of 
                    the highest closure rates in 
                      department history. My friend whose 
                    baby girl turned four yesterday. 

      Now Rowe notices the bracelet on his arm. He angrily tries to 
      cut it off himself as he swallows the tears that just rose 
      again. It s too hard for Jane to watch. She has to look away.

                                  JANE
                    Given... everything, I obviously 
                    wish I could go back and -

                                  ROWE
                    What kind of woma - What kind of 
                    person are you, that you can come 
                    in here like this today and just -
                    ask for that man s job. 

      Jane looks back at him now. She doesn t speak. 

                                  ROWE (CONT D)
                    I haven t decided. Anything. When I 
                    do I ll let you know. Get out. 

      Rowe looks down at the bracelet, his eyes wet. As Jane heads 
      for the door she KICKS something. She looks down - it s a 
      jelly glass. She picks it up and sets it on a nearby table. 
      Then she lets herself out, pulling the door quietly SHUT...

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - FOYER/KITCHEN - MORNING

      ... and lets herself in at home. Matt is in a tie buttering 
      something with an eye on the TV. He doesn t look at her.

                                  MATT
                    ... What happened.

      Jane leans on the counter. She doesn t look at him either.                                                                                    29.


                                  JANE
                    He died.

                                  MATT
                    Wow... Wasn t that old, was he?

                                  JANE
                    Nope. Coached youth hockey for the 
                    P.A.L... Ran the marathon I think.

      Matt shakes his head. They both look at the TV. Then -

                                  MATT
                    I know this thing with Tricia is my 
                    fault. I should have just gotten a 
                    lawyer right up front and said see 
                    you in court. But of course I had 
                    to try to be the nice guy - So of 
                    course she s jerking us around.
                          (abandons the toast)
                    But we were almost to home plate 
                    with this. And then you decide 
                    you re gonna make a point?

                                  JANE
                    You lie in the beginning it always 
                    comes back to bite you later -

                                  MATT
                    This is my kid. Getting to wake up 
                    with my kid again. You don t care 
                    more about whatever you were trying 
                    to prove than I do about this.

                                  JANE
                    Why didn t you say something before 
                    she came? I could have moved them 
                    and it wouldn t have been an issue -

                                  MATT
                    I should have, all right? And I 
                    should have known Tricia would ask 
                    about them, just given how weird 
                    she is about what you do -

                                  JANE
                    She doesn t know what I do. She 
                    calls me a policewoman -

                                  MATT
                    - To take you down a notch, Jane! 
                    Because she s intimidated! - Just 
                    roll with it! Like I have to roll 
                    with everything!                                                                                     30.


      They both stare at the TV again, miserable. Then -

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Can you find another place for the 
                    guns.

                                  JANE
                          (not bitchy)
                    Of course.

                                  MATT
                    Can you do it tomorrow?

                                  JANE
                    I ll do it now.

                                  MATT
                    Okay. 

      He walks out with the toast. Off Jane, her eyes on the TV...

      INT. PAT TIMONEY S APARTMENT - LATER

      Jane pushes the front door OPEN and humps in several soft 
      long-gun carry bags. As she puts them down, she calls out.

                                  JANE
                    Dad?

      PAT TIMONEY, 65, appears around a corner. He s got a slight 
      brogue and he s chewing (nicotine) GUM. He eyes the gun bags.

                                  PAT
                    That s all of em, all right.

                                  JANE
                    If you don t have enough room -

                                  PAT
                    I do of course.
                          (as they HUG)
                    You were six you had a Chipmunk 
                    bolt action single shot .22. And 
                    look at you now. Does this Tricia 
                    character know about the Chipmunk?

                                  JANE
                          (re: his breath)
                    What flavor is that.

                                  PAT
                    A minty watermelon kind of a thing. 
                    It s absolutely mental.                                                                                    31.


                                  JANE
                    Just stick with the cinnamon, all 
                    right? Don t get fancy. 

                                  PAT
                    The cinnamon has my tongue burnt 
                    off.

                                  JANE
                    It s better than a sharp stick in 
                    the eye though, right?

                                  PAT
                          (mildly)
                    Listen to how you talk to me. I ll 
                    have you know, I m a treasure. 

      Pat heads off with the gun bags. As Jane follows him, shaking 
      her head in almost teenage annoyance...

      INT. PAT TIMONEY S APARTMENT - SPARE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Three GUN SAFES against the wall. Pat unlocks one to show 
      empty slots. As he starts unloading the bags -

                                  PAT
                    How s the detective had the heart 
                    attack? Keating?
                          (Jane shakes her head)
                    Jesus. Kids?

                                  JANE
                    Two. Boy and a four year old girl.

                                  PAT
                    We ll do a whip-round down the bar. 
                    Should be good for a few hundred - 

                                  JANE
                    I asked for his job this morning. 

                                  PAT
                    You get it?

                                  JANE
                    I didn t not get it. But, I did 
                    make an enemy for life out of my 
                    boss. So that oughta keep me sharp.

                                  PAT
                    What s your source of information 
                    on that? Is it you?

      Jane s voice betrays real doubt for the first time.                                                                                    32.


                                  JANE
                    I just thought I had to ask now. 
                    While they were distracted, before 
                    they could - regroup. I thought 
                    that was my only chance, but maybe 
                    it wasn t. Maybe I should have 
                    waited. Or - just not asked at all.   
                          (then)
                    Or maybe Tom Sheridan s just gonna 
                    follow me forever. It s already 
                    followed me ten times longer than 
                    the damn thing even lasted anyway.

                                  PAT
                    ... You can t unmake a mistake, 
                    Janie. Specially not one like that 
                    one. All you can do is atone. You 
                    had the high water - Now you ve got 
                    the hell. 

      Pat closes the door of the safe and locks it, then turns.

                                  PAT (CONT D)
                    Now. Let s go have a pint or four 
                    and talk about how much we miss 
                    smoking. 

      INT. LIEUTENANT ROWE S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Duffy and Rowe. Only two cartoon character jelly glasses now. 

                                  DUFFY
                    Ger and Nate and I were going

                    should I try to still take him 
                    myself, or should I go walk off a

                          (as Duffy looks at him)
                    I m giving it to Jane. 

      Duffy s eyes go WIDE. First surprise, then rage.

                                  DUFFY
                    Okay, forget it not being me for a 
                    second - I mean, I m not gonna beg - 

                                  ROWE
                    Reg -                                                                                    33.


                                  DUFFY
                    Someone with a shot at carrying his 
                    jock! Mooney, he could do it, or 
                    what about Williams in Midtown -

                                  ROWE
                    It s the right thing. Maybe she ll 
                    screw it up. But until she does, 
                    unless she does, it s her. I m 
                    sorry... Have another pop.

      Rowe holds up the bottle. Duffy stares at it, then him.

                                  DUFFY
                    Now who s an empty suit.

      Duffy gets up and EXITS. Rowe is still holding the bottle 
      aloft. As he lowers it to the desk and stares into space...

      INT. PAT TIMONEY S APARTMENT - FOYER - NIGHT

      ... we re down the dim cluttered hall, looking toward the 
      door. Pat and Jane stand putting scarfs and gloves on. 

                                  JANE
                    Dad, the point is we thought you 
                    had cancer. That you were dying. 
                    The point is, to remember how it 
                    felt to feel that and do something 
                    so it doesn t happen for real! -

                                  PAT
                    I m only saying what if your Dr 
                    Geller trots out that same x-ray 
                    with the  shadowy mass  for all his 
                    patients have got a bad habit. 
                    Would you put that past him and his 
                    beady little eyes? -

                                  JANE
                    Stop looking for excuses to smoke!

      Jane stops dead, her face tense. As Pat turns to look at her -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I only quit because you asked me, 
                    Dad. I m not doing it alone. So if 
                    you flake out on me, I m not 
                    kidding - I m gonna frame you for 
                      something.

      Jane s phone suddenly RINGS. She answers - then she grins. As 
      she PUNCHES the air in triumph...                                                                                    34.


                                      ACT THREE

      INT. SQUADROOM - DAY

      Jane stands in front of a room of silent detectives.

                                  JANE
                    He was a good detective, a husband 
                    and a father. It s a tragedy, and 
                    I m very sorry for everyone s loss.
                          (silence)
                    I hope we can all agree, that the 
                    best way to honor his memory is to 
                    work this case til it goes down.
                          (beat, then)
                    So Detective Duffy, if you would - 
                    Tell me where we are right now.

      Duffy is sitting in front on a desk. He gets up slowly, 
      WINKING at Blando and whoever else is in the vicinity.

                                  DUFFY
                    Whelp, no security cameras, Phil s 
                    on deliveries, no repairs done or 
                      scheduled, the husband s timeline 
                    checked out. We interviewed the 
                    household staff - handyman, nanny, 
                      candlestick maker. Korilko s on 
                    phone records, no surprises there. 
                    Autopsy showed rape and semen.
                          (pointed)
                    We re waiting for DNA to tell us 
                     whose  semen. 

                                  JANE
                    But you think it s Curtis Hull.

                                  DUFFY
                    Well, I don t claim to know what 
                    mysteries the universe holds.
                          (gestures to Blando)
                    But this guy does. Augie? 

                                  BLANDO
                    Mr. Hull s timeline does not check 
                    out. It is rife with 
                      inconsistencies. I repeat, rife.

                                  DUFFY
                    So anyway, if you want to dive in - 
                    I assume you do. Want to dive in.

                                  JANE
                    I do want to.                                                                                    35.


                                  DUFFY
                    Well, the housekeeper s been laid 
                    up at home for a week - bone spur 
                    surgery. So no one s talked to her 
                    yet. She s a loose end, for sure.
                            (innocently)
                    She s out in the Bronx. Up by 
                    Fordham. Want someone to drive 
                    you?... Phil is free.

      Carter looks up, barely concealing his dismay, as Jane exits. 
      As Carter follows her, glaring daggers at a grinning Duffy...

      EXT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - LATER

      The sedan is at the curb. Jane is heading for the front 
      steps, Carter behind her, trying to conceal his frustration.

                                  CARTER
                    Why didn t you just say to Reg you 
                    wanted to see the crime scene?.. 
                    What m I supposed to tell him about 
                    the housekeeper?

                                  JANE
                    Tell him she s a loose end.

                                  CARTER
                    ... Right. How long we gonna be.

                                  JANE
                    Don t know.

                                  CARTER
                    Well - You just want to look the 
                    place over, or what are we doing?

      Jane RINGS the doorbell. She looks at Carter.

                                  JANE
                          (mild)
                    Were you there when Keating talked 
                    to the kids the first time?

                                  CARTER
                    You re gonna try to interview the 
                    kids now? -

                                  JANE
                    You were. It was Keating, and you 
                    and the kids.
                          (as he shrugs yes)
                    But not a child psychologist. 
                    Right?
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    36.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (off his face)
                    There s no psych report in the 
                    file. Did he even call one? 
                          (off his face)
                    No. Did you? No. Right? 
                          (off his face)
                    So whatever they d ve told you, 
                    it d be open to saying it was 
                    coerced -

                                  CARTER
                    - Didn t end up mattering. They 
                    said they didn t know anything. 
                    They said they never saw the guy.

                                  JANE
                    And you were satisfied with that.

                                  CARTER
                          (bravado)
                    Yeah. We were. 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah - Somebody needed not to be.

      As Carter stares at Jane - the townhouse door suddenly OPENS 
      to REVEAL the nanny, GISELE CLARKE. As she stares at Jane, 
      then at Carter, recognizing him, Jane holds up her BADGE.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hello, I m Detective Timoney, I m 
                    the new detective in charge of the 
                    case. Can we come inside, please.

                                  GISELE
                          (worried)
                    Okay. But - I have to call Dr. 
                    Edgerton. You need to talk to him.

                                  JANE
                    I agree a hundred percent.

      As Gisele disappears from the door, Carter s CELL starts to 
      RING. Jane doesn t look at him. She holds a card out to him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    When you re done call this guy. Dr. 
                    Kevin Hynes. Tell him we re here, 
                    and he should come now... And tell 
                    Duffy I said hi. 

      Jane goes inside. As Carter slowly answers his phone...                                                                                    37.


      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The CEILING LIGHT comes on with a snap. The air is still. A 
      large part of the bloody CARPET has been removed, exposing 
        floorboards. In various places around the room we can see 
      abandoned BLUE LATEX GLOVES, indicating the room has not been 
      cleaned or perhaps even entered since the crime scene techs 
      were finished. The curtains are CLOSED.

      REVEAL Jane in the doorway, her hand on the light switch. She 
      looks around the room, then crosses and opens the doors to 
      the CLOSET. She steps inside, then pulls the chain to the 
      overhead light and CLOSES the doors after her.

      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSET/BEDROOM - 
      CONTINUOUS

      Jane looks around. It s almost walk-in size. Dustmotes float 
      in the air. Some clothes lie puddled below their hangers. A 
      handful of Uno cards rest near her foot, along with one high-
      heeled shoe. She reaches up and PULLS the chain to the 
      overhead light again, switching it off and plunging the 
      closet into darkness... 

      ... except for the thick STRIPE of LIGHT at the bottom of the 
      closed doors.

                                  CARTER (O.S.)
                      Detective? You in here?

      Jane looks down at the stripe -

                                  CARTER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                      Timoney?... Jane? 

      - then SHOVES the doors open. REVEAL Carter, who almost 
      conceals his startled jump. 

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                    - Dr. Hynes just showed up.

      Jane doesn t reply. As she exits past Carter... 

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    You didn t see who hurt your mom.

      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - CHILD S BEDROOM - DAY

      ... we re on an eight-year-old BOY (CALEB) and a six-year-old 
      GIRL (PAULINA) drawing at a table. PULL BACK to REVEAL Jane 
      with them, watched by Carter, Gisele and DR. KEVIN HYNES. 
      Neither Caleb or Paulina look up from their drawing.                                                                                    38.


                                  JANE
                    That s what you told the other 
                      detectives, Caleb. Is that still 
                    right?

      Paulina suddenly looks up, then holds her hand out. Gisele 
      gets up and hands her - a BABY BOTTLE with a nipple, full of 
      MILK. Paulina grabs it and begins sucking greedily. It s a 
      jarring sight. Caleb keeps drawing.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Because I just wondered if maybe 
                    you might have thought about it, 
                    and remembered you did see him a 
                    little bit. 
                          (then)
                    I was looking at the closet, before 
                    we started talking?... I was 
                    noticing how the carpet s kind of 
                    worn down in front, and how the 
                    door doesn t really go all the way 
                    to the floor. You can see under 
                    that door. You can see a lot.

      Caleb reaches for another marker. Jane watches him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I think you looked under the door, 
                    Caleb. 

      Nothing. The pen SCRATCHES on the page. Jane leans in and 
      looks at the picture, then at some of the others. They re 
      pretty decent drawings of GUNS. Jane raises an eyebrow.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    These are good. I can pretty much 
                    tell exactly what they are.
                          (nothing)
                      Seriously. You re good at drawing. 
                          (points)
                    That s a sniper rifle. Right?
                          (points)
                    And, that s a revolver.. 

      Caleb flicks his eyes over at her, then back to his work.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (points)
                    And that s a shotgun. Looks like a 
                    12 gauge. I got one looks just like 
                    that. A Remington 870 Wingmaster.

      Caleb looks at her again.                                                                                    39.


                                  JANE (CONT D)
                            (conversationally)
                    I used to have a Mossberg but I had 
                    a lot of problems with it. Plus, 
                    the Remington racks a lot louder 
                    than the Mossberg did.

      Caleb is still looking at her. Jane matter-of-factly imitates 
      the racking sound and action.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Cch-cch. Right? You want that as 
                    loud and scary as you can get.

                                  CALEB
                    ... You don t have those. 

                                  JANE
                    Those what. The guns? Sure I do. 

                                  CALEB
                    You re a girl.

                                  JANE
                            (matter-of-factly)
                    Yeah? 

      Jane reaches into her jacket, UNSNAPS her holster and 
      produces - her SIG SAUER P226. She presses the release and 
      removes the magazine, then puts it on the table. She racks 
      the slide and looks inside to make sure the chamber is empty. 
      Then she thumbs the de-cocking lever and PLACES the gun on 
      the table between her and Caleb. THUNK. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    There s one. 
                          (then)
                    Pick it up if you want. 

      We SEE Dr. Hynes tense. Jane glances at him in warning. Caleb 
      reaches out tentatively and first taps the gun with one 
      finger, then puts his hand on it without lifting it. As Jane 
      watches him...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Why re you drawing guns, Caleb.
                          (no answer)
                    You don t want to say, huh. You 
                    think you ll get in trouble?... So 
                    can I guess?
                          (no answer)
                    ... I think you re drawing them 
                    cause you re thinking about using 
                    them.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (no answer)
                    Everybody wants to protect you, 
                    from this awful thing. But you 
                    don t want to be protected. Right? 
                    You re angry. You want to be angry. 
                          (then)
                    You re not gonna get in trouble for 
                    that... Not with me. 

      Caleb puts the gun on the table. He glances at Jane, then 
      away, then back. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Let s shake on it. You want to?

      Beat. Then suddenly, Caleb shakes her hand -

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSET - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

      - and we re in the darkened closet. The STRIPE of LIGHT glows 
      at the bottom of the closed doors. PULL BACK to REVEAL Jane 
      and Caleb kneeling inside, pressing the sides of their faces 
      to the carpet at the bottom of the doors.

                                  CALEB (V.O.)
                    He had black hair. He was the size 
                    of Mom. He said he would stab our 
                    eyes out. Mine and Paulina s first. 
                    I thought I saw him near my Nana s 
                    house yesterday but I didn t.

      Jane and Caleb straighten back up. Jane pats Caleb s back for 
      a moment. Then as she reaches up and TURNS on the LIGHT -

                                  CALEB (V.O.)
                    Mom was yelling. She was hitting 
                    him. So he didn t. Then he left. 

      INT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - CHILD S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

      - Caleb pulls some of the drawings closer. He and Jane look 
      down at them together. 

                                  CALEB
                    ... I would kill him with these.

                                  JANE
                    I would help you. 

      Off Jane...                                                                                    41.


      EXT. EASTSIDE TOWNHOUSE - LATER

      On Jane as she stands alone in silence on the pavement. She 
      sniffs, then turns to see the DOORMAN of a nearby building 
      cupping a lighter to a CIGARETTE. As she shakes her head, 
      denying a thought, Carter approaches. Beat. Then -

                                  CARTER
                    All right, so, we were wrong. You 
                    found the angle, and you worked the 
                    kid. Good job -

                                  JANE
                    Let s go. 

      Carter stares at her. Then, as he unlocks the car -

                                  CARTER
                            (conversationally)
                    Hey, you ever worry someone s gonna 
                    drop a house on you?

                                  JANE
                    This car s not gonna drive itself. 

      As Jane gets in the car and SLAMS the door -

      INT. BOROUGH HQ - OFFICE - AFTERNOON

      - we re on Evrard and Jane. Carter stands crabbily nearby.

                                  EVRARD
                    So you think your killer and the 
                    Madison Ave rapist are one guy. And
                    SVU doesn t.

                                  JANE
                    No, they don t. So if I could see 
                    their OCC reports, I might learn 
                    something they won t tell me.   

                                  EVRARD
                    Yeeeah, SVU s not gonna show you 
                    their unusual occurrence reports. 

                                  JANE
                    No, they re not. 

                                  EVRARD
                            (innocently)
                    You know they send copies of em 
                    here, though. To the Chief of D s?                                                                                    42.


                                  JANE
                    Yes, I do.

      Evrard nods. He raises his arm.

                                  EVRARD
                    Look, Janie. Cast is gone. I m 
                    almost off the bench. 

                                  JANE
                    That s great, Ev.

                                  EVRARD
                    Yeah, I d think about keeping it in 
                    mind... While you re reading these.

      As Evrard pulls open a file cabinet -

      INT. SQUADROOM - AFTERNOON

      The task force detectives are bullshitting with Duffy as the 
      door opens to admit Jane and Carter. Duffy rolls his eyes at 
      Carter - who surprises him by ignoring him. Beat, then -

                                  DUFFY
                          (sly)
                    You talk to the housekeeper?

      Jane doesn t answer right away. She was crossing to Rowe s 
      office door - now she KNOCKS. As Rowe opens the door and 
      steps out, looking puzzled, Jane turns back to Duffy.

                                  JANE
                    I talked to the Edgerton kids. The 
                      appeal-proof way this time.

      Duffy stares at her. Jane addresses the room. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    They described the man who murdered 
                    their mother as a young male, with 
                    dark hair and a slight accent. And 
                    as not being Curtis Hull.
                          (silence)
                    I also happened to learn today, 
                    that the Madison Avenue rapist 
                    stabbed several of his victims in 
                    or near their eyes. The same way I 
                    now know he threatened to do to our 
                    murder victim, and her children.
                          (silence)
                    So Reg, let SVU know these cases 
                    are linked. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    43.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    And that they don t have to call 
                    the serologist and ask to have the 
                    DNA matched, because I already did 
                    that. Which was a complete 
                      formality, because I know they re 
                    the same guy. 
                          (silence)
                    As of now, Curtis Hull is off the 
                    table. As of now, our prime suspect 
                    is a guy we haven t met. A guy who 
                    lives in the neighborhood, or works 
                    there, or both. A guy who s part of 
                    the scenery, until suddenly he 
                    isn t. 

      As Jane looks around the room, meeting everyone s eyes -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    We re going back to square one. 
                    Starting over til we find him. So 
                    everybody get on board right now - 
                    Because this is happening.

      BLACK.                                                                                    44.


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. MANHATTAN NORTH HOMICIDE - SQUADROOM - DAY

      Jane, Duffy, Korilko, Blando and Carter face SVU Detective 
      Louie Moore and a couple of his COHORTS, including DETECTIVE 
      JOE HILLER. No one looks happy.

                                  MOORE
                    I m happy for you, okay? What do 
                    you want from me?

                                  JANE
                    I just want a couple of your vics 
                    to look at it. What s the problem?
                          (Moore s shaking his head)
                    It s a great sketch, okay? It came 
                    out even better than we coulda 
                    hoped, considering the witness is a 
                    kid - 

                                  MOORE
                          (exasperated)
                    Look - We handed over what we have. 
                    We cried and hugged and shared with 
                    you. But we re not getting our vics 
                    all confused by showing em your 
                    goddamn sketch, and are we done 
                    here, or what!

                                  JANE
                    What happens when the DNA comes in 
                    and shows it s all the same guy?

                                  MOORE
                    Maybe it will, and maybe it won t. 
                    Til then every squad for themself.
                          (stands up)
                    All I know is, after months of 
                      round-the-clock on some seriously 
                    brutal rapes? Excuse me if I don t 
                    want to wake up and see headlines 
                    saying  East Side Killer Nabbed. 

      As Moore and his guys start to head for the door -

                                  JANE
                    If headlines re all it s about - I 
                    got that press conference tonight. 
                    You show your vics our sketch, you 
                    can piggyback on the press with me. 

      Moore pretends to mull this over for a beat, then -                                                                                    45.


                                  MOORE
                    Here s the Chief of Ds announcing a 
                    task force run by a lady DT on a 
                    rich white people murder - What re 
                    the odds my fat ass is gonna get to 
                    the mikes to talk about some Latina 
                    girls aren t even dead? 
                          (as Jane stares at him)
                    Pull the other one, okay, it s got 
                    bells on it.

      Moore heads off, rolling his eyes. The SVUs follow - except 
      for Hiller, who stays to grin at Korilko. 

                                  HILLER
                    You re gonna get killed tonight, 
                    buddy. I got five hundy on Perez 
                    knocking you down the first round.

                                    KORILKO
                    You got me knocking you down in the 
                    parking lot after though, right?

      Hiller winks as he exits. When he s gone, Jane looks around.

                                  JANE
                    It s fine. We don t need them. This 
                    guy lives on the East Side or works 
                    there. Tomorrow let s concentrate 
                    on works. All deliverymen in the 
                    radius need a recheck. Take-out, 
                    grocery, dry-cleaning, all of em. 
                    Also painting, gutters, remodels, 
                    going back to when the rape pattern 
                    was identified. Thanks everybody.

      As the meeting breaks up, Duffy raises his voice.

                                  DUFFY
                    We may be in the middle of a big 
                    case and everything but - Anyone I 
                    don t see at the smoker tonight 
                    better not come to work tomorrow.

      Korilko is hoisting a gym bag. Blando fistbumps him.

                                  BLANDO
                    Eat lightning crap thunder, Donnie. 

                                  CARTER
                    Kill Perez tonight... Seriously, 
                    kill him. We ll be your alibi.  

      Korilko chuckles. The others move away as Jane approaches.                                                                                    46.


                                  JANE
                    Luck tonight, Don.

                                    KORILKO
                          (nods, then, suddenly)
                    You too. 

                                  JANE
                          (surprised)
                    Thanks.

                                    KORILKO
                    Well. Thanks for the Moss thing. 
                          (as Jane blinks)
                    You gonna make it tonight?

                                  JANE
                    ... Yeah. Yeah, I ll be there - I m 
                    just might be a little late.

      As Jane speaks, PRELAP Rat-Packy MUSIC that takes us to -

      INT. HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM - MAIN AREA - NIGHT

      - where a BOXING RING is set up in the middle of the venue. 
      The rest is linen-draped tables. The giant BANNER across one

      soliciting donations from the rowdy blacktie crowd, CUT TO -

      - where Korilko trades punches with PEREZ, a detective from 
      Robbery. We FIND Carter, Rowe and Blando in tuxedos at 
      ringside. As they cheer themselves hoarse, CUT TO -

      INT. SQUAD - MEETING ROOM C - NIGHT

      - silence for Chief of Ds Bondlow, at a podium with a cluster 
      of MIKES over Detective Bureau signage. Behind him is the 
      Deputy Chief of Public Information and Jane. She looks purty. 

                                    BONDLOW
                    ... in the interest of working 
                    every available angle of the case. 
                    That task force will now be led by 
                    Detective Jane Timoney, so at this 
                    time I ll turn things over to her.

      Bondlow steps aside, glancing at Jane, who now steps up -

                    Slim build and young, slight 
                    accent, carries a folding knife.

      Jane holds up the SKETCH. As the room reacts, CUT TO -

                                  JANE
                    Yes, it does. 

      Duffy POUNDS the bar angrily several times. As the bartender 
      looks over, annoyed, Duffy raises his empty glass.

                                  DUFFY
                    Fresh horses. 

      As Duffy eyes the TV with drunken malice, a CHEER goes up -

      INT. HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM - BOXING RING - (MINUTES) LATER

      - as Korilko KNOCKS Perez to the canvas. The count starts but 
      we can see Perez is staying down, dazed. As Korilko raises 
      his gloves, we FIND Jane, clapping as she edges through the 
      crowd. ANGLE on Rowe, Blando and Carter, ties undone and 
      feeling no pain, as Jane approaches.

                                  BLANDO
                    I kind of thought Perez was gonna 
                    give Don a harder time than that.

                                  CARTER
                    I ll make sure to tell them both 
                    you said so.                                                                                    48.

                    How d it go.

                                  JANE
                    I d like to buy everyone a round.

                                  BLANDO
                          (flutters his eyelashes)
                    Oh, Detective Timoney!

      As Jane smirks and turns to lead them to -

      INT. HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM - BAR AREA - CONTINUOUS

      - we FIND Duffy still on his stool. He looks at his shoulder 
      balefully as a HAND descends on it, then looks up to see 
      Rowe. Jane and the others are ordering drinks down the bar.

                                  ROWE
                    You been in here this whole time? 
                    Did you even watch? 

                                  DUFFY
                      I watched. 

                                  ROWE
                    What a turnout. I hope Gerry knows 
                    how many people showed up.

      Duffy looks away. Then suddenly he STANDS UP. 

                                  DUFFY
                    Don t you take her money, Ballard. 
                    Tell that bitch it s no good here.

                                  ROWE
                    Reg, what the hell -

                                  DUFFY
                    You want drinks, I ll buy drinks. 
                    She wants to work homicide, let her 
                    go back to Midtown. Or she could 
                    try waving her ass at the 
                      Commissioner this time - maybe 
                    she ll get a transfer to Scotland 
                    Yard. 

      Duffy sweeps his arm to indicate Jane, who stands silent. As 
      the other detectives look at each other, abashed -                                                                                    49.


                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Acting like it s coming to you. 
                    Walking all over the memory of a 
                    great man. Gerry Keating s heart 
                    exploding was the best thing that 
                    ever happened to you, and we all 
                    know it. So stop expecting his guys 
                    to give you respect. I wouldn t 
                    give you the sweat off my stones. 

      Duffy exits, along with Carter, Blando and Korilko, the 
      latter two too uncomfortable to meet Jane s eyes. Rowe 
      follows, giving her a apologetic look. Off Jane as she 
      finally blinks...

      INT. JANE S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

      Matt is asleep on his stomach, light from the hallway falling 
      on his face. Jane KNEELS into frame at the bedside, still 
      dressed, and gazes at him. She might be a little drunk.

                                  JANE
                    Matt. Matt.

      Matt blinks, foggy. He clears his throat.

                                  MATT
                    Yeah. 

                                  JANE
                    I know you re still mad. You can be 
                    mad again tomorrow... But can you 
                    talk to me now? Just for a minute. 

      Beat. Then Matt simply reaches out and gathers Jane from the 
      floor into the bed in one smooth motion. As the covers settle 
      back over them both...

      INT. HALLWAY/SQUADROOM - DAY (DAY FIVE)

      Jane makes her way through the shift-change crowd. She hangs 
      up her coat, then roots through her bag and comes up with an 
      EMPTY PACK of nicotine gum, then another. She stares at them - 
      as a random DETECTIVE passes, packing a box of CIGARETTES. He 
      sees Jane staring and reacts sheepishly.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Yeah, I know. I should quit. 
                      Definitely. I just figure I can 
                    still run after the bad guys, so.                                                                                    50.


                                  JANE
                    Hey, far be it from me to criticize 
                    anything that helps another cop get 
                    through the day. Within reason. 

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Wish more people were like you.

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, no you don t.

      Jane glances at her watch, then crosses to her desk. As she 
      does, she s intercepted by a sheepish squirming Duffy. 

                                  DUFFY
                    Look, I know I said some things, 
                    last night. And I m sorry. If I had 
                    a problem I should have come to 
                    you. Not gone off the reservation. 
                    I ve just - had a lot on my mind, 
                    since... Then you add liquor, and - 

                                  JANE
                    Okay.

                                  DUFFY
                    ... Okay? Okay, well - Good. 

      Jane suddenly SMILES at something over his shoulder. Duffy 
      turns to see - Evrard entering the squad with Chief Bondlow, 
      who walks him over to a smiling Rowe. 

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Who s that supposed to be.

      He turns back to Jane - who is already past him and heading 
      over to Evrard. The two of them shake hands and smile at 
      Bondlow and Rowe. Off Duffy as he realizes what s happening -

      - ANGLE on Jane and Evrard as Bondlow looks at Rowe.

                                    BONDLOW
                    What happened to the Hemingway 
                    quote used to hang by the copier?

                                  ROWE
                    Nuzzi broke the glass with a Nerf 
                    bazooka. Gotta take it to the 
                    framers.

                                    BONDLOW
                    Give it, I ll have somebody take 
                    it. You gotta get that back up.
                          (to Jane)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    51.

                                    BONDLOW (CONT'D)
                    Some more guys coming to help you 
                    follow up the Crimestoppers stuff. 

                                  JANE
                    Thank you, sir.

                                    BONDLOW
                          (heading off)
                    Ev gives you trouble, lemme know. 
                    I ll shoot him myself this time. 
                          (theatrically)
                     Once you have hunted man, there is 
                    no other prey. 

      Bondlow and Rowe head off. As Jane leads Evrard to a desk -

                                  JANE
                    Who s that retired DT you re 
                    buddies with, does PI work now.

                                  EVRARD
                    Sheehan?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, you got his number?

      As Evrard reaches for his phone, presses a few buttons and 
      hands it over to Jane so she can write down the number -

                                  EVRARD
                    What you want him for. You gonna 
                    private investigate somebody?
                          (looks off)
                    Is it the guy with the face like a 
                    smacked ass?

                                  JANE
                    Duffy? No.

                                  EVRARD
                    That s Reg Duffy? Huh. Only ever 
                    heard about the guy all these 
                    years. I always pictured him more 
                    having, like, fangs.
                          (still looking)
                    That guy hates you.

                                  JANE
                    How about you. You hate me?

                                  EVRARD
                    You kidding? I m your huckleberry.                                                                                    52.


                                  JANE
                    Good. Go get me some coffee.

      Evrard snorts and heads off. Jane heads for her own desk, 
      where a stack of folders is waiting for her - DD5s and 
      transcripts of Crimestoppers calls. PUSH IN on her as she 
      sits down, looking at her phone, then dials the number...

      INT. SQUADROOM - NIGHT

      ... and PULL OUT as Jane switches on her desk lamp. The file 
      folder stack is much smaller. Around her are Evrard, Duffy 
      and the other detectives, working their own stacks of tips 
      and DD5s off caffeine and adrenaline. Korilko enters.

                                    KORILKO
                    Coffee s on again.

      As Jane pushes back her chair, frustrated -

                                  BLANDO
                    Maybe we should try looking inside 
                    the rocker panels. You think?

                                  EVRARD
                    Maybe we should weigh the other 
                    boroughs and see if any of em 
                    gained a hundred sixty pounds since 
                    last night -

                                  JANE
                    Maybe we should save the French 
                      Connection references for a time 
                    we re not totally up our own asses 
                    and right now try focusing. Huh?

      Rowe comes out of his office.

                                  ROWE
                    What say we call it a night. Even 
                    though it s technically a morning. 
                    Everybody go rack out.

      The other detectives immediately get up.

                                  JANE
                    I will, I m just gonna -

                                  ROWE
                    No, Jane. Last call. You don t have 
                    to go home, but you can stay here.

      Rowe heads back into his office. As Jane slowly gets up, her 
      CELL RINGS.                                                                                     53.


                                  JANE
                    Timoney.
                          (then)
                    Detective Sheehan - thanks for 
                    getting back to me so quick.
                          (listens, then)
                    You know what, if being an asshole 
                    was touchdowns Ev would be drinking 
                    beer out of the Lombardi Trophy.
                          (smiles, then)
                    I m just looking to run a couple 
                    names without running em, if you 
                    catch my -

      Rowe comes out of his office and gives her an annoyed look.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    This isn t work... I m going. Okay? 

      Rowe keeps looking. As Jane hurries off, CUT TO -

      INT. SQUAD - MEN S  DORMITORY  - A LITTLE LATER

      The room is chaos, clothes and cans. The fridge stands open, 
      full of old takeout. Carter and Duffy lie on a bunk bed in 
      undershirts and suit pants. Evrard stands watching TV, a 
      toothbrush in his mouth. There s a KNOCK. Evrard opens the 
      door to reveal Jane, a pile of folders under her arm. 

                                  EVRARD
                    As a matter of fact we won t keep 
                    it down.

                                  JANE
                    I was just seeing if you guys had 
                    anything to drink.

                                  CARTER
                    We got lemons and limes and mayo. 
                    You could make a smoothie.

      Now Blando appears, wearing underpants and a kimono. Jane 
      stares at him, taken aback, as Korilko enters behind her with 
      a black bodega sack of beer.

                                  DUFFY
                          (re: Blando)
                    The cheese stands alone.

                                  JANE
                    ... Good thing I m off the clock, 
                    Augie. Because that is a felonious 
                    pair of ball-huggers you got on.                                                                                     54.


      The other detectives LAUGH, even Carter and Duffy. As Korilko 
      offers out a couple of tallboys to Jane, who takes them as 
      she exits -

                                  BLANDO
                    You sure you don t wanna hang here, 
                    Skip? This is where it all happens.

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, that s what I m afraid of. 

      The dorm door CLOSES behind her -

      INT. SQUAD - WOMEN S  DORMITORY  - CONTINUOUS 

      - and a fridge door OPENS to reveal clean shelves. Jane puts 
      one beer in, then cracks the other one as she turns. Oriental 
      rug. Area lamps. Quiet and deserted. Jane takes a swig of 
      beer. She slips off her shoes, turns off the fluorescents. 
      She piles her folders on a bunk, switches on the closest 
      lamp, then lies down on the bunk and dials her cell.

                                  JANE
                    Hey, we re going straight through 
                    next shift. I m sorry. 

                                  MATT (V.O.)
                    How you holding up?

                                  JANE
                    Our guy s just still in the wind, 
                    and we really need him not to be.

                                  MATT (V.O.)
                    You should come home and grab a 
                    couple hours sleep. We don t live 
                    so far you couldn t get back if 
                    they needed you.

      Jane stares at the empty quiet room.

                                  JANE
                    I would. But it s just too crazy 
                    here right now.

                                  MATT (V.O.)
                    All right, well. I hope you find 
                    your guy soon so you can come home. 

                                  JANE
                    Me too. Thanks. Love you.

      Jane hangs up. She closes her eyes. A MOMENT of indeterminate 
      length passes - then is BROKEN by her cell RINGING again.                                                                                    55.


                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Yeah.

                                    MORESCO (V.O.)
                      Detective? It s, ah - Am I still 
                    your deputy since you came and got 
                    that Moss guy?

                                  JANE
                          (wary)
                    ... You re in for life, Mr. 
                    Moresco. No going back now.

                                    MORESCO (V.O.)
                    Okay, cool - So they had you on the 
                    TV before? Your press conference, 
                    with the drawing?

      Jane sits up, her folders sliding to the floor. 

                                  JANE
                    You recognize it?

                                    MORESCO (V.O.)
                    Not me - One of the guys here says 
                    he thinks he dated your guy s mom.

                                  JANE
                    Can you keep him there? 

      As Jane crams her feet into her shoes and rushes out -

                                    MORESCO (V.O.)
                    I got him a pizza... I get money 
                    back for that?

                                  JANE
                    From the Mayor himself and I m 
                    bringing it to you right now.

      - SMASH CUT TO -

      EXT. QUEENS STREET - NIGHT

      - a war zone. Unmarked sedans parked everywhere there aren t 
      QUEENS EMERGENCY SERVICES TRUCKS. The EMS guys (think SWAT) 
      are strapped up with heavy vests. They ve set up in the front 
      and back of 2299 Ditmars Boulevard. As one EMS guy SMACKS 
      another on the helmet with adrenalined enthusiasm and the 
      entire phalanx erupts with similar gestures -

      - PULL BACK to find Jane, Evrard and Rowe, crouched behind 
      their car across the street. Duffy, Korilko and the others 
      are fanned out nearby. Jane is eyeing the EMS guys.                                                                                     56.


                                  JANE
                    ... Those Queens guys don t blink a 
                    whole lot. You ever notice that?

      Evrard and Rowe chuckle. Rowe keys the radio.  

                                  ROWE
                    Homicide CO to CO Queens 
                      Emergency... All units in position?

      A pump-action SHOTGUN RACKS somewhere in the darkness as an 
      answer, followed by another further off. The radio crackles. 

                                  RADIO (V.O.)
                      Affirmative Homicide - all ESU 
                    personnel in place standing by.

                                  JANE
                    Make the call, Ev. 

      Evrard dials a cell phone. Someone picks up.

                                  EVRARD
                          (in subtitled Spanish)
                    Evening ma am this is Detective 
                    Evrard Velario NYPD. Is this Idalis 
                    Ayala?
                    Nothing s wrong. We just need to 
                    speak to your son Victor. 
                    We just need to. Is he home?
                    It s not about him doing anything.
                    We re not looking to hurt anyone. I 
                    would not lie to you on that. 

                                  JANE
                    What s happening.

                                  EVRARD
                          (hand over mouthpiece)
                    Mama s giving me some grief. 
                          (subtitled Spanish)
                    We don t want to come in. Please 
                    just tell him come out? 
                    We ll explain everything then. 
                    Yep, we re all here, waiting out 
                    front. You can t miss us. 
                          (hand over mouthpiece)
                    She says he s coming out. 

                                  ROWE
                          (on radio)
                    Tell everybody stand by, he s 
                    coming out.                                                                                     57.


      A tense long beat. Nothing. Another one. Nothing. Jane stares 
      at the front door of the building, which remains closed. 

                                  JANE
                    Ask her where he is. 

                                  EVRARD
                          (subtitled Spanish)
                    We re waiting. What s the hold up.
                    Listen, don t jerk me around, okay? 
                    I said we need him out here now. 
                          (to Jane)
                    She says he came out. She says he s 
                    standing right in front waiting.

      Jane stares back, suddenly filled with horror. Beat. Then -

                                  JANE
                    ... Ask her what their address is.

      Evrard holds Jane s gaze as -

                                  EVRARD
                          (subtitled Spanish)
                    Ma am, what s your address? Your 
                    street number address.
                          (to Jane - shit)
                    2929. 2929 Ditmars. Seven blocks 
                    away, maybe six -

      Jane KICKS the side of the sedan, enraged - then leaps to her 
      feet, as does Evrard. Rowe scrambles to follow.

                                  ROWE
                    What s going on?

      Jane is already getting behind the wheel, Evrard next to her.

                                  JANE
                    Somebody misread the directory -

                                  ROWE
                          (into radio)
                    Guys - Stand down. Wrong house. 
                    We re moving. Correct address is -

                                  EVRARD
                    - 2929 -

                                  ROWE
                    2929 Ditmars. Repeat, stand down. 
                    Wrong house. Actual address 2929.                                                                                    58.


      The radio and every walkie immediately ERUPT with responders 
      screaming for information. But there s no time to remobilize. 
      OFF the car as Jane takes off with squealing tires -

      EXT. QUEENS STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      - in time to see a young dark-haired Hispanic MAN sprinting 
      down the sidewalk into the darkness. It s VICTOR AYALA.

                                  EVRARD
                    You got him? You see him?

                                  JANE
                    Yeah - Does he see us?

      She BRAKES and HORNS as a CAR tries to pull out ahead -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch! 

      - and as Jane hits the gas again, we SEE Ayala suddenly dart 
      across the traffic up ahead, heading for the concrete island 
      that runs down the boulevard. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Keep your eyes on him -

                                  EVRARD
                    ... He s on the island - He s gonna 
                    try for the other side -

      Jane lays on the horn as she tries to get into the leftmost 
      lane next to the island -

                                  EVRARD (CONT D)
                    He s going for it - 

                                  JANE
                    Please God, someone wing him -

                                  EVRARD
                    He s over. He made it. 

      Jane immediately CUTS the wheel. The sedan leaves the left 
      lane and goes UP on the island, almost fishtailing amid the 
      sound of screeching metal. Evrard hangs on, his face set.

      Jane, laying frantically on the HORN, finds an opening in the 
      opposite traffic and takes the car at speed down off the 
      island into the lane - at which point a front TIRE and the 
      right rear TIRE both EXPLODE.                                                                                    59.


      On the far sidewalk, a still running Ayala looks over his 
      shoulder at the derailed sedan grounded in the middle of 
      traffic. It doesn t stop him even for a second. OFF Jane 
      through the windshield, pounding the steering wheel -

      - then suddenly EXPLODING out of the car, the driver s door 
      ramming off an SUV that s come to a stop alongside. Ignoring 
      the cursing driver she TAKES OFF after the vanishing Ayala -

      - as another car comes to a rubberburning halt too close to 
      Evrard s door. He can t open it. As he struggles across to 
      the driver s side, he grabs the walkie and YELLS into it -

                                  EVRARD (CONT D)
                    Manhattan North Homicide to 
                    Central! Emergency message! 

                                  RADIO (V.O.)
                    ... Go ahead Homicide -

                                  EVRARD
                    My partner is in pursuit on 
                    foot - Unknown if suspect is armed - 
                    33rd Street and Ditmars Boulevard!

      As Evrard struggles out of the car -

      EXT. QUEENS STREET - NIGHT

      - Jane is running. From a distance she looks good but up 
      close it s all adrenaline. In a minute she ll hit the wall. 

      Up ahead Ayala s got a good lead but he s still visible. He 
      glances over his shoulder, dodging the few people out on the 
      pavements. Jane squints to keep him in sight, then pushes 
      herself harder. As her breathing gets more ragged - up ahead 
      Ayala takes a sharp angle and DISAPPEARS.  

      Jane s body wants to stop. Her lungs are burning. With no 
      time to stop she turns her head and SPITS - forcing herself 
      to drain the tank and follow her last glimpse of Ayala into -

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      Narrow between two apartment buildings, illuminated only by 
      the street light out on the boulevard and a few lamps in 
      windows above. Jane takes the corner at speed but slows down 
      after twenty feet, her eyes adjusting -

      - and out of the dark comes Ayala, running full-tilt STRAIGHT 
      FOR HER. Before Jane can even react - he TACKLES her at 
      midline and takes them both DOWN flying hard to the pavement, 
      Jane taking the brunt of the impact for them both.                                                                                     60.


      Jane BLINKS, stunned. Above her Ayala curses, having come 
      down on an elbow. He s almost unaware of Jane struggling to 
      move. But as he tries to sit back on his heels and stand -

      - Jane GRABS his CLOTHES and holds him tightly to her. 

      At first Ayala is confused. Then he realizes why he can t 
      move. He looks down at Jane and SMACKS her almost matter-of-
      factly across the FACE with all the strength of his unhurt 
      arm. Jane reacts, whining with pain. But she DOESN T LET GO. 
      She clutches him to her like grim death. The way no woman 
      Ayala has put in this position ever has. 

      Now Ayala is whining too, desperate with the urge to flee. As 
      the two of them struggle, locked together in the dark -

      - suddenly Ayala is YANKED OFF Jane. By Evrard. A walkie hits 
      the deck and skitters away. As he lays into Ayala, Jane tries 
      to roll on her side. She can hear the walkie nearby.

                                  RADIO (V.O.)

                    - 21st Ave and Steinway Street.

      Running footsteps. Queens EMS now in the alley. Evrard 
      appears on his knees next to Jane. As she focuses on him -

                                  EVRARD (CONT D)
                    Want to go grab a few pops at

                                  JANE
                    ... Right behind you.

      Off Jane as she finally smiles...                                                                                    61.


                                        ACT FIVE

      In the BLACK we hear DRUMS.

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (DAY 9)

      Keating s funeral. The department out in force. Color guard, 
      uniformed honor guard, and the pipe band, which now KICKS IN. 
      Uniformed, professional PALLBEARERS walk the CASKET on their 
      shoulders, their hands never touching it. The casket is 
      draped with the blue, green, white and gold flag of the NYPD. 
      It moves past our characters, threaded through the crowd. 

      Now the casket passes Rowe, standing with Keating s destroyed 
      family. Near them but not with them is Duffy, his face thick 
      with tears he has succeeded in holding back - almost. 

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Jane watching Duffy. She s still in pain 
      from the alley. But that s not why this is the only time 
      we ve seen her even close to crying. As she watches a man 
      unable to express emotion buckle under the weight of it... 

      EXT. CEMETERY/PBA CANTEEN TRUCK - LATER

      Jane approaches Duffy, who is standing alone and looks lost. 

                                  JANE
                    Reg... Hey, Reg.

      Duffy blinks. They re both helpless. Then Jane gestures at 
      the Patrolmen s Benevolent Association canteen truck.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Lemme buy you a free coffee.

      Duffy doesn t answer. But he follows Jane to the truck. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You guys were friends a long time, 
                    huh. How many years?

                                  DUFFY
                    ... Since we re kids. Xavier High 
                    School  65. Then the Academy.
                          (beat, then)
                    One time on patrol we hear robbery 
                    in progress, this dive on East 51st 
                    - The boozebags are pouring out 
                    like rats and one of em yells 
                     They re still in there!  So I head 
                    for the door - and the guy that 
                    yelled pulls a gun and fires at me. 
                    Cause he was the  they . 
                          (still amazed)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    62.

                                  DUFFY (CONT'D)
                    Don t know how he missed me. But 
                    Gerry got him. He didn t miss. 

      Jane hands a cup to Duffy. He takes it and looks at her.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    This squad is my home. 
                          (serious)
                    You re invading it.

                                  JANE
                          (beat, then)
                    I know you miss your friend. Maybe 
                    try to figure out how much of this 
                    is really about that.  

      Duffy looks off, shaking his head. Jane follows his gaze to 
      see Carter approaching. Duffy addresses him.

                                  DUFFY
                    She thinks it s about Gerry.

                                  CARTER
                    It s not not about Gerry. 

      As Jane looks at Carter who s apparently with Duffy on this -

                                  DUFFY
                    Who knows - By the time you re 
                    done? You even might end up 
                      preferring me and Philly here. At 
                    least we re honest. 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah? Me too - You need a new home.

      Duffy behind-the-backs his cup into a nearby trash barrel. 

                                  DUFFY
                    You re not the man who s gonna give 
                    it to me. Skip.

      Duffy and Carter walk away without looking back. Jane watches 
      them go, then notices Detective Moore from SVU walking with a 
      somber group a little ways off. As she catches his eye - he 
      gives her the FINGER.

      As Jane turns away, almost smiling, Evrard is approaching. 
      He s holding a plastic bag full to bursting with a bow on it.  

                                  EVRARD
                    What s all that about.                                                                                    63.


                                  JANE
                    The Beef Trust.
                          (re: the bag)
                    What s all that about.

      Evrard hands Jane the bag. She looks inside. As we SEE it s 
      crammed with foilpacks of NICOTINE GUM -

                                  EVRARD
                    Some of those are from me... But 
                    not all of them.

      He blows her a kiss and exits. Jane s CELL suddenly RINGS. 

                                  JANE
                    Yeah... When? 
                          (she closes her eyes)
                    That is great. When is it?

      Off Jane and her bag of gum in the cemetery...

      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      ... to Jane and Matt sitting across from Tricia and her 
      husband DOUG ROENICK. Doug is texting.

                                  DOUG
                    So your dad just took them all? - 
                    He have a gun safe too? 

                                  JANE
                    ... He bought me mine. 

                                  MATT
                    But so the list is done. The super 
                    disabled the insta-hot today -

                                  TRICIA
                    Did he lock the garbage chute?

                                  MATT
                    I told you, other tenants use that 
                    too. Not just us.

                                  TRICIA
                    Well, so, then wait and talk to him 
                    after Owen goes down it headfirst. 

      Tricia unfolds her napkin. Matt stands up wearily.

                                  MATT
                    I m gonna hit the restroom. If the 
                    waiter comes, get me a bourbon.                                                                                    64.


                                  DOUG
                    What kind?

                                  MATT
                          (already going)
                    The kind with alcohol.

      As Jane watches him go -

                                  DOUG
                    So what about those bodies on the 
                    beach in Long Island? That s a big 
                    deal, right? Bet you wish you were 
                    working on that.

      Jane turns back to Doug.

                                  JANE
                    I m actually good for right now.
                          (then)
                    How about we talk about your  
                    burglary charge instead.

      As Doug and Tricia stare at her -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Cause there s definitely a certain 
                    school of thought says an 
                      engagement gets broken off, the 
                    girl should give back the ring. I m 
                    with you there. But if she doesn t, 
                    you don t get to break in her place 
                    and take it back plus apparently an 
                      engagement camera and a what, an 
                      engagement shearling coat?

                                  TRICIA
                    All right - I see what this is -

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, you re perceptive. Not when 
                    you re driving drunk and clipping 
                    cars on Cornelia Street, but 
                      definitely the rest of the time. 

      As Tricia looks at Doug, whom this is obviously news to -

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I mean, the thing with all the 
                    credit cards and the different 
                    names? That was perceptive as hell.

      Jane looks at her silverware. As she arranges it neatly -                                                                                    65.


                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I work terrible hours. I get a lot 
                    of calls late at night, and also 
                    the rest of the time. I have to 
                    leave a lot of things early, like 
                    movies and kids  parties. I ve 
                    never been shot, but I have been 
                    stabbed, and also once I had lye 
                    thrown in my face.
                          (to Tricia)
                    And I m a homicide detective. I m 
                    not a policeman. I m also not a 
                    divorce lawyer... But I know about 
                    going to court.
                          (then)
                    What day is Owen coming over our 
                    house. 

      Beat. Doug looks at Tricia. We SEE Matt approaching.

                                  TRICIA
                    Thursday.

      Matt arrives at the table. Jane looks up at him.

                                  JANE
                    Owen s coming to sleep over on 
                    Thursday.

                                  MATT
                          (thrilled)
                      Seriously? That s fantastic. 
                          (to Tricia)
                    That s really great. Thanks.

      Matt pulls his chair out and sits down, happy. He puts his 
      arm around the back of Jane s chair. Jane opens her menu.

                                  JANE
                    Whoo! Hungry. 

      Off her smile - FADE TO BLACK.
