A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we
hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind
the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the
planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.
Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.
PUSH DOWN TO:
Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a
wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as
Vesuvius erupted.
ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING
The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very
different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-
growing mist that threatens to engulf him.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC
As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.
ARBLUS
Transform and flee, Kranix! You must
warn all you meet of the horror of
Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature
is surrounded by the strange energy cloud
and it looks like his body has
simultaneously caught fire and been
doused with acid.
KRANIX
Arblus!
No!
ANGLE ON KRANIX
The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a
small rocket ship and...
TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...
He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,
we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious
Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava
leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves
everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our
first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb
with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.

PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct
collision course with...
MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE
There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet
Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish
metal one.
NARRATOR
It is the year 2005. The treacherous
Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'
home planet of Cybertron. But from
secret staging grounds on two of
Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots
prepare to retake their homeland.
CLOSER ON GREEN MOON
At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,
pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered
with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge
cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging
ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX
until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots
peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on
Cybertron.
ANGLE ON IRONHIDE
He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor
PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned
on Cybertron.
IRONHIDE
Every time I look into this thing, my
circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this
waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna
start bustin' Deceptichops?
ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME
He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
plans for Cybertron.
OPTIMUS PRIME
We still don't have enough Energon cubes
to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.
IRONHIDE
Then let me make another run to Autobot
City on Earth. I'll bring you back more
cubes than you'll know what to do with.
3.
ANGLE ON PRIME
He solemnly hands down an order
PRIME
Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.
ANGLE ON IRONHIDE
He raises a fist in a warwhoop!
IRONHIDE
YAHOO!
(looking into monitor)
Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.
A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN"
Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands
about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.
OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)
Jazz,
report security status.
COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES
JAZZ
No sign of Decepticons in this sector,
Prime.
PRIME
What about Moon Base 2?
JAZZ
Jazz to Moon Base 2.
PAN UP
and through the sky to -
ANOTHER MOON
This is the second moon. It is much
closer to Cybertron than the first one.
This is where Bumblebee and Spike are
stationed.
JAZZ (V.O.)
Jazz to Moon Base 2.
ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE
They stand together a communication console. Spike is now
35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save
for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)
Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.
(CONTINUED)

BUMBLEBEE
Bumblebee and Spike here.
JAZZ (V.O.)
We're about to send up the bird. Any
Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?
BUMBLEBEE

(pause)
SPIKE
Hey,
Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I
miss
him, and tell him I'll be coming
home
as soon as we've kicked Megatron's
tail
across the galaxy.
CUT TO:
- LATER
The shuttle
hurtles though a massive asteroid field.
PROWL (V.O.)
Slow down, Ironhide. We want to get to
Autobot city in one piece.
CUT TO:
A child's hands hold a scanner device which tracks a
TRAVELING BLIP across a star map towards a pulsing dot which
represents the Earth.
DANIEL (V.O.)
The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint
zeta.
ON DANIEL
Daniel, a classic twelve year old
American boy watches the portable viewer
which is like an over-sized Boy Scout
compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an
old fashioned "fishin' hole" on Earth -
surrounded by weeping willows, assorted
trees and shrubs, and that his fishing
pole is stuck in the dirt, the line
floating lazily out on the water.
DANIEL
Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As
Daniel runs to small skateboard-like
device, hits a button, and watches, it
transforms into a hoverboard and rides
it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy
hillside we change angle to feature...
HOT ROD
an "adolescent" Autobot. He is in robot
mode, sitting with his fishing rod held
between two fingers, looking bored with
it all.
HOT ROD (CONT'D)
Talk about dull......!
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
Then, he tosses the rod into the water.
ON DANIEL RIDING HIS HOVERBOARD UP THE HILL
DANIEL
(calling excitedly)
Hurry or we'll miss it!
HOT ROD
lopes up hill after Daniel.
HOT ROD (CONT'D)
If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in
style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel,
scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS
to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST
OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY
FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the
perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant
Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD
also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.
(DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy
project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit
every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered
with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks
pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions
of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN
THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of
Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and
Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up
into neighboring hills for an overview of the -
CIRCULAR LANDING AREA
which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure
and natural surroundings.
DANIEL
Hey!
Let me out.
HOT ROD
Why settle for a peek when you can see
everything from Lookout Mountain?
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
DANIEL
But we're not supposed to go beyond City
limits!
HOT ROD
Chromo-Chicken!
ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS
KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing
the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod
barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF
LIMITS", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind
KUP
disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the
mountain.
KUP (CONT'D)
(to sound like swearing)
Cam bustin', turbo revvin' young punk.
CUT TO:
MOUNTAIN ABOVE AUTOBOT CITY- LOOKOUT POINT
Hot Rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside
and TRANSFORMS back to humanoid mode. Daniel rushes to a set
of PUBLIC VIEWING BINOCULARS and peers into them.
HOT ROD
This is it! Now take a squint through
those babies.
DANIEL
Hot Rod, look! There's a hole in the
shuttle!
HOT ROD
What!?
DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE
The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle
mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship.
ANGLE ON DANIEL AND HOT ROD
Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out
of his eyes.
10.
HOT ROD'S POV - THE SHUTTLE
Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision,
spots something truly disturbing -- -- Starscream, and
several Constructicons inside the ship!
HOT ROD (O.S.)
Decepticons!
ANGLE ON HOT ROD
Drawing his gun, he starts FIRING on the shuttle.
HOT ROD
This is for Ironhide.
As so's this!
ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE
Rays streak through the hole searing...

He ducks away from the door.
STARSCREAM (CONT'D)
I'm hit!
ANGLE ON MEGATRON
Standing behind a pair of Decepticons who pilot the shuttle,
he turns to see...
THE CONSTRUCTICONS
Firing out of the hole.
MEGATRON
He's furious.
MEGATRON (CONT'D)
You imbecile, our cover is blown!
STARSCREAM
It was your stupid strategy!

wreckage like toys from a pinata.
CLOSE - MEGATRON
In mid-air
MEGATRON
(shouting to forces)
Attack!
(he looks down and fires)
HOT ROD AND DANIEL
Hot Rod pulls Daniel back as Megatron's BLAST SHEARS OFF the
VIEWING PLATFORM which crumbles and falls down the steep
mountain!
HOT ROD
Hang on!
Putting Daniel under one arm, he pivots and kicks up at...
...Hook and Scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid
mode... ...causing them both to crash against the
mountainside which starts a... ...landslide which Hot Rod
"rides" down the slope, pursued by... ... Decepticon FIRE.
HOT ROD
(SHOUTING)
WHoooooooaaah
ANGLE ON BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN SLOPE - BLITZWING
Blitzwing flies down in jet mode, transforms to robot mode,
looks up at the "slide riding" Hot Rod and Daniel, transforms
to tank mode and takes aim.
BLITZWING
(amused)
Come on down, Autobrat!
ON HOT ROD AND DANIEL
as Hot Rod tumbles, he covers Daniel with his arms and tries
unsuccessfully to slow his fall.
HOT ROD
Yiiiiiiiiii!

Kup comes flying, feet first, into
Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain
ledge.
FOLLOW Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just
coming to a stop at the bottom with Daniel.
HOT ROD
Not bad for an old timer!
KUP
(gruffly)
Old timer?! That's something you'll
never be if you don't get back to the
city. You know what we used to do with
cocky, insubordinate upstarts?
HOT ROD
(interrupting)
Save it.
STARSCREAM
transforming into jet mode, fires on them
with laser bursts which...
... chew up the ground beside them.
HOT ROD AND KUP
with Daniel race toward Autobot City, transforming into
vehicle mode as shots gouge the terrain around them.

There's no escape...Uuuuh! Just then, the
floor of the courtyard STARTS
TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the
floor snaps shut like the halves of a
gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping
Starscream's foot.
STARSCREAM
Agggggggh!
My foot!
ANGLE ON SPRINGER AND ARCEE
as they make it through an archway which TRANSFORMS INTO A
STEEL SHIELD as they run through
ON STARSCREAM - HIS FOOT STILL CAUGHT IN "CLAM" OF COURTYARD
He struggles to get free before he is crunched by the still
transforming city. In the nick of time, he shoots a "shoe
horn" like projection from his wrist and pulls his boot
free, then... ...dodges away. ... The "clam" shape RETRACTS
COMPLETELY and more armored shielding SLIDES INTO PLACE TO
COVER where the Courtyard was. He winces in mid-air and flies
away as the city continues to transform to a fortress below.

Decepticons that charge back and forth.
PRIME (V.O.)
No matter the cost.
PRIME'S CHARGE:
A SERIES OF SHOTS
PRIME'S CHARGE - HEROIC BATTLE THEME SONG
Optimus Prime leader and hero of the Autobots charges into
certain doom. As he battles his way through the Decepticons,
we HEAR an inspiring anthem of courage, strength and triumph,
like "Eye of the Tiger". This theme will reprise during the
film when the Autobots are battling at impossible odds. He
charges headlong into the Decepticon forces which separate
him from Megatron. Decepticons fire on him, but he takes
the shots, and... Spinning and whirling like the Sundance
Kid, he takes a lot out. Then, Decepticons attempt to block
his charge and Prime... ... Like a powerback, transforms to
Truck Mode and barrels into them, sending Decepticons flying
around like shards of glass hit by a .45. ... finally, he
is engulfed by an incoming swarm, and it looks like his
attack is foiled.

TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME
A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand
and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then,
pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway
opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in
there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light,
reaches in, and lifts out --
THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX,
-- and holds it for a moment in his hand.
ANGLE ON ALL
The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal,
seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the
shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest,
closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary,
and extremely powerful glow from his eyes.

MEGATRON
Nobody summons Megatron!
UNICRON
Then it pleases me to be the first.
MEGATRON
State your business.
UNICRON
Bring me the Autobot Matrix. It is the
one thing - the only thing that can stand
in my way.
MEGATRON
You have nothing to fear. I have already
crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.
UNICRON
You exaggerate.
MEGATRON
The point is, he is dead!
And the Matrix
died with him.
UNICRON
No. It has been passed to their new
leader. Get it for me.
MEGATRON
Why should I? What's in it for me?
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
UNICRON
Your bargaining posture is highly
dubious, but very well, I will provide
you with a new body, and new troops to
command.
MEGATRON
And...
UNICRON
And nothing.
You belong to me now.
MEGATRON
I belong to nobody.
UNICRON
Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your
way to oblivion. The Mist appears and
starts to dissolve Megatron.
MEGATRON
(pleading)
No, no. I accept your terms.
I accept!
UNICRON
Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray
images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on
and off as a new and larger being starts
to form, changing from dented Megatron to
a huge, new creation: Galvatron.
THE TRANSFORMATION - CREATION
ends in a blinding flash and Galvatron - who still resembles
Megatron - laughs and flexes his muscles and stretches. His
voice is deeper, different from Megatron's
GALVATRON
Long live Galvatron!
UNICRON
And these shall be your minions...
ANGLE ON OTHER DECEPTICONS
Their bodies are turned from battered Decepticons to...

SCOURGE
SCOURGE (Sweep character) is bearded,
fanged and ferocious looking and as soon
as he has been CREATED, he roars and
stretches and an ARRAY OF SIMILAR
CREATURES - smaller and all wearing dark
and matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY
CREATED FROM OTHERS behind him
UNICRON
Scourge, the tracker....and his
huntsmen...the Sweeps....
ON CYCLONUS
(NEW DECEPTICON WITH PLANE TRANSFORM ABILITY)
CYCLONUS is CREATED and then his "armada" of similar, but
smaller and similarly colored and clad creatures are formed.
UNICRON
Cyclonus, the warrior...and his
armada.....
ANGLE FEATURING GALVATRON
GALVATRON
To Cybertron!
He roars with a mad power-rush, gets into Cyclonus (who will
be his personal ship) and leading the armada, takes off for
the distant stars.
UNICRON
(loudly proclaiming over the
scene)
Bring me the Autobot matrix! DURING
UNICRON'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW
LONG SHOT OF UNICRON
as Galvatron and his newly created force FLY UP AND AWAY with
great speed.
GALVATRON
I will rip open Autobot after Autobot
until it is yours, Unicron.
CUT TO:
THE DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES - STARSCREAM
This is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne
room. It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old
leaders, and a raised area where Starscream stands.
37.
STARSCREAM AND OTHERS
The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on
his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held
high, but ready for action should anybody question
Starscream's rule. In front of him stands Astrotrain holding
a huge Metallic CROWN over his head.
OTHER DECEPTICONS
in neat ranks but their grim expressions
show their displeasure.
STARSCREAM
(preening)
Get on with the ceremony! Dirge and
others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up
and off. Starscream looks where others
are looking and reacts.
HIS P.O.V. - GALVATRON AND HIS FORCES
as they descend in Hall of Heroes and Galvatron moves out to
confront Starscream
ON STARSCREAM AND GALVATRON
STARSCREAM
Who disrupts my coronation?
GALVATRON
Coronation? This is bad comedy!
STARSCREAM
Megatron, is that you?
GALVATRON
Here's a clue!
HIS P.O.V -GALVATRON
as Galvatron transforms into cannon, FIRING A HUGE BURST ON
STARSCREAM as BLAST hits him. For a moment, he retains his
shape then piece by piece, he falls apart. Only a pair of
boots remain on the floor.
GALVATRON
He transforms back to robot mode and
confronts other Decepticons boastfully.
GALVATRON
Will anyone else attempt to fill his
shoes?
38.
ON DECEPTICONS - THRUST, DIRGE, ASTROTRAIN, BONECRUSHER, ET.
AL.
PAN for their reactions as they ponder for a brief beat and
then exchange looks/
DECEPTICONS

didn't.
GALVATRON
Galvatron.
DECEPTICONS
LONG LIVE GALVATRON!
CUT TO:
UNICRON
Bit by bit, we see new
sections of the
planet being generated.
Then, the
sinister mist we saw at
the beginning of
the film starts pouring
out.
He's about to do the big munch on..
THE FIRST MOON OF CYBERTRON -
PUSH IN TO - JAZZ AND CLIFFJUMPER
Standing outside the "netted" complex, looking off at...
UNICRON
A strange, LOUD HUM fills the air and the
ground heaves and SHAKES beneath their
feet
JAZZ
Where'd that come from?!
CLIFFJUMPER
Who cares? I'm more worried about where
it's going!

CUT TO:
AUTOBOT CITY- EARTH -LONG SHOT
Autobot City is almost rebuilt, and we see Kup and Hot Rod
working with other Autobots to move large panels into
position. In the background, two huge SPACE SHUTTLES are
almost completed and Ultra Magnus is directing the work.
During this ESTABLISHING SERIES OF SHOTS, we HEAR JAZZ'S
VOICE OVER
JAZZ (V.O.-FILTER)
Roger me. Wilco me. Anything?
Hello.
Hello Earth.
CUT TO:
OUTSIDE OF LARGE SPACE SHUTTLE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Springer and Arcee fit a hull section in place with Daniel
motioning to them, directing the action.
BLASTER
He reacts to muffled transmission from
Jazz.
BLASTER
I'm pickin' up a faint signal! BLASTER
TRANSFORMS to blaster mode and Jazz's
VOICE is broadcast loud and clear causing
Springer, Arcee, and Daniel to react
JAZZ (V.O.-ON FILTER)
This is Jazz. I gi-normous weird lookin'
planet just showed up in the suburbs of
Cybertron....
CLIFFJUMPER
And it's attack...
STATIC obscures the message

THE FIRST MOON
is covered by Unicron's energy field, and slowly seems to
dissolve.
ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING UNICRON
a great maw works more intensely crushing bits of the planet.
CUT TO:
JAZZ AND CLIFFJUMPER ON THAT MOON
as quakes, tremors and cyclonic winds toss and tear at all
structures on the moon and the energy field closes in on Jazz
and Cliffjumper - who, using handholds every step of the way -
et into
AN ESCAPE POD VEHICLE
as Unicron looms larger, larger, the energy field seems to
dissolve the landscape.
JAZZ
Got ...to....blast free....if we can.....
They get in and start retro blasters, the
flame of blasters whirling in wild winds
as moon is engulfed.
CUT TO:
CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.)
Ignition and....
SOUNDS of torrential winds, quakes, etc as moon is quickly
becoming Unicron's lunch.
JAZZ (V.O.)
Hit it!
ON ESCAPE POD
as it BLASTS OFF and away from Unicron with an EXPLOSION. For
a moment, it looks like they are going to get clean away,
but...
ANOTHER ANGLE
Suddenly it is pulled deep into Unicron.
41.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MOON
as Moon shatters like a hollow egg and is sucked completely
into Unicron's maw which closes around it with a snap.
CUT TO:
GALVATRON IN DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES
Silence. No more winds. No more movement.
GALVATRON
How dare Unicron?!
(defiant)
Cybertron and all it's moons are mine!
ANOTHER ANGLE ON GALVATRON
His body starts to twist making him writhe in pain powerless
to resist
SCOURGE
But remember, WE belong to HIM!
GALVATRON
(gasping for breath, writhing,
nods)
I....will obey, Unicron! Decepticons, to
Earth! The torture stops and Galvatron
clutches his throat and tries to regain
his composure as we...
CUT TO:
He has a portable communication device. Spike and Bumble can
be seen on it. Springer, Kup, the Dinobots, Blurr, and Hot
Rod look on amid general gathering of Autobots. Arcee holds
Daniel up on her shoulder so he can see. Blaster is in b.g.
SPIKE
It's like a terrible nightmare, Ultra
Magnus.

SPIKE
But you'd better get here fast because...
Suddenly, static obscures the
transmission.
DANIEL
Dad!
ULTRA MAGNUS
Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles.
This new menace is more dangerous than
all the Decepticons put together.
Somehow we must destroy it before it
devours Cybertron.
DANIEL
But what about my dad? He's on the moon
between that monster and Cybertron.
ULTRA MAGNUS
Daniel, I'll do everything I can for
Spike.
HOT ROD
And what are we going to do when we get
there? If that thing crunches moons,
it'll make short work of us.
ULTRA MAGNUS
Maybe the Matrix can stop it.
HOT ROD
You're right! It can.
KUP
What do you know about it lad?
HOT ROD
It's just a feeling.
Hot Rod looks up and sees something.
KUP
Look!
THE AUTOBOTS TURN TO SEE
43.
POV - ANGLE ON ATTACKING DECEPTICONS
Decepticon ships seem to dive from nowhere to attack the
Autobots.
ULTRA MAGNUS

Galvatron is in the lead.
GALVATRON
There is no escape. I, Galvatron will
crush you just as the magnificent
Megatron crushed Prime!
ULTRA MAGNUS
And you'll die trying just like Megatron!
Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits
Galvatron.
GALVATRON
aaaaaaaah!
Autobot cur!!
CYCLONUS
You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you?
GALVATRON
There are plenty of Autobots for you.
Ultra Magnus is mine!
THE BATTLE - QUICK CUT
Decepticons dive on fleeing Autobots.
ANGLE - ARCEE AND DANIEL
As Daniel looks up and Arcee moves over to him protectively.
Hot Rod looks at Arcee in the same way she is looking at
Daniel.
ARCEE

ARCEE
No, you'd better stay close to me. Blurr
is trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle
with the rest of the Dinobots as
Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND.
Grimlock is like a "spooked horse"
refusing to be shut in the barn.
BLURR
(pleading with him, shoving
him, talking very, very
rapidly)
Nice Dino, good, Dino, sweet Dino! Won't
you step into the nice spaceship for
Blurr? Please, pretty please.
GRIMLOCK

struggling Blurr)
Me, Grimlock, not "nice Dino!" Me bash
brains!

GRIMLOCK
He gives FIRE BREATHING BLAST AT JETS as
they go by STRAFING THE

SCOURGE
No survivors!
IN DINOBOT SHUTTLE
as Hot Rod squeezes past
Sludge Swoop, and Slag to join Kup
who is already at control deck where Grimlock sticks his head
down to look out the window. Kup shoves him aside.
KUP
This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9,
when the Petro-Rabbits were...(annoyed)
Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!
(starts throwing switches)
GRIMLOCK
Me, Grimlock, love Kup's war stories!
KUP
You're living one now!
(to Hot Rod)
Engage the boosters for Cybertron's sake!
Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand
over bank of SWITCHES all of which GLOW
AND PULSE with the action.

Springer springs onto scene with Daniel, Ultra Magnus and
Perceptor are guarding the entry ramp, firing at Decepticons.

All right!
SPRINGER
But if you get space sick, you're gonna

Springer grabs her hand and pulls her in, narrowly avoiding a
barrage Daniel is watching, terrified.
DANIEL
That was close!
Concussion of Decepticon hit rocks the shuttle
SPRINGER
Believe it or not, this is the fun part.
IN "COCKPIT" OF ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE
Ultra Magnus is at control deck with Perceptor as they "taxi"
for launch and we see oncoming Decepticon jets firing at them
ULTRA MAGNUS
No time to preheat....Can this ship take
it?
PERCEPTOR
With an accelerated ignition procedure
the ceramic housings might create a
magnetic flux.
ULTRA MAGNUS
(baffled)
What?
SPRINGER
(ENTERING SHOT, reaches in and
pushes joystick forward)
He says "go for it!"
Powerful rockets ignite, and the shuttle
SHAKES with the
sound.

The Shuttle's rockets surge, melting the pursuing
Sweeps as
the Shuttle hits the sky and soars upwards.

ON DINOBOT SHUTTLE
Cyclonus' Jets fire on it, as we CHANGE ANGLE ON ULTRA
MAGNUS' SHUTTLE It roars up behind Cyclonus' jets and
overtakes and smashes through them, scattering them as it
pulls up alongside the Dinobot shuttle
It sits next to a gigantic alien-made moon. Suddenly, a
hatch opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster
claw shoots out at it.
ANGLE ON HOT ROD
He sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen.
HOT ROD
Dive!
ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN
The claw snaps on the front of the ship, smashing the window

around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all
around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of
weathered junk-rock.
DANIEL (V.O.)
(whistles)
This must be the junk capital of the
universe!
LONG SHOT- DANIEL AND THE OTHERS
as they start DIGGING for parts to repair the ship, sinister
Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them. Their
leader, WRECK-GAR, speaks to his fellow Junkions.
WRECK-GAR

rumble)
Stop thief! No welcome-wagon, "hello
stranger!" that good coffee flavor
OTHER JUNKIONS

large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor
sharp fins and rusty little rocket
missiles mounted around the howitzer like

Operators are standing by! They laugh in

THE GATE TO THE QUINTESSON PALACE
At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson
gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons.
QUINTESSON
Greetings, noble strangers.
ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS
They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at
your door wondering if you can come out and play, than like
serious robots on a serious mission.
GRIMLOCK
Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock
search for friends.
ANGLE ON QUINTESSON AND GRIMLOCK
The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles.
QUINTESSON
And who might they be?
GRIMLOCK
Autobots.
Hot Rod and Kup.
QUINTESSON
(feigning recognition)
Oh yes. A young one and an old one.
GRIMLOCK
Yes.
You know friends.
Where are they?
QUINTESSON
They went down that path. He points to...
A PATH
It probably isn't lined with primroses,
but it should be.
GRIMLOCK
GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock.
I
reward you, sometime.

With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose
path."
ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON
His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile.
Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely
contorted position.
GALVATRON
Why do you torture me?!
VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON
We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but
this place sure is spooky.
UNICRON
You have failed.
GALVATRON
No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.
UNICRON
Then where is the matrix?
GALVATRON
Destroyed, with him.
UNICRON
The matrix can not be destroyed.
(pause)
And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of
Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And
bring the matrix to me.
DISSOLVE TO:
They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister
things start to happen all around them.
ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT
This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap,"
and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks
past it in humanoid mode.

SNAP!
It misses him by an inch.
GRIMLOCK
Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup

ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG
Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag
revealing a spiked pit...
SLAG
Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium
balony. He is just about to fall in
when...
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG
Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him
away an instant before he steps into the hole...
GRIMLOCK
Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium
salami! Slag gets up...
SLAG
Beryllium balony!
GRIMLOCK
Argh!
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK
He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is
actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs
toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground,
between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns
and sees the thing stocking in the ground.
GRIMLOCK
Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap
model.
SLAG
Like your head! (laughs at own joke)
Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him
to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY
CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.

Who say that?
HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE
WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been
evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed,
killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of
Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a
special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing,
especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the
clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back
and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto... ... Slag's
head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock

QUINTESSON JUDGE
Before we deliver your verdict, would you
like to beg for your lives?
ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD
Kup turns to Hot Rod.
KUP
Remember when you put me together today?
HOT ROD
(sarcastic)
Sure, that's all I got to think about.
KUP
I know what part you forgot.
QUINTESSON JUDGE (V.O.)
Silence or I'll hold you in contempt of

photon charges!
Kup transforms to Auto mode.
KUP
Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he
roars into a bunch of them, slamming a
massive stack into the wall.
ANGLE ON HOT ROD
He transforms, too and does the same thing.
ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT
As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over,
new swarms of them come out.
ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD
They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and
transform to humanoid mode.
HOT ROD
Didn't even bend a fender.

We can't hold out forever, but we can
give them one whopper of a repair bill.
ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICONS
They charge Kup and Hot Rod Kup and Hot Rod fire into them,
destroying several, but are.... ... Soon overrun. The
Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal.

ASSORTED SHOTS OF DINOBOT CARNAGE
SLUDGE in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his
tail, while stomping them with his feet.
GRIMLOCK
Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller
Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his
teeth, realizes that he's a second
stringer, and scampers away.
GRIMLOCK
Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag
barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick
shishkebob out of them, while...
Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops
them on other Sharkticons.
THE SHARKTICONS

They look down, their angry faces showing.
QUINTESSON JUDGE
Sharkticons! Execute them.
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK
He points to the Quintessons...
GRIMLOCK

THE SHARKTICONS
for a brief instant, don't seem to know
what to do. Then, they charge the
Quintessons.
THE CHASE
The Quintessons start to flee, but it's
clear that the Sharkticons, who climb
over the stacked bodies of other
Sharkticons, are going to catch them.
KUP
I think the problems on this planet will
be solved very shortly.

ON THE SECOND MOON AND UNICRON
BLAMMMOLA!
An incredible display of fireworks goes off, seemingly
blowing Unicron to smithereens.
ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE
They slap palms. Then, they look up, horrified.
BUMBLEBEE
It isn't even dented.
SPIKE
Let's get out of here!
ON UNICRON
The great Maw opens and we hear a grand
cosmic roar! Suddenly, the smoke and
space junk from the explosion are sucked
into his mouth.
ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE
They try to fly away.

SPIKE
We're being sucked into it!
ANGLE ON THEIR SHIP AND UNICRON
Despite the fact that their thrusters are on full power, they
are still sucked into...

Whose great mouth shuts when he's got the human and the
Autobot.

DEEP SPACE - THE PLANET JUNKION
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE

new "canopy" is fitted

Absolutely, positively, definitely...
WIDE SHOT TO INCLUDE DANIEL

DANIEL
This exo-suit is fantastic!
(to Blurr)
Want me to do that?
BLURR
Weld? You? Really? Well, why not? Give it
a try, but think it through first! Daniel
knits his brow, extends FINGER OF EXO-
GLOVE which is part of exo-suit.
CLOSE ON EXO GLOVE AND DANIEL'S HAND
as hand quivers and his finger shoots out a tiny flame which
sputters, sparks and then goes out like a wet match
79.
RESUME ON BLURR AND DANIEL
BLURR
Practice, practice, practice!
WRECK-GAR AND JUNKIONS IN HIDING
Wreck-Gar starts to motion them to the attack, and the
Junkions ready their weapons.

Forward, avanti, apfel and like, go for
gusto....

Hang on, this be industrial strength We

double back to the ship!
ANGLE ON CYCLONUS

forces, motioning to them to split off
and follow...
BIRD'S EYE VIEW - THE AUTOBOTS

THE OTHER AUTOBOTS
several yards down the junk-lined corridor.
PERCEPTOR (O.S.)
Your estimated survival time is 10
seconds.
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS
He shoots at the junk walls.
ULTRA MAGNUS
Then use that time to escape! The Matrix
was designed for an emergency like this.
I'll try to unleash its power.
SPRINGER
But what if it doesn't work.
ULTRA MAGNUS
Until all are one!
THE OTHER AUTOBOTS AND JUNK WALLS

Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and...
ON ULTRA MAGNUS
wrap around his arms and legs.
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND THE SWEEPS
His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's
just about had it. He struggles for one last moment, then...
ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS AND ULTRA MAGNUS
Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate
directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot
leader...
ON ULTRA MAGNUS
As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered
in the distance, he SCREAMS IN HORROR.
ULTRA MAGNUS
(SCREAMS IN HORROR)

Ultra Magnus!
ANOTHER ANGLE - BLURR, SPRINGER, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR
as they move up beside Daniel.
BLURR
Without the Matrix there is no hope.
No
hope at all!
WRECK-GAR AND AN ARMY OF JUNKIONS
as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle.
Junkions are an interesting species. They ride themselves.
That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that
if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the
vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver.
They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock,
war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of
bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a
humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense.
"Slice 'em dice 'em... And that's all folks or your money
back..."
ON WRECK-GAR
as he roars into the lead and shows his
teeth
WRECK-GAR
Don't look behind door number two, Monty.
It's time to play End-of-the-line-my
valentine! Geroni-roni-doo-ron-ron-i-mo!
(he charges)
ON SPRINGER AND OUR FRIENDS
as they react
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
SPRINGER
Get gone!
Springer leads the way and Blurr, Arcee, Daniel and Perceptor
follow and we MOVE TO A ROAD WARRIOR STYLE CHASE as Springer
and Arcee ride on either side of Daniel and Perceptor with
Blurr bringing up the rear- - zig zagging back and forth to
keep the Junkions from getting at Daniel.
A JUNKION
roars alongside Springer on his
motorcycle and throws out laser barbed
grappling hook, trying to hook Springer.
Springer ducks first pass of hook.
ON JUNKION
as he hurls GRAPPLING HOOK AGAIN
ON SPRINGER
as he catches HOOK BY THE CHAIN AND YANKS
IT
THE JUNKION
goes flying off his motorcycle.,, He
transforms into a motorcycle as The
motorcycle transforms into a rider and
hops on the new motorcycle and then...
...turns around to come back.
ON SPRINGER
He looks over, astonished.
SPRINGER
It's not hard to knock 'em down. It's
getting them to stay down that's the
trick.
ON ARCEE
as she fires at a Junkion who is trying
to swerve her off the road knocking him
off the motorcycle... The Junkion looks
down at his missing arm, digs around in
the junk for a minute, comes up with
another, and then transforms to a
motorcycle.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Junkion rides over to her, starts
belting her with junk sword
ARCEE
They're indestructible!
(CONTINUED)
86.

ON DANIEL
as he skids, stopping his Exo-Suit as he
reacts to what's ahead
DANIEL
They're everywhere!
HIS P.O.V. - PILES OF JUNK
as Junkions arise out of every junk pile in sight and,
gibbering, singing their junk-rock battle song, start moving
in
ON SPRINGER
as he stops and Arcee, Daniel, Perceptor
and Blurr stop around him. They close
ranks and look out at the Junkions grimly
PERCEPTOR
Perhaps they're not as vicious as they
look.
ON WRECK-GAR
as he gnashes his teeth and grins and
then BLINKS HIS EYES which roll to show
eyes like ping pong balls. Wreck-Gar
makes blipping noises as he does this
ON SPRINGER
reacting to Wreck-Gar's noises and
eyeball display
SPRINGER
(to Perceptor)
Positive thinking gets
on my nerves.
Suddenly, all react to
sound and wind of
passing space cruiser
their P.O.V- HOT
ROD, KUP AND DINOBOTS
IN CRUISER as it
shoots past and banks,
coming back for a
closer look
SPRINGER (V.O.)
It can't be....it's.....Hot Rod!
He's
alive!
DANIEL
as he looks up at passing Cruiser and
waves
DANIEL
And Kup and the Dinobots!
We're saved!
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
PERCEPTOR
I wouldn't count on that!
(indicating Junkions)
HIS P.O.V. - EVEN MORE JUNKIONS ARISING OUT OF THE JUNK HILLS
as Junkions newly risen from Junk look up and point at
Cruiser and make hostile signs toward it, shaking weapons,
etc.
The massive Junkion ship and the corkscrew cruiser piloted by
Hot Rod and Kup race through the dark void.
HOT ROD
I don't believe it.
As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst
of fire... ... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire
subsides, nothing has happened.
WRECK-GAR (V.O.)
Patented enamel resists fire, rain and
corrosion. Five year warranty,
satisfaction guaranteed.
OTHER JUNKIONS
Or your money back!
The ship fires back, dumping rays into... ... Unicron's face,
but not really doing any damage.
UNICRON AND JUNKION CRUISER
Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands
and...
CLOSER
... tears it in half.
WRECK-GAR (V.O.)
Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable. And
for a limited time we include...
Both halves of the Junkion ship act as independent space
ships.
PERCEPTOR (V.O.)
Most unscientific, but... effective.
98.
EXT THE SPACE BATTLE
As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face.
THE CRUISER
Is suddenly struck by a ray from
Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked
off.
INT THE CRUISER
Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys.
ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN
They are heading right to Unicron's eye.
ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER
Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser
crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!
UNICRON (V.O.)
Graaaaaaaaaaa!
Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor
in the giant, flickering chamber.
DANIEL
Where's Hot Rod?
SPRINGER
Sees something in the distance.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
SPRINGER
I don't know, but I hope they didn't get
him.
WHAT HE SEES
Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear
traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the
Autobots.
ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS
KUP
Debugoids!
ARCEE
Quick!
This way.
They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the
central nervous system or something.
CUT TO:
ASSORTED SHOTS
Unicron now stands atop Cybertron,
fighting the various ships that swarm
around him like bees. ... Rays streak
from his one good eye. ...
(MORE)

fire.

while he crushes the Junkion ship.
... Unicron's side...
CUT TO:
Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion
ship, sending it hurtling.
108.
Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off
a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.
CUT TO:
Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...
Followed by the
others.
ANGLE ON UNICRON
An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence
spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly,
Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot
out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like
some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And
then...
110.
BANG!
We get the big visual explosion.
DISSOLVE TO:
Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and
PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus,
Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch
construction being done on Cybertron below.

Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian
