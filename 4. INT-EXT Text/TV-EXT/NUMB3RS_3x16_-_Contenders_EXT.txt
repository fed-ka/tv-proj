      Megan sits in front of a LONG BANK OF MONITORS, watching 
      curiously (ON THE MONITORS: "DIALING", PHONE NUMBERS APPEAR, 
      "CALL CONNECTED", ETC). Charlie enters.

                                  MEGAN
                    Per your instructions, all the 
                    computers are networked. We're 
                      monitoring calling patterns on 50 
                    numbers we got from Ben Ellis' 
                    phone records.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Here's the program with the 
                    algorithm I constructed on Amita's 
                    laptop.

                                  MEGAN
                    Mind telling me what exactly it is 
                    we're doing?

                                    CHARLIE
                    We're going to find Ben Ellis by 
                      identifying his calling pattern.

                                  MEGAN
                    But he hasn't used his cell since 
                    he got away from David and Colby.

                                    CHARLIE
                    But that doesn't mean he hasn't 
                    been making any calls.

                                  MEGAN
                          (gets it)
                    He's borrowed someone else's phone.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And this algorithm will find his 
                    calling pattern hidden within all 
                    the other calls made on that phone. 
                    Think of a symphony...

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Ben's calling pattern is like a 
                    series of notes.

      A MUSICIAN PLAYS A SERIES OF NOTES ON A FLUTE.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    If we know the notes, we can locate 
                    the tune even if it's played on 
                    another instrument.


      THE SAME SERIES IS PLAYED ON A TRUMPET.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    But we need to locate the tune 
                    while the whole symphony is 
                    playing.

                    We wait and watch for Ben Ellis' 
                    tune.

      A beat, then,

                    I hear you're doing a lot of prep 
                    for the poker tournament.

      Charlie is lost in the monitors, watching the ALGORITHM 
      highlight calls, the numbers flash until the pattern fails 
      and the numbers are abandoned.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah.

                                  MEGAN
                    You really wanna win this thing, 
                    huh.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Well, the winner gets a seat at the 
                    final table in next year's 
                      tournament.

                                  MEGAN
                    And Larry's had that seat five 
                    years running...

                                    CHARLIE
                    I just wanna make sure it's there. 
                    You know, for when he gets back.

      Charlie studies the monitors. Megan studies Charlie, when...

                    Did we get him?

                                    CHARLIE
                    We got his phone.

      David and Colby are in a BUREAU SEDAN, waiting.

                    Nobody's home now. Ben could have

                                  DAVID

                    Alright, move to positions. Let's 
                    take him.

      Colby puts the car in gear, drives toward Ben. Colby wheels 
      the car over the curb, cutting off Ben. Ben turns, starts to 
      run. A BLACK SUV cuts him off. David is first out of the car, 
      gun drawn. There's thirty feet between him and Ben.

                                  DAVID
                    On the pavement. Hands on the back 
                    of your head.

      Ben turns around.

                                  BEN
                    What? You gonna shoot me?

      Ben steps towards David. David raises his gun.

                                  DAVID
                    Ben, I said on the pavement!  Hands

      Ben takes another step.

                    You haven t changed a bit. I m not

                    Come on, David! COME ON!

      David looks like he might shoot. Ben stops. Colby steps past 
      David, gun raised.

      David and Claudia walk along the sidewalk.

                    So Ben isn't the only suspect?

                    A guy's gym bag has got to have 
                    some DNA on it somewhere, right?

                    It should.

                    Had no reason to... Can you get me

                      Technically, it is. But we have Ben

                    Hmm. Just when you think you've 
                    gotten away.

                                  DAVID
                    How do you mean?

                    out of there. 

                                  DAVID
                    Guess we don't every really leave 
                    all that past behind...

      They reach CLAUDIA'S CAR. She takes out her KEYS.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    Thanks for the help.

      Claudia gives him a kiss on the cheek.

      A MARSHALL opens the gate. Ben Ellis walks out of the Holding 
      Facility. David is there, waiting. They stand opposite each

                    I don't know why I bothered coming 
                    down here.

      Ben stops.

                    Maybe you thought you'd finally

                    Let s finally get something 
                    straight, man.  Locking you up back 
                    then was one of the best things 
                    they could have done for you.

                                  BEN
                    Look, I know you already had the 
                    Bronx in your rear-view, but I 
                    figured my best friend would come 
                    by at least once. If only to ask me 
                    what happened that night.

      Ben shakes his head.

                                  DAVID
                    What happened? You did the same 
                    thing you always do, man. I know 
                    what happened.

                                  BEN
                    You know that Earl stepped to that

                    You're saying  E  started the

                    I don't think Earl ever saw the gun 
                    come out, but I did.

                                  DAVID
                    Why didn't you tell anyone this?

                                  BEN
                    Lawyer told me if I told my side,  
                    tried for self-defense, I could end 
                    up doin' twenty years...

                                  DAVID 
                    Wait.  Wait, hold on. 

                                  BEN 
                    I didn't know what to do. You 
                    weren t there.
                    (shrugs)
                    What's done is done.

      Beat. Ben turns to leave.

                                  DAVID
                    Never. Never

      Ben stops.

                                  BEN
                    What's that?

                                  DAVID
                    You asked when did you ever back 
                    down from a fight. That's my 
                    answer.


      Ben almost smiles. Then,

                                  BEN
                    What your partner said about the 
                    moving up the rankings. You oughta 
                    know, it doesn't really work that 
                    way.

      Off David s silence...

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    The rankings... I mean, they 
                    matter. But, at the end of the day, 
                    Larry Alston decides who gets to 
                    fight.

      Off David, wheels turning,
