A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing.
Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.
JIM
Well...how do you feel?
SUZY
Ask me in about five minutes.
She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..
JIM
I'm talking about graduation. Being
totally free to do whatever we want
now.
Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.
SUZY
It feels excellent.
Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently
pulls away from her with a teasing smile.
JIM
Gotta throw the anchor over.
He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.
as Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on
top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same
enthusiasm as before.
SUZY
What's wrong?
JIM
Nothing.
He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses
his anxiety.
SUZY
C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering
you.
Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.
JIM
It's just that we're right around that
old summer camp where all those
murders took place.
The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.
SUZY
What murders?
JIM
Never mind, you don't want to know
about it.
SUZY
Tell me.
JIM
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy.
The guy's dead now, somewhere at the
bottom of this lake...if you believe
the stories.
(beat)
Let's drop it, okay?
He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.
SUZY
What stories?
He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.
JIM
There was this boy named Jason
Voorhees who drowned in Crystal
Lake...
FLASHBACK
Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread
water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get
attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.
YOUNG JASON
Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...
JIM (V.O.)
None of the counselors heard him.
YOUNG JASON
Mmmmmmommy....
...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.
JIM
A bunch of years went by and everybody
forgot about it.
(beat)
That's when the murders started.
FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)
as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted
teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over
each other. We do not see the attacker. As the
cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:
as the silence hits us hard again.
SUZY
Jason did it...?
JIM'
That's what some people thought. But
they were wrong.
FLASHBACK (STOCK)
as MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge
knife and a primal scream.
JIM
His mother blamed the counselors for
his death and tried to kill them all.
(dramatic pause)
She got her head chopped off by one of
them.
We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite
sufficient.
SUZY
So the murders stopped?
He gives her a long, penetrating look.
JIM
No.
FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)
We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked
JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing
everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as
Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:
Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.
JIM
Legend has it that Jason came back to
avenge his mother's death, vowing to
kill every teenager from the area.
(beat)
And every now and then, the murders
start up again.
The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable.
She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.
JIM
Forget about it, Suzy. They're just
stories.
He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently,
finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes,
trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't.
Suzy begins to rationalize.
SUZY
We're the last graduating class,
right?
Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.
JIM
Right.
SUZY
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its
doors for good, right?
JIM
Right.
SUZY
So there's no reason for him to come
back because there won't be any of us
around...right?
Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.
JIM
Right. Except that Jason isn't real
so none of it matters anyway.
She starts to relax, returning his kisses.
as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are
starting to slip away along with their clothes.
Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At
the same moment:
as Suzy's eyes flash open.
SUZY
Did you hear that?
JIM
Hear what?
He pulls her back down.
SUZY
C'mon, I'm serious.
He knows the mood is broken.
JIM
All right, I'll check it out.
He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the
sheet up around her fearfully.
Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void
of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim
has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.
SUZY
Jimmy...?
No answer. Her heart starts to pound.
SUZY
Jim...?
Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving
towards the open door. The ship creaks again.
SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW
as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
black beyond it.
SUZY
Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean
it...
...And just as she reaches the door:
A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER
leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time
to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.
SUZY
stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her
mortal wound. But there's no blood.
THE MONSTER
pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out
with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM
pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it
aside.
JIM
Gotcha good, baby cakes.
She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick
him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed,
laughing.
as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying
unsuccessfully to kiss her.
JIM
All right, all right -- I'm a major
ass.
SUZY
And you'll never do it again.
JIM
And I'll never do it again. Forgive
me?
SUZY
No.
She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around
him, finally giving in.
The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each
other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR
Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered
BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.
SUZY
closes her eyes with pleasure...
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR
...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless
legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked
face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.
SUZY
lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay
open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway.
She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just
collapsed himself.
SUZY
JJJJJJJJason...
He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.
JIM
Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an
ass.
But she continues to stare in horror as:
JASON
raises the spear, taking aim.
ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM
Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR,
PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.
Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able
to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see
the monster himself.
JIM
Ohmygod...
Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to
defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He
SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim
scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE
AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.
Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties,
attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits
next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly
withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in
the back seat.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
I'm glad you decided to come after
all.
RENNIE
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles
will be.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
You let me worry about him, okay?
(pause)
Personal experiences are what fuel the
minds of great writers, Rennie. You
made the right decision.
RENNIE
What about not-so-great writers?
Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen
grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far
between, this one disappearing as she glances out the
window.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)
as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread
out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes
across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.
RETURN TO SHOT
Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns
away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She
turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Everything okay?
RENNIE
Just felt a little chill.
Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Did you know that I'm giving up
teaching?
RENNIE
Really?
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Since the school is closing anyway,
I'm going to write that novel I've
been threatening on everybody.
RENNIE
That's wonderful, Miss Van
Deusen...what's it about?
She parks the car, turning off the ignition.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
A senior class cruise to Manhattan,
laced with romance, adventure and
murder.
(beat)
Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't
decided which.
She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van
Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove
compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly
surprised.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Go on, open it.
Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip
pen.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Stephen King supposedly used it when
he was in high school.
RENNIE
I don't know what to say...
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Rennie, you're the best student I ever
had...you have a real gift. If anybody
can make use of that pen, it's you.
Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's
window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short
distance away.
CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES
A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA
MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of
SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and
hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a
cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda,
EVA WATANABE.
. TAMARA
Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock
'n roll or what, girl?
Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left.
Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a
smile at Tamara.
MRS. WATANABE
Hello, Tamara.
TAMARA
Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.
MRS. WATANABE
Yes, I'm sure.
Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss
goodbye.
EVA
Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll
have a terrific time and I won't do
anything stupid, okay?
Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter
is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.
MRS. WATANABE
I love you...
TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA
Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --
TAMARA
I hear the crew members are cute guys
in their twenties.
EVA
Really?
TAMARA
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting
them to party with us...especially
with this.
Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with
fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.
TAMARA
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It
cost over a thousand bucks but it's
the best.
EVA
He bought you that?
TAMARA
More or less. It's part of my college
fund.
She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the
calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT
is aimlessly drifting into port.
CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT
Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last
night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a
ghost ship.
Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged
scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to
reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the
cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF
ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA
satellite computer as well as the LORAN.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
(checking watch)
Let's take in the brow.
CHIEF ENGINEER
Yes Sir.
(into intercom phone.)
Take in the gangway and single up all
lines.
SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from
his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.
SEAN
Hello, Dad.
MILES
Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your
ship.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've
retired from the Navy ten years ago.
MILES
You've really been generous to give us
this cruise. I know I speak for
everybody on board.
Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He
avoids eye contact with his father.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Hell, there's just twenty or so of you
-- we only need a skeleton crew and
it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
(beat)
By the way, congratulations on winning
the intramural diving championships,
Miles. I'm sure you made your old man
proud.
Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean
should think about doing the same.
CHIEF ENGINEER
Have you decided on your departure
protocol, Admiral?
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Actually, I thought I'd leave the
honors to my son.
SEAN
Dad, I don't think...
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
(to Chief Engineer, ignoring
Sean)
Relinquishing command of the Princess
Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.
Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his
friend's nervousness as well.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
But before you take the helm, take
this.
He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a
navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting
next to a rusty old sextant.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Something old and something new. I
used the sextant when I was your age,
but now they have these goddamn
computers to do all the work for you.
CHIEF ENGINEER
(to Sean)
Have you decided on a plan of
departure, Captain?
Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at
the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.
SEAN
How about if we start up the forward
engines and come around. 180
degrees...
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Aren't you forgetting something?
Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a
large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air
with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It
underscores his frustration.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
We're in foggy weather! Send out the
international maritime signal that a
vessel is backing down, followed by a
security broadcast warning other
ships!
He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it,
leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment
for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits
as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window,
saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this
way.
as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen,"
continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black
leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding
the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing
the latest hip prescription glasses.
WAYNE
Too cool, J.J. Your parents came
through.
She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.
J.J.
No lie. I hear there's a big power
room down below where I can get
supreme concert hall echo. Come down
and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?
WAYNE
Sure...but I gotta shoot some
shockumentary footage first.
He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a
look.
J.J.
Man, don't tell me you're still trying
to scam on Tamara...
His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him,
grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.
J.J.
How long have we known each other?
Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not
interested in you, only what you can
do for her. She's a user.
WAYNE
She's sexy.
J.J.
So's this guitar. So what?
WAYNE
I'll catch you later.
He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling
up her amp cord.
as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he
passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY
FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS
the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition,
our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not
for long.
Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of
pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers
and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming
generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her
guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the
surroundings.
J.J.
This place is aching for a video.
Wayne, you're an asshole.
She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam,
moving through it, behind the generators.
J.J.
pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play"
button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather
pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.
TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR
as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female.
receptacle.
JASON'S FACE
appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
J.J.
screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with
her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which
makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs.
She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending
the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She
opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:
JASON
emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.
as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the
air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a
narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a
generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one
last look at her before:
JASON
swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.
No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her
dog, who's curled up on the bed.
RENNIE
What do you think...time for some
personal experiences to fuel our
minds?
The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.
RENNIE
I agree.
Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and
some black satin pants.
as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he
rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA
and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.
A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is
going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly
losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the
mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering
them on.
REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW
as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around,
feeling out of place in the men's locker room.
EVA
I'm not sure we're supposed to be
here, Tamara.
A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But
Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against
the glass, watching Julius.
TAMARA
Is that a muscular bod or what?
Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her
instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a
left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud.
Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked
smile.
TAMARA
He's undefeated, you know that?
(beat)
Julius is the only senior I'd even
consider doing it with. If he wasn't
black, that is.
EVA
(awkward)
My parents are open minded about that
sort of thing.
TAMARA
My stepmom couldn't care less, but
Daddy would have a shit fit.
(lets it slip out)
He might even pay some attention to
me.
Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting
something.
TAMARA
Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look
sensual.
Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in
his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very
masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara
turns around to check out his back side.
TAMARA
I think it's time for some
recreational activity, girl.
EVA
Sounds good. I hear there's a
shuffleboard court on deck -- it might
be kinds cool...
TAMARA
You're joking, right?
She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara
walks on, Eva following.
as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very
worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his
viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his
face.
MCCULLOCH
Have you seen my niece anywhere?
WAYNE
Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think.
What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?
MCCULLOCH
Senior predictions started five
minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.
WAYNE
Some of us don't want our futures
predicted.
MCCULLOCH
In your case I'm sure that's true.
He brushes past Wayne angrily.
as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling
out her mirror, straw and baggie.
TAMARA
The night time is the right time.
Tamara hands the straw to Eva.
EVA
(nervous)
No thanks.
TAMARA
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is
top dollar toot.
EVA
It's not that, it's just that...
(beat)
It I get caught, I'll lose my science
scholarship and everything.
TAMARA
You're talking to the prom queen,
Eva. Do you really think I'm going to
risk getting caught?
EVA
(a pause)
I guess not.
TAMARA
Do you realize how many people would
kill to be sitting here right now?
Come on, it's grad night. You've got
your whole life to be uptight.
Eva takes the straw.
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows,
hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's
coming...
ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA
as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.
TAMARA
Is that unbelievable or what?
Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line.
But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING
FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with
fear as:
RENNIE
appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them.
It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the
cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.
TAMARA
Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.
RENNIE
Have you seen my dog? I think he came
this way.
TAMARA
No, we haven't.
(awkwardly)
Care for a hit?
RENNIE
No thanks.
Rennie continues on. After she's gone...
TAMARA
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll
narc on us...
EVA
I have her in Creative Writing and
she's fairly nice.
TAMARA
Nobody related to McCulloch can be
nice.
Tamara puts the straw to her nose.
ANGLE - RENNIE
as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.
RENNIE
Toby?
No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway...
but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON
REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM.
He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in
half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.
as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a
sniffle.
TAMARA
Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.
She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service
Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both
GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the
ground.
REVERSE ANGLE
They are facing McCulloch.
MCCULLOCH
What are you doing in here?
TAMARA
Nothing.
He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.
MCCULLOCH
Are you girls using drugs?
EVA
Do you think I would use drugs, Mr.
McCulloch? We were just exploring the
ship.
He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara
is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.
MCCULLOCH
I'11 be coming around your stateroom
in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss
Mason. You'd better have your biology
project ready or I'm phoning your
parents.
TAMARA
They're out of town.
MCCULLOCH
Then I'll make sure you remain on
board while your classmates see the
sights.
He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.
EVA
What are you going to do?
TAMARA
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered...
but that little narcing bitch niece of
his is a different matter.
(calculating)
Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid
of the water...
SPLASH!
as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool.
It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high
board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at
poolside, giving him some applause.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Poetry in motion, Miles.
MILES
A half-twist short. I'll hone that
dive yet.
He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie.
She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool
edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to
your room
RENNIE
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
MISS VAN DEUSEN
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The
ship's only so big and there's
certainly no way off it, is there?
She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than
comforting.
as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the
maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his
pace, knowing he's getting close to something.
TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which
obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase,
weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no
warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN
FRONT OF US.
TOBY
rears back with teeth bared, but:
THE BODY
is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the
TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's
still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL
CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.
as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes
a sultry voice...
TAMARA (O.S.)
The door's open.
McCulloch swings it open.
MCCULLOCH
I'm in no mood for any more stall
tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your
final project?
REVERSE ANGLE
as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle
of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.
TAMARA
Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne
first, Charles?
He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.
MCCULLOCH
Where did you get that alcohol?
TAMARA
I packed it. Just for us.
as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through
it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the
people.
as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down
on her nightstand.
MCCULLOCH
That's it. You're not setting foot off
this ship until we return home.
TAMARA
But I haven't even shown you my
biology project...
Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as
it softly piles at her bare feet.
ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW
as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.
RETURN TO SCENE
McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react.
Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning
to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all.
Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.
TAMARA
Take a closer look, Charles. I want to
make sure I labeled all my organs
correctly.
as we approach her door, still cracked open from
McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see
Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips
on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly
starched shirt.
as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit
of anger.
MCCULLOCH
Oh, you've done it now. Not only are
you going home, I'll see to it that
you spend next year back in a high
school classroom!
He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to
face with:
WAYNE
who casually lowers his camcorder.
TAMARA
I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
(to Wayne)
Did you get anything good?
His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.
WAYNE
Oh yeah.
She quickly slips on her robe again, all business.
McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.
MCCULLOCH
You'll never get away with it.
(eyeing Wayne)
And you can forget about ever
attending any film school.
(serious beat)
You're both going to be very, very
sorry.
He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara
steps over to him, cuddling up.
TAMARA
Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a
thing.
(beat)
Can I have the tape?
He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne
steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He
lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.
WAYNE
This is going to sound supremely
lame...but I've had the major hots for
you since our sophomore year, Tamara.
He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the
incriminating videotape.
TAMARA
That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to
chat but I'm really pressed for time.
(ushering him to door)
Let's try to get together later, okey-
doke?
WAYNE
But I thought...
TAMARA
Thanks for the camerawork.
And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands
outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.
WAYNE
Wayne, you're an asshole.
He despondently exits.
as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe.
She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind
her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking
it back...
Nothing is there.
as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the
sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the
silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked
hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.
When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD
POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps,
jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.
RENNIE
It's not real, it's not real...
as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat
before Tamara turns it off.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body
paint has been washed off.
She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror
AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins
around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM.
Just as she SCREAMS:
Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING
THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:
The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS
FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a
whimpering Tamara.
TAMARA
Please...please don't...
Jason raises the shard above her and just as she
SHRIEKS...
CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP
as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins
to rain.
as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral
Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr.
Carlson, and get the seas off the
quarter. These kids are in for one
hell of a storm.
CHIEF ENGINEER
Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise
mode.
The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches,
flipping a row of them.
TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME
as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty
harpoon hanging above the map.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.
ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON
How olds your boy now, Carlson?
CHIEF ENGINEER
Nineteen months.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
A tremendous age. Take some advice
from a salty old man: don't push him
too hard.
The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the
Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck,
contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the
radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in
a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.
CHIEF ENGINEER
This is the bridge. Approaching
weather suggests we secure the main
deck and...
His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from
excruciating, instant pain.
His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he
stares into the face of:
JASON
holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it
forward with one more staccato jerk and:
CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK
-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through
his once-white uniform.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
Better have them doublecheck the
lifeboat stations as well...
Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr.
Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing
as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson
bends his neck upwards to face:
JASON
hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling
knives.
as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the
bridge.
RENNIE
Can he really take us home?
SEAN
Not completing a voyage is against
everything he stands for. But I think
I can convince him to call a Coast
Guard cutter for you.
RENNIE
What about you?
SEAN
If I go with you, he'll never
speak to me again.
(beat)
But I'm never going to live up to his
expectations anyway...so maybe it's
the right thing to do.
He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they
walk on.
THEIR POINT OF VIEW
moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not
the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.
SEAN
knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He
pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean
puts his weight into it, shoving hard.
as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes
roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE
HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.
SEAN
Oh Jesus...Dad??
Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still
sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent.
Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward
his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.
SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he
thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his
face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's
about two feet away from him...
SEAN
reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his
father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers
backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We
MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching
onto him tightly.
SEAN
He's...he's dead...
as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently
knocking.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Ronnie? I just came by to see how you
were feeling...
No answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open,
unlocked.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Rennie...?
Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung
open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.
MCCULLOCH
I thought I told you to stay away from
her.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(holds her ground)
Where is she?
MCCULLOCB
(accusing)
That's a very good question and I'd
appreciate an answer.
A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to
their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's
unsteady voice immediately follows.
SEAN (V.O.)
Attention everybody, attention. This
is Sean Robertson...
as JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after
a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them.
SEAN (V.O.)
I want everybody to meet on the
bridge...
JULIUS
What the fuck is this?
The others shrug, concerned.
trying his best to keep it together. He glances at his
dead father, still unable to believe it.
SEAN (V.O.)
God, I wish this was a joke, but it's
not.
Sean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze.
Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE
BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the
swivel chair.
RENNIE
What is happening???
Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console,
looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them
before.
SEAN
I don't know...we've gone off course
or something...
RENNIE
What do you mean???
Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful
panic.
SEAN
I don't know what I mean! All's I know
is that there's no one guiding this
ship anymore...
Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean
guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking
him.
RENNIE
Can't you call for help??
Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing
frenetically.
SEAN
I think so. But we have to lower the
anchors so we don't drift any
further...
RENNIE
Where are they?
SEAN
The bow...front of the ship. There's a
hoist on each side that lowers them
She starts to exit.
SEAN
I didn't mean for you to go!
RENNIE
Just radio for help, okay???
She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced
adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing
the keying button, speaking into the mike.
SEAN
Mayday, mayday, mayday...
ANOTHER ANGLE
as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room.
They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the
radio.
SEAN
Please...can anybody out there hear
me??
No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.
MILES
Sean, what's going on?
Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.
WAYNE
Jesus Christ...
He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded
with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.
JULIUS
Who did this, man?
WAYNE
Is the radio even working??
MILES
Isn't there some international S.O.S.
thing you can do???
SEAN
(suddenly remembers)
Channel 16...the distress frequency...
(dialing knob)
Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the
Princess Ruby. Please, somebody
answer...
as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.
SEAN
The Captain and Chief Engineer...
they've been...they're dead.
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
(a grave-pause)
What is your location?
SEAN
I...I don't know...
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
Is your ship equipped with Omega
satellite navigation or LORAN?
SEAN
Yes...
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
The LORAN has a digital printout of
your latitude and longitude. Give me
the coordinates and we'll be there as
quick as we can.
Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.
as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against
his spitless mouth.
SEAN
I've got the numbers.
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
Give me the degrees first, followed by
minutes and sec...
Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.
SEAN
Hello? Are you there??
No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.
as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva,
who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.
EVA
What's going on? I heard on the P.A.
system that...
WAYNE
(interrupting)
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz
is that Jason might be on board.
EVA
Jason...Voorhees?
She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne
nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva
rushes up to him again.
EVA
Have you seen Tamara?
WAYNE
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over
it.
EVA
But she might be in trouble...
WAYNE
So what else is new?
(beat)
Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude
to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise
up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
EVA
I don't care about being hip anymore.
She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.
WAYNE
I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.
He hurries on.
as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every
alcove.
EVA
Tamara?
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva
before she turns a corner and disappears.
(STEADICAM)
Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom.
She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings
open, unlocked.
EVA
Tamara?
(no response)
I just want to talk with you.
She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The
quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused
and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND
causes her to look back at:
THE BATHROOM DOOR
It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with
grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE
DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR
SRARDS.
EVA
shrieks, running back out the door...
...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING
AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a
bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.
RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)
Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she
flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral
staircase and running on.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
chasing after her with the smooth determination of a
shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.
Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way
through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races
past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."
ANGLE - JASON
--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in
the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.
The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune
precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the
corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward,
curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out
onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars
lighting system assaults her all directions along with
the music. She's all alone in here.
TIGHT ON EVA
The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her
terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing
to it. It's locked.
CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR
as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT
BEHIND HIM.
EVA
decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the
corridor again and:
JASON
appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The
spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's
gone.
EVA
backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor
like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror
balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the
point where she last saw him. But:
JASON
illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe
assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course
with him.
EVA
whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the
sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs,
PUSHING IN on her face.
EVA'S POINT OF VIEW
spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes
of Jason materializing where she least expects to see
him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of
exhaustion:
EVA
stops, looking everywhere.
EVA'S POINT OF VIEW
He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then
sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:
THE HOCKEY MASK
exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly
before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as
he grips her throat...
WIDE SHOT - DISCO
Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at
the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF
THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT
OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings
her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is
over.
where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes,
including Miles and Wayne.
JULIUS
I managed to scrounge this shit from
the game room and hallways. Grab what
you want.
Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.
WAYNE
What are you taking, Julius?
JULIUS
(flexes fists)
Nothin'.
WAYNE
(dead serious)
We're talking the possibility of Jason
Voorhees here.
Julius pauses. He's not stupid.
JULIUS
Nothin' but this gun.
He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they
move.
as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging
her door open.
RENNIE
Can't we at least talk about it?
MCCULLOCH
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous
notion that a ghoul is terrorizing
this ship.
RENNIE
But what about the drowning boy I've
been seeing?
He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering
her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room
now; he's in the hallway.
MCCULLOCH
Whatever you've been...imagining...
has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
(pause)
I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's
all I care about.
RENNIE
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle
Charles.
MCCULLOCH
This isn't a request.
He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key,
locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other
side.
RENNIE (O.S.)
Uncle Charles!
He ignores her, briskly walking away.
as she throws her fists against the door a final time,
realizing it's futile.
Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing
pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding
the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his
video camera to guide him.
WAYNE
J.J. -- you down here?
CLOSER ANGLE
as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the
precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares
the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.
INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)
--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down
through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.
WAYNE
lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his
bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself
to a standing position again.
WAYNE
We got a major problem, Wayne.
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than
crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily
forward.
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK
as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A
PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.
WAYNE
takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs
leading down to the next level. And when he arrives
there...
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A
KNIFE.
WAYNE
instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
...and the body goes down. He's hit him!
WAYNE
stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea,
looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to
adjust the eyepiece diaptor.
WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus,
finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER --
the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier.
He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set,
not a knife.
WAYNE
slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his
throat.
WAYNE
No...
He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will
reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.
WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS
FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then
the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES
DARK AND BLURRY.
WAYNE
screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips,
picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs.
Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over
something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an
ELECTRIC GUITAR.
ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET
Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a
blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.
TIGHT ON WAYNE
--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his
hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin
up through his scalp.
WAYNE
No no no...
REVERSE ANGLE
Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE
CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry
because
JASON
hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:
THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)
which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS
AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.
as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume
normal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational
chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's
computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
What was that??
SEAN
(very worried)
I don't know.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(trying not to panic)
What happens if we don't get control
of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell
me the truth.
SEAN
(beat)
We could hit a reef, collide with
another ship...we could be out here
for weeks before anybody spotted us.
They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch
storms onto the bridge.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Did you find Rennie?
MCCULLOCH
She's locked safe in her room, no
thanks to either of you.
(like Sean isn't even in the
room)
Has he brought it back on course yet?
Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the
wall of components.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
MCCULLOCH
He's the son of the Captain, for
Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able
to operate this thing!
Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind
and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of
Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He
checks the Omega and LORAN.
MCCULLOCH
Well?
Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm.
His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the
wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of
buttons on the console.
CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS
We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM -
DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera
continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on
the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring
at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over
his shoulder.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
Wayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING
THROUGH THE ROOM.
as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle
switches.
INSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER
as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light
illuminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.
RETURN TO SHOT
SEAN
It worked...we're back on course!
Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van
Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time
later:
TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON
Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...
...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel.
The blood drains from Sean's face.
MCCULLOCH
What's that?
SEAN
The fire alarm...
VARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT
as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways
and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep
pause for thought.
as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody
else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window,
working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip
on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE
IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he
hurries off.
as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY
FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.
MCCULLOCH
Can you shut that damn thing off??
Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around
for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees
McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
We already thought of that -- nobody
could possibly see it in this storm...
MCCULIACH
There's only one person who needs to
see it. And I'm going to find him.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
What about the fire??
MCCULLOCH
I doubt very much that one even
exists.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
What are you talking about?
MCCULLOCH
Use some common sense! Setting off a
fire alarm causes panic...the same
kind of panic caused by suggesting
Jason Voorhees is on board.
(resolved)
Enough is enough.
He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill
switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He
grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van
Deusen.
SEAN
We have to get everybody together just
in case the fire's for real.
Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.
Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading
dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel
pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads:
DANGER - FUEL TANKS.
as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming
that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face;
she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER
...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:
YOUNG JASON (O.S.)
Hhhhelp....me....
Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:
YOUNG JASON (EFX)
...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his
hands reaching out to her. But then comes the
inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND
JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her
room, choking on murky water.
YOUNG JASON
Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
RENNIE
stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a
magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a
deep lake, and extends her arms to him.
YOUNG JASON
grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.
RENNIE
feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her
eyes expanding because she's now looking at:
HERSELF!
Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger
in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.
YOUNG RENNIE
Hhhhelp....me....
RENNIE
screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself,
watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.
YOUNG RENNIE
disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds
later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.
NEW ANGLE
as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face,
utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her
porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH
THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles,
gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.
CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering
across her table like a spider.
TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON
Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the
porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the
circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.
CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But
Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object:
the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She
seizes it, getting a firm grip.
CLOSE ON JASON
as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP
INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason
instantly releases her, reeling backwards.
RENNIE
sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far
away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across
the room to her stateroom door just as:
THE DOOR
is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in
terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.
SEAN
Rennie...??
RENNIE
(pointing)
The window...
Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out,
seeing nothing. He steps back to her.
RENNIE
I don't understand what is happening
to me...
She breaks down; he holds her.
SEAN
It's gonna be okay...
...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are
lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning
down into the tank. A second later the whole thing
EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.
The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie
clings to him fearfully.
RENNIE
What is it??
One second later, the lights begin to flicker.
SEAN
The power room...
as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in
the hull.
as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's
some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun,
moving onward.
PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS
Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven,
spying on McCulloch.
MCCULLOCH
almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged
into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative.
He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them,
spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the
shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now,
clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.
Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room,
trying to think, talking to himself.
SEAN
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two,
assess the damage and act
accordingly...
RENNIE
Is the ship going to sink??
He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.
SEAN
I don't know.
Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face.
Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.
SEAN
The emergency lights just kicked in...
Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant
to convince himself as much as Rennie.
SEAN
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by
the lifeboats, just in case.
RENNIE
(terrified)
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
SEAN
But Rennie...
RENNIE
I'm not!!
as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are
panicking, sitting them down.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Everybody wait right here until I come
back with the others -- understand?
They nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying
us into a view of the dining room windows. No one
notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside
desk.
Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of
steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine
bearings begin to GRIND.
as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door,
cautiously entering with flare gun raised.
MCCULLOCH
Rennie??
MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW
The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered
across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up
to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his
attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to
something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.
MCCULLOCH
cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the
knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears
something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there.
McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few
seconds pass.
MCCULLOCH
Come on, answer!!
TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE
TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck
below through rain-streaked windows.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up
a trio of terrified seniors.
RETURN TO SHOT
Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches,
studying them.
INSERT - CONSOLE
In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the
words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic
safety cover, exposing the button.
A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow
corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end,
coughing on the black smoke which clouds their
passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are
standing in a puddle of water.
SEAN
Water has gotten to the engines.
(coughs)
We have to get everybody off this
ship...
INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON
as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:
A WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and
Rennie have no time to react because:
ANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)
A sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE
OF SEA WATER...
REVERSE ANGLE (EFX)
...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING
THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time
for her to witness:
WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)
which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out,
scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's
body washes past them.
as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling
up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a
corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch
pulls Rennie away from him.
MCCULLOCH
She never should've set foot on this
ship. This is your fault!
SEAN
This is Jason's fault!
MCCULLOCH
(shouting)
Not another word, do you hear me??
as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, RECOILING AT THE
SOUND OF A SNARLING DOG. Toby is curled up in the
corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared.
RENNIE
Toby...
She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog,
McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.
INSERT - HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)
as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.
Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with
McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:
A DARK FIGURE (TANK)
lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto
Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for
oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the
edge.
SEAN
It's Julius!
Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog.
Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar;
McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van
Deusen.
MCCULLOCH
(miserable)
If we don't find the shore soon we're
all going to die.
Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(unable to hide fear)
Do you know where we are, Sean?
Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment,
remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat
pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He
stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him,
seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his
shoulder.
JULIUS
Hey man, if I can make it, so can.
you.
Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean
and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one
more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his
coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship
for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)
They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,
illuminated in all its glory.
Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking
control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve,
his eyes never leaving the monument.
JULIUS
Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!
The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if
it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.
JULIUS
God damn, we're in New York! You did
it, my man!!
Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie
as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.
WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)
as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of
Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear
the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York,"
relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.
The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police
cars have no door handles in the back.
SEAN
There aren't any handles!!
Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts
hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just
as:
JASON
appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT
TOWARDS THE CAR.
There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition
and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON
THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto
the floorboards.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set
her target. We come straight at the abominable creature
and:
WHAM! (EFX)
Jason is mowed down.
RENNIE
slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT
AGAIN.
CLOSE ON JASON (EFX)
as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.
RENNIE
stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A
HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath,
looking out the front window...
THEIR POINT OF VIEW
Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He
SLOWLY STANDS.
RENNIE
desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the
wheel and RACING FORWARD.
POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)
Jason's standing there for one second, but the next
moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY...
as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into
reverse...
slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into
reverse.
CLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT)
as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally
gripping pavement.
POINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE)
as we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!!
TIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR
--Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason
is in back of them.
TIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT)
as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly
rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of
frame.
Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around
the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the
floorboard.
MCCULLOCH
Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!
She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her
eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks
too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO
SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping
wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.
A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across
its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN,
not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The
rowboat glides across the surface of the burning
gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt
SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.
RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY
Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it.
The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG
RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an
innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the
water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.
YOUNG RENNIE
What a beautiful day.
MCCULLOCH
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
She frowns at him, looking away.
MCCULLOCH
You've been coming out here every
summer for the last three years, young
lady, and you still haven't learned
how.
YOUNG RENNIE
I'll take some lessons this time. I
promise.
She bends over, splashing the water.
MCCULLOCH
That's what you said last year. I
think the time for your first swimming
lesson has just come.
The splashing stops.
MCCULLOCH
You don't want to end up drowning like
that Voorhees boy, do you?
She's instantly tense.
MCCULLOCH
He never learned how either and he's
still at the bottom of this lake.
YOUNG RENNIE
He is not.
MCCULLOCH
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull
down anybody who falls in and can't
swim.
YOUNG RENNIE
You're telling a lie.
MCCULLOCH
Am I? Let's find out.
...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH
PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.
SPLASH!
as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface.
She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly
leans over the edge.
MCCULLOCH
Better swim before Jason drags you
down, Rennie. Come on, you can do
it...
...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep
from sinking under the surface.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her
eyes.
YOUNG RENNIE
I...I can't...
MCCULLOCH
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
RENNIE
is too panicked to obey.
YOUNG RENNIE
Hhhhelp...me....
She coughs on some water then disappears...
UNDERWATER (TANK)
The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water
taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)
Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her
down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:
DISSOLVE BACK TO:
as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us.
Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open
the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.
Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few
scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall
at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)
as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions
grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering
terror as we plow right through them.
ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)
Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling
under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting
at them.
TICKET TAKER
Hey!
The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH
THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM
WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts
speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.
as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit,
SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking
too long to get there.
SEAN
Come on...
...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and
snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He
treads toward them and:
DOG TOBY
leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's
throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just
as:
THE SUBWAY TRAIN
streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:
JASON
heaves the dog in front of the train.
RENNIE
shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just
as the train roars by.
ANGLE - ONLOOKERS
They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach
this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe
SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train,
quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in
action.
SEAN
makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the
platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention
to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no
choice but to board the front car.
as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The
TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason
making the improper entry.
TRAIN ENGINEER
Hey pal, you can't do that...
A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too
late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD
INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.
INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE
as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...
as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the
end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and
entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.
as the train thunders through the station without
stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.
--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another
connecting door. We storm our way through it into the
next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower
away from us.
as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of
slowing down.
as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating
doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last
car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite
end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart
around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR
IT.
The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the
rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.
as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks
toward the light of the next station, running out of
strength.
as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the
pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself
when:
JASON
fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle.
Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages
to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle.
Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as
Rennie watches helplessly.
RENNIE
NO!!!
RENNIE
runs straight towards the track pit like a football
punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON
SQUARELY IN THE FACE.
JASON (EFX)
trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL,
RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and
convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be
terminated!!!
ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE
as they get to their feet, holding each other tight,
looking down on the now-dead undead creature.
filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough,
redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands
behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The
front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and
Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.
SEAN
(out of breath)
You have to call the police...
RENNIE
Please, hurry...
A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.
WAITRESS
There's a pay phone in back.
They start to run.
WAITRESS
...but it's broken.
RENNIE
You don't understand -- there's a
maniac trying to kill us!!!
WAITRESS
(blase)
Welcome to New York.
There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES
THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS
THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress
eyes Jason with complete disbelief.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS
HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.
THE WAITRESS
picks up the telephone, really pissed off.
A BIKER
climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE
KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS
JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it
out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing
away.
THE WAITRESS
stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.
JASON
lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO
THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.
THE WAITRESS
feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her
mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as
she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out
the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons
shrink from him.
as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains,
finally getting the back door open and springing into:
as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting
of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of
stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and
Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing
deeper into the labyrinth.
ANGLE UP STAIRS
as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is
eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.
An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness.
Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery
rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end,
wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.
TRACKING SHOT
as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace,
strangers in a very strange land.
ANGLE - THEIR FEET
sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's
foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT.
A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of
the container, sizzling on the around.
SEAN AND RENNIE
carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it
another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE,
GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through
the tunnel.
REVERSE ANGLE
...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers
the wrench, as frightened as they are.
SANITATION ENGINEER
What the hell are you kids doing down
here?
SEAN
Can you help us get out??
SANITATION ENGINEER
I sure can and we don't have a minute
to waste.
He begins quickly packing up his tools.
SEAN
What do you mean?
SANITATION ENGINEER
Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods
out with the stuff on the 13th of
every month, right at midnight.
(checks watch)
And that's less than ten minutes from
now.
Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions,
swallowing hard.
SANITATION ENGINEER
Follow me.
He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly
leads them down:
...no less threatening than the one they just left. When
they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS
HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND
SEAN.
THE FLASHLIGHT
rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically
across the polluted walls.
THE SANITATION ENGINEER
begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the
monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL
#3.
RENNIE
tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the
opposite wall, barely conscious.
SEAN
Run, Rennie...
She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel
#3, seeing:
A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL
Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it
over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.
RENNIE
backs away but does not run. The time has come to face
her fears.
ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL
as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him
off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated
tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for
Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench
over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is
SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning
directly into it.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's
flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in
the reflective wet surroundings.
RENNIE
You never got me in the lake, Jason.
And you're not going to get me now
either.
Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the
irritating light never leaving us.
JASON
has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down
the intersecting tunnel (#1).
TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET
stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's
wanted to kill Rennie most of all.
as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean
tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to
crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but
still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.
He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling
after his fix.
INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM
as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately
causing it to cave in.
--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into
Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie
flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second
later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...
TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)
and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE,
SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if
her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank
buckshot.
RENNIE
drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.
CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)
as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the
plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT
CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS
HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the
chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his
eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs
frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just
broke, running down his face.
CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT
as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE
TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning
sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and
RUNS.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH
HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward
Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come
around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way
ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.
as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him,
shaking hard.
RENNIE
Get up, Sean!!!
His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable
terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING
SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the
direction of her planned retreat:
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the
unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at
leaps and bounds.
TIGHT ON RENNIE
as her trembling chin rises, looking at:
ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)
The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from
the approaching flood.
RENNIE
rotates her head and sees:
JASON
vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her
relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell
and high water.
RENNIE
drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed
woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to
the intersecting alcove wall.
RENNIE
(screaming)
Climb!!!
She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning
everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare
back down the tunnel...
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake
has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her
vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING
FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms
like the claws of a roto-tiller.
ANGLE - LADDER
as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:
JASON
within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder
like he's working on some kind of radar.
RENNIE
slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and
rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the
tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as
she sees:
A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into
the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING
STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.
JASON
has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and
smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His
decomposed head swivels to face:
Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in
seconds.
JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)
He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses
already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE
FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF
AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:
JASON
Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN,
MOMMY...
Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT
as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We
sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into
our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS
STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS
DROWNING IN IT.
YOUNG JASON
Hhhhelp me....
A split second later:
The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches
below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking
their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with
their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.
We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over
and under us.
