      SQUARE) - DAY 1. UK/FR.

      MERLIN and ARTHUR look down into the Main Square. MERLIN s 
      impressed, ARTHUR less so.

                                  MERLIN
                    Did you see that?

                                  ARTHUR
                    It s a man throwing some sticks in 
                    the air.

      MERLIN takes in ARTHUR s mood.

                                  MERLIN
                    What s wrong?

      ARTHUR pulls a face...

                                  MERLIN
                    It s the anniversary of your birth. 
                    A huge feast is being held in your 
                    honour. You have dancers, jugglers 
                    and acrobats to entertain you. It 
                    must be a terrible burden. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Perhaps I m just less easily 
                    impressed than you, Merlin.

                                  MERLIN
                    I m really looking forward to it.

                                  ARTHUR
                    That s because you have the mind of 
                    a child.

      ARTHUR heads out.

                                  MERLIN
                          (to himself)
                    And yet I m still more intelligent 
                    than you.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     1A.


      ARTHUR doesn t look round as he calls out...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I heard that.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Two ACROBATS have set up a circular board, divided into 
      brightly coloured segments. 

      THE GLEEMAN passes through the Banquet Hall, casting a 
      critical eye over the preparations, checking everything is as 
      it should be. 

      Suddenly, behind him we hear a crash - THE GLEEMAN turns to 
      see a chest full of juggling batons spill out over the floor.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Careful gentlemen. Careful.

      The JUGGLERS pick up their batons.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    There is no room for error. We must 
                    strive for perfection in all that 
                    we do. For tonight, we entertain 
                    royalty.

      He hears a sound and looks round to see objects flying out 
      of a deep trunk.                             MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     3.


      THE GLEEMAN clears his throat. A head appears, peering out 
      over the rim of the trunk. This is GELDRED.   

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Have you misplaced something 
                    Geldred?

      GELDRED leaps from the trunk. We now see he is a dwarf.

                                    GELDRED
                    Our special gift for the Prince. 
                    I cannot find it anywhere. It is 
                    lost.

      GELDRED starts to search a sack, causing more mess...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                      Geldred...

      GELDRED continues his search. He stops as he feels a hand 
      on his shoulder. He looks up to see THE GLEEMAN fixing him 
      with a piercing stare. It is suddenly apparent that THE 
      GLEEMAN is a man to be feared. He pulls slim box from his 
      tunic...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    I took the liberty of ensuring 
                    their safe passage myself. King 
                    Odin has gone to such trouble to 
                    arrange our little surprise. We 
                    would not want to disappoint him.

      THE GLEEMAN opens the box to reveal three sharp throwing 
      daggers...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    We must make sure this is a 
                      celebration that the young Prince 
                    will never forget. 

      The GLEEMAN throws one of the knives through the air. It 
      pierces the centre of the board with terrifying precision. 

      TITLES



      MERLIN and ARTHUR exit Arthur s chambers and make their way 
      down the corridor. They meet GWEN...

                                  GWEN
                    Arthur.

                                  ARTHUR
                      Guinevere.                            MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     4.


                                  GWEN
                    I m glad we have met. I wanted to 
                    give you my best wishes for your 
                    special day. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Thank you. That s very kind.

                                  GWEN
                    You must be so looking forward to 
                    the carnival?

      ARTHUR hesitates, then...

                                  ARTHUR
                      Absolutely. More than I can say.

      MERLIN s outraged as he takes in ARTHUR s volte-face.

                                  GWEN
                    I should get on.

      ARTHUR and GWEN share an affectionate smile as she heads 
      off. ARTHUR stares after her with puppy dog eyes. His 
      expression changes as he sees MERLIN smirking...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Shut up, Merlin.

                                  MERLIN
                    It s sweet. How you are with 
                    Gwen. You re like... you re like 
                    a little puppy. 

      ARTHUR doesn t appreciate the analogy.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Really? Have you ever seen a 
                    little puppy do this...?

      ARTHUR clips MERLIN round the head...

                                  MERLIN
                    Ouh!

      ARTHUR clips MERLIN round the head again. MERLIN s 
      outraged.

                                  MERLIN
                    What was that for?

                                  ARTHUR
                    That was for what you said 
                    earlier.

      MERLIN goes to respond. ARTHUR clips him round the head 
      before he can speak. MERLIN s speechless.                            MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     5.


                                  ARTHUR
                    And that, is for what you were 
                    about to say.

      ARTHUR heads off, leaving MERLIN disgruntled, rubbing his 
      sore ear.

                                  MERLIN
                          (to himself)
                    A little puppy with the brains of 
                    a donkey.

      ARTHUR calls out without looking back...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Heard it.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      UTHER appears weak and withdrawn. Reveal ARTHUR seated by 
      him. ARTHUR takes a moment as he takes in UTHER s vacant 
      expression, then launches into his usual routine...

                                  ARTHUR
                    The Court discussed the annual 
                    levy this morning. The council 
                    has suggested we raise it. I feel 
                    the people are already over-
                      burdened...

                                  UTHER
                    We should not talk about matters 
                    of court today.

      ARTHUR s surprised by UTHER s response. UTHER fixes ARTHUR 
      with an emotional look. ARTHUR s increasingly concerned...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Father?

      UTHER smiles softly...

                                  UTHER
                    You think I could ever forget 
                    that today is the anniversary of 
                    your birth?

      ARTHUR s both relieved and touched. UTHER pulls out a small 
      box, holds it out to ARTHUR, gestures for him to take it. 
      ARTHUR takes the box, opens it and pulls out a beautiful 
      ring. 

                                  UTHER
                    It was your grandfather s.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     5A.


      ARTHUR s moved...                             MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     6.


                                  ARTHUR
                    I shall treasure it. Thank you.

                                  UTHER
                    Despite what you all think, I 
                    haven t completely lost my mind. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    No one thinks that. Least of all 
                    me.

      UTHER s touched...

                                  UTHER
                    You are a good son Arthur... I 
                    take it a suitable celebration 
                    has been arranged for this 
                    evening?

                                  ARTHUR
                    A feast, and some entertainment. 
                    I will tell you all about it 
                    tomorrow.

                                  UTHER
                    Nonsense. You think I would miss 
                    my son s anniversary? 

      ARTHUR s surprised and touched...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Are you sure you feel strong 
                    enough?

                                  UTHER
                    Nothing would stop me.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR and GAIUS are talking by the guards outside the door 
      to Uther s chambers. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    He seems much better. This will 
                    be the first time he has left his 
                    chambers in months.

                                  GAIUS
                    We must be cautious. I have seen 
                    cases like your father s before. 
                    Periods of lucidity are not 
                    uncommon, but I have to warn you. 
                    It may not last.

      ARTHUR takes this in, but remains positive.                             MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     7.


                                  ARTHUR
                    No. I m sure this is the start of 
                    his recovery. He will soon be his 
                    old self. 

      GAIUS smiles, letting ARTHUR enjoy the moment.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The Banquet Hall is packed. KNIGHTS and COURTIERS are 
      tucking into a feast.                             MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     8.




      A blast of trumpets. Everyone looks toward the doors. For a 
      moment, nothing happens. The tension builds. Suddenly, the 
      doors are thrown open and ACROBATS back flip through them. 
      DANCERS and JUGGLERS follow behind, and suddenly the Hall 
      is filled with entertainment... 

      Everyone s enjoying the show, wowed by the skills of the 
      PERFORMERS. ARTHUR takes in UTHER smiling, and then 
      applauding. He catches his eye. UTHER raises his goblet. 
      ARTHUR returns the gesture with a smile. He s thrilled to 
      see his father in such good spirits...

      In the midst of the PERFORMERS, stands THE GLEEMAN. He 
      raises his arms and signals. The PERFORMERS freeze. All 
      eyes focus on THE GLEEMAN as a hush descends over the Hall.  

      With a flourish, THE GLEEMAN pulls a brightly coloured 
      cover from the large circular board. A ripple of excitement 
      as the CROWD realise what s happening...

                                  UTHER
                    Knife throwing. Excellent.

      THE GLEEMAN looks out over the Hall.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    We will require a volunteer...

      THE GLEEMAN s eyes travel the Hall, before settling on 
      ARTHUR...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Prince Arthur. What better and 
                    more fitting occasion to 
                      demonstrate your legendary 
                    bravery. 

      ARTHUR s caught out, put on the spot.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Do you accept the challenge?

      ARTHUR feels the eyes of the COURTIERS and KNIGHTS awaiting 
      his decision. ARTHUR stands...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Of course.

      There s a round of applause as ARTHUR makes his way through 
      the Hall. MERLIN intercepts ARTHUR. They have a whispered 
      exchange...

                                  MERLIN
                    Is this safe...?                            MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     9.


                                  ARTHUR
                    It s knife throwing, Merlin. Of 
                    course it s not safe. I could 
                    hardly refuse his challenge.

      ARTHUR sees that the eyes of the entire room are upon them 
      and starts emptying his pockets, giving the contents to 
      MERLIN, making an excuse to cover the true nature of their 
      exchange... 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Just emptying my pockets. Try not 
                    to steal anything, Merlin.

      A ripple of laughter. MERLIN and ARTHUR s whispered 
      exchange continues...

                                  MERLIN
                    I just don t think it s a good 
                    idea to let someone strap you to 
                    a board and throw knives at you.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Perhaps I should have you take my 
                    place?

      MERLIN doesn t relish the prospect, looks out at the 
      expectant CROWD, then back at ARTHUR...

                                  MERLIN
                    I think they want you to do it.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Your bravery never ceases to 
                    impress me, Merlin.

      ARTHUR heads over to the circular board where THE GLEEMAN 
      waits for him. He catches GWEN s eye. She looks concerned. 
      ARTHUR smiles, reassuring. THE GLEEMAN gestures for ARTHUR 
      to place himself against the board...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Sire. If you will...?

      ARTHUR places himself against the board. DANCERS strap 
      ARTHUR s ankles and wrists to the restraints on the board. 
      ARTHUR shoots a slightly nervous glance at THE GLEEMAN.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Do not fear, my Lord. I never 
                    miss my target.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Good. Glad to hear it.

      With a flourish, THE GLEEMAN whips an apple from his robes 
      and holds it up to the CROWD. THE GLEEMAN turns to 
      ARTHUR...                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     10.


                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    May I?

                                  ARTHUR
                    What?

      Before ARTHUR can object, THE GLEEMAN places the apple in 
      ARTHUR s mouth. THE GLEEMAN nods to one of the DANCERS. She 
      gives the wheel a push and it starts to spin...  

      ARTHUR spins on the board. It makes him feel dizzy, and a 
      little nauseous. A faint groan escapes his lips, muffled by 
      the apple stuffed in his mouth...

      GELDRED presents the case of knives to THE GLEEMAN. He 
      takes one out, touches his finger to the tip, then 
        demonstrates the blades sharpness by slicing off the top of 
      GELDRED s hat. 

      On ARTHUR s eyes, a flash of fear at the demonstration.

      Looking on, MERLIN is also concerned.

      Without even stopping to take aim, THE GLEEMAN suddenly 
      turns and throws the knife at ARTHUR. It thuds into the 
      board, centimeters from ARTHUR s face. A huge gasp goes up, 
      followed by a round of applause.

      As he spins, ARTHUR eyes the knife warily...

      THE GLEEMAN takes the next knife from the case. The tension 
      builds, and suddenly THE GLEEMAN throws the knife. It flies 
      through the air and thuds into the board on the other side 
      of ARTHUR s head. Another round of applause.

      THE GLEEMAN takes the final knife from the case. Tension as 
      he takes aim...

      MERLIN looks on. He steps into the shadows, his eyes flash, 
      he s poised, ready to intervene magically...

      We go into MERLIN TIME as THE GLEEMAN throws the knife. It 
      spins through the air in slow motion...

      The knife sticks straight into the apple. On ARTHUR s eyes, 
      wide with fear. The hall erupts in applause.

      MERLIN stands down, breathes a huge sigh of relief.

      GWEN is equally relieved.

      The DANCERS release ARTHUR from the board as THE GLEEMAN 
      takes a bow. 

      ARTHUR grabs the handle of the knife, takes a bite of the 
      apple as he saunters back to his seat. He throws the knife 
      and apple to MERLIN, who catches them...                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     11.


                                  ARTHUR
                    See, Merlin. Nothing to worry 
                    about.

      THE GLEEMAN and GELDRED watch ARTHUR chewing the mouthful 
      of apple as he retakes his seat next to UTHER, who 
      congratulates him warmly. THE GLEEMAN has a quiet word with 
      GELDRED... 

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                          (an aside)
                    In a few hours, the sedative on 
                    the apple will start to take 
                    effect. The Prince will be 
                      defenceless. Then we will strike. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The door flies open. ARTHUR staggers in, followed by 
      MERLIN. The sedative is starting to take effect. ARTHUR s 
      very drowsy and unsteady on his feet...

                                  MERLIN
                    You re telling me you weren t 
                    even a little bit scared?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Of course I wasn t. I am a 
                    warrior. You learn to control 
                    your fear. To channel it...

      ARTHUR loses his balance, staggers. MERLIN catches him, 
      stops him from falling over...

                                  MERLIN
                    You looked scared...

      ARTHUR rights himself.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Then you are blind, as well as 
                    stupid, Merlin.

      ARTHUR lets out an enormous yawn as he starts to undress.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It was good to see my father 
                    enjoying himself.
                          (a worrying thought 
                            occurs)
                    He was a little quiet toward the 
                    end of the evening. Perhaps I 
                    should go and see him.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     12.


                                  MERLIN
                    Are you sure that s a good idea? 
                    You can barely stand up. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Are you saying I m drunk? 

                                  MERLIN
                    I m saying I really don t think 
                    you should be wandering around 
                    the palace.

                                  ARTHUR
                    And why is that, Merlin?

                                  MERLIN
                    Because you re not wearing 
                    trousers.

      ARTHUR looks down and sees that he is indeed not wearing 
      trousers, then looks back at MERLIN...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Good point.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR emerges from his chambers, fastening his trousers, 
      which he finds rather difficult. He heads off down the 
      corridor, bouncing off the walls, struggling to keep his 
      eyes open. MERLIN looks after him with concern... 

                                  MERLIN
                    Are you sure you re okay?

                                  ARTHUR
                    I ll be fine, Merlin. Get some 
                    beauty sleep. 

      MERLIN pulls a face as ARTHUR rounds the corner and 
      disappears from view...

                                  MERLIN
                    Watch out for the steps!

      We hear a loud crash O/S. MERLIN smiles to himself, then 
      heads off in the opposite direction... 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      ARTHUR wobbles down the corridor.                           MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     13.


      We now see THE GLEEMAN is wedged onto the ceiling, braced 
      between the two walls. THE GLEEMAN watches ARTHUR disappear 
      round the corner, then drops silently to the floor. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR lets out an enormous yawn, struggling to keep his eyes 
      open as he passes the two GUARDS outside the doors to Uther s 
      chambers. He heads inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      UTHER lies in bed, sleeping peacefully. ARTHUR looks down 
      at him. His eyes start to close as the sedative takes hold. 
      He wobbles on his feet. ARTHUR forces his eyes open, slaps 
      his face. But this only gives him a moments reprieve. He 
      sinks into a chair. He fights the tiredness he feels 
      sweeping over him, but it s a losing battle. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The two GUARDS standing outside Uther s chambers suddenly 
      react as they see THE GLEEMAN standing in front of them - 
      surprised he was able to get so close without them 
      noticing...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Good evening, gentlemen.

      Before the GUARDS can challenge him, we see a glint of a 
      blade in each of THE GLEEMAN s hands. He dispatches the 
      GUARDS in two swift but deadly moves.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR is drifting into sleep, struggling to focus on 
      UTHER. His head lolls. He jerks himself awake. ARTHUR hears 
      a faint sound, but he is too tired to react to it. Behind 
      ARTHUR, we see the door open. THE GLEEMAN slips into the 
      room. ARTHUR s oblivious...

      THE GLEEMAN creeps toward ARTHUR. He draws a sword from his 
      robes just as ARTHUR s head jerks up. ARTHUR catches a 
      flash as the blade catches the candle light. ARTHUR draws 
      his sword and parries the blow as THE GLEEMAN strikes. 
      ARTHUR spills out of the chair and staggers backwards.                           MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     14.


      He s sleepy and disorientated, tries to call out, but his 
      voice is weak...

                                  ARTHUR
                      Guards...!

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    They will be of no help to you. I 
                    imagine you are feeling rather 
                    sleepy by now?

      THE GLEEMAN attacks. ARTHUR barely manages to fight off the 
      attack. His sword is knocked out of his hand and thrown 
      across the room. ARTHUR collapses to his knees. He tries to 
      call out, but barely manages a mumble...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Father...

      THE GLEEMAN stands over ARTHUR.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    It is a shame that Odin will not 
                    be here to witness your death. I 
                    will enjoy telling him how you 
                    died, kneeling before me. 

      THE GLEEMAN raises his sword, ready to strike. 

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Goodbye, Arthur Pendragon.

      ARTHUR is powerless, fears this is the end. But as THE 
      GLEEMAN strikes, the blow is blocked by a sword. ARTHUR and 
      THE GLEEMAN see UTHER standing there, Arthur s sword in his 
      hand...

                                  UTHER
                    It will take more than a coward 
                    like you to kill my son.

      THE GLEEMAN strikes. UTHER blocks the blow. They trade a 
      series of ferocious blows. But THE GLEEMAN is skilled and 
      UTHER rusty. UTHER is beaten back, and only narrowly avoids 
      being killed.

      ARTHUR tries to get to his feet to go to UTHER s aid, but 
      he s too drowsy, collapses back on the floor.

      UTHER and THE GLEEMAN circle each other, preparing to 
      strike...

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    They say you have lost your mind. 
                    How does it feel, to know your 
                    people laugh at you?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     15.


      Enraged, UTHER attacks, but THE GLEEMAN easily deflects the 
      blows.

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Uther Pendragon. The great King. 
                    Look at you. A broken man.

      UTHER attacks, and again THE GLEEMAN easily deflects the 
      blows. He s cruelly toying with UTHER, taunting him.  

                                  THE GLEEMAN
                    Is there anything you d like to 
                    say to your son before I kill 
                    him?

      UTHER looks at ARTHUR, kneeling, helpless. UTHER s paternal 
      instincts kick in. He attacks with a new ferocity, taking 
      THE GLEEMAN by surprise. UTHER rains blow after blow down 
      on THE GLEEMAN, forcing him back. THE GLEEMAN s sword is 
      knocked from his hand. UTHER prepares to deliver a fatal 
      blow... 

                                  UTHER
                    I will send Odin your head as a 
                    gift.

      THE GLEEMAN suddenly draws a knife, lunges at UTHER. UTHER 
      thrusts his sword. THE GLEEMAN s expression changes as he s 
      impaled. He staggers backwards, collapses and dies. 

      ARTHUR looks on, hugely relieved. But UTHER doesn t 
      respond. He looks weak and confused. His legs buckle. He 
      sinks to the floor, sitting against the bed. ARTHUR 
      realises something is very wrong.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Father!

      UTHER pulls the bloody dagger from his robes, from where 
      THE GLEEMAN thrust it into his chest. ARTHUR forces himself 
      to his feet, staggers over to UTHER and drops to his knees 
      beside him. ARTHUR s horrified to see blood staining 
      UTHER s robes. Both ARTHUR and UTHER have to fight to stay 
      conscious.

                                  ARTHUR
                    No... Guards!... I will get 
                    help...

      ARTHUR goes to stand. UTHER grabs his hand...

                                  UTHER
                    Stay with me...

                                  ARTHUR
                          (to Uther)
                    I m here... 
                                  (MORE)                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     16.

                                  ARTHUR (cont'd)
                          (beat, calling out)
                    Guards! Someone! We need help!

                                  UTHER
                    It is my time...

                                  ARTHUR
                    No... You can t die...

                                  UTHER
                    I know you will make me proud, as 
                    you always have. You will be a 
                    great King...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I m not ready...

                                  UTHER
                    You have been ready for some 
                    time, Arthur...

                                  ARTHUR
                    No. I need you...

                                  UTHER
                    I know I wasn t always a good 
                    father. I put my duty to Camelot 
                    first. I m sorry.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Don t say that...

      UTHER grips ARTHUR s hand with all his remaining strength.

                                  UTHER
                    Know one thing. I always loved 
                    you, Arthur...

      With that, UTHER s eyes slowly close as he loses 
      consciousness. ARTHUR s horrified...

                                  ARTHUR
                    No... Father... Father!

      ARTHUR s appalled, but barely able to focus.

                                  ARTHUR
                    No...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      GAIUS is tending to UTHER. He s unconscious, very weak - 
      close to death. ARTHUR and GWEN look on, deeply concerned. 
      ARTHUR fixes GAIUS with a desperate look...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Gaius. Can you treat him?

                                  GAIUS
                    The knife pierced an artery. He 
                    is bleeding internally.

                                  ARTHUR
                    There must be something... there 
                    must be something you can do. 
                    Please, Gaius.

      GAIUS shakes his head.

                                  GAIUS
                    It is just a matter of time. I am 
                    sorry, Arthur.

      ARTHUR prepares himself for the worst.

                                  ARTHUR
                    How long - how long has he got?

                                  GAIUS
                    I fear he will not last more than 
                    two days. 

      ARTHUR can t accept that.

                                  ARTHUR
                    No...

      GWEN comforts ARTHUR...

                                  GWEN
                    I m sorry.

      As GWEN holds him, ARTHUR stares at UTHER, struggling to 
      accept that he is going to die.  

                                                                          CUT TO:



      SIR LEON and AGRAVAINE are reporting to ARTHUR, who just 
      stares blankly, traumatised...

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    We have traced the assassin back 
                    to the town of Wenham. It is in 
                    Odin s land. 
                                  (MORE)                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     18.

                                  AGRAVAINE (cont'd)
                    It seems Odin hired him to kill 
                    you, in revenge for the death of 
                    his son.

      ARTHUR barely responds as he takes this in.

                                  SIR LEON
                    We believe he had an accomplice 
                    among the performers, but he has 
                    fled the city. We have doubled 
                    the guard, should there be 
                    another attempt on your life.

      Again, ARTHUR barely responds. AGRAVAINE takes in ARTHUR s 
      despondent mood. He places a comforting hand on ARTHUR s 
      shoulder...

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Our thoughts are with you, 
                    Arthur. If there s anything I can 
                    do at this difficult time, you 
                    have only to ask.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Your support means a great deal 
                    to me. Thank you.

      AGRAVAINE and SIR LEON head out, passing MERLIN as he 
      enters. ARTHUR immediately responds to MERLIN s arrival... 

                                  ARTHUR
                          (to MERLIN)
                    What news of my father?

                                  MERLIN
                    There s no change.

      ARTHUR snaps.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why isn t Gaius doing something?

      MERLIN treads softly...

                                  MERLIN
                    Because there s nothing he can 
                    do.

      ARTHUR knows that s true, and that is what pains him. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      AGRAVAINE bursts through the door, taking MORGANA by 
      surprise. She instinctively spins, drawing a dagger and 
      stands poised, ready to plunge it into AGRAVAINE. He gives 
      a sly smile...

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Is that any way to greet an old 
                      friend...?

      MORGANA lowers the dagger.

                                    MORGANA
                    I wasn t expecting you today...

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    I had to see you. I bring good 
                    news. Better news than we could 
                    ever have hoped for.

      MORGANA reacts, curious.

                                    MORGANA
                    What is it?

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Uther has been mortally wounded. 
                    He lies on his deathbed. Gaius 
                    says he only has days to live.

      MORGANA smiles.

                                    MORGANA
                    I hope the image of my face haunts 
                    him. 
                          (a sudden thought occurs)
                    How is Arthur?

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    He is devastated. The poor boy can 
                    barely think straight.

      MORGANA smiles at this news.

                                    MORGANA
                    We must strike while he is 
                      vulnerable. 

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    When Uther dies, the Kingdom will 
                    be weak. We must choose our moment 
                      carefully. Who knows what 
                      opportunities the coming weeks will 
                    bring.                            MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     20.


      They share a smile.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR holds a vigil beside UTHER s bed. He just sits 
      there, staring at UTHER intensely. GWEN enters. She stops 
      as she sees ARTHUR, doesn t want to intrude.

                                  GWEN
                    I was going to change the 
                    dressing on your father s wound. 
                    I ll come back.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It s all right. Come in.

      GWEN crosses over to the bed. She changes the dressing on 
      UTHER s wound through the following. GWEN and ARTHUR catch 
      each others eye a few times, but given the circumstances, 
      they are unsure what to say to each other. ARTHUR makes the 
      first move.

                                  ARTHUR
                      I appreciate your kindness, 
                      everything you are doing for him.

                                  GWEN
                    I do it for you.

      ARTHUR s touched. It tips him over the edge. He turns away 
      from GWEN to prevent her seeing how upset he is...

                                  GWEN
                    Arthur?

      She turns his face and is pained to see his hurt...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I cannot see him die... Without 
                    him, I have no one.

      GWEN seizes ARTHUR s hand.

                                  GWEN
                    You have many friends. And you 
                    have me. I will always be here 
                    for you.

      ARTHUR looks pained.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It is not the same... he s my 
                    father. There is still so much I 
                    want to say to him... He cannot 
                    die.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     21.


      ARTHUR stands and hurries out...

                                  GWEN
                    Arthur. Please...

      ARTHUR exits, leaving GWEN deeply concerned for him.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      SQUARE) - NIGHT 2. UK/FR.

      TOWNSPEOPLE hold a candle-lit vigil in the Main Square. 
      MERLIN stands at the window, staring down at them. ARTHUR 
      enters, crosses over and looks out of the window...

                                  ARTHUR
                    What s going on?

                                  MERLIN
                    It is a vigil for your Father. 
                    The people wish to share their 
                    grief.  

      ARTHUR frowns, unsettled...  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why are they behaving like my 
                    father is already dead? There is 
                    still life in his body...

                                  MERLIN
                    They re preparing themselves for 
                    the worst.

      ARTHUR steels himself.

                                  ARTHUR
                    They can give up hope, but I will 
                    not.

                                  MERLIN
                    I know it s hard to accept. I 
                    wish it wasn t so, but there is 
                    nothing more that can be done.

      ARTHUR looks thoughtful, then...

                                  ARTHUR
                    There is a way to heal my father. 

                                  MERLIN
                    How?

      ARTHUR hesitates, then fixes MERLIN with a poignant look.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     22.


                                  ARTHUR
                    With magic.

      MERLIN s stunned as he takes this in.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      MERLIN has just informed GAIUS of ARTHUR s plan. GAIUS 
      looks concerned.

                                  GAIUS
                    Arthur plans to use magic?

                                  MERLIN
                    He s desperate. He knows it s the 
                    only hope he has of healing 
                    Uther.

      GAIUS takes a moment to process the revelation, then fixes 
      MERLIN with a look.

                                  GAIUS
                    Please tell me you re not 
                    thinking of doing this, Merlin.

                                  MERLIN
                    I d be lying if I said  no .

                                  GAIUS
                    You can t risk exposing yourself 
                    like this. It s too dangerous.  

                                  MERLIN
                    Arthur didn t recognise me last 
                    time I was eighty years old. 
                    There s no reason why he should 
                    this time.

                                  GAIUS
                    You seem to be forgetting that 
                    last time you used an ageing 
                    spell, you nearly got yourself 
                    burnt at the stake.

                                  MERLIN
                    It s worth the risk.

                                  GAIUS
                    You think Uther will thank you 
                    for healing him with magic? He ll 
                    most likely have you hanged.

                                  MERLIN
                    Uther will never change his 
                    attitude to magic. I know that. 
                                  (MORE)                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     23.

                                  MERLIN (cont'd)
                    But if Arthur allows it to be 
                    used to heal his father, his 
                    attitude will be changed forever. 
                    He will see that magic can be a 
                    force for good.

                                  GAIUS
                    You of all people should know 
                    that using such powerful magic is 
                    fraught with dangers. 

                                  MERLIN
                    If it works, I won t have to hide 
                    any more. Arthur will come to 
                    trust me for who I really am.

                                  GAIUS
                    And if it doesn t? I cannot stand 
                    by and let you do this Merlin.

                                  MERLIN
                    Don t try and stop me, because you 
                    can t.

      Tension GAIUS and MERLIN trade a poignant look...

                                  GAIUS
                    You are playing a dangerous game, 
                    Merlin.

                                  MERLIN
                    I ve been playing a dangerous 
                    game since the first day I set 
                    foot in Camelot. Maybe this is my 
                    chance to change that.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      MERLIN enters. ARTHUR s waiting impatiently.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Well. What did Gaius say? Did he 
                    have any information?

                                  MERLIN
                    He didn t know much. But he has 
                    heard of a sorcerer. An old man. 
                    He lives in the Forest of 
                    Glaestig. Gaius thinks he may be 
                    able to help you. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Will he take me to him?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     24.


                                  MERLIN
                    He has told me all that he knows. 
                    We will have to find him 
                      ourselves.

      ARTHUR takes this in and is suddenly daunted by the 
      prospect of what he is about to do.

                                  ARTHUR
                    If you were me Merlin, if it was 
                    your father, would you use magic 
                    to save his life?

      MERLIN seizes the moment, looks ARTHUR in the eye.

                                  MERLIN
                    Yes. I would. I d do whatever it 
                    took.  

      ARTHUR s persuaded.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ready the horses and gather some 
                    supplies. We ride at first light.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      AGRAVAINE is staring out of the window. There s a knock on 
      the door.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Enter.

      The door opens. ARTHUR enters.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Arthur. What news of your father?

                                  ARTHUR
                    I m afraid there is still no 
                      improvement.   

      ARTHUR hesitates, unsure how to express what he needs to say. 
      AGRAVAINE detects ARTHUR s hesitation.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Is there something on your mind?

                                  ARTHUR
                    It will be apparent soon enough. I 
                    didn t want to go behind your back. 
                    I have decided to use magic to heal 
                    my father.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     25.


      AGRAVAINE s shocked - knows he must do what he can to 
      dissuade him.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    I must counsel against such a 
                    course of action.

                                  ARTHUR
                    There is no other way...

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Magic caused your mother s death. 
                    My sister would still be alive 
                    today. If you respect her memory, 
                    you cannot do this. 

      ARTHUR s moved by the argument. He s torn...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Would you see my father die?

      AGRAVAINE s put on the spot, but of course cannot reveal his 
      true desires...

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Perhaps it is his time.

      ARTHUR cannot accept that...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I know we have both suffered 
                    because of magic, but I cannot 
                    stand by and let my father die. My 
                    mind is made up. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The door opens. ARTHUR peers in.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Hello...?

      ARTHUR looks round the hut. There s no one there.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR pokes around at a few dusty old bottles and pots on 
      the table. In doing so, he knocks over a bottle, which in 
      turn knocks a pot off the table. It falls to the floor and 
      smashes. ARTHUR grimaces. Oops. He quickly kicks the pieces 
      of broken pottery under the table to conceal them. ARTHUR 
      hears a sound outside. Someone s approaching the hut. 
      ARTHUR steps away from the table.  

      ARTHUR tenses as the door opens. ARTHUR reacts, stunned as 
      OLD MERLIN enters...

                                  ARTHUR
                    You?

      OLD MERLIN looks back at ARTHUR...

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    We meet again, Arthur Pendragon.

      ARTHUR instinctively reaches for the hilt of his sword. OLD 
      MERLIN reacts to the move...

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    So you have come to kill me?

      ARTHUR eyes OLD MERLIN warily, uncertain how to proceed.

                                  ARTHUR
                    No. That wasn t my intention.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     29.


      OLD MERLIN hears a crunch as he steps on some broken pot. 
      He looks down at it. ARTHUR grimaces... 

                                  ARTHUR
                    I broke a pot.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    You always were a clumsy fool.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Excuse me?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    So if you haven t come to kill 
                    me, what is it that brings you 
                    here? I take it you didn t come 
                    all this way just to smash my 
                    pot?

                                  ARTHUR
                    If I d known who you were, I would 
                    not have come at all. 

      Seeing how difficult this is for ARTHUR, OLD MERLIN helps him 
      out.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I thought you may have come to 
                    ask me to use magic to heal your 
                    father?

      ARTHUR s taken aback.

                                  ARTHUR
                    How did you know?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I know more than you could 
                    possibly comprehend.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Given your hatred for my father and 
                    all that he stands for, I have 
                    clearly had a wasted journey.  

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Do not suppose that you know my 
                    mind. 

      ARTHUR fixes OLD MERLIN with a desperate look.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Will you help me?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    You are asking me to save the 
                    life of the man that would have 
                    me executed.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     30.


                                  ARTHUR
                    I know what I am asking of you. 
                    And you have no reason to help 
                    me. But... You are my father s 
                    only hope. I will give you 
                    anything you ask. Land, gold - 
                    name your price. 

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I do not want your gold. All I 
                    have ever wanted is that people 
                    like me are allowed to live in 
                    peace. That those who practice 
                    magic are accepted, rather than 
                    hunted. That is all I ask.

      ARTHUR s unsure he can meet the demand.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    That is the price of your 
                    father s life. 

      ARTHUR rises to the moment.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You have my solemn word, that 
                    when I am King, things will be 
                      different. You will not have to 
                    live in fear. 

      OLD MERLIN takes this in, moved by the declaration.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Then I will help you.

      ARTHUR s suddenly filled with hope.

                                  ARTHUR
                    There is not a moment to spare. 
                    We must ride for Camelot 
                      immediately.

      OLD MERLIN s caught out.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Now?

                                  ARTHUR
                    My father grows weaker by the 
                    hour.

      OLD MERLIN blusters, searching for an excuse.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    But I have no horse.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     31.


                                  ARTHUR
                    You can have Merlin s horse. He 
                    will have to walk.

      OLD MERLIN s outraged.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    You would make your poor servant 
                    walk back to Camelot? I ve a good 
                    mind not to help you.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I don t care whose horse you 
                    have. We have to get to Camelot 
                    before it s too late.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                          (thinking on his feet)
                    First, I will need to gather some 
                    rare herbs. They are an essential 
                    part of the cure. I shall come to 
                    Camelot at nightfall. If you want 
                    my help, that is how it needs to 
                    be.

      ARTHUR feels he can t push any further.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I will meet you at the lower gate 
                    outside the town... Give me your 
                    word that you will come. 

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    You have my word.

      OLD MERLIN pauses as he attempts to figure out how to 
      handle the transformation back into his youthful self 
      without being caught.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Now just wait here one moment.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                      Questions. So many questions.  
                    For once in your life, will you 
                    just do as your told? 

      ARTHUR feels chastised.

                                  ARTHUR
                    All right. I ll wait here. 

      OLD MERLIN hurries out.

                                                                          CUT TO:                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     32.



      ARTHUR kicks his heals. He soon grows impatient of waiting 
      and heads out.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      AGRAVAINE gives the news to MORGANA.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Arthur has gone to consult with a 
                    sorcerer. He means to use magic 
                    to heal Uther. 

        A determined expression comes over MORGANA s face.

                                    MORGANA
                    Then we must see to it that he 
                    fails. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Open on a small fire in the grate. MORGANA stands over it. 
      In her hands she holds a tiny silver charm. She casts it 
      into the fire and her eyes glow a deep amber as she incants 
      a spell.

                                    MORGANA

                    gode cr fte.

      Suddenly, the flames flare, the firelight dances in her eyes. 
      AGRAVAINE looks on, in awe. 

      MORGANA takes a pair of tongs and pulls the charm from the 
      raging fire.

      She turns to AGRAVAINE and drops the charm before him. He 
      instinctively reaches out and catches it, before realising 
      the danger of what he has just done. He reacts with 
      surprise... 

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    It s cold...

                                    MORGANA
                    I have bound it to the left hand 
                    path. 

      He holds up the charm, impressed.

                                    MORGANA
                    You must place the charm around 
                    Uther s neck.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    What will it do to him?

                                    MORGANA
                    The force of any healing magic 
                    will be reversed, and magnified 
                    tenfold.

                    By trying to cure his father, 
                    Arthur will seal his fate.

      AGRAVAINE looks grave as he takes this in.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Arthur will never forgive himself.

      ARTHUR hurries towards Uther s chambers. Two GUARDS flank 
      the doors.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR enters. GWEN is tending to UTHER. He crosses over to 
      the bed and looks down at UTHER.

                                  ARTHUR
                    How is he?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     35.


                                  GWEN
                    His breath is weaker. Gaius has 
                    given him wintergreen to make him 
                    more comfortable.

      ARTHUR takes this in. GWEN s curious.

                                  GWEN
                    I saw you and Merlin riding out. 
                    Where have you been?

      ARTHUR s torn about whether to confide in GWEN. She sees 
      his indecision.

                                  GWEN
                    Arthur?

      ARTHUR decides he must tell GWEN.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I don t want to have any secrets 
                    from you.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      MERLIN enters. GAIUS is relieved to see him.

                                  GAIUS
                    Merlin. I was worried something 
                    had gone wrong.

                                  MERLIN
                    Apart from Arthur thinking that 
                    there is something very wrong 
                    with my bladder, everything went 
                    to plan.

      MERLIN starts to search the shelves, taking various books 
      down. GAIUS looks on with concern. 

                                  GAIUS
                    I take it this means you re going 
                    through with it?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     36.


                                  MERLIN
                    If I heal Uther, Arthur has given 
                    me his word that when he is King, 
                    magic will no longer be outlawed. 
                    This could change everything.

                                  GAIUS
                    And if something goes wrong? What 
                    of Arthur s attitude to magic 
                    then?

      MERLIN stops and looks at GAIUS.

                                  MERLIN
                    I live with the risk of being 
                    exposed every day. If I don t 
                    take this opportunity, maybe I ll 
                    spend the rest of my life having 
                    to hide who I really am. 
                      Everyone s always telling me I 
                    have this great destiny. Maybe 
                    this is it. I have to try.

      GAIUS can t bring himself to argue. MERLIN gathers up the 
      books and heads into his room. GAIUS looks thoughtful as he 
      stares after him.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      MERLIN sits on his bed. He looks through a book, but fails 
      to find what he s looking for. He tosses it aside in 
        frustration, picks up another book and starts to go through 
      it. Again, he fails to find what he s looking for. MERLIN 
      sits there, frustrated. There s a knock on the door. MERLIN 
      looks up as GAIUS enters. MERLIN looks downcast.

                                  MERLIN
                    I gave Arthur my word that I 
                    could heal Uther. I can t even 
                    find the right spell. 

                                  GAIUS
                    That s because you re looking in 
                    the wrong books. Here...

      GAIUS holds out a small leather tome, which MERLIN takes.

                                  GAIUS
                    Gwillem of Cambria was as mad as 
                    a coot, but there has never been 
                    a better healer. 

      MERLIN smiles. This means a lot to him. GAIUS makes to 
      leave.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     37.


                                  MERLIN
                    Gaius. Thank you.

      MERLIN and GAIUS share an affectionate look.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      GAIUS hands MERLIN a small pouch of hogswart.

                                  GAIUS
                    You must use no more than four 
                    drops. Any more could be dangerous.

      MERLIN nods. He takes one final look at the spell.

                                  MERLIN
                    I just hope I can make the spell 
                    work.

                                  GAIUS
                    Trust in your abilities, Merlin.   

      MERLIN s grateful for the reassurance.

                                  ARTHUR (O.S.)
                    Merlin?

      GAIUS and MERLIN exchange a worried look.

                                  MERLIN
                          (low)

                                  ARTHUR (O.S.)
                    Merlin!?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      GAIUS emerges from Merlin s room.

                                  GAIUS
                    Arthur...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Gaius. Have you seen my useless 
                    toad of a servant?

                                  GAIUS
                    I m afraid not.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Where on earth can he be?

      GAIUS is put on the spot.

                                  GAIUS
                    Have you tried the tavern?

      ARTHUR s enraged.

                                  ARTHUR
                    The tavern. Of course. I am going 
                    to make him wish he was never born.

      ARTHUR heads out. A moment later, MERLIN emerges from his 
      room. He fixes GAIUS with a look of outrage.

                                  MERLIN
                    Why did you tell him I was in the 
                    tavern?

                                  GAIUS
                    It was the first thing that popped 
                    into my head.

                                  MERLIN
                    Next time, go for the second, or 
                    third thing that pops into your 
                    head. Anything but the tavern.

      GAIUS nods, smiles faintly, then turns more serious.

                                  GAIUS
                    Good luck, Merlin.                        MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     39A.


      MERLIN and GAIUS share a poignant look, then MERLIN heads 
      out. GAIUS stares after him, deeply worried.

                                                                            CUT TO:                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     40.



      AGRAVAINE enters. He sees GWEN tending to UTHER, mopping 
      his brow. AGRAVAINE crosses to the bed, exchanges a faint 
      smile with GWEN.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    It is cold today. Perhaps it 
                    would be a good idea to start a 
                    fire. 

                                  GWEN
                    Of course.

      GWEN crosses over to light the fire. AGRAVAINE waits until 
      GWEN has her back turned and is preoccupied with the fire. 
      He takes a small cloth bundle from his tunic. He unwraps it 
      and takes out the tiny silver charm, which glows with a 
      magical light.  

      AGRAVAINE glances over at GWEN, then quickly and carefully 
      ties the charm around UTHER s neck. He ensures it is 
      carefully tucked out of sight in UTHER s robes. 

                                  AGRAVAINE
                          (sotto)
                    Finally, you will get all that you 
                    deserve, old friend. 

      AGRAVAINE looks down at UTHER for a poignant beat, then 
      heads out. Go out on UTHER, lying in bed. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR hurries through the dark, damp passage. He turns to 
      see OLD MERLIN lagging behind and reacts with frustration. 
      ARTHUR waits for OLD MERLIN to catch up. When he arrives, 
      OLD MERLIN is out of breath. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Is that really as fast as you can 
                    walk?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    When you are as old as I, we will 
                    see how fast you can walk. I need 
                    to rest a moment.

                                  ARTHUR
                    There s no time.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Then perhaps you should carry me? 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Fine. If it means we get there 
                    quicker, I ll carry you.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     42.


      ARTHUR turns. OLD MERLIN hops onto his back. ARTHUR heads 
      off. OLD MERLIN kicks him with his heals, as you would a 
      horse. ARTHUR stops, outraged...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Did you just kick me?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Now who s wasting time?

      ARTHUR staggers on, disgruntled. OLD MERLIN kicks ARTHUR 
      again, enjoying himself...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Stop kicking me!

      ARTHUR approaches the GUARDS outside Uther s chambers.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You re dismissed.

      The GUARDS hesitate, surprised by the order.

                                  GUARD
                    But, Sire. We were instructed not

                                  ARTHUR
                    I said you re dismissed.

                                  GUARD
                    Yes, my Lord.

      The GUARD s head off. ARTHUR waits until they ve 
      disappeared round the corner, then gives a nod. OLD MERLIN 
      hobbles out of the shadows. ARTHUR ushers OLD MERLIN into 
      Uther s chambers, then follows him inside and closes the 
      door.

                                                                          CUT TO:                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     43.



      UTHER lies in bed, barely breathing. ARTHUR grows 
        increasingly anxious as he watches OLD MERLIN placing four 
      drops of hogswart on UTHER s lips. OLD MERLIN takes a 
      branch of sage and holds it over UTHER. OLD MERLIN psyches 
      himself up. His eyes start to glow. ARTHUR cracks...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Wait!

      OLD MERLIN stands down, looks at ARTHUR...

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Is something wrong?

                                  ARTHUR
                    My father has taught me never to 
                    trust magic, and now I am using 
                    it to save him.  

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Your own life has been saved by 
                    magic more times than you can 
                    possibly imagine.

                                  ARTHUR
                    What on earth are you talking 
                    about? 

      OLD MERLIN realises it would be dangerous to elaborate.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I merely mean to say that magic 
                    is all around you. It is woven 
                    into the fabric of the world. 

      ARTHUR s unsettled.

                                  ARTHUR
                    How can I be sure it is the right 
                    thing to do?

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I know you have suffered because 
                    of magic, as many have. But not 
                    all magic, and not all sorcerers 
                    are the same. I wish only to show 
                    you that magic can be used for 
                    good. I hope that one day you ll 
                    see me in a different light. 

      ARTHUR s moved by the argument. ARTHUR and OLD MERLIN trade 
      stares for a poignant beat, then ARTHUR nods and steps 
      back. OLD MERLIN turns to UTHER, psyches himself up then 
      holds up the sage branch. OLD MERLIN s eyes glow. The sage 
      branch begins to smoke. OLD MERLIN wafts the incense over 
      UTHER and begins to chant, with increasing intensity...                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     44.

      OLD MERLIN completes the spell. Silence. The tension rises 
      as ARTHUR looks at UTHER, desperately hoping to see some 
      signs of life. For a moment, it looks like the spell has 
      failed. OLD MERLIN grows anxious. Suddenly, UTHER s eyes 
      snap open. ARTHUR s thrilled.  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Father...

      ARTHUR and UTHER clinch hands. UTHER manages a weak smile.

                                  UTHER
                    Arthur...

      OLD MERLIN allows himself a smile, overcome with relief. 
      But as UTHER looks up at ARTHUR, his expression suddenly 
      contorts in pain. His breath starts to fail. ARTHUR reacts, 
      alarmed. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    What s happening!?

      OLD MERLIN s equally alarmed.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I don t know...

      UTHER s fading fast. His eyes close. He goes still.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Do something!

      OLD MERLIN feels for a pulse. There isn t one. OLD MERLIN 
      reels, meets ARTHUR s stare.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    He s dead.

      ARTHUR struggles to accept this...

                                  ARTHUR
                    No... He can t be...
                          (shaking UTHER)
                    Father... Father!?... No... 
                    Please... Father...

      All OLD MERLIN can do is look on, horrified. ARTHUR 
      realises the futility of his actions. He gives up, stares 
      at UTHER, his mind swimming. He suddenly turns on OLD 
      MERLIN, more hurt and angry that we have ever seen him.

                                  ARTHUR
                    What have you done?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     45.


                                  OLD MERLIN
                    This was not supposed to happen.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You gave me your word. You have 
                    killed him... You killed him.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    No...

      ARTHUR draws his sword and advances on OLD MERLIN.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You will die for what you have 
                    done.

      OLD MERLIN s eyes flash as he thrusts his hand out.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    Hleap on b c!

      ARTHUR flies backwards into the wall and falls to the 
      floor, momentarily stunned. OLD MERLIN flees. ARTHUR takes 
      a moment to come to his senses.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Guards!

                                                                          CUT TO:



      OLD MERLIN hurries down the corridor as fast as his old 
      legs will carry him. He hears the sound of GUARDS 
        approaching. OLD MERLIN ducks into a stairwell, takes out a 
      little bottle of potion and downs it.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      MERLIN hurries in. He sees GAIUS standing over the bed, and 
      ARTHUR and GWEN looking on, traumatised. MERLIN struggles 
      to accept what he s seeing as GAIUS gently closes UTHER s 
      eyes and pulls a sheet over his face. GAIUS turns to 
      ARTHUR.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     46.


                                  GAIUS
                    I m sorry, Arthur. There is 
                    nothing more I can do. The King 
                    is dead.

      ARTHUR instinctively shakes his head, unable to accept 
      this. GWEN places a comforting hand on ARTHUR s shoulder, 
      really feeling for him, but lost for words.

                                  GWEN
                    Arthur...

      GAIUS catches MERLIN s eye. They trade a horrified look. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      MERLIN and GAIUS enter Gaius  chambers. 

                                  MERLIN
                    The spell was working. I m sure 
                    of it. I did everything right. I 
                    don t know what happened.

                                  GAIUS
                    I think I do.

      GAIUS opens his hand to reveal the small silver charm. It 
      twinkles magically.

                                  GAIUS
                    I found it around Uther s neck. 
                    It appears as though it s been 
                    enchanted and such an enchantment 
                    would have reversed the effects 
                    of your healing spell. Uther 
                    didn t stand a chance.

      MERLIN suddenly suspects who is responsible.

                                  MERLIN
                      Morgana...

                                  GAIUS
                    I believe so.

                                  MERLIN
                    How did she get past the guards?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     47.


                                  GAIUS
                    Perhaps it wasn t Morgana who 
                    placed the charm around Uther s 
                    neck. 

                                  MERLIN
                    You think it was Agravaine?

                                  GAIUS
                    I fear so.

      MERLIN frowns as he takes this in.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      AGRAVAINE enters and finds MORGANA staring contemplatively 
      at the fire. MORGANA speaks before AGRAVAINE can deliver 
      his exciting news.

                                    MORGANA
                    Uther s dead, isn t he?

                                  AGRAVAINE
                          (confused)
                    How did you know?

                                    MORGANA
                    I felt it. I felt his pain. 

      AGRAVAINE s surprised by MORGANA s muted reaction.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    I thought Uther s death would be 
                    cause for a celebration?

                                    MORGANA
                    Arthur will replace him. There is 
                    nothing to celebrate until I take 
                    my rightful place on the throne. 

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    You are closer to that goal than 
                    you think. Arthur is young, and 
                    untested. He will look to his 
                    trusted uncle for counsel. And I 
                    will ensure he fails.                           MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     48.


      MORGANA and AGRAVAINE share a thin smile.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR stares out of the window, struggling to process his 
      emotions. MERLIN approaches. ARTHUR looks round and sees 
      MERLIN standing there.

                                  MERLIN
                    I am so sorry.

      ARTHUR absorbs the sympathy. MERLIN struggles to express 
      what he s feeling.

                                  MERLIN
                    I... I should ve... I wish there 
                    was something I could have done.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Merlin. No one but me is to blame 
                    for this. 

                                  MERLIN
                    You re not to blame. This isn t 
                    your fault.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I am entirely to blame. My father 
                    spent twenty years fighting 
                    sorcery. To think I knew better. 
                    I was so arrogant. My arrogance 
                    has cost my father his life. 

                                  MERLIN
                    You were only doing what you 
                    thought was right. I m sure that 
                    old sorcerer meant no harm. 
                    Perhaps the spell went wrong. 
                    Uther was dying. Maybe nothing 
                    could have saved him...

                                  ARTHUR
                    We ll never know. All I know for 
                    sure is that I have lost both my 
                    parents to magic. It is pure 
                    evil. I will never lose sight of 
                    that again.

      ARTHUR s makes to leave.*

      But ARTHUR s already at the door and what else can MERLIN *
      say? *

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR enters the mighty room where UTHER is lying in 
      state. There is a raised dais in the centre of the space. 
      UTHER lies on it, surrounded by candles. ARTHUR begins the 
      long, lonely walk to UTHER s side.  

      MERLIN and GAIUS watch from the doorway. 

      ARTHUR reaches the dais. He stares down at UTHER s serene 
      and peaceful face. And as he stares, ARTHUR starts to cry.

      Looking on, MERLIN s devastated by the thought of what he 
      has done.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      GAIUS closes the doors to the Throne Room.

                                  GAIUS
                    We must leave him to mourn.

      GAIUS takes in MERLIN s shell shocked expression.

                                  GAIUS
                    Merlin..?

                                  MERLIN
                    This is all my fault. I killed 
                    him.

                                  GAIUS
                    You didn t kill Uther. Morgana 
                    did. Uther s spirit died when she 
                    broke his heart. 

      MERLIN takes this in.

                                  GAIUS
                    We must look to the future. 
                    Uther s death will allow Arthur s 
                      progression to the throne.

                    We must hope it brings peace and 
                    stability to the land.   

                                  MERLIN
                    But magic will still be outlawed.

      GAIUS nods sadly.

                                  MERLIN
                    I have turned Arthur against 
                    magic forever. I ll never be able 
                    to show him who I really am.

                                  GAIUS
                    That time will come. I m sure of 
                    it. Arthur will be under even 
                    more pressure now he is King. He 
                    will need you now more than ever. 

      MERLIN takes that in. He knows it s true. 

                                  GAIUS
                    There is nothing more to be done. 
                    Come and eat your supper. 

                                  MERLIN
                    I think I ll wait here.

      GAIUS takes this in, touched by MERLIN s devotion. GAIUS 
      heads off, leaving MERLIN to wait with a heavy heart.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR stares at UTHER. Tears streak down ARTHUR s face.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      Sunlight streams in through the windows. It falls on 
      MERLIN, lying on the floor, fast asleep.

                                  ARTHUR (O.S.)
                    Merlin?

      MERLIN wakes, comes to his senses. He sees ARTHUR standing 
      over him. ARTHUR has dried his eyes.                           MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     51.


      He is calm and composed, almost serene. They trade stares, 
      then ARTHUR looks at the light flooding in through the 
      window - in a contemplative mood.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It is a new day.

      MERLIN takes this in, nods, then stands.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Have you been out here all night?

                                  MERLIN
                    I didn t want you to feel you were 
                    alone.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (touched)
                    You re a loyal friend, Merlin.

      MERLIN and ARTHUR trade a look.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You must be hungry?

                    us some breakfast.

      MERLIN and ARTHUR head off down the corridor, side by side.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The Throne Room is packed with COURTIERS. An air of

                    according to their respective laws 
                    and customs?                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     52.


                                  ARTHUR
                      I solemnly promise so to do.

                                    GEOFFRY OF MONMOUTH
                    Will you to your power cause Law 
                    and Justice, in Mercy, to be 
                    executed in all your judgements?

                                  ARTHUR
                    I will.

      GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH places a crown upon ARTHUR s head.  

                                    GEOFFRY OF MONMOUTH
                    Then by the sacred laws vested in 
                    me, I pronounce you Arthur, King of 
                    Camelot!

      ARTHUR stands and looks out over the COURTIERS. He catches 
      GWEN s eye and they share a poignant look.

                                  AGRAVAINE
                    Long live the King!

      Everyone joins in the chant...

                                  ALL
                    Long live the King!

      Go out on MERLIN, shouting - proud, moved by the huge 
        significance of the moment.

                                  MERLIN/ALL
                    Long live the King!

      Ends.
