  CLOSE on TITUS  DEAD FACE. Rot and decay have set in.  
  PERFUME AND FLOWERS burn to mask the stench.

  BATIATUS

  gazes down at Titus laying peacefully on a FUNERARY COUCH, 
  dressed in a ROMAN TOGA. Batiatus himself wears the rough 
  black robes of mourning, his face unshaven since his 
  father s death.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS (O.S.)
                      It is a heavy thing...

  Batiatus looks up to see MAGISTRATE SEXTUS. A knot of other 
  HONORED ROMANS mill about, paying their final respects.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Seeing a father, so strong in life, 
                        unable to rise.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The weight of it keenly felt.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Titus was much loved by this city.  
                        Hold comfort in the knowledge.

  Sextus moves off, nodding politely at LUCRETIA as she joins 
  Batiatus. Lucretia wears simple robes, her hair unwashed for 
  the period of mourning.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The magistrate himself pays 
                        respect? A great honor.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        For my father.

  Batiatus is a swirl of conflicting emotions.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Years I wished for blistering 
                        tongue to cool. Only to long for it 
                      to scorch ear once more.

                        I know you did not wish him gone in 
                        such a manner. Nor did I, despite 
                        our many differences. Yet the gods 
                        have willed it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The gods had no fucking hand in 
                        this.  Tullius  alone inflicts 
                        injury.

  Lucretia gauges the fire in Batiatus  eyes. Carefully stokes 
  the flames, wanting vengeance for what Tullius did to Gaia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And how shall it be answered?

  SOLONIUS interrupts.

                        Apologies. Unwelcome guest makes 
                        appearance.

  Batiatus follows Solonius  eyes, inflamed to spot VETTIUS.  
  Vettius smiles, moves across the room towards them.

                                  whispered)(
                        Temper emotion, and greet him with 
                        measured voice. It would serve no 
                        purpose to have confrontation in 
                        presence of the Magistrate.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Good Batiatus. My sympathy for the 
                        passing of your father. A titan, 
                        standing far above all who follow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You come absent Tullius? I thought 
                        nothing could keep the man from 
                        observance of such tragedy.

                        eight of them to pass. Your period 
                      of mourning comes to conclusion. 
                        Tomorrow the sun greets a ninth 
                        day, and with it we expect delivery 
                      of Gannicus.

                        and see yourselves well satisfied.

                        Then Tullius will be forced to

                      in the opening games of the new 
                        arena. And all that follow.

  Vettius exits. OFF BATIATUS  mounting fury...



  The air hangs solemn as CRIXUS straps on his gladiator gear.  
  BARCA, RHASKOS, and GNAEUS do the same.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Titus condemns our brothers to the 
                        mines.  Now we fucking honor him?

                      He was the dominus of this house. 
                        And deserves no less.

                                        BARCA

  CONTINUED:

  Barca grins at Crixus. He half-heartedly returns it, his 
  attention pulled to GANNICUS as he passes. Heading for 
  Oenomaus  cell. Lost in troubled thought. OFF CRIXUS, 
  wrestling with his own over how he gained the title of 
  champion of the House of Batiatus...



  Candles burn at OENOMAUS  altar. He kneels, stripped to the 
  waist, silently praying before a simple OSSUARY containing 
  Melitta s ashes.

  GANNICUS

  appears in the doorway behind him. He hesitates, devastation 
  and guilt welling. Oenomaus pauses, sensing him.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Apologies. Batiatus summons the 
                        men.

  Oenomaus nods, rises to strap on his chestplate. Silence 
  hangs heavy. Gannicus  eyes fall to the ossuary.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        You will see her ashes beneath the 
                        ground?

                                        OENOMAUS
                      As her people s custom.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I did not know of them. There were 
                        many things I did not pause to ask 
                        her of.  Now I am filled with 
                        questions.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        None knew her as I did. We will 
                        speak of her, in quiet moments. And 
                        see them answered.

  Gannicus absorbs that, his conscience consuming him. Burning 
  for the release of confession.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Oenomaus, she --

  Oenomaus looks to him, his own pain and loss etched deep.  
  Gannicus veers in favor of a more comforting truth.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        She was the rarest of women. A 
                        flower of beauty and compassion, in 
                        a world of shit. I would assume her 
                        place, so that her laugh may yet 
                        fill solemn air.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        She would not wish it. She loved 
                        you.

  Gannicus tenses.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                      As a brother.

  Gannicus realizes Oenomaus is unaware of the betrayal. Which 
  only makes it worse.

                                        GANNICUS

                      As I loved her.

  OFF GANNICUS, his heart breaking...



  The storm has arrived. Rain hammers down outside as we TRACK 
  ACROSS the open ledgers and scattered parchment littering 
  BATIATUS  DESK.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        This is all that remains. When the 
                        smoke clears and the embers die. 
                        The sum total of a man s life.

  REVEAL Batiatus as he picks up a scroll.

                                        BATIATUS

  REVERSE to find Gannicus standing before him, dirty and 
  bruised from his bout with Crixus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A bill of sale, transferring your

                        honored.

  Batiatus weighs the surprise of that with a frown.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You wish to leave this house?

                        A noble offer. Yet I fear your life 
                        would be forfeit in such attempt.

                                        GANNICUS
                        A price willingly paid.

                      My father never aimed a favored 
                        word towards you. Now you entreat 
                      to be the instrument of his 
                        vengeance?
                                (a beat, dissecting 
                                  him)
                      Or is it another you seek it for?

  Guilt breaks the surface of Gannicus  anger. Batiatus spots 
  it.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You would sacrifice your life, in

                        A thousand lives, if I but had 
                        them.

  Batiatus unearths something else beneath the guilt and 
  anger.  An emotion he did not expect to find.

                                        BATIATUS

                      us do, to see the death of one so 
                        loved avenged?

                        The very heart of my concern. To

                        guard. Especially in the presence

  Solonius reels from that, deeply stung.

  Batiatus regains his composure, embarrassed by the vehemence 
  of his outburst.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It has been a trying day, in a long 
                        succession of many. Apologies.  I 
                        have asked much of our friendship, 
                        with little reward. Yet I must seek 
                        more, to see injuries against this 
                        house redressed.

  Solonius considers that, nods. Clearly not happy with 
  Batiatus but willing to hear him out.

                      us put minds together, and see them 
                        cleared.

  Solonius reluctantly moves off with Batiatus. Lucretia 
  watches them go, her plan to rid herself of Titus and propel 
  Batiatus to take action against Tullius finally bearing 
  deadly fruit. OFF the bloom of a satisfied smile...

                        side, never to leave it. Or this 
                        house. As Diona chose.

  Naevia tenses. Lucretia mistakes the reason.

                        I understand why she fled. It was 
                      an unfortunate thing, that she was 
                      so used by men as base 
                          entertainment. I understand. Yet 
                        cannot forgive.

                        What I can do... is make promise

                        gift, to be given only to the most 
                        worthy. As Melitta was given to 
                        Oenomaus.

  House Mother nods to Lucretia, finished. Lucretia smiles 
  warmly, stroking a stray lock of hair from Naevia s face.

                        leave these walls.

  Batiatus moves off to attend to his beard and robes. A dark 
  smile bends Lucretia s lips. Her plan to maneuver action 
  against Tullius has worked. Gaia s murder will be avenged.  
  OFF the triumph...



  Gannicus sits in his subligaria, drinking from a jug of 
  funeral wine. Lost in dark thoughts. Oenomaus enters, wet 
  from the storm. Gannicus laughs mirthlessly.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You are too late, brother. I have 
                        finished the wine. Would that I had 
                        enough to sink to fucking bottom.

  He throws the jug, shattering it against the wall.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Dominus orders you prepared for 
                        transport.

  Gannicus freezes, wheels turning.

                      to Tullius after what he has done? 
                        The man has lost fucking sense.

  Gannicus begins to dress in threadbare robes.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Then question mine as well.

                        I wish to stand before Tullius... 
                        and have his fucking life.

  Oenomaus chews on that. Doesn t care for the taste.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You would have better chance

                      It was his fucking wine! If she had 
                        not...

  Gannicus struggles with his grief and overwhelming guilt.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)

                        must pay.  Regardless of cost.

  The words hang heavy in the air between them. Gannicus 
  returns to dressing. Oenomaus stoops to collect the shards 
  of the jug, a thought nagging at him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It was a gift for Titus.

                        pass her lips? She was no thief.

  Pain wells in Gannicus  eyes. He forces it aside in favor of 
  mounting anger. At Tullius. The Fates. But mostly himself.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        fall to Tullius.

  That hits Gannicus hard. Tears stain his cheeks.

                      He deserves no less.

  Oenomaus looks at him questioningly, not understanding.  
  Gannicus can contain his guilt no longer.

  They turn to find Batiatus in the doorway. Clean shaven.  
  Wearing proper robes and a hooded cloak. An ORNATE CLOTH BAG 
  a bit larger than a coin purse in hand, containing his 
  father s ashes. Oenomaus starts to protest Gannicus  sale.

  Oenomaus sees there is no convincing him or Gannicus. He 
  nods, exits. Batiatus turns on Gannicus, hissing to him.

  Tullius bores a hole through him. Solonius moistens dry

  Theron releases his grip, exiting. Solonius sucks air.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I cannot believe even Batiatus so 
                        thick, to imagine concealing such 
                      an act.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He will spin story... of Gannicus 
                        escaping. To perhaps follow his 
                        slave Diona, who recently went to 
                        foot.

                                          TULLIUS
                      He thinks me the fool, to accept 
                        the tale?

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He is counting on you not to. 
                        Batiatus knows you will summon him 
                      to meeting. To  discuss  the 
                        matter. He lays plans to see much 
                        coin in your men s hands.  Payment 
                      in aid against your life when he 
                        stands before you.

  Vettius laughs in disbelief.

                        Batiatus has always thought himself 
                        above those around him. Even 
                        closest friend.

                        see fucking son join his father.

  OFF TULLIUS, murder flashing in his eyes...



  TIGHT ON VETTIUS  FACE as he slowly comes to -- and realizes 
  he s hanging by bound hands from one of Nestor s meat hooks.  
  Solonius, flanked by a Bodyguard, smiles down at him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The lamb finally wakes.

  Vettius struggles, tries to scream for help through his gag.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        Calm yourself. I merely wish to 
                        break words. Seek to raise alarm, 
                        and find throat slit well in 
                        advance of aid. We are clear?

  Vettius nods, his eyes wild with fear. Solonius removes the 
  gag. Vettius sputters.

                                          VETTIUS
                        You are fucking dead.

  Solonius laughs, pours himself a cup of wine.

                        Me? I have done nothing. In all of 
                        this, I have never known quarrel 
                        with good Tullius. Yet Batiatus... 
                      he is of a contrary nature. And 
                        moves even as we speak to end his 
                        conflict with your man.  Forever.

  Vettius glares in disbelief.

                                          VETTIUS
                        The opening of the arena is upon 
                        us.  Tullius  absence will be

                        upon heel.

                        You are mistaken. No one will 
                        suspect Tullius has left this 
                        world. Not when trusted Vettius 
                        heralds news that he has 
                        unexpectedly set sail abroad. To 
                        attend pressing concerns in 
                        Antioch.

  Vettius eyes him in surprise.

                                          VETTIUS
                        What would move tongue to voice 
                        such fucking lie? It more easily 
                        forms words to see you and Batiatus 
                        executed for your crimes.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Based upon what evidence? We were 
                        not discovered knife in hand, 
                        kneeling beside body. A body that 
                        even now Batiatus conceals beyond 
                        reach of human eyes. No, my concern 
                        rests with your safety.  Attempt to 
                        raise unwarranted suspicion, and 
                        Batiatus would be sure to take 
                        offense. And without Tullius to 
                        protect you...

  Vettius wrestles with that, sees the truth in it. Solonius 
  catches the shift in his eyes, smiles in satisfaction.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        Ah. Youth finally matures. Now that 
                      we have settled issue, let us turn 
                      to other matters. Of a more

  A faint smile tugs at Lucretia s lips as she moves closer.

                        I did not think I pleased you. When

  The cell that Spartacus was held in at the beginning of 
  episode 101. Tullius is roughly deposited at Batiatus  feet 
  by Oenomaus and Gannicus. Duratius and Ambiorix stand off to 
  the side, near stone and mortar of a half finished wall.

  Batiatus produces a dagger. He descends on Tullius -- and 
  cuts his gag free. Tullius immediately screams for aid, his 
  voice hoarse from Gannicus  chain.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The boy will carry news of urgent 
                        business calling you to Antioch. A 
                        treacherous journey. One that 
                        better men than you have often 
                        vanished from, never to be heard 
                        after. The city will mourn.  Soon 
                        your name will be spoken of less 
                        and less. Until it is lost to 
                        history.

  A tense beat. Broken by Tullius  mirthless laugh.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I should have had your life at the 
                        beginning of this. The mistake is 
                        mine, for staying hand in respect 
                      of your father.

  Batiatus tightens.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Respect? Then pay it to the remains 
                      of the man himself!

  Batiatus produces the ornate bag holding his father s ashes.  
  He reaches in and scoops out a handful, screaming at Tullius 
  as he forces them into his mouth.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Tell him how high you fucking hold 
                        him!  Even as your poisoned wine 
                        robs him of fucking life! Tell him! 
                        Tell him, you fucking shit!

  Tullius chokes and sputters. Locks eyes with Batiatus.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I am guilty of many things. The 
                        death of your father does not stand 
                        among them.

                        Why would I strike against your 
                        father?  He was an honorable Roman.

  Batiatus  eyes go cold.

                      As I know yours.

  Tullius laughs, accepting his fate.

                                          TULLIUS
                        There will be an accounting, 
                        Batiatus.  For this and all that 
                        follows. The gods will see to it 
                        some day.

                                        BATIATUS
                        But not this one.

  Batiatus whips his dagger out and stabs Tullius. Gannicus 
  and Oenomaus join in, stabbing him with their own weapons.  
  Tullius screams. Blood flows.



  Crixus makes love to Lucretia. Passions build. Lucretia 
  roughly grabs hold of him, silently urging him to thrust 
  harder.

  LUCRETIA CLIMAXES,

  a smile bending her lips. Of satisfaction. Of knowing that 
  at this very moment Tullius is meeting his end...



  Tullius collapses. Gurgles. Barely alive.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  winded)(

  CONTINUED:

  He motions for Duratius and Ambiorix. They roughly shove 
  Tullius into the unfinished wall. Tullius tries to scream.

  A wet, ugly sound. Batiatus basks in the grim victory as 
  they mortar Tullius into the wall.

  PRE-LAP: THE ROAR OF THE CROWD fades in as we RISE UPWARD 
  THROUGH THE CEILING, TRANSITIONING US TO --



  Vettius comes down the stairs, flush with humiliation.  
  Solonius follows in a cloud of smug satisfaction.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You have done well.

                        never return to Capua while I draw 
                        breath.

                        I shall pray for the day it ceases.

  Vettius exits. Solonius turns to head back up. Batiatus 
  intercepts, furious.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  harsh whisper)(
                      We were supposed to divide Vettius

                        doing?

                        What it takes to make a name in 
                        this world. After years of  bowing 
                        and scraping in shit .

                      Is that what this is about? A few 
                        words spoken in anger absent 
                        thought?

                                        SOLONIUS

                        brother, yet at every turn remind 
                        that I lack this trait or that. You 
                        take information given to aid and 
                        move against Tullius, absent regard 
                      of the difficult position it places 
                        me.

                                        BATIATUS

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Every tongue that is not your own 
                      is accused of the same. It has 
                        taken years and the price of blood, 
                        but I at last see you for what you 
                        are. A man that holds no one in 
                        esteem beyond himself.

  Batiatus is stunned by the vehemence of Solonius  assault.

  Solonius sweeps back up to the pulvinus. OFF BATIATUS, left 
  to wrestle with the truth of Solonius  words...



  Crixus (now shaven with short hair), Ashur, Gnaeus, and a 
  knot of Gladiators watch Diona s execution from the gates.

                                        ASHUR
                        A pity, to lose one so fetching.

  Dagan grunts, his bad eye still shielded by a bloodied 
  cloth.

                                        DAGAN
                        Soon you join. Cunt.

  Ashur chews on the statement with obvious concern. He moves 
  off to finish gearing up, passing Barca and Oenomaus.  
  Barca s wounded side has been bandaged.

                                        BARCA
                        I can fight, Doctore. Have word

  Oenomaus responds by pressing the butt of his whip into 
  Barca s bandaged side (from his injury in the attack on 
  Tullius). Barca grunts in pain as blood seeps.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I already have. Aid your brothers 
                      in preparing for the day. You will 
                        fight again when you are able.

                                        BARCA
                        Yes, Doctore.

  Barca moves off in disappointment, favoring his wound.  
  Oenomaus  eyes fall on Gannicus. He sits alone in quiet 
  reflection, ignoring the world around him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You will face Tasgetius and 
                        Synetos. In the match before the 
                        primus.

  Gannicus nods, numb. With Tullius gone, the fire of revenge 
  has followed. All that is left is pain and regret.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Our days have been filled with 
                        anguish and wounded heart. Yet now 
                        thoughts must turn upon the games. 
                        Show all of Capua why you are 
                        considered such a prize.  Show them 
                        why so many died to possess you. 
                        Fight. And honor the House of 
                        Batiatus.

  Gannicus smiles sadly.

                                        GANNICUS
                        There are many things I would die 
                        for.  Many I deserve to die for. 
                        This house is no longer among them.

  Oenomaus absorbs that for a long beat.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Then fight for her. Every life you 
                        take.  The blood you will shed. She 
                        will see it from the afterlife.

  A beat. Gannicus rises, the fire returning.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Then I shall fill her eyes.

  OFF GANNICUS, burning with deadly purpose...



  Torches are lit. Gannicus and the other battered men rest 
  before the primus. Crixus sits next to Gannicus, offering 
  him water. Gannicus takes it, sips, hands it back. A beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        So. We at last meet upon the sands.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I do not give concern towards the 
                        other men. There is only one I 
                        would prove myself against in 
                        proper contest.

  Gannicus eyes him with a frown. This guy just never stops.

                        brotherhood. The true title of 
                        champion in the balance.

  Caburus snorts in contempt, passing with a few of Solonius  
  Gladiators.

                                          CABURUS

  Crixus surges to his feet, ready to fight. Gannicus holds 
  him back.

                      In the arena.

  Caburus laughs, moving off with his men. Batiatus glares at 
  them as he enters with Oenomaus, interrupting.

                        Attend. Your Dominus would have

                        Everything we have dreamed of. 
                        Suffered and died for.
                        The worth of it all turns upon this 
                        single moment. You face the House 
                      of Solonius, and his ill gotten 
                        men. You stand outnumbered. But not 
                        outmatched.  Only one man will 
                        claim victory this day and earn the 
                        title Champion of Capua.  And by 
                        the gods that man will fucking be 
                        from the House of Batiatus!

  The men CHEER. Batiatus locks eyes with Gannicus. His 
  champion. His best hope. Gannicus burns with bloody purpose. 
  He will honor the memory of Melitta with an offering of 
  blood -- and a glorious death, if the gods so will it. The 
  CHEERS drowned out by the ROAR OF THE CROWD as we TRANSITION 
  TO --                                                                                    44.



  The final scene from Ep 113. Batiatus lays dying next to a 
  wounded Lucretia. Spartacus addresses the blood drenched 
  Gladiators and frightened Slaves.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your lives are now your own. Forge 
                        your own path... or join with us, 
                        and together we shall see Rome 
                        tremble!

  The Gladiators and Slaves CHEER.

  TIGHT ON BATIATUS,

  the roar of rebellion coming through in distorted waves as 
  the life fades from his eyes. Death and blood his true 
  reward. Finally earned.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
