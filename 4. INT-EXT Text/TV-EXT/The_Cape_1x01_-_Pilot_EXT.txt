      SWAT SNIPERS train their scopes on any open window. A CROWD 
      gathers below. We hear VOICES amplified by microphones.


      ROSS - THE NEW CHIEF OF POLICE - is at the podium in the 
      middle of his speech. THE MAYOR is flanked by UNIFORMED 
      POLICE. REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS fill the steps. There is 
      a serious law-enforcement-presence on the streets.

      PALM CITY has a coastal sunniness and allure. A mixture of 
      sleek skyscrapers and white-sand-beaches. It could be LA or 
      Miami. A world just like ours. But just beneath the 
      surface...a cancer grows.

      ACROSS THE STREET: VINCE FARADAY watches the speech and the 
      sidewalks with TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS.                                                                                    5.


                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to cops)
                    Get somebody on that north corner. 
                    We re looking a little thin there.

                                  OFFICER #1
                    On it.

    The officer jogs down the closed-off-street. Vince is uneasy.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to remaining cop)
                    Why show off that you ve got the 
                    mayor s schedule? What s the point 
                    of that?

                                  OFFICER #2
                    Look at all this press. He wants 
                    the attention. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Guy names himself Chess, though. I 
                    studied chess - the game - a lot in 
                    military theory classes. 

    The press conference is over. The Mayor is whisked down the 
      stairs. Flashbulbs POP. Police fan out to their cars. A 
      UNIFORMED OFFICER heads towards Vince.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                          (still talking to cop)
                    Key piece of Chess strategy is 
                    disguising your true objective. Get 
                    your opponent to defend his...
                          (notices something, stops 
                          an approaching officer)
                    Jenner, what reyou doing? You and 
                    Garcia are my bodies on the Chief.

                                  JENNER
                          (confused)
                    You just called me off it.

    The Chief of Police shakes hands. Ducks into a black sedan.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    The hell I did!


      VINCE jogs towards the black sedan which PEELS out in 
      reverse, suddenly.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (into radio)
                    He s got the Chief!

    The black sedan SQUEALS around the corner. Vince races after 
    it on foot. Officers scramble.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A sleepy and annoyed MARTY VOYT pulls up in his SUVto an 
      abandoned warehouse on a lonely pier. VINCE waits by the 
      curb, blowing on his hands for the chill.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    It s 3am, Vince.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    You alone?

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    No, there s five guys in the trunk. 

      Vince turns and heads over to a warehouse where the front 
      door is ajar. Marty studies the chain lock which is cut.

                                  MARTY VOYT (CONT'D)
                    Did you clip this chain?

                                  VINCE FARADAY (O.S.)
                            (alreadyinside)
                    Come on.


      VINCE exits his car at a rail yard. He checks that his GUN is 
      loaded and stuffs it in the back of his pants. He walks 
      between heavy freight cars. In the distance a TRAIN WHISTLES.

    In the maze of cars, Vince passes one with a once-garish, now 
      fading poster for an old carnival exhibition: MAX MALINI S 
      FANTASTIC ODDITIES AND AMAZEMENTS!

                                  MARTY VOYT (O.S.)
                    Vince.

      Vince turns to an open freight car. MARTY waves. Vince heads 
      over. Marty helps him up. Vince sees tears in Marty s eyes.

                                  MARTY VOYT (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry--

      A hypodermic is in Vince s neck before he can reach his gun. 

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:


      A blood dawn looms on the horizon as VINCE FARADAY runs for 
    his life, staggering through the rail yard, YANKING on the 
      Chess mask glued to his face as...

      ...LYNX TROOPS methodically sweep across the rail yard. Red 
      targeting lasers dance across the freight cars.

      A LYNX CHOPPER swerves overhead, its hot spotlight on Vince 
    as he darts in and out.


      VINCE slams against a freight car. He looks freakish with the 
      torn, half-glued mask stuck to his face. Bullets PWINGoff 
    the steel casing of the freight cars. Vince ducks and runs. 
    He sees Lynx BOOTS underneath the freight cars. The chopper 
      spotlight follows him relentlessly.


      VINCE staggers past the strange Carnival poster and catches 
    his foot on a broken timber. Vince hits the ground hard. He 
      climbs to his feet, turns and sees...                                                                                    23.


      ...LYNX TROOPS curl around the corner, rifles aiming.

      Vince turns and sees a FUEL CAR blocking his path. Vince 
      charges towards the fuel car as bullets PWINGall around him. 
      Vince hits the dirt and scrambles on his stomach under the 
      fuel car. Vince claws for daylight. 

      Vince knows what happens next. He digs in the gravel. Drags 
      himself to his feet on the other side. But too late as...

      ...THE FUEL CAR EXPLODES.

      A shockwavehits Vince, throwing him forward like a rag doll, 
      followed by a gathering wave of blue fire that soars 
      overhead.

    The chopper PEELS away as the RAIL CAR hurtles into the sky 
    on a plume of hellflamebefore PLUMMETING back to Earth.

      LYNX TROOPS are flattened by the blast, retreating in a panic 
      from the licking, devouring fire.


    The rail yard is filled with choking black smoke. Debris is 
      everywhere. VINCE S body smokes. His clothing is charred. He 
    is unconscious, face-down. He is oblivious to...

      ...a set of small, gnarled hands that take his collar and 
      roughly DRAG him into the shadows.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:


      PETER FLEMING stands before a flotilla of cameras. A CROWD 
      fills the street. Peter Fleming is flanked by a LINEUP OF 
      LYNX TROOPS in their black gear.

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    Six months ago, when Mayor Welkins 
                    approached me about taking over the 
                    Palm City police force I told him 
                     no.  I told him Lynx - having 
                    proved itself in international 
                    conflicts the world over - hadn t 
                    proven itself on this battlefield. 
                    Today...we have.                                                                                     24.


      There is APPLAUSE. Cameras CLICK. 

                                  PETER FLEMING (CONT'D)
                    Palm City is safer this morning 
                    because of us. 
                          (beat)
                    And so it is - with pride - that I 
                    accept Mayor Welkins offer to be 
                    the first fully private 
                    metropolitan police force in the 
                    United States!

      More APPLAUSE.


      VINCE watches his own burial from behind a tree at the Palm 
      City Cemetery. He sees DANA in black holding TRIP in his 
      suit. Vince sees MARTY VOYT consoling Dana. 

      Vince clenches his fists. Tortured. He wants to go to them 
    but after a few moments...he walks off in the opposite 
      direction.

                                      ACT THREE

      TITLE: THE BIRTH OF A HERO...


      BLACK SUVSline up outside the glittering lights as long 
      lines of PARTIERSwait to get into this exclusive club.


      SOMEONE S P.O.V: WE SEE through a telephoto lens TWO LYNX 
      GUARDS in plainclothes entering the Club Tatou.

    The telephoto lens comes down. A GLOVED HAND holds up a 
      PHOTOCOPY OF LYNX ID CARDS. Same guards. 


    THE LYNX TROOPS push the girls into the alley.

                                  CLUB GIRL #1
                          (looks around)
                    What the hell is this?
                          (beat)
                    I m going back inside.

    One of the drunk troops shoves Club Girl #1 too hard and she 
      face-plants across the cement.

                                  CLUB GIRL #1 (CONT'D)
                          (digs in her purse)
                    I m calling a cop--

    Her hand is YANKED AWAY. The Lynx Trooper gets in her face. 
      Flashes a LYNX BADGE.                                                                                    43.


                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                    We are the cops!

    The Trooper picks up Club Girl #1 by the jaw. 

                                  CLUB GIRL #2
                    Come on, guys, it s cool--

      Trooper #2 hauls off and WHACKS Club Girl #2 into a row of 
      trash cans. Trooper #2 pulls a GUN.

                                  LYNX TROOP #2
                    Time to play Simon Sez.

    The Trooper chambers a round as...

      ...a LIVING SHADOW snaps out of the darkness, SNATCHES the 
    gun from the Trooper s hand and FLINGS it 50-feet-away.

                                  LYNX TROOP #2 (CONT'D)
                          (watches the gun go)
                    What the fu--?

    The fire escape SHUDDERS as SOMETHING blurs by at the two-
      story-level when there is a BURST OF SMOKE and...

      ...another BURST OF SMOKE in the alley. The smoke clears away 
      from a TALL FIGURE completely hidden by a LONG COWL or CAPE.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                          (to Figure)
                    You want some? You freak piece-of-

      Lynx Trooper #1 does a running JUDO KICK and...

      ...passes harmlessly through the empty cloak.The Trooper 
      CRASHES into a set of noisy trash cans.

      Lynx Trooper #2 looks around - frantic as...

      ...VINCE FARADAY rises up behind him wearing a thin black 
      mask and black body armor. When he looks like this...

      ...we ll call him THE CAPE.

    The Lynx Trooper WHIRLS around.

                                  THE CAPE
                    Simon Sezfall down.

    The Cape ducks a punch and drops to the ground, viciously LEG-
      SWEEPS the Lynx Trooper, then TWISTS and PIVOTS around his 
      body RAINING DOWN BLOWS on the overmatched Trooper.                                                                                    44.


      Lynx Trooper #1 aims and FIRES but The Cape SPRINGS up the 
      wall and BACKFLIPSover the Trooper s head and lands...

      ...at his cape which he WHIPS into the air and it SNAPS out, 
      WRAPS around the Trooper s wrist and YANKS him forward where 
    he meets...

      ...The Cape s fist. WHAM.Lights out. Bye bye.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    THE LYNX TROOPER S eyes flutter open. It s windy. He looks 
      around at the glowing cityscapeof Palm City. Looks down and 
      sees that he is harnessed to a bungee cord.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                    Whoa! What s--what sthis!?

    The Trooper looks around and sees THE CAPE testing the 
      strength of a piton. The Cape then writes something on a 
      piece of paper. He comes at The Trooper.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1 (CONT'D)
                      P-please!What do you want?

    The Cape pins something on the Trooper s chest. The Cape digs 
    in the Trooper s pockets and pulls out a...

      ...a slip of paper. A SCHEDULE OF A SHIPMENT from the Palm 
      City Piers. Someone has written 2PMon it. He pockets it.

                                  THE CAPE
                    You were there. You helped to frame 
                    Vince Faraday. Now you re going to 
                    help me send a message.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                    What? What message?! What reyou--

    The Cape THUDS his boot into the Trooper s chest. The Trooper 
      SCREAMS bloody murder as he TOPPLES backwards, off the roof 
    and PLUNGES twenty stories, bungee cord trailing until...


      RAIA the Animal Trainer - in clown makeup - poses for a 
      photograph with her RACCOON and a HAPPY TOURIST. The Happy 
      Tourist s WIFE (also happy) takes the picture.

                                  HAPPY TOURIST WIFE
                    I think the raccoon waved!                                                                                    47.

                    He loves to have his picture taken.

    The tourists move on. Raia turns to the Raccoon who hands 
      Raia the Tourist s wallet. She checks it. Full of cash.

                                  RAIA (CONT'D)
                    You want a treat now, my love?

      A HAND snatches Raia s arm. The Raccoon HISSES as it s 
      GRABBED by the neck...


      A TRUCK pulls up to a SECURITY POST at the Palm City piers. 
      Huge tankers and towers of shipping containers form the 
      backdrop.

    The truck window lowers. THE SECURITY GUARD drops his ring of 
      keys as a...

      ...strangely glittering, scaled HAND reaches out of the truck 
      clutching a wad of hundreds.The Security Guard takes the 
      money, finding it hard to look at the person in the truck.

      REVERSE ON: The face behind the window. He s big. Massive 
      even. He has a freakish skin condition that gives him the 
      appearance of green and gold scales. And he wears RayBans.
      This is DOMINIC RAOUL aka: GATOR. He s human. Just barely.

                                  GATOR
                    What s shaking, baby?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Container Twelve.

    The Security Guard pushes the button lifting the arm. The 
      truck drives onto the piers.


      GATOR tears open a box marked: BABY TOYS. He digs out a TOY 
      BEAR and rips off the head. Checks to see if the NERVE AGENT 
      cannister is inside. Bingo.

                                  GATOR
                    Move, slugs! On the truck!

      Gator s men haul the crates on hand trucks towards the back 
    of the truck. A SCARED THUG stands next to Gator.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                    I don t want to name names to 
                    Chess. Yeah. You re moving now.

      Gator s phone rings.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (answers)
                    What dI tell you about this 
                    number? You don t call this God 
                    damn number, I ll crush you!
                          (hangsup, to Scared Thug)
                    My therapist. My old lady s got me 
                    seeing one.                                                                                     49.


    The Scared Thug nods, wishing he were somewhere else.

      Something black DARTS out from behind a tower of crates, 
      COILS around a thug s neck and JERKS him behind a crate. 
      There is a CRASH and a CHOKED CRY.

      Everyone looks around. Gator frowns. Draws a massive GUN. 

      There is a SNAP and ANOTHER THUG goes HURTLING into the 
      water. And another YANKS backwards out of frame and WHAMS
      into the shipping container.

      Gator aims for the shadows as...

      ...a cape SNAPS around his wrist. But Gator SNARLS and RIPS 
    his arm forward...

        ...somersaulting THE CAPE into the light. The Cape recovers 
    and delivers several FIERCE BLOWS to Gator s ribs.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (grins)
                    Sweet threads.

                                  THE CAPE 
                    Thanks.

      Gator grabs the Cape by the throat and literally THROWS him 
      20-feet.The Cape SLAMS off one of the containers. Before The 
      Cape can catch his breath...

      ...Gator is on top of him. BITES his shoulder. Lifts him up - 
      over his head like an Olympic lifter - and brings him down 
      HARD over his knee. We might hear a rib CRACK.

    The Cape rolls over in agony. THUGS watch as Gator RIPS part 
    of a chain barrier and a pylon from the ground.

                                  GATOR
                          (to his boys)
                    Pay attention, slugs!

      Gator wraps the chain around the Cape s neck. Knots the chain 
      around his arms. The Cape STRUGGLES.

      Gator hefts the pylon (has to be 300-pounds) which drags the 
      chain...which drags the Cape to the water s edge.

    His phone RINGS.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (answers, listens)
                    I m not paying for the missed hour! 
                    Here. Listen to this.                                                                                    50.


      Gator holds the phone up the The Cape s GAGGING.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    That s how I roll, Dennis!

      Gator hangs up, heaves the pylon over the edge...

      ...DRAGGING the Cape across the concrete and WHIPPING him 
      over the side. The Cape plummets 30-feetinto the water and 
      vanishes. Even Gator s thugs are freaked out by his ferocity. 

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (to thugs)
                    Fish  em out tonight. The Lich ll
                    want to see that.


      A LYNX TROOPER walks the pier as lights glow from the 
      warehouse windows. We hear MACHINERY running inside.

      Suddenly, the Lynx Trooper HITS the ground hard and DRAGS 
      over the side. We hear a SPLASH.                                                                                    51.



    THE CAPE climbs onto the roof and runs to a row of skylights. 
    He peers inside and sees GATOR running things. FORKLIFTS move 
    the boxes we saw earlier. The Cape sees the material is being 
      moves into new boxes labeled for VENEZUELA. Then...

      ...The Cape hears a shutter CLICK. He whips around and sees 
      nothing but hears FOOTSTEPS. 

      From the ledge, the Cape spots a FIGURE running away. The 
      Cape DIVES to the other rooftop, lands in a roll, gets up on 
    his feet, racing after the figure. He springs off the roof, 
      uses the fire escape as a springboard and FLIPS onto the 
      ground where he DROPS the figure with a SPINNING KICK.

      Vince tears off the figure s backpack, spilling notebooks 
      that bear the ORWELL INSIGNIA. 

                                  THE CAPE
                          (hesitates)
                    Are you--?

    The Cape catches a SWINGING PUNCH. He twists Orwell s arm but 
      doesn t see the tazer that ZAPS him. The Cape snatches it.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    Not cool!

      Orwell s ponytail shakes free in the struggle. She s 23 and 
      really cute in an intrepid, violent sort of way.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    You re Orwell? What reyou twelve?

                                  ORWELL
                    You re the one wearing long 
                    underwear and a cape.

                                  THE CAPE
                          (thinks about this)
                    Fair enough.

                                        ACT FIVE

      TITLE: ORWELL


      ORWELL sits in her car. A voice-disguiser on her phone which 
    is plugged into her laptop. She watches LYNX TROOPS funneling 
      into the warehouse.

                                  ORWELL
                          (eyes on warehouse)
                    ...The Cape has been spotted on the 
                    scene. This is your scoop. Try not 
                    to screw it up.

      Orwell hangs up.


      CHESS and the LYNX CAPTAIN run across the warehouse roof 
      where a CHOPPER hovers. A ladder is dropped. 

    The Lynx Captain grabs the rope ladder. Hauls himself up. 
      Throws out a hand for Chess who takes it. They climb the 
      ladder, dangling over the warehouse roof. 

    In the distance FIRE and POLICE sirens are seen and heard. 

                                  CHESS
                          (to Captain)
                    Hurry up!

      Chess looks up into the black visor and helmet of the Lynx 
      Captain.

                                  CHESS (CONT'D)
                    Pull me up!

    The Lynx Captain takes off his helmet TO REVEAL...

      ...THE CAPE.

      Chess s crazy eyes go wide. The two adversaries are frozen 
      there in space for a long moment. The chopper hovers.

                                  THE CAPE
                    Checkmate.

      Chess pulls a KNIFE from his pocket, tries to swing it 
      around, but the Cape sees it and simply OPENS HIS HAND...

      ...Chess PLUMMETS backward 20 feet to the warehouse roof. 

    The Cape RIPS OFF his gear and DIVES after him. His CAPE 
      UNFURLS allowing him to glide to the roof - landing surely on 
    his feet. Chess struggles to his feet, hurt but alive.                                                                                    63.



    THE CAPE and CHESS exchange blows on the warehouse roof. The 
      Cape lifts Chess s body into the air with brutal KICKS to the 
      ribs. He BACKHANDS Chess who topples onto the ground again.

    The chopper continues to HOVER overhead.

                                  ORWELL (V.O.)
                          (overradio)
                    Cape! Respond!

      A CONE OF FIRE rips a piece of the roof away. Glass SHATTERS. 
      Chess PUNCHES The Cape.

      Another EXPLOSION spews debris into the air. The Cape TACKLES 
      Chess. The chopper BUZZES overhead.

                                  CHESS
                    I ll find out who you are! I ll 
                    find out who you are and kill 
                    everything you love!

                                  THE CAPE
                          (takes Chess by the 
                            collar)
                    You can t touch me. I m already 
                    dead!

      Another ERUPTION disintegrates most of the roof. The Cape has 
    no choice, he backs away from Chess, throws his cloak around 
      himself and VANISHES in a burst of smoke. 

      WIDE AS: The warehouse PLUMES in a crescendo of flames. WE 
      SOAR UPWARDS and see...

      ...CHESS - his body smoking - clinging desperately to the 
      rope ladder of the chopper as it swerves away into the sky.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:                                                                                    64.
