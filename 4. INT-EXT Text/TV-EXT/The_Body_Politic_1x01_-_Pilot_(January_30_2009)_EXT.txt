      We find Hope in a window near the back of the bus.  It merges 
      onto the open freeway, pointing east into the rising sun.



      She steps from the restroom.  The sight of THE CAPITOL DOME 
      rising above the city in the distance stops her cold. 



      Hope stares up at the massive dome.  She s come all this way, 
      but finds herself suddenly frozen.  Intimidated.

      Then something up above steals her attention:

      A TV NEWS CREW converges on the middle-aged, politically 
      handsome SENATOR JACK ADAMSON (D-FL), and his very sexy, 
      smartly tailored legislative aide, JESSICA SHARP, 29.  

      They re moving fast, late for something.  Still, the Senator 
      can t resist CNN s DANA BASH...

                                  DANA BASH
                    Senator Adamson?  Excuse me.

                                    JESSICA
                          (low)
                    She ll ask about the foreclosure 
                    freeze.  Just keep moving.  Her 
                    husband s name is John.  One son.

                                  DANA BASH
                    Sir, my republican sources say 
                    they ll hold up your nomination as 
                    attorney general if you keep 
                    pushing the foreclosure freeze.  

                                    ADAMSON
                    I d suggest your republican sources 
                    check the score board, Dana.  
                    Cynical politics like that cost 
                    them the White House and put them 
                    out in the cold.

                                  DANA BASH
                    You re not worried about a 
                      filibuster then?  After all, the 
                    democrats only have 59 votes.

                                    ADAMSON
                    What I m worried about is people 
                    losing their homes.                                                                                        4.

                                    ADAMSON (CONT'D)
                          (then; with a smile)
                    My best to John, and your son.

      Dana wants to follow up, but before she can...

                                    JESSICA
                    The Senator s late.

      With that, they stride off.  Hope watches.  Seeing Jessica in 
      action makes her feel even more out of place than before.

      She looks back to the dome, summoning her courage, finally 
      starting to climb.



      Jessica stands there, badly shaken, as the limo races away.



      Colonial mansions.  Massive oaks.  Well tended yards.    

      Ruby climbs from her Prius with its  VOTE CHANGE  sticker and 
      stares at the perfect house, then hurries up the long drive.  



      Ruby RINGS the bell.  FOOTSTEPS rush to the door.  

      MARTHA MULLIN pulls it open.  She s had some help to stay 
      this gorgeous at 50.  The drink in her hand is not her first.

                                  MARTHA
                    You re late, sugar.  



      A converted townhouse in an area that was a crime zone, 
      before getting bought up by Gen-X and rented out to Gen-Y.  

      The neighborhood s one constant, like a beacon in the night,  
      is the incandescent Capitol dome.



      Jessica slips through the shadows toward the limo.  If she s 
      concerned, it doesn t show.  Window slides.  Vince smiles...

                                  VINCE
                    Nice robe, Lady X.

                                    JESSICA
                    What are you doing here, Vince?

                                  VINCE
                          (after a beat)
                    They want a name. 

                                    JESSICA
                    It ll pass.  Right now, we have to 
                    think about the Senator s legacy.

                                  VINCE
                    I m getting pressured, Jessica.

      It hangs there.  She knows what this is really about...

                                    JESSICA
                    What s the bidding at, Vince?

      Vince looks away, clearly conflicted about this.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Oh come on.  I m a big girl.  
                    How much to say it was a hooker?

      He looks back, shaking his head slightly, then...

                                  VINCE
                    Fifty.

                                    JESSICA
                    Fifty thousand?  In case you 
                    forgot, I don t have a job.

                                  VINCE
                    Neither do I.  

      With that, he drives off.  Jessica just stands there,      
      the weight of her situation finally showing in her face,     
      as WE RISE ABOVE HER, all the way up to...                                                                                    32.



      Killer view.  A crescent moon over the beaming Capitol dome.   
      Charlie and Ben sit with their housemate Miles, whom we 
      recognize as Jessica's assistant.  

      Tie loosened from a long day on the Hill, Miles reads the 
       roommate wanted  ad he s composing on his laptop...

                                  MILES
                    Busy Hill staffer, passionate about 
                    the environment, seeks non-smoker, 
                    to share two bedroom on the Hill.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    Dude, there s a thousand new kids 
                    like you on the Hill for every 
                    vacant apartment.  DC s the new 
                    Wall Street.  Be specific.  Who do 
                    we want to live with?

                                  BEN
                    How  bout a redhead to go with the 
                    blonde and the brunette?

                                    CHARLIE
                    How  bout a republican to balance 
                    out you liberal elites?

                                  MILES
                    You mean, as opposed to the media 
                    elites like you?

      There s a beat.  Charlie is surprised Miles has it in him.  
      Ben holds out his fist...

                                  BEN
                    So it begins.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Better a media elite than a walking 
                    photo-op.

      Ruby emerges from the rooftop door, unseen until...

                                  RUBY
                    That s not fair.  Ben can t help it 
                    if the camera loves him.

                                  BEN
                    Oh, go pee in a cup.

      That stops Ruby in her tracks.  Tears spring to her eyes.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What the hell does that mean?                                                                                    33.


                                  BEN
                    Just a figure of speech.

      With that, he looks at her, subtly apologetic.

                                  RUBY
                    It s okay.  Long day, that s all.

      Still, Charlie s curious about the exchange.  Fortunately for 
      Ruby, that s when T-PAIN blasts.  Charlie checks his 
      Blackberry.  What he sees, knocks him back to his chair.

                                    CHARLIE
                    ... Oh my God.  My blog just got 
                    picked up by the dead tree team.  
                    I m getting my first front page!

      The others WHOOP, genuinely happy for him.  Ben pulls him  
      back to his feet, hugs him.  So does Ruby.  Because Miles is 
      the new guy, he settles for a high-five.  Then...  

                                  BEN
                    Wait.  So what s the story?



      Mullin stands at a bank of microphones with Senator Webster.   
      He s mid-statement when we arrive...  

                                  MULLIN
                    Although we may sit on different 
                    sides of the political aisle, my 
                    good friend from Michigan will be a 
                    fantastic attorney general.

      APPLAUSE from the CROWD.  Jessica and Lucky at the center.

                                    JESSICA
                    So what did you have on the   
                    little weasel?                                                                                    41.


                                  LUCKY
                    I know it s hard to believe, but 
                    sometimes people do the right 
                    things for the right reasons.

      That s when Webster steps to the mic.  Lucky joins in the 
      APPLAUSE for a moment, then looks back to Jessica...

                                  LUCKY (CONT D)
                    Still wanna work at Justice?

                                    JESSICA
                    For Webster?  Sure.  Right after my 
                    sex change.  

      Lucky LAUGHS, understands her completely... 

                                  LUCKY 
                    This is a real offer, Jess.      
                    Who cares if he s a republican?

                                    JESSICA
                    I care.  Lucky, I m a partisan.        
                    I don t reach across the aisle.     
                    I don t compromise my beliefs.      
                    I fight.  I win or I lose.  And 
                    when I win, I don t delude myself 
                    into believing that everything's 
                    gonna change.

                                  LUCKY
                    You think the two million people 
                    that packed that mall for our 
                      inauguration are delusional?

                                    JESSICA
                    I think it s a honeymoon, Lucky.  
                    Everyone loves a honeymoon.  
                      Unfortunately, once the oaths are 
                    taken, and the marriage starts, the 
                    only ones left screwing each other 
                    are the partisans.

                                  LUCKY
                    It s different this time, Jess.    
                    It just is.  The job s open until 
                    the end of the day.

      With that, he walks off.  Jessica watches him go, surprised 
      by how deeply he believes  And..



      Hope's taxi rolls to a stop across the street.  She stares 
      out the window at the place she may soon call home.



      She buzzes Ben s apartment.  No answer.  She tries again.    
      A window opens above her.  It s Charlie.

                                  HOPE
                          (to herself)
                    Great.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey.  What are you doing here?

                                  HOPE 
                    I came to see the apartment.    
                    I ll come back later.

                                    CHARLIE
                    No.  Wait.

      Charlie disappears.  Hope shakes her head, considers leaving.  
      Before she can decide, the door opens and there he is.

                                  HOPE
                    This was a mistake.

      She starts back down the steps.  Charlie follows...

                                    CHARLIE
                    I know you re mad, but you re not 
                    the only person who works in that 
                    office, you know?

      It stops her.  She looks back...

                                  HOPE 
                    Someone else talked to you?      

                                    CHARLIE
                    I can t tell you that, but, yes...  
                    Now do you want to see the 
                      apartment, or not?

      She stares a moment, still not sure what to think.  And...



      Hope follows Charlie from the stairwell door.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Careful.  Don t let it close,     
                    it locks from the inside.

      Hope moves to the railing, taking in the monuments.

                                  HOPE
                    Wow.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I know.  Every time I forget,      
                    I come up here.

                                  HOPE
                    Forget what?

                                    CHARLIE
                    What a cool country this is.
                          (then; off her smile)
                    Corny, right?

                                  HOPE
                    No... nice.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    The last few years, I ve had to 
                    come up here a lot.
                          (then, remembering she s a 
                            republican)
                    No offense.

                                  HOPE
                    None taken.

      He sees that she means it, makes him wonder...

                                    CHARLIE
                    So what s your issue anyway?

                                  HOPE
                    My issue?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Your reason for coming here.
                          (then)                                                                                    51.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    You did come here for a reason, 
                    didn t you?

      She stares at him for a moment, then...

                                  HOPE
                    World peace.
                          (before he can press)
                    What s your reason?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Lies.  Getting lied into a war.  
                    Now I try to shine a light on the 
                    liars.

                                  HOPE
                    You must be busy.

      Charlie LAUGHS, nods.

                                  HOPE (CONT D)
                    What about the rest of the house?

                                    CHARLIE
                    An issue buffet.  Miles won t shut 
                    up about global warming.  Ruby 
                    wants to end poverty, preferably 
                    without using her trust fund to do 
                    it.    And believe it or not, 
                    Jessica was the youngest ever chief 
                    counsel for the National 
                      Organization of Women.  Of course, 
                    that was when she was still human.

                                  HOPE
                    What about Ben?  What s his issue?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Ben s issue is Ben.

      Their eyes meet.  Looks like he wants to kiss her.         
      She senses it, doesn t want to hurt his feelings.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Would it be weird if I kissed you, 
                    right now?

                                  HOPE
                    Maybe.  But only cuz I m gonna take 
                    the apartment, so --

      That s when Miles rushes from the doorway, out of breath.

                                  MILES
                    Sorry, I m late.  I got stuck at 
                    the office.                                                                                    52.


                                    CHARLIE
                    We heard.  Hangers, no starch.

                                  MILES
                          (a little embarrassed)
                    If you want I could show you the --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Don t sweat it.  I closed the deal.

                                  MILES
                    Really?  You re gonna take it? 
                    That s great!  

      Before Hope can respond, the sound of an ENGINE comes from 
      below, and they all look down to see Ben rolling up on his 
      motorcycle.  He s greeting Ruby, who s just back from a jog.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey!  We gotta new housemate!

                                  RUBY
                    Awesome!  We ll be right up!

      She bounds up the front steps.  Hope s eyes linger on Ben,  
      as he unstraps the case of beer from the back of his bike.

      Charlie notices this, but manages a smile as Hope looks back 
      over at him.  This might be trouble.



      Everyone is seated now on the mismatched lawn furniture, 
      waiting for Ben to finish passing out the beer.

                                  RUBY
                    Hurry up.  I wanna make a toast.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Promise it won t include the    
                    word  change? 

                                  RUBY
                          (to Hope)
                    He pretends he s not as excited as 
                    the rest of us.
                          (then, re: the beer)
                    Anyone got an opener?

      No one does.  Ben stands to get one.  Hope follows to      
      her feet.

                                  HOPE
                    Wait.                                                                                      53.


      She steps toward him, reaches for his belt, and, to 
      everyone s disbelief, actually unbuckles it.  Before they 
      know what she s doing, she uses the buckle to open the beer.

      Reactions run the gamut.  

                                  MILES
                    Where d you learn to do that?

                                  HOPE
                    Too much time behind a bar.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (handing his beer to Hope)
                    In some offices around here that s 
                    better than a law degree.  

      She moves Charlie s bottle to Ben s waist...

                                  HOPE
                    You mind?

                                  BEN
                    Not at all.  

      This time, when she pops the cap, beer sprays all over Ben s 
      pants and shirt.  All but Ben find this hysterical...

                                  HOPE
                    Oh God!  I m sorry!

                                  BEN
                          (to Charlie)
                    You shook it up, didn t you?

      Charlie nods, pleased with himself.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Nice.  Real nice.

      As the LAUGHTER continues, we rise above, losing them amid 
      the monuments.   

                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                    54.


                                          ACT FIVE



      BANG!  A 21 gun salute, as Adamson s coffin descends.  

      A sea of MOURNERS circle the grave.  With each rifle shot  
      THE ANGLE CHANGES.

      BANG!  Lucky stands at the front of the circle, a small 
      folder tucked discreetly under his arm.

      BANG!  Ben stands near Senator Buckley.  Rigid.  Saluting.  
      Emotions clearly stirred by this military funeral.

      BANG!  Jessica stands with the rest of Adamson s staff.  
      Vince locks eyes with her:  Well?   She pats her purse.

      BANG!  Like the rest of the veterans in attendance, Webster 
      is saluting.  He stands between his WIFE and Sperlock.

      BANG!  Ruby stands beside Mullin, whose hand inadvertently 
      touches hers, neither withdraws, as the coffin disappears 
      into the ground.  And...



      The service is over.  Limos are being loaded.  

      As Buckley heads for hers, Lucky splits from the crowd, and 
      falls in stride.  He holds the opposition research file.  
      Buckley sees it, and is instantly suspicious.

                                  LUCKY
                    Senator.  My condolences.  I know 
                    you and Senator Adamson were close.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    We were on the Harvard law review 
                    together.  He went to congress, and 
                    I became a prosecutor in federal 
                    court.  You know, Mr. Evans, I won 
                    more government corruption cases in 
                    those seven years than have been 
                    won since.  I was tough. 
                          (then; looking over)
                    He d have wanted me to be attorney 
                    general in his place.

      Lucky says nothing, keeps walking.  Buckley waits for more.  
      Her eyes go to the file.   We sense that Lucky is struggling 
      with using whatever's inside.  Buckley senses it, too...

                                    BUCKLEY (CONT D)
                    What are you waiting for?                                                                                    55.


                                  LUCKY
                    Ma am?

                                    BUCKLEY
                    This is when you tell me what 
                    you ve got on me, hoping it keeps 
                    me inside the tent pissing out, 
                    instead of the other way around.
                          (then; eyes on the file)
                    Question is, how good s your hand?

      Lucky stares, weighing the choice for another moment, before 
      slipping the file into the trash can beside them, then... 

                                  LUCKY
                    I m sure you ll do what s right for 
                    the country, Senator.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    I ll do what I think is right, yes.

                                  LUCKY
                    I hope that includes not killing 
                    the foreclosure freeze.  

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Senator Mullin made his choice.

                                  LUCKY
                    Senator Mullin chose to follow his 
                      conscience.  You should try it.  

      There s a flash of rage in Buckley.  She controls it...

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Just because a President decides to 
                    change the rules, doesn t mean that 
                    everyone else will play by them.  I 
                    hope he knows that.  We re both 
                      democrats.  That s one thing.  But 
                    if he thinks the Republicans are 
                    gonna stop shooting --

                                  LUCKY
                    Someone s gotta stop shooting 
                    first, Senator.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    You stop shooting and you get shot.

                                  LUCKY
                    I respect you, Senator.  You may 
                    not know this, but I m still 
                      registered to vote in California.  
                    Something I ve done for you in 
                    every election you ve ever run in.                                                                                      56.

                                  LUCKY (CONT'D)
                    I even made signs for your first 
                    campaign.

      Buckley simply stares, knows the big punch is coming.

                                  LUCKY (CONT D)
                    With or without you, we will change 
                    this country.  You wanna play games 
                    with the foreclosure freeze?  Even 
                    if it means families will lose 
                    their homes?  Just because you re 
                    Ellen Buckley, goddamn it?  Just 
                    because you think you deserve to be 
                    attorney general?  

      It hangs there.  Lucky knows he s gotten to her...

                                  LUCKY (CONT D)
                    That s why you didn t get the job, 
                    Senator.  It s also why, in two 
                    years, I won t be voting for you. 

      With that, he walks off, leaving Buckley alone amid the 
      endless gravestones.

      Then she remembers something, looks around to make sure no 
      one s watching, and reaches into the trash can to pull out 
      the file.  



      Hope pauses to pull on her shoes.  A cab waits.

                                  BEN (O.S.) 
                    I didn t know we had a date.

      She sees him coming up the sidewalk in his uniform.  His eyes 
      wander down her dress.

                                  HOPE
                    You wish.  Webster s party.                                                                                    58.


      She moves down the steps, passing him on her way to the cab.

                                  BEN 
                    Hope, I might not ask again.

                                  HOPE
                    I didn t hear you ask the      
                    first time.

      Ben just stands there, watching her go.  Only once she s in 
      the backseat, and driving away does she let herself smile.



      Storm clouds gather over the Hill, as the housemates unwind.  

      Jessica sits removed from the others, reading People Are 
      Idiots and I Can Prove It!

      Hope sits with Charlie and Miles.  Each going over their next 
      day s work.  

      Ruby sits on the roof, beaming as she carefully cuts out a 
      front page story from the Post.  The headline: 

                            FORECLOSURE FREEZE PASSES SENATE

      Beneath is a photo of Buckley, Mullin and a few OTHER 
      SENATORS smiling proudly, shaking hands with the Lunds.

      Just when we re wondering about Ben, he steps from the door.

      His eyes go to Hope, and hers to him.  She s excited to    
      see him, and doesn t hide it.

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.)
                    ...After all, sweet girl, do people 
                    ever really change?

      That s when BEN S SCANTILY CLAD DATE appears in the door 
      behind him.  Hope s face falls.

                                  HOPE S MOM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...I guess that s something you ll 
                    have to find out for yourself.

      Suddenly, the sky opens, and it starts to rain.

      Everyone rushes for the door, but Ben s date has let it 
      close.  Ben tries to stop it, but he s too late.       
      They re locked out.

      Jessica is furious, her paper work ruined.  Charlie tucks his 
      laptop under his shirt.  

      They re all YELLING at each other, when Hope starts to LAUGH.  
      She throws her hands out, and looks to the sky.

      For a moment, they look at her like she s crazy.  Then 
      Charlie s LAUGHING, too.  Ben notices this and smiles.

      Finally, it s only Jessica left POUNDING on the door.  And..

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                            THE END
