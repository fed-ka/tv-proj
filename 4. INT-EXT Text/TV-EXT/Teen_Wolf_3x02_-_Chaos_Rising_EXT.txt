      FADE IN:


      Hurrying along the sidewalk of a suburban neighborhood, 
      Stiles glances over to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    What?              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/132.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you mean what?

                                  STILES
                    I mean what. And you know what. 

                                  SCOTT
                    What what?

                                  STILES
                    That look you were giving.

                                  SCOTT
                    I wasn t giving a look.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, there was a distinct look.

                                  SCOTT
                    What look?

                                  STILES
                    The one that says the last thing 
                    you feel like doing is going to a 
                    party.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s not that. It just feels a 
                    little weird going to a different 
                    high school s party.

                                  STILES
                    One drink, you ll be fine. I went 
                    to nursery school with this girl. 
                    She promised to introduce us to all 
                    of her friends. So no Allison, no 
                    Lydia. We re moving on.

      Scott glances to his phone seeing a MISSED CALL from Allison. 
      But he slips the phone back into his pocket.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re right.

                                  STILES
                    That s right I m right.

                                  SCOTT
                    Moving on.

                                  STILES
                    Onward and upward.              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/133.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let s do this.

                                  STILES
                    That s what I m talking about.

      They turn down a walkway to the door of an upscale house.

                                  SCOTT
                    How s my breath?

                                  STILES
                    I m not smelling your breath.

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you have any gum?

                                  STILES
                    No gum. You re fine.

                                  SCOTT
                    Can you at least tell me what kind 
                    of party it is?


      Stepping away from the house, Scott hurries to the sidewalk 
      where he finds Allison waiting under a streetlight. But he 
      slows when he notices Lydia as well.

                                  SCOTT
                    This isn t the talk we were going 
                    to have, is it?

      Allison shakes her head. Then pulls up her sleeve to reveal 
      the mark on her arm.


      In the underpass leading to the athletics field, Lydia and 
      Allison hold their arms together, forming the complete symbol 
      on their skin. Derek stands before them while Scott and 
      Stiles look on at his sides.

      Derek raises his eyes to meet Allison s. Neither of them 
      blink, glaring at each other.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t see anything.

                                  SCOTT
                    Look again.

                                  DEREK
                    How is a bruise going to tell me 
                    where Erica and Boyd are?

                                  SCOTT
                    It s the same on both arms. Exactly 
                    the same.

                                  DEREK
                    It s nothing.

                    What she said.

                                  SCOTT
                    Take another look.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t need to.

                    They re trying to help.

                    resurrect my psychotic uncle. And

                                  STILES
                    Hey, no one died. There might have 
                    been some maiming. A little 
                    mangling. But no death. I call that 
                    an important distinction.

                                    ALLISON
                    My mother died.

                                  DEREK
                    Your family s little honor code 
                    killed your mother. Not me.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, can everyone back off for a 
                    second?

                                    ALLISON
                          (to Derek)
                    That girl was looking for Scott. 
                    I m here to help him. Not you.

                                  DEREK
                    You want to help? Find something 
                    real.

      He turns to go. Scott follows, stopping him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Give her a chance. We re all on the 
                    same side now.

                                  DEREK
                    Then maybe you should tell her what 
                    her mother was actually trying to 
                    do that night.

      Derek pushes past him, heading out of the underpass.


      A hand reaches up to grasp the CHAINS wrapped around the 
      bank s entrance doors. Allison gives a yank, but it s locked 
      tight. She examines the padlock. Then lets it drop.

      Slowly retreating back from the ominous building, Allison s 
      gaze falls on the image that brought her here. The bank s 
      LOGO, a decal on the glass doors.

      Exactly the same as the pattern left on her and Lydia s arm.

      When she finally turns to hurry to her car, something else 
      appears just behind the logo. A PAIR OF GLOWING RED EYES 
      watching her car roar off into the night.


      Doors clicking open on her car, Allison gets out for the 
      school day, followed by Lydia.

                                  LYDIA
                    So Mystery Girl leaves a bruise on 
                    our arms that turns out to be the 
                    logo for a bank. What s she trying 
                    to do? Give us investment advice?

                                    ALLISON
                    Not at this bank. It s been closed 
                    for years.

                                  LYDIA
                    So why aren t you telling Scott?

                                    ALLISON
                    Because according to someone I need 
                    to find something real.

      Allison opens her trunk, grabbing her school bag from it.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Which reminds me. I can t drive you 
                    home today. I ve got an errand to 
                    run after school.

      Eyeing the very large pair of BOLT CUTTERS inside, Allison 
      slams the trunk closed.

      Just a few spaces down from them, the doors of Stiles s Jeep 
      swing open. Scott steps out reading a TEXT on his phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    We meet at Derek s at five to go 
                    over the plan. Then we start as 
                    soon as it gets dark.

                                  STILES
                    What do we do until then?            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/1330.

                                  SCOTT
                    Right now? We ve got English.

      They head into the school, double doors CLANGING SHUT behind 
      them.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      The glass doors of the bank. Allison raises the bolt cutters 
      to the chains and quickly severs the metal links. As they 
      fall to a pile at her feet, she gently presses a nervous hand 
      to the door and gives a light push. 

      The door swings slowly open.


      Making a cautious approach through the alley behind the rear 
      of the bank, Scott and Derek pause beneath the fire escape. 
      Scott reaches for one of the rungs, but then notices 
      something.

                                  SCOTT
                    Now I kind of wish we d let Stiles 
                    come.

                    Why?            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/1337.

                    Because he d be able to come up 
                    with something better than I told 
                    you so.

      He points to the BANK NAME and LOGO on the rear door. The 
      same exact symbol bruised onto Allison and Lydia s arm.

                                  DEREK
                    Shut up and climb.

      Grabbing hold of a ladder rung, Scott pauses again.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    What?

                    Something I can t get out of my 
                    head.

                                  DEREK
                    The moon s rising, Scott. What is 
                    it?

                    But think about it. They put the

                    me.

      Derek grabs the steel rung of the fire escape and begins to 
      climb. With a last glance at the rising moon, Scott reaches 
      up to follow.


      The CITY LIGHTS of Beacon Hills flicker brilliantly 
      underneath a massive full moon. 

      TWO OMINOUS SILHOUETTES slowly approach the edge of the 
      cliffside. Breathing low, fierce growls through fanged teeth, 
      Boyd and Cora turn a murderous gaze on the unwitting town 
      below them.
