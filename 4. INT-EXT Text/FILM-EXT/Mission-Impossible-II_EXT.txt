near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now
traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet
exposed to the earth far below.
He's clinging to the mountain
almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.
When he reaches for a
handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a
lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of
feet to oblivion.
ETHAN
Whoaa..
He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.
REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT
with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the
summit.
He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who
favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.
To
lizard:
ETHAN
You're welcome.
The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back
attracts his attention.
He turns to see the source of the
beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo
streamer.
Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now
ominously circling back.
Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of
the copter.
With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.
The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.
Ethan has
opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.
ETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES
First, a retinal scan.
ELECTRONIC VOICE
Identity confirmed.
SWANBECK
Good morning, Mr. Hunt.
Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen.
Over his introduction of Nyah
is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive
she never seems to give the camera a clean shot.
SWANBECK'S VOICE
Your mission, should you choose to accept
it, requires you to recover a stolen item,
designated Chimera.
Essential to the
mission is the recruitment of a civilian --
a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall.
She is a highly
capable professional thief currently
active in Spain.
A series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i.e., warrants, complaints,
Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as
glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville.
SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
Her dossier's available on I-COM 3.
You
have 48 hours to recruit Ms. Nordoff-Hall
and meet me in Seville to receive further
details.
Should you or any member of your
IM force be caught or killed, the
Secretary will disavow all knowledge of
your actions.
Swanbeck's face reappears on screen:
SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
And Mr. Hunt - the next time you go on
vacation, please be good enough to let us
know where you're going.
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.
Ethan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space.
ETHAN
If I let you know where I'm going -
The glasses explode in a puff of smoke.
ETHAN (cont'd)
- won't be on holiday.
Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps
off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal
snit.
Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a
little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his
back-pack.
Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries
of flamenco dancers.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)
Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving
guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen,
exits her car and enters the villa.
where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands
wielding the castanets.
The dancers perform on a raised platform
and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling
skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.
REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN
looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the
relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the
crowed party.
Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder
over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.
Nyah
offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to
the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one
another.
Ethan approaches her.
ETHAN
Do you know me?
NYAH
No.
Should I?
ETHAN
No.
You just looked as if you did.
NYAH
No.
Just as if I'd like to.
ETHAN
Oh.
Well.
I think that can be arranged.
NYAH
Not tonight.
Bad timing.
Sorry -
ETHAN
There's not enough time in the world for
any of it to be bad.
This stops her.
Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose
to nose.
Whispered but breezy:
NYAH
Look, it's either you or the rent and I
don't mind telling you it's not an easy
choice.
ETHAN
What if I pay the rent?
NYAH
Uh-huh.
ETHAN
Uh-huh?
Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink
then:
NYAH
Go find the wealthy lady you came with and
next time we meet - I'll pay your rent.
(kissing him, sweetly)
Now bugger off.
And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated
desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of
the dancer's steps to cover her own.
Once upstairs, a security
guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to
Ethan.
In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the
windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.
In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard
can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the
hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.
Ethan smiles, moves out
of shot.
INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)
Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.
INT - BATH (EVE)
A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored
walls.
The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler
chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of
ice.
Nyah can't resist.
She spoons a dollop of the caviar and
downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to
its back.
There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff,
revealing an electronic density meter.
She turns it on and holds
it at the rear of the tub.
Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from
green thru yellow and into red.
NYAH
(her fondest hopes confirmed)
Mmmm.
She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the
tiles just above the sop dish.
Her knee eyes search for any
cracks in the grout and she spots one.
Using a tweezers she
pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing
something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.
She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.
There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble
casing out from the rear of the tub.
Nyah breathes a sigh of
relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself
looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked
compartments.
As she studies them:
ETHAN
Decisions, decisions.
Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom
mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.
NYAH
What are you doing here?
ETHAN
Think you're the only one who can pick a
lock?
NYAH
(not altogether pleased)
I see.
You're not just another pretty face..
Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the
bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.
NYAH (cont'd)
Oh god.
A bloody baritone.
Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.
She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the
tub, pulling him down on top of her.
Once again they're nose to
nose.
ETHAN
I take it you prefer tenors.
She glances up at the mirror.
In it is the reflection of SENOR
AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's
changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.
He
breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and
disappears from the dressing room mirror.
NYAH
Would you mind if I'm on top?
ETHAN
Oh, either way works for me.
With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins
working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque
wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara
brush.
She glances down and is rather disconcerted.
Continues
working with the pick and wrench.
ETHAN'S VOICE
You're never gonna find it there.
NYAH
(she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)
Damn it!
Find what?
ETHAN
His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes
up for auction Tuesday.
Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:
LOOKING UP
more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against
the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's
lower pelvic region as she straddles him.
Not exactly in the mood
to move:
She stiffens - he knows too damn much.
NYAH
- right..where is it?
ETHAN
Far right.
She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
bottom right compartment.
She's utterly nonplussed:
NYAH
Where's the bloody -
ETHAN
(plucking it off his chest,
offering it up like a mechanic
under the chassis)
- torque wrench.
NYAH
- this is very disconerting..
ETHAN
Hey, you put me here.
I just do what I'm
told.
NYAH
- right..
She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque
wrench and carbide pick - and it's open.
She withdraws a velvet
pouch and opens the pouch.
Out spills the spectacular necklace.
NYAH (cont'd)
Lovely.
(starting to close the safe)
Who are you and what's it going to cost me?
ETHAN
(having sat up)
I wouldn't do that.
NYAH
Do what?
The alarm goes off.
ETHAN
That.
The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn
Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in.
SENOR DE L'ARENA
Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you!
(in Spanish to security guards,
annoyed)
It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer.
ETHAN
Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is
that the heat sensors were activated.
But
Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate -
Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.
SENOR DE L'ARENA
Mucho gusto, senorita.
ETHAN
- did feel that she had rather too long to
work on the safe before they triggered the
alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall?
NYAH
Oh yes.
Absolutely.
Much too long I
should yes.
Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary,
intensified curiosity - about Ethan.
ETHAN
Under the circumstances I think we would
recommend re-setting the senors to
respond to a lighter load.
How do you
feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
NYAH
Indeed.
ETHAN
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason
to disrupt your party any longer.
we have
some further concerns about the disposition
of your security guards, which you'll
receive in our written report by fax in the
morning, hard copy to follow.
Shall we?
He offers Nyah his arm.
They start out.
Ethan immediately stops.
ETHAN (cont'd)
Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten
something?
Nyah looking genuinely puzzled.
NYAH
The necklace?
Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering
string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.
SENOR DE L'ARENA
(a great kidder)
What are you trying to do, senorita?
Rob
me.
They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door.
EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)
The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.
Ethan and Nyah
emerge from the villa, walking slowly.
Nyah's clearly
preoccupied.
NYAH
I'm missing something here, aside from a
500,000 pound necklace.
Even after I
botched the job, I could've walked out of
there with the bloody thing.
ETHAN
At least you walked.
NYAH
If you weren't going to let me get away
with it, why did you let me go thru with
it?
ETHAN
Wanted to see how good you were.
I'm hoping we might work together.
NYAH
May I say something, no offence?
You
look like a gigolo, you sound like a
thief, you act like a cop - what the
bloody hell do you have in mind?
ETHAN
Working under adverse conditions.
Highly
adverse conditions.
NYAH
Sounds smashing.
I'm in.
Muchacho, mi
carro, por favor!
Now be serious.
You
couldn't possibly want me off tonight's
performance..
ETHAN
You didn't do that badly.
Her car arrives.
NYAH
(as she moves to her car)
You're apologizing for me?
Quite the
gentleman..
ETHAN
(opening the car door)
Not really.
I triggered the alarm..
One foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to Ethan.
ETHAN
Hey, the Bulgari job last week was
flawless.
And I've always been partial to
pale yellows.
She slides behind the wheel.
NYAH
(as he leads on the car)
I don't do laundry, or put up with
cheeky bastards who set me up on their
territory so they can poach on mine.
She takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake.
Ethan smiles and shakes his head.
ON THE ROAD - NYAH (MOVING)
around curves, hair flying, she's free.
Her car phone rings.
Perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up:
NYAH
(tentatively)
Hola..
ETHAN
Hi.
Would you mind slowing down?
NYAH
Where did you get this number?
I don't
even have it!
ETHAN' VOICE
Would you like it?
She hits the End button and disconnects.
The phone immediately
rings again.
She refuses to pick up.
Ethan pulls alongside hers.
She looks at him.
They speak through the open cars.
ETHAN
Pull over and listen to me, will you?
Just listen..
NYAH
Listen to what?
ETHAN
I need your help and I thin you can use
mine.
NYAH
Your help?
What are you talking about?
ETHAN
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch
authority.
I can make them go away.
NYAH
Oh bloody hell.
You're a spy.
She floors it and shoots ahead of Ethan, nicking his car as she takes off.
ETHAN
(to himself)
I deserved that.
SERIES OF DRIVING SHOTS - NYAH AND ETHAN
Ethan rings her again.
And keeps ringing.
Her face becomes
grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethan's
pursuit progressively more determined.
They are reaching the
limits of adhesion around blind curves.
MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)
The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin
turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of
marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.
Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in
this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank
and sees on his GPS what Nyah can't see thru the fog -
less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly
negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of
feet to rock and sea below.
Ringing her number again:
ETHAN
(half to himself)
Slow down, slow down.
She turns up a mound and loses control.
She spins out and heads
toward the edge of the cliff.
NYAH
(realizing she's in trouble)
Uh-oh.
Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin.
Her car stops just at the cliff's edge.
Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.
ETHAN
No!
Suddenly there's no Nyah.
Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and
sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet
below, holding the door handle.
NYAH
Oh..oh..
Taking a firm grip on her wrist.
ETHAN
Don't look down.
Just..look at me.
That's it..that's it..
He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into
his arms.
For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.
Then:
NYAH
What's you name?
ETHAN
Ethan Hunt.
NYAH
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to
talk to me about?
Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.
Her dark eyes
suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.
ETHAN
...more than I thought..
They scarcely to move to bring their lips together:
NYAH
Awfully short notice..
ETHAN
Care to wait a decent interval?
NYAH
Who wants to be decent?..
DISSOLVE:
sleeping.
His eyes open slowly.
He comes to full consciousness,
his head still on the pillow.
Something approaching serious
anxiety informs his features.
He lifts his head and looks at his
left, angle widening.
Nyah lies on her side facing him,
sleeping serenely.
Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't-
approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed.
He lets his head flop
back on the pillow.
Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to-
profile.
As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced
by curiosity and even wonder.
He lifts his hand and just
brushes her cheek.
Her eyes open.
She knows where she is.
ETHAN
So what've you got against spooks?
Nyah smiles.
NYAH
When they've got your recruiting
technique?
Not a thing.
ETHAN
Oh.
Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
NYAH
They've got a book for this?
ETHAN
They've got a book for everything.
NYAH
The only other spook I knew was a liar.
Charming but absolutely incapable of
telling the truth.
He'd lie about his
favorite color.
But then I reckon it's an
occupational hazard.
All spies really do
is conceal the truth and tell lies.
ETHAN
Not revealing information doesn't
necessarily make someone a liar.
NYAH
That's not the point.
In the end what
spies rely on is the one thing they think
they know that you don't.
ETHAN
Which is?
NYAH
That they're lying.
Ethan laughs.
NYAH (cont'd)
..once they know that they can
get very very..crosee..
Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan.
ETHAN
So where did I got right?
NYAH
You're not a liar.
Or you're an awfully
good one..
(then)
..this thing these blokes pinched..
ETHAN
I don't know that they 'pinched' it.
Don't even know that they're blokes.
Nyah stops to think about this.
NYAH
Well, then, what I am I doing here?
I assume
I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to
catch-a-thief..
ETHAN
So do I.
Sort of.
Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.
NYAH
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
ETHAN
Of what?
Nyah laughs.
NYAH
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
ETHAN
Damn, you're beautiful.
NYAH
That's because I'm on my back.
Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down
at him.
ETHAN
I don't think so.
She sinks into his arms.
EXT-INT - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)
Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his
way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema
portion of the Fallas de Valencia.
On this night great papier
mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the
city and torched in great bonfires.
Outside the bar Ethan's
looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and
flowers.
He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going
to buy some flowers.
He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be
seen on the petals.
Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar,
and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.
Turns back to the vendor.
ETHAN
Are you gonna be here a while?
VENDOR
Si, senor.
ETHAN
I'll pick'em up on my way out, okay?
Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where
he passes security at a pair of double doors.
INT - IMF BRIEFING ROOM
Swanbeck stands looking out the window.
Noisy crowds from the
festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the
first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid
background thru briefing room's window.
SWANBECK
Fetival's a pain in the ass.
Honoring
saint by setting'em on fire.
(turning to Ethan)
Sit down, sit down.
Ethan sits.
SWANBECK (cont'd)
Let's you know what they think of saints,
doesn't it?
Damn near set me on fire on
my way over here.
As if I haven't been
burned enough today.
A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is
going to blow between these two.
Then civilly:
SWANBECK (cont'd)
Sorry I barged in on your vacation.
ETHAN
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
SWANBECK
Don't be.
Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
ETHAN
Well.
You're sorry and I'm sorry.
SWANBECK
Why did you phrase it like that?
ETHAN
Like what?
SWANBECK
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
ETHAN
You gotta be kidding.
Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD, and
projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is:
VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH
NEKHORVICH
(with exaggerate brio)
Well, Dmitri!
How are you?..
Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply.
Ethan smiles.
ETHAN
..I'm fine..and you?
NEKHORVICH
I'm fine..
Ethan laughs.
ETHAN
I'm fine and you're fine..
With Ethan simultaneously whispering:
NEKHORVICH
I'm fine too.. I'm fine and you're fine - do
you remember, dear fried, how you got
Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr.
Strangelove and we gave you the name of that
silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know
your name?..In those days, you not only
saved our lives, you saved our sanity.
'Now,
then Dmitri - we have this little problem':
Every search for a hero must begin with
something that every hero requires; a
villain.
Therefore, in a search for our
hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster
Chimera.
I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney
and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.
However we travel, I must arrive at me
destination, within 20 hours of departure.
Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for
now prudence dictates that I communicate
nothing but the gravest urgency.
I fear I can entrust this to no one but
you, Dmitri.
as we say, 'I'm sorry and
you're sorry'..
Swanbeck stops the DVD.
SWANBECK
Let me ask you something.
You have any
idea what the hell he's talking about?
Ethan smiles.
ETHAN
An idea, yeah.
SWANBECK
Like?
ETHAN
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a
hurry.
And a bad idea to fly him on a
commercial carrier.
So let's get on with
it.
He's still in Sydney?
SWANBECK
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.
So is his
colleague, Gradski, but that happened
earlier.
We had Nekhorvich on a flight
from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Ethan sits back, heavily.
SWANBECK (cont'd)
- Hunt, are you listening?..
Slowly looking up:
ETHAN
If he didn't want to go anywhere without
me, how did you get him on the flight?
SWANBECK
You were there.
Swanbeck clears his throat.
He turns back to the computer and
punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.
File open to computer scans
of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and
comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat,
as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy
scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image.
ETHAN
slowly looks up at Swanbeck.
SWANBECK
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace
you.
Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.
He double you, what?
Two, three times?
ETHAN
Twice.
SWANBECK
What did you think of him?
ETHAN
You know we had reservations about each
other.
Isn't it a little late in the day
to be asking me that?
SWANBECK
Not necessarily.
Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain.
SWANBECK
Airline record list Captain Harold
Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.
as
far as the media and all governmental
agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh
died on the flight, but in fact he missed
it.
He did, however make the next flight -
in cargo, stuffed into a rather small
suitcase considering his size.
Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially
obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.
SWANBECK (cont'd)
Someone on that flight planned an
operation designed to down the plane and
make it look like an accident.
Someone
skillful enough to bring the whole thing
off without a hitch but - they don't
always get your luggage on the plane, even
when you fly first class.
ETHAN
So there's one thing we know Ambrose
doesn't.
SWANBECK
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Ethan barely nods.
SWANBECK (cont'd)
And you're not surprised.
Ethan gives Swanbeck a look.
ETHAN
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean
wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
that he took it.
SWANBECK
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
innocent passengers?
Ethan smiles.
ETHAN
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
SWANBECK
The question is why?
What was this
Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Ethan rises and moves to the window.
ETHAN
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
SWANBECK
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera
and bring it to us.
ETHAN
In order to do that, I've got to figure
out how he plans to make money with it.
SWANBECK
- right.
In fact since the plane went
down our banking sources have confirmed a
marked increase in the stock pilling of
cash in terrorists accounts.
ETHAN
'Terrorists?'
SWANBECK
Well you know Nekhorvich's history.
You're the one who got him out of the
Soviet Union was it still in bio-
weapon business.
ETHAN
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose
would have set up a bidding situation with
any number of buyers before he got on the
plane.
Locating him in time to stop
something like that -
SWANBECK
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
ETHAN
(blindsided)
Excuse me?
SWANBECK
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
which he took very seriously.
She walked
away and he's wanting her back ever
since.
We believe she's our surest and
quickest way of location him.
ETHAN
(acidly)
And then what?
SWANBECK
Then makes sure she continues to see him.
Gets him confide in her and report to
you.
ETHAN
You made it sound as if I was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief.
SWANBECK
Well, then I mislead you.
Or you made the
wrong assumption.
Either way we're asking
her to resume a prior relationship, not do
anything she hasn't already done.
ETHAN
She's got no training for this kind of
thing.
SWANBECK
Go to bed with a man and lie to him?
She's a woman.
She's got all the training
she needs.
Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.
ETHAN
I don't think I can get her to do it.
SWANBECK
You mean it'll be difficult.
ETHAN
Very.
SWANBECK
Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt.
It's mission impossible.
Difficult should
be a walk in the park for you.
If you can
think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose,
you're welcome to try.
Oh, by the way, you
might want to take a look at these..if you
have any further qualms about getting her
to do the job.
He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the
one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security).
Swanbeck sets it on
the table.
Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.
EXT - BAR (NIGHT)
A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever
more lively crowd.
as he does:
STREET VENDOR
Senor, senor!
Your flowers.
The vendor holds up the spring bouquet.
Ethan seems genuinely
surprised by them.
ETHAN
Yes.
They're very nice..
And he's lost in the crowd, leaving a very puzzled vendor holding
the bouquet.
STILL OF CRASH SITE IN ROCKIES (THRU MINOLTA STILL CAMERA)
One after the other flashing by.
They are more evocative than
specific in their suggestion of an abrupt, fiery, ending, where
the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart
and strewn over a desolate landscape.
NYAH
carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee
table.
She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the
lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto
the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of
champagne chilling.
There's a light breeze the fire from the
burning effigies throwing smoke and flame all over the city.
NYAH
What's the population of Seville any
idea?
ETHAN
Five, six-hundred thousand.
NYAH
There's nearly 2 million in London.
ETHAN
And six billion in the world.
NYAH
That's lot of people out there..how many
of them, I wonder, are capable of
something like that?
ETHAN
Sean Ambrose, for one.
A long shocked moment.
Nyah laughs.
NYAH
Right...
INT - SAFEHOUSE (EVE - LATER)
The pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room
Nyah's back to Ethan:
NYAH
(grimly amused)
Not that it matter much but..I seem to
recall you staying something like, 'I was
hoping we could work together.'
ETHAN
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
NYAH
But it is what you'd like me to do.
so tell me to do it..
She approaches Ethan.
They're inches apart.
NYAH (cont'd)
Come on, out with it.
Tell me to go and
insinuate myself back into Sean's life.
ETHAN
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's
life.
NYAH
I'd like a little more conviction..
ETHAN
So would I.
But it's not mine to give.
NYAH
(archness there)
You've either got it or you don't.
Let
your conscience be your guide?
ETHAN
Something like that.
With a smile and a wink.
NYAH
But I don't have a conscience.
I'm a
bloody thief.
ETHAN
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
NYAH
No.
You can be a thief and have a
conscience:
Not me.
Why did you have to
tell me about this!
(pouring herself a drink)
What do I have to do to get away from this
guy?
When you're with him, he messes
about with your head every waking
moment..even now I'll be at some out-of-
the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a
bottle of Crystal shows up at the table,
with two glass, God knows how he finds
out at any given moment where I am in the
world but he does.
And it looks like he's
done it again.
You know his definition of
a
true paranoid?
ETHAN
I don't.
NYAH
Someone in possession of all the facts.
(she turns away, pauses)
Are you telling me I have to do this?
ETHAN
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone.
Not when there's a chance my life could
end up in their hands.
NYAH
And that's the only reason?
ETHAN
Can you think of a better one?
NYAH
Not me.
I was just hoping you might..or
that..somehow in the course of business
this got personal as well as physical.
ETHAN
Look, would it make you feel better if I
didn't want you to do this?
NYAH
Much.
ETHAN
Then feel better!..
Long moment while she looks at him.
ETHAN (cont'd)
Well.
That made all the difference in the
world, didn't it?
Ethan walks out onto the balcony.
She looks at his back.
NYAH
Sean will never be anything but suspicious
if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm-
not-nad' message.
Not after the way we
broke up.
ETHAN
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
NYAH
Probably that I needed him in some urgent
way..destitute - in serious trouble..the
kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Ethan's been smiling slightly.
ETHAN
Serious trouble, Nyah, is something I can
always arrange..
NYAH IN A SPANISH JAIL

On the screen of the GPS computer, a little yellow blip appears
pulsating on the screen.
ETHAN'S VOICE
When it's in your ankle we can track you

OVER ETHAN AND ONTO COMPUTER SCREEN
He types a small Interpol bulletin stating that Nyah Nordoff
Hall, apprehended March 13 in Seville, is awaiting extradition
while the authorities in London, Paris, and Amsterdam squabble
over where she's going to be tried first, for the various thefts
and burglaries she's committed in the three cities.
COMPUTER SCREEN (AMBROSE TENT ANNEX - DAY)
Ambrose picking up on a version of the Interpol bulletin Ethan's
put out.
He leans over the screen for a moment, then moves to
the window, and stares out thoughtful at the bay, almost as if
he were watching...
EXT - NYAH IN JAIL COURTYARD
From a beautiful blue sky,

His attention fixed on the screen, Ethan stares at satellite
shot of Nyah in the jail courtyard.
INT - PRISON - NYAH
being allowed a phone call, a prison guard visible b.g.
Cross
cut with Ethan.
ETHAN
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but
I guarantee he's monitoring every law
enforcement agency in the world, for what
they might be saying about him, if nothing
else - he's got the ability and, we
assume, the desire to get you out of
there.
NYAH
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing
much.
ETHAN
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.
It is
keeping a very capable thief off the
street..
NYAH
Very funny..maybe he has heard and
doesn't want to know.
Maybe he's lost
interest.
Her guard, b.g. is handed a note.
GUARD
(to Nyah)
Your lawyer to see you.
NYAH
What lawyer?
ETHAN AND COMPUTER SCREEN
ETHAN
Well, here we go.
SECTOR: AUSTRALIA, moving into NEW SOUTH WALES, and then to:

EXT - GOVERNMENT BUILDING - SEVILLE (DAY)
Nyah emerges from the entrance to the jail.
ETHAN
Stop and look for something in you
purse..kneel down..
She does.
They're effectively blocked from the street.
NYAH
Limo's waiting.
Ethan hands her a key chain with what appear to be a car-key.
ETHAN
- Ambrose will have counter-surveillance
second to no one's.
When and if he
contacts you, push this button
before you actually end up under his roof
it'll scramble your transmission to us.
She takes the key chain.
Her hands are shaking.
NYAH
When will you be there?
ETHAN
Before you are.
NYAH
How can you possibly?
I've got to get
right on the plane.
I'm leaving now.
ETHAN
You don't trust me.
NYAH
Oh, I do.
But as we know I'm a very poor
judge of character.
ETHAN
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.
It's
going to be delayed.
NYAH
Yes?
ETHAN
You'll be fine.
I'm going to lose
you.
NYAH
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll
take care of myself because if push comes
to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without
giving two week notice.
ETHAN
Well, forewarned is forearmed.
And while
we're at it, be especially sensitive to
any sudden change in Ambrose's plans,
especially any involving you..
They rise.
A quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone.
A look of
something like longing replaces the toughness as she gazes after
him, then starts across the street toward the limo and driver.

Billy and Luther emerge, Luther with computer looking acutely
uncomfortable in a wrinkled suit.
ETHAN'S VOICE
Welcome to Australia, mate.
They look up to a smiling Ethan who points to the ground beneath
Luther's feet.
Luther looks down to see that he is standing in a
pile of sheep-shit.
LUTHER
Thanks - mate.
Both men laugh and all three move to:
INT - FARMHOUSE (DAY)
Luther and Billy with Ethan setting up their operation.
There's
a blip on one of the screens.
LUTHER
It's the transponder.
ETHAN
Put in the coordinates and let's get a
visual.
The visuals aren't coming up.
LUTHER
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I
do.
BILLY
Yeah, I've heard about you, Luther, and I
just want to tell you it's an honor and a
pleasure to be working with you blokes,
whoaa!
That's some transponder!
As Billy speaks, the visual come on line and Nyah has become
visible.
LUTHER
(a jaundiced eye, to Ethan)
It certainly is.
How did we get so lucky?
Ethan pointedly ignore the question.
POV - MOVING (PALM BEACH - DAY)
rounding the tip of the bay's crescent, revealing the beach and
dock at Ambrose's palm-lined residence.
NYAH
The speedboat's engine's are cut.
Nyah looks momentarily
stricken.
POV NYAH (MOVING)
a lone slender figure silhouetted at the end of the dock, still
as the piling besides which it stands.
But the features remain
obscured by the sun at his back.
ETHAN
leans forward as the slender figure grows larger,
BILLY
(to Ethan)
Is it him, then?
POV - MOVING
The tide is too low for the boat to dock, making it necessary for
he boat to approach the shore.
The slender figure moves off the
end of the dock and onto the beach.
THE CIGARETTE
idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the
sand - the boatman grumbles he can't get any closer.
The slender
figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light
changes - Ambrose is waiting.
Nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side
into thigh-high water without taking her eyes off Ambrose.
Ambrose strides right on into the bay.
as they are just an arm's
length apart:
NYAH
takes a deep breath, presses the button to scramble the
transponder.
Perfectly poised, still loosely in his arms, Nyah returns
Ambrose's penetrating gaze with a pleasant, clear eyed one.
AMBROSE
Not much luggage.
NYAH
I left in a bit of a hurry.
I'm terribly
grateful, Sean.
AMBROSE
How grateful?
NYAH
Well that depends.
AMBROSE
On what.
NYAH
How hard you had to work to get me out of
there..how in the world did you ever find me?
AMBROSE
(stopping)
How I usually find you, Nyah.
NYAH
How do you that.
AMBROSE
Magic...
NYAH
Ahh..
POV THRU TENT ANNEX WINDOW (AMBROSE COMPOUND)
looking down the length of the dock.
Ambrose, his arm around
Nyah and carrying her suitcase, moves up the dock toward the
house and camera.
Stamp steps into the annex and looks over to Wallis, who watches
Nyah on the monitors.
WALLIS
No flies on her.

No bugs either.
She's clean.

Chimera.
Ethan then flips through a series of pictures on the computer
depicting the myth of Bellerophon attacking Chimera.
Billy moves up behind him.
BILLY
What you got there, mate?
ETHAN
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be
checking out their countersurveillance?
BILLY
Well you know his blokes'll place the
OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're
pinpointing transmitters, video signals,
covert chip cameras, anything radiating,
oscillating..
ETHAN
..or hard wired..
BILLY
(please)
- or hard wired, right.
First line of
perimeter defence'll run from the back of
the dock to the front of the house.
Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be
picked up to a height of twenty feet.
Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
LUTHER
Ethan, here's Nekhorvich, and here's his

Luther scans an entry from the IMF database with newspaper
clippings, sidebars of still of McCloy and Nekhorvich.
LUTHER (cont'd)

BILLY
(a little lost)
Well do you disagree with that?
ETHAN
Not at all.
But how about going into town
and confirming your intuitions on site?
BILLY
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Billy leaves.
LUTHER
..then Cambridge..Harvard..entrepreneurial

Ethan, have a look at this.
On Ethan's screen appears the Biocyte website; where among he
various icons one offer McCloy's proud detailing of Biocyte's
philanthropic efforts:
MCCLOY'S VOICE

vigilance is the price of health.. whether
it's funding the teaching center at the
Royal Prince Edward Hospital, removing
aerosol products from the marker or
braving the influenza quarantine at Bruny

INT - AMBROSE'S (DAY)
They've reached the head of the stairs.
Ambrose opens a door.
It's a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the
tent annex and the beach, and a very large bed.
NYAH
Your room.
AMBROSE
(yes)
Mmmm.
NYAH
And my room?
A long moment.
Ambrose walks to a mirrored wall.
The mirrors
are sliding doors.
With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the
mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer
clothes.
AMBROSE
Thought you could use a little something
to wear.
Nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe.
Ambrose pulls out a
slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed.
AMBROSE ( cont'd)
Try it on..
Nyah hesitates.
AMBROSE (cont'd)
Go ahead.
I'm dying to see if I
remembered your size..
Nyah picks it up.
NYAH
No changing room?
Ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits.
Her blouse,
belt, skirt, fall on the bed.
As her slender arm reaches down to
pick up the Armani:
AMBROSE
grips her wrist, the flimsy Armani dangling in the air.
CLOSE - NYAH
meeting Ambrose's look.
NYAH
You're not interested in seeing how it
looks.
AMBROSE
Oh, I am.
Later..
The Armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor.
CLOSE - ETHAN (DUSK)
standing off to one side, listening to Nekhorvich's voice.
NEKHORVICH
..therefore in a search for our hero,
Bellerophon, we created a monster,
Chimera.
LUTHER
Why's Nekhorvich going on about an old Greek myth?
ETHAN
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA
molecules.
In the myth, Bellerophon killed
Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head
of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
plagued the ancient world.
I think Nekhorvich
has created a monster virus in Chimera and
apparently the means to kill it in
Bellerophon.
LUTHER
That simple, huh?
ETHAN
Why not?
with no sound, the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until
horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the
sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting and gasping for
jostling and going to the whip, the sound of the crowd
overwhelming all but the announcer's voice carrying everyone
around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing,
controlled frenzy.
EXT - PRIVATE BLEACHER (DAY)
Nyah and Ambrose rising as the horses cross the finish.
AMBROSE
(surprised)
You won.
NYAH

I suppose I did.
AMBROSE
What made you pick that nag?
She'd never
won a bloody thing.
NYAH
'Thief in the Night?'
AMBROSE
Say no more.
I'm off to grab a drink.
Still favor Bellinis?
She smiles, a little shakily.
Ambrose leaves.
A VOICE
Naturally Vain..
It's Billy passing behind her.
NYAH
Pardon me?
BILLY
'Naturally Vain.'
In the fourth.
Check her out.
She's due.
Billy hands her a chest sheet and moves on.
She opens it to the
fourth race.
Taped onto 'Naturally Vain' is a small plastic
piece with the note.
she regards the note, places the plastic
piece in her ear.
ETHAN'S VOICE
You can speak as if I'm right by your
side.
NYAH
(picking up binoculars)
Where are you?
ETHAN'S VOICE
At the mounting enclosure, just off the
tracks at two o'clock.
THRU BINOCULARS - NYAH'S POV - MOVING
thru the crowd onto the track over to the pre-post paddock where
an animated gaggle of owners, heavy batters and investerace touts
surround it.
Only Ethan is stock still - and looking up at Nyah.
CLOSE - NYAH
a swift intake of breath as she see him.
ETHAN
How's it going?
Everything okay?
NYAH
Just like old times.
ETHAN
Just like old times?
NYAH
Just about..
She appears to be the picture of unruffled sang-froid.
ETHAN
Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's.
ETHAN'S POV (THRU GLASSES)
moving from Nyah to the champagne bar just behind where Ambrose
is seen greeting someone in the crowd and they sit at a corner
table in front of the window overlooking the track.
NYAH
(a breath, then:)
Near as I can tell, there's at least a
half-dozen other blokes about the place.
Maybe more.
Hugh Stamp, an old mate of
Sean's, is the only one I recognize, bit
of a creep and then some..
POV ETHAN
Stamp, stands a pillar, his finger bandages, looking
glum and looking down at Nyah.
ETHAN
We know him.
He's over your left
shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
NYAH
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to
me.
Then there's the blokes in the
annex at the back of the house.
ETHAN
Have you met them?
NYAH
Annex is strictly off limits to me and
they never come to the main house,
Michael even takes their meals to them
all but shoves them under the door.
ETHAN
(looking into Champagne Bar)
I've no doubt.
ETHAN'S POV MONOCULAR VIDEO RANGE FINDER
of Ambrose sitting with someone whose face is obscured from his
angle by bar patrons.
BILLY
is also looking.
POV RANGE FINDER BILLY
and from his point of view it can be seen that Ambrose is talking
with John McCloy, the head Biocyte.
Ambrose takes an envelope
out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small
plastic container marked 'S.G.' (Identical to the object first
seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security.)
He opens it
and removes a small shiny object about the size of a quarter.
He
turns to the window and gestures.
Stamp enters the bar.
BILLY
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar.
Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into
something.
ETHAN'S POV
ETHAN
I'll be damned.
It's McCloy, the Biocyte
CEO.
LUTHER
Nekhorvich's boss?
ETHAN
Yep.
NYAH
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with
loads of money piled on them -- thirty-
seven million on the London Times.
What's
that about?
ETHAN
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to
prove that as of the date on the newspaper
those bids are back up by earnest money --
INT - VAN - LUTHER
is monitoring both cameras.
All see Ambrose give the little
wafer-like object to Stamp who places it in a small camera, hands
it back to Ambrose and exits, waiting just outside the glass
door.
Ambrose hands the camera to McCloy who looks puzzled.
LUTHER
Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how
to use a digital camera..
McCloy puts it to his eye, fumbles, then with Ambrose's
direction:
ETHAN
Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not
happy about.
McCloy puts the camera down.
The two men have words.
McCloy
shakily leave the table.
Ambrose opens the camera.
LUTHER
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of
the digital camera and put it into an
envelope, put it in his inner left jacket
pocket...
ETHAN
Left jacket pocket?
LUTHER
Roger that.
ETHAN
Confirm.
Left jacket pocket.
LUTHER
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
ETHAN BY THE MOUNTING ENCLOSURE
ETHAN
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.
There's an

Ambrose arriving with a pair of drinks.
Nyah rises.
AMBROSE
See anything you like?
NYAH
Yeah.
Naturally vain -- but they're about
to close the betting table and I haven't a
sou..
While Ambrose is still juggling the drinks, Nyah reaches into his
trouser pockets, and rummages around.
AMBROSE
(laughing)
Nyah!
ETHAN
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
BILLY
No worries, mate.
She pulls out a fifty-dollar note.
NYAH
Would you mind terribly?
AMBROSE (cont'd)
(amused and turned on)
- not at all.
But you'll pay for that
and with interest..
NYAH
I've no doubt..
She heads up the stairs.
AMBROSE
(reaching into his pocket for
money)
Hold on.
Ambrose grabs her arm, and she almost drops the envelope she's
just lifted.
(NOTE: It is important not to see her actually lift
it).
She's holding it, pinned between her right arm and side.
As
it's slipping, she notes Stamp above her, looking down and has to
conceal what she's holding from him as well:
AMBROSE (cont'd)
Put down a couple of hundred for.
NYAH
To win?
AMBROSE
What else?
She takes it and as she does the envelope falls, but she manages
to catch it with her left hand, blocking the move with her body
as she does.

designated as NEW SOUTH WALES DELIVERIES, 'anytime, anywhere.'
Luther bursts out of the van, carrying the tiny camera and begins
to thread his way thru cars and foot traffic.
BILLY
in dramatic contrast ambles at a conspicuously leisurely pace.
NYAH
passes Stamp, not seeing him standing just a row above, blocked
from her by one of the pillars.
Stamp idly regards her and then
decides: he follows.
LUTHER
perspiring, approaches the betting table thru the last of the
parked cars.
STAMP
approaches the door thru which Nyah had gone and starts to open
it - only to have the door slammed in his face and on his
bandaged finger by Billy, in a track usher's uniforms.
BILLY
(very solicitous)
Sorry about that, mate, that must've
really - aggrhh!..
Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds
himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.
If he'd been welded
there by a band of steal he'd have more room to maneuver.
STAMP
Say again?
BILLY
Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh...
STAMP
Whatever you're about in future, watch
your step.
Never know who you might run
into...
Stamp looks around, Nyah's nowhere in sight.
He's lost her.
Sees
his hand's bleeding and lets Billy go, who nearly drops to the
floor.
STAMP
Where's the loo then?
BILLY
(pointing up)
- aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh...
Stamp heads up the men's room.
BILLY
(croaking it out)
...
Shakes his head, feeling lucky to escape with his life.
EXT - PADDOCK - BETTING TABLE TWELVE
Nyah into shot.
Stands in line.
She looks around.
ETHAN'S VOICE
How'd you do?
Don't turn around.
Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye.
NYAH
I managed.
ETHAN
You noticed.
What're you going to do?
Spank me?
She slips Ethan the envelope.
Ethan himself returns the look,
holding it in spite of:
BILLY'S VOICE
Stamp's out of the loo.
Luther arrives, with the camera, opening for Ethan.
Nyah turns
away.
Ethan pulls out the tiny memory card, slips it in the
camera.
ETHAN (CONT'D)

This is going to take a couple of
minutes..
LUTHER
is racing back to the van.
LUTHER
There in twenty, Ethan..
NYAH AND ETHAN (IN LINE)
edge toward the window.
BILLY'S VOICE
Stamp's a little shaky, but headed your
way, mate.
ETHAN
Copy that.
(to Nyah)
Who do you like?
In the race?
NYAH
(nervous, she's heard Billy
too)
What race are we talking about?
INT - VAN (DAY)
A sweaty Luther:
LUTHER
I'm booted up.
Go, Ethan.
BILLY'S VOICE
He's heading down the stairs, now..
Ethan places the digital camera on play and begins to go thru the
stills.
As they cliff off, Ethan is visibly affected.
LUTHER IN THE VAN
watches the stills as well.
He's no less affected.
ETHAN WITH NYAH
He mutters some expletive under his breath, then, evenly:
ETHAN
I want you out of Ambrose's place.
BILLY'S VOICE
He's one tier from the bottom.
Ethan glances over to the bottom of the stairs.
NYAH
What are you talking about?
As he lowers camera and removes the memory card.
ETHAN
I want you out of there.
NYAH
Why?
What's happened. What did you see?
BILLY
Thirty steps..
Slipping card back into envelope.
ETHAN
Nyah, you've done more than enough.
Even
the best of snake charmers get bit.
NYAH
Ethan, tell me -
BILLY'S VOICE
Twenty, nineteen..
Ethan's been talking to someone he's been urging to walk, not run
to the nearest exit.
Now he drops all pretence:
ETHAN
I want you out of Australia!
(more quickly)
..I don't know how much more plainly I can
put it.
NYAH
How do you suggest I go about it?
ETHAN
He's touched your heart.
You're
overwhelmed.
You need to think it over.
You'll meet him somewhere in a month.
If
You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in
and getting you out.
Give me the ear
piece.
She just gets it out of her hear and gives it to Ethan when she
reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet.
She gives
him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off -
no more bets.
Flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops
the envelope.
She quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it,
tucking it away and looking up - to see Stamp standing over her.
almost exactly where Ethan had stood when she looked away.
NYAH
tries not to register alarm while she gauges how much Stamp had
seen.
STAMP
Get your bet down?
NYAH
Just..
She rises.
Stamp waits only a moment then follows.
AT THE PRIVATE BLEACHERS (DAY)
everyone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch.
Ambrose is watching the race through binoculars.
Nyah comes up
behind and puts her arms around him.
With her left hand she puts
the envelope into his right jacket pocket.
AMBROSE
Your nag is making a run for it on the
outside!
(lowering binoculars)
Bloody hell, Nyah!
She's momentarily startled.
Then:
AMBROSE (CONT'D)
You picked another winner!
NYAH
Well, that's good, isn't?
Nyah is on the balcony.
Ambrose enters with two glasses of
champagne.
AMBROSE
To Australia.
It's made so many convicts
feel at home.
Here's hoping it does the
same for you..
He laughs.
She doesn't.
NYAH
Sean, there's something I've been meaning
to talk to you about... Isn't going to be
easy for me to say.
AMBROSE
(jocular)
Then don't say it.
NYAH
I don't know what to do about you, Sean.
I'm more than a bit muddled.
I need time.
AMBROSE
To do what?
NYAH
Sort it all out.
AMBROSE
And you're going to have time.
There's
been a change of plans.
NYAH
A change of plans?
AMBROSE
Yes.
We won't be able to have dinner
tonight.
Something's come up.
I hope you
don't mind.
NYAH
Oh, no, not at all.
Maybe just a bit.
AMBROSE
Ulrich will be about.
He'll look after
you.
NYAH
Lovely.
INT - AMBROSE STUDY (LATE AFTERNOON)
Ambrose enters, slips off his jacket and hangs it over a chair.
He walks to a desk and brings up a computer the Biocyte website
and McCloy infomercial.
Stamp notes that Ambrose is
on the computer and moves to the desk.
STAMP
I thought you were going to dinner.
AMBROSE
(pulling up something on the
computer)
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory
card.
STAMP
Where is it?
AMBROSE
In the envelope in my pocket.
My
right.. jacket..pocket..
Stamp leans over and pulls out the envelope.
As he does he sees
Ambrose has pulled up and started to play McCloy's informercial.
AMBROSE (cont'd)
(calmly)
We've got an opportunity here.
I'm not
going to miss it..
running pell-mell down to the shore.
Stops.
Looks outside the
small skiff moored at the end of the dock.
It's dark and she
decides to chance it.
She moves onto the pier, trying to glide
by the boathouse.
A figure darts out and grabs her.
She tries to
scream but can't.
The figure whips her around and she sees:
ETHAN
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
NYAH
Oh Ethan!..
She throws her arms around him.
ETHAN
Are you okay?
NYAH
I am now.
Get me out of here.
Just get
me out of here.
ETHAN
It's going to be okay.
He holds her.
INT - HOSPITAL ROOM
McCloy's strapped down, but manages to reach the call button and
push it.
Again and again.
NEKHORVICH
No use, my friend.
The medical staff
wants no part of this.
Doctors don't
fancy the idea of dying any more than
anybody else.
McCloy stares at Nekhorvich for a long moment.
MCCLOY
How could I possibly be infected?
Nekhorvich shrugs.
NEKHORVICH
That's exactly what Gradski said - 27
hours before he died.
With Chimera, the
most minute exposure can be fatal.
McCloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor.
He grips
the edge of the hospital bed.
NEKHORVICH
But then you shouldn't be feeling to ill.
not for another three of four hours
anyway.
McCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety.
MCCLOY
You have Bellerophon.
NEKHORVICH
(mildly)
Do I?
MCCLOY
You took it!
All of it!
And what if I need
it?
NEKHORVICH
(amused)
'If?'
My, my, my...the five hundred
people on Bruny Island that you
deliberately infected with Chimera needed
it as well.
MCCLOY
Oh, please!
How was I to know they had to
be treated with Bellerophon within twenty
hours?
NEKHORVICH
By asking me.
MCCLOY
You still don't get it, do you?
You want
to make an omelet, you break a few eggs -
I needed to know just how bad the disease
was - in the real world, not the lab.
And
you never know til you try.
You thought
you were genetically splicing together
strains of influenza to create a
cure for all influenzas.
But I saw you
creating a disease so terrible in Chimera
that the cure would be priceless.
NEKHORVICH
You wanted the disease in order to peddle
the cure.
MCCLOY
Well, the thought had occurred to me.
I needed
Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.
For
hero to be appreciated, you need a monster.
Now that's not so difficult to understand, is
it?
Look, time was a shot of penicillin could
knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!
Not
anymore!..have you any idea the R&D; money it
takes to float one little pissy boutique
antibiotic that's barely effective against one
strain of one bacterium?
If I couldn't makes
money killing the microscopic little shits that
are out there, you'd help me put one out there
I can make on!..there it is.
I've
confessed.
I, John C. McCloy, am in business
to make money.
Lilly's making billions feeding
Prozac to depressed dogs.
Pfizer doesn't even
know where to put the money they're making on
Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do
a thing for me even at twice the recommended
dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a
a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated
and let's go back to work!..
NEKHORVICH
You know, I think it's a little late for
that.
Do give my regards to Gradski if
you see him.
INT - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE MCCLOY'S ROOM)
Nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask, and the vocal
oscillator, revealing an exhausted Ethan.
Angle widens to
include Luther and Billy in hospital greens.
Luther and Billy nod in disgusted assent.
EXT - ANNEX (NIGHT) NYAH
holds tight in her embrace with Ethan.
NYAH
Ethan, you know what frightens me most
when I'm with him?..the thought of never
seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
ETHAN
Nyah, it's very important not do
anything to alarm Ambrose..
NYAH
What?
You told me to get out of here.
I
thought you were here to collect me.
I
was so relieved.
ETHAN
(with growing urgency)
No time to explain.
You've done well,
and we're so close.
So close.
It's
critical that you do whatever Ambrose
asks.
Don't worry - it'll be over soon..
That's a promise.. Come on, now off you
go!
He gives her an affectionate smile and she reluctantly heads back
to the house, her expression troubled, even suspicious.
INT - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE MCCLOY'S ROOM)
Having just taken off the mask, Ethan stands with Luther and Billy.
LUTHER
(disgusted by what he's heard)
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's
got Chimera.
BILLY
There guys are walking around with
different halves of the same dollar bill?
ETHAN
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich
on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera
virus.
LUTHER
Yeah.
Why else would he come back to
Australia?
If he had them both, he could
sell them anywhere.
ETHAN
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting
on a cure without a disease.
LUTHER
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
EXT - AMBROSE HOUSE (NIGHT)
Ethan enters and tears off his mask, revealing Ambrose filled
with implacable rage.
He looks up to see Stamp who's been
obviously waiting for him.
Tearing the voice oscillator.
Leaning with both hands on a counter-surveillance monitor table
he stares at the floor, his face rictus of hateful intensity.
STAMP
You were right.
Hunt stung McCloy
tonight.
He knows.
They'll be going into
Biocyte...
Ambrose looks up slowly to Stamp who's been standing by.
AMBROSE
Good..then we go where he'll be, don't
we?
Well done, Hugh.
Well done.
is poised, upside down, on cable against the Sydney skyline.
THE ATRIUM LOUVERS
begin to open.
reflected in it is the face of a digital clock, its red LED
illuminating the clock's numbers fourteen - thirteen - twelve -
WITH LUTHER
LUTHER
(realizing what he's in for)
Oh - oh - oh -
Even as he moans he's frantically ripping out the computer and
cords dangling, hotfoots toward the van exit.
INT - HOT ZONE - GLASS OBSERVATION ROOM
Ethan fires the second injection gun.
Picks up the third and
last.
He pauses as he's about to fire it, staring intently
suddenly the gun is held by:
NEKHORVICH
who turns the barrel from the hyper-thermal chamber and releases
into his wrist.
BACK TO ETHAN - GLASS OBSERVATION ROOM
whose vision of of Nekhorvich fades.
Still thinking of Nekhorvich he
continues to stare at the gun for another moment and before he can fire:
INT - SHEEP FARM IMF SAFEHOUSE
The bomb's LED readout shows 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.. As it reaches 0
a small light on the bomb suddenly stops its incessant blinking.
EXT - VAN
explodes.
Saw horses and dirt fly.
INT - GLASS OBSERVATION ROOM - ETHAN
looks up just in time to see Ambrose and team arrive at the far
end of the lab.
They immediately open fire, shattering the
room's walls and the glass injection gun chamber.
As the
injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below, one of
Ambrose's team runs to grab it, but before he can reach it he is
shot by Ethan, who's falling to the floor below.
AMBROSE
(to Ulrich)
Get it.
As Ethan hits and dives for cover, Ulrich goes for the gun
Ethan shoots Ulrich in the leg.
Ulrich hops back in pain.
AMBROSE
Those were two explosions, your van and
your safehouse, in case you didn't hear
them both -- I believe that means you've
also lost a friend.
Ethan's crouching on the ground protected behind a series of
vertical metal sheets.
ETHAN
And you couldn't walk to tell me about it.
Ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the
shattered glass on the floor.
Ambrose, Wallis, and a couple of
other Ambrose team members fire, kicking up broken glass.
Ethan
backs off.
AMBROSE
(yelling)
Hold your fire, dammit!
The two spot one another in a mirror on the far wall of the hot
zone..
AMBROSE (cont'd)
Well, Hunt.
How've you been?
ETHAN
(smiling)
Fight a bit of a cold..
AMBROSE
And you're happy about that?
ETHAN
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell
you.
AMBROSE
You know, that was the hardest part of
having to portray you.
Grinning like an
idiot every fifteen minutes.
ETHAN
I would've thought the hardest part was
exercising restraint.
Curbing that
pressing need of your to get your gun
off.
You were in such a hurry to knock
off that 747, you never figured out where
the virus really was.
AMBROSE
I knew where it was.
ETHAN
Oh.
then you knew the only way
could smuggle the live virus to the CDC
scientists in Atlanta was by injecting
himself and using his own bloodstream as a
Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty
hours so he could take the anti-virus and
still have it be effective.
You knew that
while you were knocking him off and
destroying the very thing you came for.
Ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen
round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a
spray of gunfire, attempting to cover his own effort to the reach
the injection gun.
The return fire nearly hits the injection
gun, kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the
floor.
AMBROSE
Stop!
Put a sock in it!
Hit that bloody
gun and you'll spray the bloody virus all
over the place!
Everybody's regained cover but the injection gun remains out of
everybody's reach.
ETHAN
There it is, guys, the last of it.
AMBROSE
Yep.
You've provided us with a golden
opportunity to have both the bug and the
bug killer.
ETHAN
What was the top bid?
AMBROSE
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
ETHAN
Than thirty-seven million pounds?
Not
really.
AMBROSE
(not amused)
Somebody's been slipping you our mail.
Come on out here, you bad girl.
Nyah walks out into view on her own.
Ethan sees her reflection in
the mirror.
Enraged, but trying to control it.
ETHAN
She doesn't belong here, Sean.
Let her go.
AMBROSE
She wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for
you, Hunt.
from this moment you're
responsible for what happens to her, and
if you're looking out for her well-being,
I suggest you advise her to pick up the
gun and bring it to me.
Ball's in your
court, Hunt.
What've you got to say?
Nyah's waiting for your answer.
A pregnant pause.
LUTHER'S VOICE
(breaking through the static)
Ethan, Nyah's in the building!
Do you
copy?
a mess amid the rubble of the construction van.
ETHAN
ETHAN
(dryly)
Thank you.
ETHAN (cont'd)
Sure he won't shoot you the minute he's
got it?
AMBROSE
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah
responsible for her actions..
ETHAN
In other words, you're calling her a
flake.
CLOSE - NYAH
listening.
AMBROSE
You know women, mate.
Like monkeys, they
are.
Won't let go of one branch til
they've got a grip on the next...get it,
Nyah.
I'll cover you.
Ambrose cocks his weapon.
AMBROSE (cont'd)
I'm waiting.
NYAH
(not much more than body
length from Ethan)
This isn't exactly working out the way you
thought it would, Ethan.
Sorry.
Finger on the injection trigger, she rises and turns the barrel
on her arm, firing.
The sound of the air pressure pushing the
virus into her is unmistakable, as is the circle of tiny puncture
wounds on her skin.
Nyah moves in front of Ethan, covering him,
as she turns to face Ambrose.
ETHAN
shocked by Nyah's gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he
resets the 'Countdown' on his chronometer to twenty hours.
As
it drops into the nineteen:
AMBROSE
(frustrated in the extreme)
You..bitch!
She's been laughing away with Ethan:
NYAH
You're not going to shoot, Sean.
Not
this bitch.
She's worth thirty-seven
million pounds.
CLOSE - ETHAN'S HANDS
fingers press a red button on a tiny detonator.
There's a bright
heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water --
the plastique killing any airborne virus.
Ethan uses the diversion to grab Nyah and run with her to the far
side of the lab, behind a stock of horizontal cylinders.
INT - LAB
Ambrose and team recover from the explosion and begin firing on
the tanks protecting Ethan and Nyah, surrounding the two with
fire and jets of released steam.
INT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH
behind the stack of tanks.
Ethan launches an explosive down a
short hallway, blowing a hole in the building's exterior wall.
INT - ENTRANCES TO THE LAB
A group of Biocyte security guards enter from behind Ambrose and
team and catch them off-guard.
All hell breaks loose.
INT - LAB - ETHAN AND NYAH
ETHAN
(outraged)
What did you think you were doing!
NYAH
I wasn't thinking!
Just..trying to keep
you from getting hurt, that's all.
This hits Ethan with the force of a blow.
ETHAN
- you who don't have a conscience.
NYAH
(something of surprise to
her)
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us
out of here, can you?
ETHAN
No.
NYAH
Then you'll have to kill me before it's
too late.
Before I start killing people.
ETHAN
No.
NYAH
I'm infected with Chimera.
You know you
don't have a choice.
Just do it now.
She puts Ethan's gun to her forehead.
NYAH (cont'd)
For god's sake, get it over with.
THE HAMMER
pulls back.
CLOSE - ETHAN
He can't fire, lower the hammer.
ETHAN
We've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before
you start killing anybody.
I'll get
Bellerophon into your system by then.
Just stay alive.
I'm not gonna lose you.
Ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall
once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambrose's
team, wounding a couple men.
He reaches the wall and dives thru,
camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in
the air all around him.
Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute
deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it.
