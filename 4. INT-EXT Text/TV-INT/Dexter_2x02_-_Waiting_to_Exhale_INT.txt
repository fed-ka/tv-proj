    Dexter driving, listening.  

                                        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Captain Matthews of Miami Metro 
                        Homicide issued this brief statement 
                        earlier today --

                         I want to assure the citizens of 
                        Miami that whoever committed these 
                        dreadful crimes will be brought to the 
                        swiftest and harshest justice. 

    Dexter reacts.

                                        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        So far authorities have no clue as to 
                        who that criminal might be.

                        And I have no clue as to why I m going 
                        through this time-warp mind-trip.  Got 
                        to stay focussed.

    He looks off to a street corner where a group of Gang 
    Bangers hang.  Surly, smoking, drinking, staring back at 
    him.

    Suddenly, a ribbon of light bounces off his rearview and 
    slashes across his eyes.  Dexter adjusts the mirror.  As he 
    does, the trailing car s headlights go out.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Shit.  Little Chino.  He did see me.  
                        Timing could be better.  That, plus I 
                        don t have my tools, but... 

    He swerves into an alley, swings to a stop; blocking it.

                        up one massive loose end.  

    He grabs his Taser and a longneck Mag-light, jumps out and 
    strides toward the trailing car as it screeches up.  Dexter 
    hefts the Mag-light, about to demolish the driver s window, 
    when it abruptly powers down to reveal... Doakes.  DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      8.

    Just then, the elevator opens and LITTLE CHINO (the stitches 
    on his freshly slashed cheek and his newly broken nose  
    adding to his menace) and his LAWYER emerge.  The man-giant 
    struts his way into the Bullpen.  Dexter ducks down as if he 
    dropped something.

    HIS POV, looking up:  Little Chino, big as a redwood.

    Dexter slips into his lab as Raul, smug as can be, and 
    Little Chino, even smugger, pass the furious cops and exit.

                        The FBI has sent over their top man, 
                        Special Agent Frank Lundy, to help 
                        solve this crime.  This will not be a 
                        jurisdictional circle jerk.  It will 
                        be a shining example of two agencies 
                        working together for the public good.

                        What fucking asshole left this here?

    She kicks the briefcase into a wall.  Beat.  Liquid starts 
    leaking out.  Lundy enters from his office; retrieves the 
    dripping briefcase and holds it over a waste basket.

                        It s Special Agent fucking asshole.

    He opens the briefcase, drops his broken thermos into the 
    trash and shakes out his soggy paperwork.  Lundy looks to 
    Debra, his old-soldier eyes crinkling.

    Dexter steps over the threshold.  Waits to see if he ll be 
    struck dead.  He isn t.  Then he goes up the aisle.  Cody 
    takes his hand and guides him to a seat next to Rita and 
    Astor.  Rita, eyes wet, smiles and puts her hand on his leg.

    prisoners.  Dexter watches intently.  In the far b.g. Lundy 
    gets into his car, looks up to our window and drives off.

                        That s... too bad.

    The group breaks up.  Dexter heads for his lab, Pascal for 
    her office.  A Runner hands LaGuerta an Inter-Departmental 
    envelope.  She opens it, reads the contents and goes into --DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      40.

    But LaGuerta doesn t go.  Pascal looks up.

                        You stop me when you think I m

    LaGuerta hands her the envelope.

    She holds LaGuerta s gaze.  LaGuerta offers a slight smile.

                        Then, this is me not mentioning it.

    She starts to go.  Pascal stops her with --

    Dexter on the phone while he works on his computer.  We see 
    what looks like a nautical chart on the monitor, a red wavy 
    swath snaking through a field of blue.

    He taps the keyboard.  Photos of Little Chino come up.

                        little late.  We ll catch up later.  

    He rings off, pushes away from his desk and rises.


    Doakes at his desk.  Batista comes up.

                        Maria told me about the task force.

    Doakes looks up at him, ready to rip his head off.

                        door that closes, another one opens.

    The door to Dexter s lab opens.  He sees Doakes staring at 
    him.  Dexter smiles and shrugs that shrug of his.  


    THE TOP FLOOR.  Joey Nunez sprays gang symbols on the bare 
    walls.  A ratty mattress, fast-food bags and a boombox tell 
    us this is where the kid lives.

    DOWN BELOW.  The Chrysler 300C crunches into FRAME.  Little 
    Chino emerges, as big as a silo.  He reaches into his car 
    for his machete and heads for the Freight Elevator.


    Little Chino enters, pulls the iron grating closed and 
    presses  10 .  The car ascends.  DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      42.

    Suddenly, it shudders to a stop at the second floor.  Little 
    Chino impatiently pokes at the control panel.  Nothing.

    Dexter appears.  He quickly secures the iron grate with a 
    pair of handcuffs, trapping Chino.  Brandishing the TRANQ 
    STICK, he jams the business end into Chino s neck.  The big 
    man roars and grabs the stick.  Enraged, he pulls on the 
    stick.  Dexter is yanked against the cage, the Tranq Stick 
    all that separates him from this huge wounded animal...

    THE TOP FLOOR.  The elevator arrives.  Joey turns, startled.  
    But it s empty.


    Dexter wheels the unconscious Little Chino on a four-wheeled 
    construction dolly.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        It was simple really.  All I had to do 
                        was put myself into the mind of a 
                        killer.  Hardly a stretch.

    He dumps Little Chino into the Chrysler s trunk.

                        It was only a matter of time before 
                        Little Chino went after Joey Nunez.    

    He jumps down, climbs into the Chrysler and starts it.  The 
    car pulls away from CAMERA, the rear-end visibly sagging.

    Little Chino s prostrate body RISES INTO FRAME.  We re --


    The massive Little Chino is bound to an auto lift.

                        I ll have to find a way to thank her.

    The lift jolts to a stop.  Little Chino opens his eyes, 
    looks around.  Photos of Eva Arenas, Rafael Arenas and his 
    other victims are propped behind votive candles.  Each 
    victim has a blood-red teardrop weeping from his or her left 
    eye.  Little Chino struggles mightily against his 
      restraints.  Dexter steps into his field of vision.DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      43.

    thread of blood appears in the wound.

    He prepares the blood slide and puts it on a table.  Then he 
    lights another votive.  When he clears, we see a photo of 
    Eva s daughter, Marissa.  Dexter returns to Little Chino. 
    Killing tools at the ready, he nods to Marissa s picture.

    He sucks in a long deep breath.  Then confidently presses 
    the knife into Little Chino s chest.

    CLOSE ON DEXTER.  A long beat.  A smile comes to his face.  
    At last.  Another beat.  And he finally allows himself to 
    exhale.  A cleansing rush of air escaping his lungs.  

    ON LITTLE CHINO S TATTOOED ARM.  Christ on the crucifix, the 
    blood-red teardrops.  A beat.  Then Little Chino s own blood 
    courses over the tattoo, totally obscuring it from sight. 


    Dexter enters.  Rita s at the table, sipping coffee.  He 
    goes to kiss her. She gives him her cheek. Dexter sits down.

                        sense:  that s what you do when you 
                        disappear at all hours of the night 
                        like Clark fucking Kent.

    She leans across the table, urgent.

                        If there s anything left between us, 
                        you need to answer me one question; 
                        and you better tell me the truth... 
                        are you a drug addict?

    Dexter stares at her, groping for the right words.  Then --

                                        DEXTER
                        Yes.  I have an addiction.DEXTER 202      "Waiting To Exhale"    Final Collated    6/13/07      48.

    Rita sits back hard, taking it all in.  This is their moment 
    of truth.  Is it the end of them?

    Then, to Dexter s surprise, a change comes over her.  A calm 
    sense of familiar purpose.  She rises and goes to him.

                                        RITA
                        Oh, Dexter.  That s the first step.  
                        Admitting you have a problem.
                              (she hugs him)

                        get you the help you need.  And I will 
                        be there for you.

      Bewildered, Dexter returns the hug.  Rita looks deep into 
    his eyes.  DEXTER S POV:  Rita s eyes, searching.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        If the eyes are the windows to the 
                        soul, then grief is the door.


    A long PUSH IN on Debra s back as she furiously works the 
    heavy bag.

    A light coming on draws his attention.  He spreads the 
    blinds and looks across to see Special Agent Frank Lundy 
    burning the midnight oil in the Briefing Room.

    Lundy sits there, staring at the photos of the Bay Harbor 
    Butcher s  sunken treasure . 

    DEXTER switches off his light.  Sits in the semi-darkness.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        And now I m faced with the struggle 
                        for my own survival that I always knew 
                        was coming.

    He rises, exits his lab and crosses the bullpen.  Lundy 
    looks up, nods with a benign smile.  Dexter nods back.  Then 
    he steps into the elevator, turns and looks into CAMERA. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I ve been preparing for this my entire 
                        life.

    The doors slide closed.


    Dexter slips Little Chino s blood slide into the box; runs 
    his index finger along the other slides.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        When all is said and done, Chino, 
                        you re the same size as everyone else.

    He closes the box and is about to put it back in the AC 
    unit, when the front door opens.  The chain catches.

                                        DEBRA
                        Hey, Dex.  What the fuck?

    Dexter jams the slide box home and reassembles the AC unit. 

                                        DEXTER
                        Hang on.  I m coming.

    He crosses to unchain the door.  

                                        DEXTER
                              (re: the chain)

    Debra enters.  She s wearing sweaty workout clothes.

    Dexter nods to his open laptop.

                        Just surfing.  You go to the gym?

    Debra looks at her own messy clothes.

                        Because?

    Debra goes to the refrigerator, takes out the orange juice.  
    She swigs from the carton, then puts it on top of the mail.

                                        DEBRA
                        I saw a couple of buildings with  For

    She notices Dexter looking at the OJ carton and returns it 
    to the fridge.  Then she gestures around the apartment.

    Debra peels off her grungy sweatshirt and drops it onto

    And she heads toward the bathroom.  Dexter looks after her 
    as she goes in and SLAMS the door.  Dexter grins.

    She shuts the door, gently this time.  Dexter lifts her 
    sweatshirt off his laptop. MUSIC: A LILTING, HAUNTING THEME.
