MORNING
David starts up his dark green sports car, and roars onto
the New York City streets.
2
David travels the side-streets to work. He senses a
growing weirdness. The streets are empty. He looks at. his
watch. It's
8:12.
He continues anxiously. Runs a red
light. Music rises.
The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is
silent. It is as if the world's biggest parade has just
left, taking everybody with it. David pulls over
haphazardly. He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of
the street. He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises.
All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in
sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The
billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions
to his loneliness. He pulls up short., stopping and crying
out in anguish. There is no one left in the world.
A WOMAN'S VOICE
Open your eyes... open your eyes,
David...
DISSOLVE TO:
David is about to enter the green sports car, then thinks
better of it. He fires up a knock-around beater car from
his collection. He drives into the street which is,
comfortingly, now full of people. We hear R.E.M.'s "All
The Right Friends."
David drives the crowded streets.
It all seems more
poignant today. Life is good again.
David pulls up to a lower-end apartment, checks his watch.
Enter the hung-over BRIAN SHELBY,
30ish. In a world of
acquaintances, Brian is a true friend.
He has all the
qualities of Abe Lincoln and, much to his chagrin, the
looks too. He hops in the car with racquetball bag.
DAVID
Did you reserve the court?
BRIAN
Easy. I can't handle heavy
conversation at this ungodly hour.
DAVID
I'm sorry to do this early. I
gotta be done by 10.
Car phone rings. David checks Caller ID - it's his office.
He clicks on.
ASSISTANT VOICE
(RACHEL)
You're not going to make the 8:45,
are you?
DAVID
How did you find me?
RACHEL'S VOICE
David Aames, you have to check the
colors of the letters for the new
issue of Rise.
DAVID
What are the colors?
RACHEL'S VOICE
Yellow-and-red... or the
traditional white.
6
DAVID
Let, me think about it.
RACHEL'S VOICE
David, please. Don't be late for
the ten o'clock with the board.
DAVID
Okay, but. don't tell anybody where
I am I don't care if God calls.
I'm very busy.
BRIAN
Can't you just get rid of that
board?
DAVID
The Seven Dwarves? No.
BRIAN
Those people drive you nuts.
DAVID
And that was the desire of my
father, who hired them.
BRIAN
(suspicious pause)
You fucked Julie Gianni again,
didn't you?
David takes off driving.
David meets Peter Brown and RACHEL, his second assistant,
at. the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames
Publications. Aames hops out of car and heads into the
building.
They stand nervously out in front of her apartment. In the
distance, rain.
DAVID
A lot of people are scared of
heights. It's not the heights
that bother me, it's the impact
that terrifies me.
(off her look)
I won't stay long.
She laughs. It was never his decision to make.
29
David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the
alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...
because David is a man with a brand new buzz.
The city is
his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.
Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with
its lights still on starts and advances alongside.
Behind
the wheel is Julianna Gianni.
JULIANNA
David Aames.
David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.
DAVID
Julie Gianni.
You're following
me.
JULIANNA
only a little.
I wanted to
finish what we were talking about.
39
DAVID
And _-
JUL IANNA
How'd it work out with our Moth
Girl? Did she turn into a
butterfly for you?
DAVID
Yes she did.
JULIANNA
But I can see from your walk that
you didn't sleep with her.
David turns.
JULIANNA
Let me see if I can guess. You
haven't slept with her because...
it's more fun when you can draw it
out. Sex just isn't as good if
the woman hasn't told all her
friends she'd never sleep with
you.
DAVID
You're right on the money, Julie.
JULIANNA
She must be exhausted from trying
to be witty for you all night
long.
DAVID
Hey, Julie.
JUL IANNA
Sorry. You're just never there
for your friends until they've
already given up on you.
DAVID
I'm not blowing you off! I just
want to be alone for a little bit.
Trust me - I have a lot of things
I gotta take care of. If we're
friends, which we are, you'll
understand.
JULIANNA
(simple, honest)
I'm sorry I got weird. I missed
an audition and I just felt bad
40
you didn't invite me to your
party.
It zings him. David turns, considers her.
JULIANNA
Do you want to make it up to me?
I won't tell a soul.
Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last
time. He gets in the car.
David walks the hall of trees. It's the gentle seductive
whoosh of a new day, the way the world sounds when you're
in love. Vibrant. Alive. Ironically rich in the beauty
we all take for granted when we're not in love. He looks
impossibly drawn forward to Sofia, who stands waiting to
meet him.
SOFIA
Hello.
He steals a kiss. They both feel like they're getting away
with something.
DAVID
You're amazing. Hello.
SOFIA
Did you get to work alright?
43
DAVID
Yeah, well, actually... I had a
horrible dream.
SOFIA
You dreamed you'd never see me
again.
DAVID
I left your house. I went to the
car, and my friend the stalker had
been following me.
SOFIA
Julie.
DAVID
Yes. She followed me down the
street. She wanted to talk, and I
had that buzz... from you and me,
and I think my mind was on that
terrible drawing of me... and, you
know, I got inside. And she drove
me off a bridge and committed
suicide with me in the car.
SOFIA
I thought you were going straight
to work.
DAVID
But I survive! I survive with my
arm and my face reconstructed.
And what's worse I couldn't wake
up.
SOFIA
(shushing)
How was your house after the
party?
DAVID
What party? A party?
SOFIA
The PARTY. Remember? Red
dress... strappy shoes... I
spilled something on your SHIRT...
sweet and sour... and the saddest
girl to ever hold a martini.
He looks at her, completely lost and spacy.
44
DAVID
(V.0.)
My dreams are a cruel joke. They
taunt me. Even in my dreams, I'm
an idiot who knows he's about to
wake up to reality. If I could
only avoid sleep, but I can't.
Sofia Serrano walks down a New York street in sensible
shoes. Just another part of the working force.
To our
unseen follower, she is most beautiful when unaware she's
being watched. Shot continues parallel to her. She stops,
sees someone she knows. A truck with several panes of
glass passes by and stops in traffic. Her image blurs
behind the glass, but visible to us in the window is David
Acmes. His healing face is dotted with stubble. He wears
a wool hat. He looks noble, an assembled victim, a modern
miracle. He looks like many things. But he no longer
looks like David Aames. The truck moves through frame.
Families lined up watching the ritual blowing up of the
balloons the night before Thanksgiving. Parents hug
children, detailing the magical events of an autumn night.
Sagging balloons come to life-
DAVID
(V.0.)
A new form of me began to take
shape.
David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in
silence. David weaves. They are anxious to pretend it was
a wonderful evening.
SOFIA
Well, this is where I leave you.
BRIAN
Wait. I'll walk you to your door.
SOFIA
No, I live just around the corner.
BRIAN
I've got my bike here.
SOFIA
I'd rather walk.
DAVID
Don't be a drag. Can't you see
she wants to go on her own?
BRIAN
Shut up, you're drunk.
DAVID
I may be an idiot, but I'm not
drunk.
BRIAN
61
SOFIA
Seriously, I don't need you to
walk me home. Thank you.
BRIAN
Okay then. So. We'll call you.
SOFIA
(unconvincing)
Great. We'll go catch a movie or
something.
SOFIA
So. We'll meet up soon.
The word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it.
DAVID
We'll meet up soon.
Sofia turns and runs away.
DAVID
(lacking all pride)
We'll call you again to go out
with me!
BRIAN
We'll call you.
David and Brian walk on. Brian turns back to see Sofia
running to the corner.
BRIAN
Well, it's been a real blast,
David. I bid you good evening.
DAVID
Where you going?
BRIAN
My bike. It's back over there.
We'll hang soon. Bring your mask
if you want. I'm getting used to
it.
DAVID
Wait a minute.
BRIAN
(stops)
What?
62
DAVID
(shrugs)
I don't know.
BRIAN
You drank a little too much. Call
me tomorrow if you want.
DAVID
Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.
BRIAN
(starts in Sofia's
direction)
No you won't. You just need to
sleep.
DAVID
Hey!
BRIAN
(Brian's itching to go)
What!
DAVID
What did you say to Julie Gianni
the night of the accident?
BRIAN
What?
DAVID
You told her she was a "fuck
buddy."
BRIAN
Never.
DAVID
And she was a little more than
pissed about it.
BRIAN
(a little guilty)
Have you been harboring this shit
all along? I never talked to her.
DAVID
Whatever. I mean - who am I, if I
can't. be the one who tells you
you're not ugly? Aw, give me a
courtesy laugh. Come on!
Brian shakes his head, starts running.
63
DAVID
Brian!! I'm so fucked up. I'm
just so fucked up!
Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the
street.
DAVID
We're best friends! We're bros!
Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in
the direction of Sofia.
David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard.
His head hurts. His body hurts.
DAVID
Come on, man, we're bros.
Beat. He sprints down the middle of the street after
Brian.
David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing.
HIS MIND
Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss
messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height.
David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are
tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car,
unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he
manages to run further.
David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs
overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,
mouth agape. The empty street visible in the b.g., his
hand loosens its grip on the mask.
FADE TO BLACK
WOMAN'S VOICE
Open your eyes... open your
eyes...
David is passed out, the mask is still clutched in his
hand. A Butterfly crosses frame. A hand enters, resting
on his shoulder.
64
WOMAN'S VOICE
This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie
Gianni.
JULIANNA
Boo!
He recoils. His vision sharpens. In the morning shadows,
with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia.
DAVID
No, I'm okay -
DAVID POV
Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
understanding. Everything takes on a clear and sharp
focus. Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky.
SOFIA
And it worked. Get up.
DAVID
Ugh -
SOFIA
(helping him up)
That's right. I agree. Ugh.
DAVID
This is a joke.
SOFIA
(touches his cheek)
David. I'm not going to lie to
you. I liked the way you looked.
But if you don't pull it together,
I'll forget the other guy. You
know that. other guy - YOU?
DAVID
(groggy)
I'm still that guy. I'm still
that guy.
Sofia speaks with rapid-fire conviction, as if she might
change her mind if she thought about it too much.
SOFIA
I don't. have a mother-savior bone
in my body. It's not about that.
You're coming inside. But if this
65
turns out to be a big mistake, I
do have the ability to fall out of
love with you -
(snaps fingers)
- like that.
She helps him up.
DAVID
I am still that guy.
SOFIA
Shut up.
DAVID
(V.0.)
We created our own world together.
Us vs. Them -
DAVID
Where's Brian?
SOFIA
He went with you, didn't he?
DAVID
(shaking head at his own
paranoia)
I thought you guys hooked up.
She stops in profile with him. She's astonished at his
jealousy. Then:
SOFIA
(raw truth)
I wish you hadn't gotten in the
car with that girl.
DAVID
(a long apology is
coming)
Sofia... I'm...
She covers his mouth, nose and face. Only his eyes remain.
SOFIA
Your eyes apologized better. Come
on.
Portrait of the two, her leading him to the door, the crisp
glycerine morning overhead.
66
SOFIA
Holy God, this is going to change
my life in a zillion different
ways... I must be nuts.
DAVID
(V.0.)
- and we were quite a pair.
Her
believing in me. Me believing
that I deserved it.
We hear the sound of voices, human voices howling like
dogs.
Prison. Human voices, howling like dogs.
Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of
the street on fresh snow.
DAVID
(V.0.)
We talked about the big things,
the little things, and the big
things. But in truth, with Sofia,
it was the in-between times.
Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.
BRIAN
You're in fucking sad shape, man.
Don't fucking ever hit a girl,
man. Hit me, but don't fucking
EVER hit a girl.
David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on
them - pulls Brian out of the station.
DAVID
It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.
BRIAN
Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,
Sofia was abducted by Julie, and
now Julie is posing as Sofia.
DAVID
Yes.
BRIAN
You're in O.J. land, man. Julie
Gianni is fucking dead!
DAVID
I don't know what the cops have
told you, but let me assure you -
Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.
BRIAN
I didn't talk to the cops. I
talked to Sofia!
DAVID
Where is she?
BRIAN
I just dropped Sofia off. And I
saw everything you did to her.
80
DAVID
Let me tell you something - I did
not do that to her. Look me in
the eye and tell me that it was
the same girl you brought to the
party. Tell me it was your dream
girl, your "proximity
infatuation."
BRIAN
(raw, finally)
Yes! And you stole her from me!
David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his
heart.
BRIAN
The one girl I really wanted, and
you took her from me. You're
insane. You're losing it, man.
David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one
of them too.
DAVID
You have revealed yourself.
BRIAN
Oh yeah, I'm with them.
DAVID
Where'd you get the coat, Brian?
Where'd you get the camera? How
much did they pay you?
BRIAN
Listen to me, 'cause it's the last
time we're ever gonna speak. I
was your only friend.
DAVID
You have revealed yourself to me.
The police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business
plaza. McCabe exits with David. Always watching his every
move, his every revelation. David looks upward at the
towering skyscraper in the center of the plaza, rising high
into the sky.
- DAY
Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled
office, proposals in hand. A glimpse shows words like Re-
Evolve and Re-Experience, peppered with colorful photos of
simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life. It's
well-appointed and well-marketed organization.
McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam.
Injustice fuels McCabe.
MCCABE
(continuing, scoffing)
"Cryonization - a journey of re-
awakening after the preservation
of the human body at extremely low
temperatures."
DAVID
They laughed at Jules Verne too.
MCCABE
(a little sadly)
David, you're not-
Account Liaison REBECCA DEARBORN enters with paperwork.
She is an electric presence. Efficient, caring and oddly
compassionate.
DEARBORN
Mr. McCabe, how are you? I'm
Rebecca Dearborn.
(quick notice of mask)
Life Extension, or L.E. as we like
to refer to it, is a glimpse of
the future... a ticket... not in
the juvenile sense, but in the
deeply meaningful sense that can
only be borne in the human heart.
92
The DNA codes of the human body
have been broken. Soon, heart
ailments, cancer and so much more,
will be a thing of the past. Very
simply, your anguish... your
discontent... even your death is
no longer necessary in a
traditional sense. Whatever
malady that hides behind that
mask... is temporary.
She looks directly at David, and it stirs him. McCabe
studies her, and the operation. He thirsts for clues.
David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel
of photos of storage tanks. Lavishly and warmly
photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine.
DEARBORN
Within an hour of your passing,
L.E. will transfer your body to a
vessel where you will be sealed
and frozen at
196
degrees below
zero. Power outages, earthquakes,
nothing will effect your
suspension-hibernation.
MCCABE
Did you sign this contract, David?
David looks down at pamphlet, looks up.
DAVID
What's the "Lucid Dream" option?
DEARBORN
Good choice. The Lucid Dream is
Life Extension's newest option.
For a little extra, we offer the
cryonic union of science and
entertainment.
MCCABE
(rueful, skeptical)
"Cryo-tainment. "
Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal
a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top. Aames
and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses
play.
DEARBORN
Some find this presentation
helpful.
93
INTERCUT
ON MONITOR - THE PRESENTATION
An appealing presentation begins
-- Man's Life. A generic
happy-looking Man with graphics floating out of his mouth:
Re-Emerge ...
. Re-Store
.Re--Invent...a voice takes over for
Dearborn. A wonderfully comforting tone is present in the
narration. Like that of a parent.
NARRATION
Portrait of a modern human life.
American, male.
(highlighting stage)
Birth.
(highlighting another
stage)
and Death. Imagine that you
are suffering from a terminal
illness. You'd like to be
cryonized, but you'd rather be
resurrected to continue your own
life, as you know it now. L.E.
offers you the answer. Upon
resurrection you will continue in
an ageless state - preserved - but
living in the "present" with a
future of your choosing.
VIDEO MONITOR -- THE PRESENTATION
Push in on a door that opens to a panel of steel
compartments. Music and atmosphere are seductive and
compelling.
NARRATION (CONT ' D )
Your death will be wiped from your
memory. Your life will continue
as a realistic work of art,
painted by you, minute-to-minute.
And you'll live it with the
romantic abandon of a summer
day... with the feeling of a great
movie, or a pop song you always
loved. With no memory of how it
all occurred, save for the
knowledge that everything
simply... improved. And in any
instance of discontent, you'll be
visited by Technical Support.
94
VIDEO MONITOR - THE PRESENTATION
Shot of Edmund Ventura holding a Life Extension folder in
his arms. Graphic reads: Tech Support.
NARRATION (CONT'D)
It is all just around the corner,
the day after tomorrow.
MONITOR - THE PRESENTATION
The words: LIFE, PART TWO drift onto the screen, obscuring
the phase marked: Death.
NARRATION
Another chapter begins seamlessly,
a living dream. Life Extension's
promise to you. Life -- Part Two.
DEARBORN
A living dream.
MCCABE
Your death will be wiped from your
memory. I guess I missed that one
in USA Today.
David sits, reeling from the revelation he may be living a
Lucid Dream.
DAVID
. a dream... What if there was a
mistake? What if the dream became
a nightmare?
DEARBORN
Of course, your subconscious can
always play tricks on you. The
subconscious is a very powerful
thing -
SIDE-ANGLE CU MCCABE
Sits forward. He turns to David with great strength,
worried for him.
MCCABE
Did you sign a contract with these
people, David?
DEARBORN
(continuing)
-but this is a serious business.
The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.
95
And what is any life, if not the
pursuit of a dream? The dream of
peace. The dream of achievement.
The dream of hearing someone
saying these words, when they
truly mean them.
David is deeply moved as he listens. Somewhere, music
begins to play. It is The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations."
DEARBORN
I love you, David. Te Quiero.
Roam free, David. Most of us live
our whole lives with no real
adventure to call our own. It's
hard to comprehend-but they
laughed at Jules Verne too.
DAVID
DEARBORN
This is a revolution of the

mind.
CLOSE FRONTAL SHOT OF DAVID AAMES
David pulls off his mask. He runs out.
David storms around the corner from Dearborn's office,
yelling, raving.
DAVID
I want to wake up! I want to wake
up!
Aaron grabs for him. David wrenches free.
DAVID
TECH SUPPORT!
David runs down the corridor and into the elevator, Aaron
chasing after him.
DAVID
It's a nightmare!
The doors shut. Music rising.
David is collapsed on the ground. His mask clutched in his
hand, passed out. Rhythmic score.
VENTURA
(with importance)
That night, when Sofia left you
and you fell asleep on the
pavement, that was the moment you
chose for the splice...
DAVID
(remembers the word)
The splice?
FADE OUT ON MASK
The mask has tumbled out of his hand.
VENTURA
Splice. The end of your "real"
life and the beginning of L.E.'s
Lucid Dream. A splice of many
years which passed while you were
frozen and dreaming.
FADE UP ON MASK
A moody day dawns. David's mask is just outside the reach
of his outstretched hand.
ON DAVID PASSED OUT ON STREET
Sofia's hand reaches in, and awakens him. Everything is
suddenly a little more vivid, a little more super-real.
SOFIA
Open your eyes.
They walk away, down the street, into a beautiful Vanilla
Sky. Sofia slips her arm around his shoulder, as we've
seen earlier.
VENTURA
From the moment you woke up on
that street, nothing was "real" in
98
a traditional sense. Your Lucid
Dream is monitored by Life
Extension, and a panel of experts
who follow your every thought.
Even at this moment.
Match push in on David rising to his feet. His disfigured
face thunders with a massive migraine. The exact. shot we
once saw as David and Sofia walked away together. This
time, David is alone.
VENTURA
The morning after the nightclub,
you woke up on that street, hung-
over and along. You got up and
walked away. You never saw Sofia
again.
DAVID
I didn't kill Sofia.
VENTURA
No.
ON DAVID - IN ELEVATOR
He can't remember any of this. And then...
VENTURA
You battled your board, the Seven
Dwarves, for control. In the end
it was Thomas Tipp, your father's
101
friend, the one whose job you
saved, who wrenched the company
back in your control.
David and Ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop.
VENTURA
Your subconscious did create
problems. Your dream turned into
a nightmare. The glitch has been
corrected.
DAVID
So all I have to do is imagine
something? If I wanted McCabe to
come back, right now -
McCabe comes flying out of the door.
MCCABE
David. Listen to me. These
people are dangerous. We're in
trouble. We need to get off this
roof now.
MCC DAVID
Who turns from McCabe to Ventura.
Ventura leads David away.
VENTURA
We're now on "pause". And you're
about to return to your Lucid
Dream...
MCCABE
"Pause"?
VENTURA
(continuing)
.. with all of the upgrades. You
won't remember any of this, nor be
charged for the technical support.
it is now your moment of choice.
You can return to your Lucid
Dream, and live a beautiful life
104
with Sofia, or whomever you
wish... or you can choose the
world out there.
Ventura gestures to the city beyond, as they come to a
halt.
CLOSE ON DAVID
DAVID
The world out. there. And you can
bring me back, just. like Benny the
Dog.
CLOSE ON VENTURA
The client is starting to understand.
VENTURA
Yes. Just like Benny the Dog.
Your face and body can now be
fixed, of course. But it's very
different out there now. Your
finances won't last long. Your
panel of observers are waiting for
you to choose.
Ventura gestures into the camera. He begins walking
backwards to the roof's ledge.
VENTURA
There are no guarantees. But
remember, even in the future, the
sweet is never as sweet without
the sour.
David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the
roof. He nods to Brian, who nods back.
DAVID
How do I wake up?
VENTURA
The decision is yours.
Ventura glances over the edge.
DAVID
And I chose this scenario, didn't
I?
105
VENTURA
(enjoying that he
understands)
Yes, to face your last remaining
fear of heights.
MCCABE
David, don't listen to him. You
were right. This is the Seven
Dwarves. It's a set up! You
can't trust him.
David looks at McCabe with compassion.
VENTURA
Don't feel bad, David. This
winning man is your creation.
It's in his nature to fight for
his existence. But he's not real.
CLOSE ON DAVID
who looks on with compassion.
McCabe fights for himself.
MCCABE
I'm real. I have two daughters.
You know that.
VENTURA
What are their names?
MCCABE
I
- I --
CLOSE ON DAVID
who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles.
MCCABE
Mortality as home entertainment.
This cannot be the future. Can
it?
David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems
unsure of his own existence. Slowly, always looking at
David, he settles into the truth of his very being. With
great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets
and faces his own destiny... or lack thereof.
MCCABE
(quietly)
Goodbye.
106
VENTURA
It's been a brilliant journey of
self-awakening, and you've simply
got to ask yourself -- what is
happiness to you?
CLOSE PUSH IN ON DAVID AAMES
His moment of realization.
DAVID
I want to live a real life. I
don't want to dream any longer.
VENTURA
Any last wishes?
DAVID
Let them out there read my mind.
VENTURA
I wish you well, David.
Music rises as he turns to see Sofia. He moves to her.
She touches his cheek. His face is restored. They
embrace.
DAVID
Look at us. I'm frozen, and
you're dead. And I love you.
SOFIA
It's a problem.
DAVID
I lost you when I got in that car.
I'm sorry.
She looks at him, beguiling and understanding.
DAVID
But remember what you told me
once? Every passing minute is
another chance to turn it all
around.
She kisses him.
SOFIA
I'll find you again.
She regards her lost love, taking him in. David treasures
his last moments with her.
107
David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge.
DAVID
I'll see you in another life when
we are both cats.
David backs up and begins to run. He arrives at the edge,
looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping
himself at the precipice.
He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out
into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he
is suspended in mid-air. And he hurtles to the ground.
And the ground hurtles to meet him.
SERIES OF IMAGES
It is the little things, the random poetic instances of
David Aames' life that come back to him. Music rises as he
realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity. The
images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his
heartbeat. Father. Mother. A casual glance of a
stranger. All combine to give his life meaning. And then,
finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him
purpose in this life... and the next. Sofia.
TO WHITE:
The sound of a breath. A gulp of life. Someone's heart is
beating.
A WOMAN'S VOICE
Relax... relax, David... open your
eyes...
An eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left.
Life again.
A WOMAN'S VOICE
open your eyes.
