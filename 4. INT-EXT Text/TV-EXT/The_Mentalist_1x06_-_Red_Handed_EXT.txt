      A long stretch of desert road abruptly cluttered with a mass 
      of California and Nevada Highway Patrolmen milling about a 
      CRIME SCENE.  We see LISBON talking with a Captain as he 
      inputs data into a handheld GPS.  

      JANE, RIGSBY, VAN PELT and CHO stand slightly apart, watching 
      Lisbon.

                                  CHO
                    That damn GPS is going to put it in 
                      California.  I know it.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Think positive.  It s Nevada.  
                      Definitely Nevada.

      ANGLE ON: A SEVERED RIGHT HAND lying on the asphalt, palm up.

      The number  43  is written small in ink -- very faded now --  
      on the palm of the hand.  

      Starting from the hand, two uniform HIGHWAY PATROLMEN (one 
        Californian, one Nevadan) unroll big tape measures toward  
      two signs:  One that says  California Border  and the other 
       Nevada Border. 

                                  CHO
                    You re dreaming.  We ll catch it.  
                    A stone cold mystery.

                    Forensics are already running the 
                    prints.  Maybe we ll get a quick 
                    match.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We d never get that lucky.  We re 
                    going to be  talking to the hand  
                    for a long while.

                                  JANE
                    Why so glum?  A case is a case.

                      Dismemberments are a pig.  You can 
                    spend months just assembling the 
                    victim.  And there s always a piece 
                    missing.   

                                  JANE 
                    There s already plenty to work with 
                    right here.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    It s a right hand with a number on 
                    it.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    A male hand, or a not very femme 
                    female.  What else can you get 
                    right here without any forensic 
                    analysis?

                                  JANE
                    Let s see.  Probably a white man in 
                    his fifties.  He wrote on his right 
                    hand, so he s a lefty.  

                                  CHO
                    Maybe the killer wrote it.  Some 
                    kind of message. 

                                  JANE
                    Too faded.  And a killer would 
                    write it bigger.

      Jane gets on his hands and knees to sniff the hand.  Several 
      troopers notice this.  And LISBON who sees him sniff while 
      waiting by a patrol car with the Captain, who gives her a 
      quizzical look.

                    Smells of almond oil moisturizer, 
                    musky cologne, and tobacco.  His 
                    palms are supple, his nails are 
                      professionally maintained. 

      Jane stands up.

                    So, a rich man.  There s a faint 
                    tan line on his little finger from 
                    a missing pinkie ring.  Suggesting

      Cho checks his pockets.

                      Thirty-five cents.

                                  JANE
                      Thirty-five cents?  I find that hard 
                    to believe considering the huge crayon 
                    bank you ve probably got hiding behind 
                    your bedroom door that s filled with 
                    all the spare change you ve acquired 
                    since you were 15. 

      Cho is alternately mortified and amazed that Jane even 
      guessed something like that about him so accurately.  Rigsby 
      stifles a giggle.

                                  CHO
                          (annoyed)

                    leave it.

                                  JANE
                    You have a bet.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don t think it s right to gamble 
                    on such things.  That s a human 
                    being that died right there.

      Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt exit their car.  As Lisbon hands 
      the keys to a VALET, she gets a call.

      Jane walks the deserted streets with his booty.  While 
      walking, he spies a PLANET AID DONATION BOX in a parking lot.  
      He takes a look around to make sure no one is watching, and 
      then deposits the money and the jewels in the box.  As he s 
      walking away, his PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.  It s Lisbon.

                    Mr. Etienne, we have a warrant to 
                    search your property.

      Matt s resigned, depressed.  As the group approaches his 
      property, they look down and notice a large amount of dried 
      mud surrounding the place.  They cautiously watch their step, 
      including Jane, who sees something in the mud that takes his 
      attention.

      ON JANE:  looking at large, deep footprints.  The same prints 
      going both ways.

                      relationship a long time ago.  They 
                    came to an understanding.  He was

                    Look at this.

      Jane points at the footprints in the mud, leading around the 
      side of the house and back again.

      Jim Meier approaches Daniel just as Daniel is about to leave.

      hits Jim hard.  Jim goes down.  Daniel wails on him.

      Daniel tosses the bat back in his truck, takes all the money 
      off of Jim, finally yanking the poker chip from around his 
      neck.  He drags the body into his truck.
