  A stone circle, ancient and huge.

  FX SHOT: The circle against a fabulous star-filled sky.

  Two figures in robes, ROBERT FRANCE (40s) and 13 year old son 
  MARK, new to this, eyes big with wonder, assisting.

                                ROBERT
                By the Fire of the Sun, the Rage of 
                  the Sea, the Fury of the Wind...

                                MARK
                  Now, dad?

                                ROBERT
                  Yes, now, Mark. Now.

  Mark, nervous, casts powder into a burner carved into the 
  rock on the circle s altar stone. There s a burst of red PRAC 
    SMOKE. Robert raises an elaborately decorated RING above his 
  head.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                I call upon the Eye of Questoroth 
                to look upon this Ring of Healing 
                  and give it the power to cure.

  FX SHOT: The stones start to GLOW. Energy building. Magical 
    script appears on them as they glow.

                                MARK
                  The stones! They - they re glowing! 

    Robert enjoys his son s wonder for a moment.

                                ROBERT
                  You never forget the first time you 
                  see the Power of Magic.

  FX SHOT: Energy leaps stone to stone like magical lightning.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Now be quiet, wizardry is ten per 
                  cent invocation and ninety per  
                  cent concentration.

  As PRAC WIND blows around them Robert raises his arms.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Questoroth come to me! Questoroth, 
                I summon thee!

  As Mark searches the sky - and suddenly sees something -

                                ROBERT
                  It s coming! The Eye of Questoroth!

  FX SHOT: A shooting star - heading for the circle.

                                MARK
                  Dad, are you sure that s the Eye of 
                  Questoroth?

                                ROBERT
                Of course. What else could it be?

    Robert bows his head.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Oh, Questoroth!

  FX SHOT: The light gets bigger. And it s REVOLVING!

                                MARK
                It - it looks like a spaceship!

                                ROBERT
                  What do you mean, a spaceship?

                                MARK
                An alien spaceship.

                                ROBERT
                  Don t be ridiculous. There are no 
                  such things as aliens!

                                MARK
                  Try telling them that!

                                ROBERT
                  For the last time, there are no -

  And he looks up, sees -

  FX SHOT: A SPACECRAFT! Flying saucer-style. Awesome!

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  ... It s impossible...

  FX SHOT: The spacecraft hovers over the circle. Huge.

  FX SHOT: Blinding LIGHT bursts out from beneath it.

    Robert drops the ring, as they are bathed in PRAC LIGHT.

                                MARK

  A school football match. King s Park against Darwin High. 
  KIDS screaming support from the sidelines. 

  TOM CLARKE (16) good-looking, athletic. Near the penalty box.

                                TOM
                  Quinn! To me!

  QUINN CHRISTOPHER passes the ball - 

  KATIE LORD (16) screams support with the other spectators -

                  Go, Tom!

  Close to Katie, BENNY SHERWOOD (16) bit of a geek -

                  Come on, King s Park

  - A DEFENDER tackles Tom  - the ball is kicked out. Narrowly 
    misses Benny.

  A teacher on the sidelines, MISS WEBSTER, yells.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

  Quinn gets ready to take the throw-in.

  Benny checks his watch - it s a mass of dials and things.

                                BENNY
                  Time s almost up! Come on! 

  Quinn throws to Tom - who takes the ball up the wing -

                                SPECTATORS
                Go on, Tom!... Get in there, 
                  Tom!... Come on, Tom!

    MICHAEL CLARKE (42), a good looking and capable man, shouts 
    encouragement. 

                                MICHAEL
                  Make it count, Tom!

  Tom shoots - kicks high. As the keeper prepares to save, 
    everyone s eyes are on the ball sailing through the air -

                                TOM
                        (whispers)
                  Maah-gann dah!

  FX SHOT: MAGICAL ENERGY around Tom s fingers as he CLICKS

  FX SHOT: It SWERVES mid-air from the keeper into the net!

  The whistle! King s Park go wild. The TEAM swamps Tom.

  As the keeper looks at the ball - bemused - what happened?!

                                QUINN
                  Mate, that was magic!

                                TOM
                        (grins)
                  Well, that s me, isn t it?!

  As the team surrounds Tom in celebration.

                                TEAM
                  Tom! Tom! Tom!

  But Tom feels Michael s eyes on him - his dad isn t happy. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

  APRIL AVENUE. A nice place to live. As Michael s 4x4 parks at 
  No. 23. MICHAEL and TOM jump out, Tom bouncing a football. 
    Michael with a bag marked  VET  from the back seat, not 
    happy.

                                MICHAEL
                  You know the rule - no spells 
                  outside home.

                                TOM
                  Dad, we got through to the final.

                                MICHAEL
                By using Magic - it wasn t fair.

                                TOM
                I just gave it a nudge. 

                                MICHAEL
                  Was there a wizard on the other 
                  team? 

                                TOM
                  No. Course not.

                                MICHAEL
                So it was unfair. You cheated. 

  As Michael leads Tom into the house.

                  Happy birthday, honey. 

  But Tom is gazing at the headstone, deep in thought.

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  Are you all right, son?

                                TOM
                  You say Magic s this great big 
                  thing. A gift. And I shouldn t mess 
                  around with it. But what s the 
                  point? Mum had Magic, but she still 
                  had to die.

    Michael has asked himself the same question. 

                                MICHAEL
                  There are some things Magic isn t 
                  supposed to fix. That s what your 
                  Gran told me back then. There are 
                  lines that wizards just can t 
                  cross. Even for someone they love.

  Tom looks back at the gravestone.

                                TOM
                  But you would ve done, wouldn t 
                  you? No matter what the rules said. 
                If you d been a wizard.

    Michael regards his son, this isn t easy...

                                MICHAEL
                I loved your mum. She had a magic 
                  that had nothing to do with 
                  wizards. I d have done anything to 
                  save her. But I don t have Magic. 
                  And I can t teach you everything 
                  you need to know. Things your mum 
                  could have taught you. About how to 
                be what you are. What she was.

                  Listen, Tom, there are more things

                  important. How to be a good man.

                  Hurry up, Benny. Miss Webster will 
                be lonely without her pet. 

  Benny carries on, just ahead of Tom, Quinn and Katie. But 
    making it clear he s not running after the teacher.


                                KATIE
                  Any way, I thought standing stones 
                  were put up by Druids. People like 
                  that. For magical ceremonies. I 
                  mean, an observatory? How boring is 
                  that? But magic, now that s cool.

  Tom grins - he really likes Katie.

                                TOM
                  You think so?

    Katie s smile twinkles.

                                KATIE
                  Yeah. Course it is.

  As BENNY interrupts -

                                BENNY
                  Magic s a load of old Hogwarts. 

                                TOM
                  Are you still here?

                                BENNY
                  I m talking about science, Katie. 
                  Which, in case you missed chemistry 
                  this week, is real.

                                TOM
                  Couldn t miss it, Benny, you nearly 
                  blew the class up. Again.

  Tom, Quinn and Katie laughing at Benny as they carry on along 
  the path. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

  The STUDENTS come along the footpath - TOM with KATIE, QUINN 
  and BENNY. As they get closer to the STONE CIRCLE, Tom stops -

    FLASHBACK - Sc 1, ROBERT and MARK working Magic there.

  KATIE sees Tom -

                                KATIE
                  Tom? Are you all right?

  But it s as if she s in another world. Tom is transfixed.

    FLASHBACK - Sc 1 - the energy build-up between the stones.

                He just went a bit... weird.
                      (to Tom)
                  You said something happened here?

  On Tom again.

    FLASHBACK: ROBERT and MARK staring upwards in horror.

  Tom shakes the images in his head, tries to get a grip.

                                TOM
                I mean in the past. I bet.

  Quinn looks at Benny - 

                                QUINN
                  Like human sacrifice. I knew there 
                  was a reason we brought Benny!

  As MISS WEBSTER, at the stones with the others -

                                MISS WEBSTER 
                  You four! Are you waiting for the 
                  stones to come to you?

  As they join MISS WEBSTER and the rest of the group.

                                MISS WEBSTER (CONT D)
                  Now, the purpose of the Circle, 
                  like Stonehenge, is unclear.

                                TOM
                        (whispers to Benny)
                  See. They don t know what it is.

                        (whispers to Tom)
                  Okay, well some people say they re 
                  landing pads for alien spacecraft. 
                  How s that for an explanation?

                                TOM
                  There s no such thing as aliens. 

  On Tom.

  TOM reels. Still not sure what he s seeing, but freaked.

                                MISS WEBSTER
                I want measurements and sketches. 
                  Teams of two. Get on with it!

  Tom looks around him; sees Katie is paired up with Quinn - 
  it s just him and Benny. Great (not)!

                                BENNY
                  Looks like we re a team. So no 
                  messing about. Just because you 
                  don t care about your grades 
                  doesn t mean I have to miss out.

                                TOM
                  Being stuck with you is so totally  *
                  lame.*

  And the kids get to work. Grudgingly, Tom is with Benny -

                                BENNY
                  Don t worry about it. Like I want 
                  anyone to think we re mates. No 
                  way.

  Tom bites his tongue - and unseen by Benny, Tom - finds the 
    RING OF HEALING in the grass. As he picks it up it GLOWS with 
  a PRAC light.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                BENNY
                  Wow! Look at that!

  Tom knows what it is - and Benny seeing it is bad news.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                It was in the grass.

  Tom can t stop Benny taking it - instantly the glow dies.

                                BENNY
                  What happened? It just stopped.

  Tom is edgy.

                                                                          CUT TO:

  Benny pulls a magnifying glass from his bag.

                                BENNY
                  No, this is freaky. It was glowing.

  and chest. A VOOLOX.

  MISS WEBSTER reacts with shock, dropping her phone -

  The Voolox locks on to her skull with a sucker. And it s like 
  she s been turned off. Her eyes closed.
