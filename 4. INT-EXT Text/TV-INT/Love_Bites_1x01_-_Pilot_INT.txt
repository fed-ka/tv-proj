      ...a CHERRY that is dropped into a drink at a hip wedding 
      reception.  We see the BRIDE and GROOM, who are incredibly 
      happy and in love.  This is not their story.  

      Beyond the bride and groom, in the distance, we find two 28-
      year-olds, ANNIE and FRANNIE, both bridesmaids, sitting at 
      their table sipping champagne and watching the happy couple:  
      The groom stands behind the bride, his arms wrapped around 
      her waist as they chat with their GUESTS.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    Were they married or surgically 
                    attached?

                                  ANNIE
                    Doesn t it make you happy to see 
                    Jill so happy?

                                    FRANNIE
                    This is my fifth wedding this 
                    summer.  I m running out of happy.   

                                  ANNIE
                    I think it s encouraging when 
                    everyone around you is falling in 
                    love.  It s like you re next.

                                    FRANNIE
                    We have to be next.  We re the only 
                    ones left.  In fact, I wanted to 
                    talk to you about that, Annie.  

                                  ANNIE
                    About what, Frannie?

                                    FRANNIE
                    That.  The Annie-Frannie of it all.  
                    It s no good. 

                                  ANNIE
                    For meeting men, you mean?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Ding ding ding.  In a group it was 
                    okay, but just the two of us...  
                          (she mimes gagging)
                    Do you ever go by Anne?                                                                                      3.



                                  ANNIE
                    No.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    Want to start?

                                  ANNIE
                    No.  Anne sounds too serious.  Like 
                    Anne Frank.  Who wants to date Anne 
                    Frank?  It s depressing.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    Okay, tell you what.  I ll go by 
                    Fran, which I don t even like, if 
                    you will stop telling people you re 
                    a virgin.

                                  ANNIE
                    But I am a virgin.

                                    FRANNIE
                    I know.  Everyone knows.  It s like 
                    your thing.

                                  ANNIE
                    It s not my thing.  It s just a 
                    fact.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Fine.  But then, why do you have to 
                    bring it up right up front, as soon 
                    as you meet someone?

                                  ANNIE
                    Because a lot of men aren t into 
                    that.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Please!  Men looooove the virgins.

                                  ANNIE
                    No, they love the idea of sex with 
                    a virgin.  Which is like going to a 
                    vegan restaurant for a burger.  
                    Hello?  It s VEGAN!  I m a VIRGIN!

      People stare.  Annie doesn t care, but Frannie does.

                                    FRANNIE
                          (quietly)
                    Okay, the problem is... when you 
                    say you re a virgin, it makes me, 
                    by contrast, look like a slut.                                                                                      4.



                                  ANNIE
                    If the condom fits...

                                    FRANNIE
                          (indignant)
                    I have only slept with three men.
                          (a beat)
                    At this wedding. 

      Frannie smiles.  Annie shakes her head.

                                  ANNIE
                    Alright, when we re together, I 
                    will not mention that I m a virgin.

                                    FRANNIE
                    And I ll be Fran.

                                  ANNIE
                    Should we try it here?

                                    FRANNIE
                    On who?!  

                                  ANNIE
                    Don t be so negative!  
                          (looks around, then)
                    What about those guys at that table 
                    over there?  

      Frannie looks where Annie is looking.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    They don t have dates with them.  
                    And they re cute. 

                                    FRANNIE
                          (playing along)
                    Yes, they are.

                                  ANNIE
                          (looking into her drink)
                    Are they checking us out?

                                    FRANNIE
                    They re kissing.

                                  ANNIE
                    Ah.   

      On Frannie, not sure this relationship is going to work...                                                                                      5.




      Annie and Frannie, dressed to impress, are at a very crowded 
      bar trying to get a BARTENDER s attention.  Frannie notices 
      she s standing behind a handsome guy, JORDAN, sitting alone 
      at the bar drinking a beer.  Frannie nods in his direction to 
      Annie, indicating that she thinks he s cute.  

      Annie points to her wedding finger.  

      Frannie cranes to see Jordan s left hand and shakes her head 
       no,  meaning he s single.   

                                  ANNIE
                    Make your move.

                                    FRANNIE
                    I believe I will.

      Frannie pulls out some money to get the bartender s attention 
      and leans in, her breasts practically in Jordan s face.  

                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    What s a girl gotta do to get a 
                    drink around here?

                                  JORDAN
                          (re: his beer)
                    I ordered this yesterday over the 
                    internet.  

      Frannie and Annie laugh.  He s not only cute, he s funny.

                                  JORDAN (CONT D)
                    What can I attempt -- and probably 
                    fail -- to get you ladies?  

                                    FRANNIE
                    A dirty martini.  
                          (flirting)
                    Very dirty.

                                  ANNIE
                    And a virgin margarita.  

      Frannie shoots Annie a look as Jordan tries to get the 
      bartender s attention.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    What?  I m driving.                                                                                         6.



                                  JORDAN
                    I like it.  Responsible, but the 
                    girl still knows how to live.

                                  ANNIE
                          (infectiously bubbly)
                    I love that you got all that from 
                    my drink order!

                                  JORDAN
                          (liking her)
                    I didn t get your name, though.  
                    I m Jordan.  

      He flashes a winning smile.

                                  ANNIE
                          (smitten)
                    Annie.  Hello.

                                    FRANNIE
                          (feeling left out)
                    And I m--  

                                  JORDAN
                    What do you do, Annie?

                                  ANNIE
                    I m a social worker.

                                  JORDAN
                    My mom is a social worker!

                                    FRANNIE
                    I m a virgin.

                                  JORDAN
                    What?

                                  ANNIE
                    What?

                                    FRANNIE
                    What?  Yeah.  That s why I reacted 
                    that way when she said what she was 
                    drinking.  I thought she was making 
                    fun of me.

                                  JORDAN
                    Why would anyone make fun of that?  
                    It s admirable.                                                                                      7.



                                  ANNIE
                    It is admirable.
                          (pointedly)
                    It s not something I would joke 
                    about, Fran.

      It s too late, though.  Jordan is now completely intrigued by 
      Frannie.

                                  JORDAN
                    So... um... do you mind me asking?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Ask away.

                                  JORDAN
                    Are you, what?  Waiting until you 
                    get married?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yeah.  
                          (earnest)
                    It s hard, you know.  But I think 
                    it ll be worth it.

                                  JORDAN
                    That s tremendous.  The last virgin 
                    in Virginia.

      Frannie shrugs and smiles shyly.  Jordan smiles back at her.  
      Annie is annoyed.


      Frannie and Jordan are making out on her couch.  Frannie 
      starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Man.  You re a fantastic kisser.

                                  JORDAN
                    So are you.  I guess since you 
                    can t have sex...

                                    FRANNIE
                          (stops unbuttoning)
                    What?  Oh, yeah.  Right.  I can t.

      They kiss some more.  She wants him.  She regroups.                                                                                      8.



                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    Actually, it s not that I can t.  
                    It s not a religious thing.  I ve 
                    chosen not to. 

                                  JORDAN
                    And I respect that.

                                    FRANNIE
                          (disappointed)
                    Really?  

                                  JORDAN
                    Yeah.  I m cool with whatever you 
                    want.  In fact, if you want me to 
                    leave...

                                    FRANNIE
                    No!  You know what?  Jordan...
                          (as if it s a gift)
                    I want you to be my first.

                                  JORDAN
                          (a beat, really touched)
                    Maybe someday I will be, Fran.

      He looks at her as if envisioning their future.

                                    FRANNIE
                    No, I mean... tonight.

                                  JORDAN
                    I thought you wanted to wait until 
                    you got married.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yeah, um.  Jordan, the truth is... 

      She looks into his eyes, wanting to tell the truth, but he s 
      looking at her with such respect and tenderness...

                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    I just want my first time to be 
                    special.  And I feel like it could 
                    be.  With you.

                                  JORDAN
                    But what if you regret it?  You ve 
                    waited your whole life...                                                                                      9.



                                    FRANNIE
                    See, this is the problem.  It s too 
                    much pressure.  I just want to get 
                    it over with already.

                                  JORDAN
                    No, don t say that!  You need 
                    someone to show you the ropes.  
                    Slow.  And sweet.

                                    FRANNIE
                            (innocently)
                    Is that... important?


      Jordan and Frannie are in bed and he s kissing Frannie slowly 
      down her stomach.  She s in ecstacy.  She MOANS.

                                  JORDAN
                    Are you okay?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yes!

                                  JORDAN
                    Are you sure you want to do this?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yes!!

                                  JORDAN
                    I should put on a condom then.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yes!!!

      Frannie reaches over and opens her bedside drawer, then 
      remembers she s a virgin and shuts it. 

                                  JORDAN
                    I have one in my wallet.  Can you 
                    wait while I get it?

                                    FRANNIE
                    I ve waited twenty-eight years.  I 
                    can wait two more minutes.  

      He kisses her and leaves.  She smiles at the ceiling.                                                                                    10.




      Frannie, still smiling, is now looking at the ceiling of her 
      gym.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    It was the best sex I ever had.

      Frannie is doing flies with some light weights as Annie does 
      squats next to her.  Frannie is in a great mood.  Annie is 
      not.

                                  ANNIE
                    The only sex you ever had, right?  
                    Because you re a virgin? 

      Frannie sits up to talk to Annie.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    Annie... 
                          (a beat... feeling bad?)
                    I love being a virgin!  There were 
                    hours and hours of foreplay!  And 
                    he kept trying things to see what I 
                    liked.  I thought I knew what I 
                    liked, but--

                                  ANNIE
                    You stole my virginity!

      A few MEN WORKING OUT nearby turn and look at them.  Some 
      WEIGHTS DROP onto the floor.

                                    FRANNIE
                          (quietly)
                    I didn t sleep with you.

                                  ANNIE
                    You took something I care about, 
                    and used it for sex.

                                    FRANNIE
                    For great sex.   

                                  ANNIE
                    You can t build a relationship on a 
                    lie.

                                    FRANNIE
                    What relationship?  He liked me 
                    because I was virgin, and now I m 
                    not.                                                                                       11.



                                  ANNIE
                    You were never a virgin!

                                    FRANNIE
                    Once I was a virgin!  The point is, 
                    I took advantage of a typical 
                    male s shallow, egotistical desire 
                    to be a girl s first.  I used him 
                    and he used me.  The fewer 
                    illusions you have about these 
                    things, the better.

      Frannie s cell phone rings.  She picks up.

                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    Hello?...  Oh.  Hi, Jordan... 

      She looks at Annie, amazed he called.

                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    No, I feel fine about it...  I 
                    didn t regret it at all.  Did 
                    you?...  It was really special...  
                    No, better than I expected...  I 
                    promise I m not freaking out... 
                          (then)
                    Yeah, I could do dinner tonight.  
                    I ll call you later and we ll make 
                    a plan...  Bye.

      She hangs up.  She looks sick.

                                  ANNIE
                    He seems so nice.

                                    FRANNIE
                    He is so nice.
                          (depressed)
                    And he s good in bed.  And cute and 
                    smart and funny and successful...  
                    Annie, what have I done?

                                  ANNIE
                    Screwed up our chances with the 
                    last good guy in Virginia.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Our chances?

                                  ANNIE
                    He was flirting with me before you 
                    stole my virginity!                                                                                      12.



                                    FRANNIE
                    Could you please stop saying that?
                          (a beat, getting excited)
                    What should I wear tonight?

                                  ANNIE
                    You have to tell him, you know.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yeah.  Of course...  Do I?  I mean, 
                    he should have been my first.  And 
                    if he was my first, how romantic!  
                    And what a great story for our 
                    kids!

                                  ANNIE
                    Um, there are a few men who could 
                    refute that story. 
                          (a beat)
                    At this gym.

      Frannie laughs a little at this, then glances around, worried 
      it s true.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    And who knows?  Maybe he ll think 
                    it s funny.


      PAN PAST SOME ANGRY MEN sitting at the bar yelling at a 
      televised New York Rangers hockey game.

                                    RANGERS FAN
                    You suck, Perling!

      Annie is doing the same.

                                  ANNIE
                    C mon, Perling, get it together!

      Frannie, depressed, is eating cheese fries.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Honesty is so overrated.

                                  ANNIE
                    No, it s not.  You should always be 
                    honest.  That s why I prefer to 
                    tell the truth right up front. 

                                    FRANNIE
                    Uh huh.  Is that why you come here 
                    and pretend to care about hockey 
                    when clearly you re here for the 
                    favorable man to woman ratio?

                                  ANNIE
                    It s not that.  
                            (whispering)
                    It s the bartender.  

      She nods discretely in the direction of the CUTE BARTENDER, 
      who is laughing with one of the HOT WAITRESSES.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    I find him so dreamy, but he flirts 
                    with every waitress here.  How can 
                    I compete with Double D s, heels 
                    and hot pants?                                                                                    14.



      Frannie knows how, and she feels like she owes Annie one.  

                                    FRANNIE
                          (to the bartender)
                    Hey, hi.  Can I get a Diet Coke for 
                    my friend here.  
                          (proud)
                    She s a virgin, by the way.

      The bartender laughs hard, as do a few of the Rangers fans 
      who overheard.  Annie is insulted and confused.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Is that a great story or what?

      The men laugh some more.  Finally Annie asks:

                                  ANNIE
                    What story?

                                    RANGERS FAN
                    The Last Virgin in Virginia!

      Annie and Frannie aren t sure how to react.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                          (to Annie)
                    You didn t hear this?  The guy who 
                    called into the John & Nikki show 
                    this morning?  He met some girl who 
                    tells men she s a virgin so the sex 
                    will be better!

      He smiles at Frannie, thinking she s in on the joke.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Ha.  Ha ha.

                                    RANGERS FAN
                    So now everybody s a virgin!

      The guys laugh.  Annie and Frannie laugh along weakly, then:

                                  ANNIE
                    Except... I m really a virgin.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Yeah, right!

      Two of the HOT WAITRESSES chime in:

                                  HOT WAITRESS #1
                    Me, too!                                                                                    15.



                                  HOT WAITRESS #2
                    Me, too!

      As everyone else laughs, and men chat with the waitresses...

                                    FRANNIE
                    It s not like it was a policy.  It 
                    was a one-time thing.

                                  ANNIE
                    Losing your virginity is a one-time 
                    thing!  Don t talk to me about one-
                    time things!

                                    FRANNIE
                          (trying to convince 
                            herself as much as Annie)
                    This will all blow over.  It was on 
                    local radio, not national 
                      television.  

      The bartender hands Annie her Diet Coke.  

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Here you go, virgin.

      He and the guys crack up again.  Annie looks at Frannie.

                                    FRANNIE
                    You know what?  Maybe this is good.  

                                  ANNIE
                    How is this good?!

                                    FRANNIE
                    Well, if everyone is a virgin, 
                    maybe slut is the new virgin.

                                  ANNIE
                    So it s good for you.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Well, yeah. 

      As Annie worries whether this relationship with Frannie is 
      going to work out, the bartender drops a cherry in her soda.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Forgot the cherry.

      He smiles at Annie with his dreamy smile, then walks off.                                                                                      16.



                                  ANNIE
                    Is he... flirting with me?

                                    FRANNIE
                    You re welcome.

                                  ANNIE
                    So what now?  I have to pretend I m 
                    not a virgin?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Just until he gets to know you 
                    better.

      As Annie considers this and our THEME MUSIC comes up...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.


                                        ACT TWO

      As our THEME MUSIC plays, we again see the three tattoos 
      which represent tonight s three stories: the CHERRY with the 
      words  first time,  the BRIEFCASE with the words  first to 
      go,  and the STAR with the words  first on the list ... 

      The briefcase tattoo that says  first to go  fills the frame 
      and becomes...


      ...the BRIEFCASE that CARTER, 32, handsome, generally happy, 
      recently engaged, pops open on his desk, having just arrived 
      at the mid-size, Midtown law firm where he works as an 
      accountant.

      He shares his office with KELL, 36, divorced and generally 
      not as happy.  Kell is already at his desk working.

                                  CARTER
                    Hey, Kell.

                                  KELL
                    The boss was looking for ya.

                                  CARTER
                    It s not even 9am.

                                  KELL
                    This is a law firm, Carter.  You 
                    have to be here before you re 
                    supposed to be here and stay after 
                    you re supposed to be here.  Why do 
                    you think I m always here when you 
                    arrive and when you leave?

                                  CARTER
                    Because you have no life.

                                  KELL
                    Exactly.  Because I have no life.


      Carter enters his boss s office.  She s a partner in the 
      firm, 45, beautiful and ballsy.

                                  CARTER
                    You wanted to see me?

                                  BOSS
                    Yes.  Have a seat, Carter.
                          (as he does)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                  BOSS (CONT'D)
                    I m making a big announcement this 
                    morning, and I wanted to tell you 
                    about it first.

                                  CARTER
                    Why me?

                                  BOSS
                    Because you are directly affected.  
                    Carter, you re a terrific 
                      accountant.

                                  CARTER
                          (he s being promoted?)
                    Thank you.

                                  BOSS
                    And, as you know, our system for 
                    tracking billable hours is a bit 
                      antiquated.  We are probably the 
                    last firm of our size requiring 
                    lawyers to manually produce time 
                    sheets, which your department then 
                    has to manually compile in order to 
                    bill our clients.  It s a colossal 
                    waste of time, so we re finally 
                    moving into the future and getting 
                    an ATS...
                          (off Carter s blank stare)
                    Automated Timekeeping System.  It s 
                      a software program that will 
                    eliminate work for our lawyers, 
                    save our clients money, and save me 
                    from having to explain for the 
                    800th time why we bill for billing!

      She laughs, so Carter laughs politely, too.

                                  BOSS (CONT D)
                    Thus we won t need you to do the 
                    job you ve been doing.

                                  CARTER
                    Right.  So what will my new job be?

                                  BOSS
                    I don t know.  But I will certainly 
                    give you a glowing reference.

      A moment as Carter takes this in.  He s being fired?                                                                                    19.




      Carter, on his cell phone, is alone in the men s room.  He 
      stands with his back blocking the door.

                                  CARTER
                          (quietly)
                    Jordan?


      Jordan (Frannie and Annie s Jordan) is on his cell, putting 
      sugar in his coffee.  Lots of sugar.  

                                  JORDAN
                    Who is this?

                                  CARTER
                    Your brother.

                                  JORDAN
                    I can barely hear you.

                                  CARTER
                    I m in the men s room at work.

                                  JORDAN
                    Don t call me from the men s room!

                                  CARTER
                    It was this or a ledge somewhere.  
                    Jordan--
                          (this is hard to say)
                    I just got fired.  

                                  JORDAN
                    Shit happens.

                                  CARTER
                    Good thing I m not on a ledge.

                                  JORDAN
                    I m having a rough week, too.

                                  CARTER
                    Are you getting married in a month?  
                    Did you just move into an expensive 
                    apartment with someone, and now you 
                    have to tell her you lost your job?

                                  JORDAN
                    Did Liz -- when you first met -- 
                    lie and tell you she was a virgin?                                                                                    20.



                                  CARTER
                    No.
                          (confused)
                    Why?  Did Liz tell you she was a 
                    virgin?

                                  JORDAN
                    Forget it.

                                  CARTER
                    I don t understand.

                                  JORDAN
                    Of course you don t understand, 
                    because you don t have to date 
                    anymore.  And finding a job, even 
                    in this economy, is a hell of a lot 
                    easier than finding a woman who 
                    isn t a lying psychopath!

      Jordan hangs up.


                                  CARTER
                          (into his phone)
                    Hello?...  Jord?...

      Carter can t believe his brother just hung up on him.  Then a 
      TOILET FLUSHES.  Terrific!  He s not alone.  As he pretends 
      to be washing his hands, Kell emerges from a stall and starts 
      washing his hands, too.  It s awkward.

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                          (without looking up)
                    Did you hear--

                                  KELL
                    --that you re getting fired or that 
                    your fiancee is a virgin?

                                  CARTER
                    She s not a virgin.

                                  KELL
                    And you re still going to marry 
                    her?!
                          (a beat, sincere)
                    Sorry.  You really got fired?                                                                                    21.



                                  CARTER
                    Yep.  They re installing a new 
                    software system, and apparently my 
                    job was the first to go.

                                  KELL
                    Okay, that sucks.  But Liz will 
                      understand.  These things happen in 
                    the business world.  It doesn t 
                    make you any less of a man.  In 
                    fact, the test of a man s character 
                    is not how he handles success, but 
                    how he handles adversity. 

      A YOUNG LAWYER enters the bathroom and sees Kell.

                                  YOUNG LAWYER
                    Oh, Kell, the boss was looking for 
                    you.

      The young lawyer enters a stall as Kell realizes he s next.

                                  KELL
                          (covering his eyes, about 
                          to cry, very unmanly)
                    Oh, my God.  No.  Nooooo...


      As he enters, the MOANING GETS LOUDER.  It s coming from the 
      bedroom.

                                  LIZ (O.S.)
                    Yes.  Yesssss...

      His fiancee is a lying psychopath!  She s cheating on him 
      with another man while she thinks he s at work!  

      As he quietly approaches the bedroom, passing boxes they have 
      yet to unpack, her moaning gets LOUDER AND LOUDER until she 
      seems to reach a climax.  

                                  LIZ (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    OH, YEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!

      Carter steels himself, throws open the door and finds her...                                                                                    22.




      Alone!  Under the covers.  Exhausted.  Naked.  And now, 
        embarrassed.  There s a LOUD BUZZING.  She fumbles around, 
      finds the source and turns it off.

                                  LIZ
                          (not sure what to say)
                    Hi, honey.  
                          (a beat)
                    You re home early.  

                                  CARTER
                          (still getting over it)
                      I thought...  I thought you were 
                    with somebody.

                                  LIZ
                    How could you think that?  I would 
                    never--

                                  CARTER
                    I know, it was just... all the 
                    moaning.

                                  LIZ
                    So... you heard me?

                                  CARTER
                    I think all of Manhattan heard you.
                    Maybe some other boroughs, too.

                                  LIZ
                          (grimacing)
                    This is so embarrassing!!!  
                          (she sits up, pulling the 
                            covers up around her)
                    My friends -- at my bachelorette 
                    party in Atlantic City -- they gave 
                    me  the Cadillac of vibrators  as a 
                    joke.  But...

                                  CARTER
                          (playfully)
                    ...it s no joke?

                                  LIZ
                          (can t help but smile)
                    No, it s not.                                                                                    23.



                                  CARTER
                    How is it I m only getting a lame 
                    fishing trip for my bachelor party, 
                    and you got sex toys in Atlantic 
                    City?

      Liz shrugs, still smiling.  Carter sits on the bed.

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                    Maybe I should cancel that trip.

                                  LIZ
                    It s this weekend.  Why would you 
                    cancel it?

                                  CARTER
                    To save money.  

                                  LIZ
                    You re saving money by not having 
                      strippers.

                                  CARTER
                    Liz, I need to tell you something.

                                  LIZ
                    You promised no strippers. 

                                  CARTER
                    It s not about strippers.

                                  LIZ
                    I need to tell you something, too.

                                  CARTER
                    Okay, you first.

                                  LIZ
                          (a beat)
                    I think I just had my first orgasm.

      He doesn t even know how to process this.

                                  CARTER
                    Are you saying...  What are you 
                    saying?  You ve been faking all 
                    this time with me?  

                                  LIZ
                    No!  No!  But I now realize that 
                    what I thought was an orgasm all of 
                    my life -- not just with you, but 
                    with ALL OF THE GUYS before you--                                                                                    24.



                                  CARTER
                    Not helping.

                                  LIZ
                          (gently)
                    --might not have been an orgasm.  

      He's reeling.

                                  LIZ (CONT D)
                    This is a good thing, Carter.

                                  CARTER
                    It doesn t feel like a good thing.

                                  LIZ
                    No, see, now that I know what it's 
                    supposed to be like, I m sure we'll 
                    be able to get there as well.  It s 
                    like once you ve been to a house, 
                    you can find your way--

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah, uh huh, I get it.

                                  LIZ
                    It s not like I haven t been 
                    enjoying it with you.  It s... an A 
                    compared to an A+.  An A is still 
                    great...
                          (feeling badly)
                    Should I not have told you?

                                  CARTER
                    No.  We should be able to tell each 
                    other anything.  And you, of all 
                    people, deserve an A+.

                                  LIZ
                    You are the Cadillac of fiances.
                          (she kisses him)
                    So what was your news?

                                  CARTER
                    It s not important.

                                  LIZ
                    No, what did you want to tell me?

                                  CARTER
                    My boss called me into her office.
                          (he can t do it)
                    And said I m a terrific accountant.                                                                                    25.



                                  LIZ
                    That s great, honey!  Maybe they ll 
                    give you a raise.

      Off his weak nod...


      Carter and Kell are having a beer at a New York pub.

                                  CARTER
                    So I ve been replaced by a machine 
                    at work and in bed.

                                  KELL
                    At least it wasn t a guy.

                                  CARTER
                    A guy I could compete with.  How am 
                      I supposed to compete with  the 
                    Cadillac of vibrators?  

                                  KELL
                    You don t require batteries.

                                  CARTER
                    It s not battery operated.  It 
                    plugs in.

                                  KELL
                    Jesus.

                                  CARTER
                    Exactly.  It never gets tired.  It 
                    can go forever.

                                  KELL
                    You ve got trouble, man.

                                  CARTER
                    That s what I m saying!

                                  KELL
                    It s not that damn bunny, is it?  
                    My ex-wife had one of those, and I 
                    still say it s why she didn t cry 
                    when she left me. 

                                  CARTER
                    No, that I might have recognized.  
                    This just looks like a back 
                    massager.  That s the insidious 
                    part.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  CARTER (CONT'D)
                    It could be lying around, you might 
                    not even notice it, then boom!  She 
                    tells you it s better in bed than 
                    you are.

      A moment as they sip their beers and contemplate their very 
      tenuous position in the world.

                                  KELL
                    I blame her friends.  That s a gift 
                    for a woman who s getting dumped, 
                    not a woman who s getting married.

                                  CARTER
                    Says who?  Emily Post... coital?  

                                  KELL
                    Liz has you whenever she wants.  
                    She doesn t need... a device.  That 
                    should be the first thing to go 
                    when two people move in together, 
                    just like your porn has to go.

                                  CARTER
                    It does?

                                  KELL
                    Yes.  Then when you get divorced, 
                    you ve got no woman and no porn.  
                    And now... no job! 

      Kell raises his glass, then takes a long swig.   

                                  CARTER
                    At least now we can drink during 
                    the day.

                                  KELL
                    Yeah.  There s that.  

                                  CARTER
                    The thing is, I can t forbid her to 
                    use it.  I mean, I still plan to...

                                  KELL
                    ...Pat the Buchanan?

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah.  Right?  When you were 
                    married, you still--

                                  KELL
                    Sure.  More than ever -- which was 
                    maybe a bad sign.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  KELL (CONT'D)
                    And it could be challenging, 
                    knowing someone was just outside 
                    the door, waiting to use the blow 
                    dryer, or to fight about something.  
                    So sometimes I did it at work. 

                                  CARTER
                    That s why you logged so many 
                    hours!  Not in our office, I hope-- 

                                  KELL
                    No!  In the john.

                                  CARTER
                    So when I was on my cell yesterday--

                                  KELL
                    I only did it at work when I was 
                    married.  Now I can do it at home.  

                                  CARTER
                    Now you can do it all day.

                                  KELL
                    Another perk of unemployment.

      They both raise a glass to that, then...

                                  CARTER
                    I don t want her to leave me.

                                  KELL
                    She s not going to leave you. 

                                  CARTER
                    But I don t even have a job.

                                  KELL
                    I don t even have someone to lose 
                    over losing my job, so consider 
                    yourself lucky.

                                  CARTER
                    I do.  I am lucky.  
                            (determined)
                    In fact, you know what?  My job, 
                    while I don t have a job... is to 
                    become as good in bed as the 
                    Cadillac of vibrators.

                                  KELL
                    How are you gonna do that?                                                                                    28.

                    Business 101:  Know your 
                      competition.


    A LOW BUZZING.  We don t see the device, but we see Carter 
      and Kell looking at it (toward us), awed.

                                  KELL
                    No human can move that fast.

                                  SALESWOMAN
                    And that s the slow speed.  Check 
                    this out...

      As a SEXY TATTOOED SALESWOMAN changes the speed from low to 
      high, the BUZZING (and their worry) GETS MORE INTENSE.  

                                  SALESWOMAN (CONT D)
                    There s also an attachment called 
                    the  G  Whiz for dual action.  
                    Inside and out.

      The men gulp.

                                  KELL
                    You re killing us here.  You know 
                    that?  This place is making men 
                    obsolete.

                                  SALESWOMAN
                    These toys are modeled after men.  
                    All they do is simulate sex.

                                  CARTER
                    But we can t simulate these  toys  
                    unless we re being electrocuted.

      She laughs.

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                      Seriously.  How are we supposed to 
                    compete if they keep getting faster 
                    and more sophisticated? 

                                  SALESWOMAN
                    Get faster and more sophisticated.

      Carter takes this as a personal challenge.

                                  CARTER
                    I will.  You watch.                                                                                      29.



                                  SALESWOMAN
                    I don t need to watch.

                                  CARTER
                    I didn t mean... literally.

      She goes back to reading her tabloid, which, for those paying 
      attention, has Alyssa Milano and a hunky hockey player on the 
      cover, and the headline says,  Alyssa to Perling: Puck Off! 

                                  KELL
                          (to the saleswoman)
                    Is it fun working here?

                                  SALESWOMAN
                          (not interested)
                    I have a boyfriend.

                                  KELL
                    No, I m actually looking for a job.


      The BED IS SHAKING, and so is Liz.  She looks at the clock.  
      It s 8:15am.  

                                  LIZ
                    Honey...  Honey...

      Carter emerges from under the covers, looking like he just 
      ran a marathon.  He can barely move.

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah?

                                  LIZ
                      Everything you re doing feels 
                    amazing, and I am so close... 
                            (apologetic)
                    ...but I have to get to work.

                                  CARTER
                    But you didn t--

                                  LIZ
                    That s okay.

                                  CARTER
                    No, it s not.  What can I do? 

                                  LIZ
                    Well... want to take out the Caddy 
                    and drive this home?                                                                                    30.



      She smiles, but for Carter, that was a stake in the heart.

                                  CARTER
                    So I m what?  The fluffer?  

                                  LIZ
                          (lovingly)
                    It s not a competition.  I love 
                    you.  I m marrying you.  And sex... 
                    sex is whatever works. 
                          (looks at the clock, torn)
                    Shit.  I really have to get to the 
                    office.  

      She kisses him on the forehead and gets up.

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah.   
                          (covering)
                    Me, too.  


    A male HEADHUNTER looks over Carter s resume as Carter sits 
      up taller, trying to make a good impression.

                                  HEADHUNTER
                    Well, with this resume we should 
                    have no problem finding you a job.  
                    What are you looking for exactly? 

                                  CARTER
                          (his tongue is numb, like 
                            muscles after a workout)
                      Anythin... I m very ambi-thith.

                                  HEADHUNTER
                    Excuse me?

                                  CARTER
                      Ambit-thith.  I m kind of a 
                      perfecthinith...

                                  HEADHUNTER
                    Do you have a lisp?

                                  CARTER
                    No.  I think I thrained my thongue. 

      As the headhunter becomes less sure of Carter s prospects, 
      Carter picks up a glass of ice water and dips his tongue in.                                                                                    31.




      Liz is watching LENO on television, maybe we SEE the 
      monologue, maybe we just HEAR it.

                                  LENO
                    There s a growing number of virgins 
                    in Virginia.  Did you hear about 
                    this?  A woman there improved her 
                    sex life by pretending to be a 
                    virgin.  Apparently, men who think 
                    they re your first are better in 
                    bed. 

      AUDIENCE LAUGHTER from the television.  Liz laughs, too. 

                                  LENO (CONT D)
                    I don t get that.  If I thought I 
                    was somebody s first -- that she s 
                    got nothing to compare me to -- it 
                    wouldn t be better.  It d be over.  
                     That s right.  That s how long it 
                    takes.  Forty-four seconds.  

      Suddenly, Carter, who wasn t even listening because he was 
      intent on the task at hand, turns off Leno and put on a DVD.  

                                  LIZ
                    Hey, I was watching that.

                                  CARTER
                    I want to watch this. 

      CHEESY PORN MUSIC PLAYS.  Liz watches, a little shocked.

                                  LIZ
                    You want to watch porn?

                                  CARTER
                    It helps me get in the mood.  And 
                    like you said... whatever works.  

      He smiles, point made.  Liz gets what he s doing and nods.  

      Then she looks at the television.  As the CHEESY PORN MUSIC 
      gets more intense, and we hear MOANING from the television...

                                  LIZ
                    I guess I m okay with that.  

                                  CARTER
                    You are?                                                                                    32.



                                  LIZ
                    Yeah, why not?  
                          (a beat)
                    Should I get out the Caddy, too?

                                  CARTER
                          (giving up)
                    Yeah, why not?

      This wasn t what Carter imagined their sex life would be, but 
      still... it s kind of hot.  LET THE BUZZING BEGIN...


                                  LIZ
                    I LOVE YOU!!!

                                  CARTER
                    I LOST MY JOB!!!

      Liz and Carter, who are holding each other, out of breath, 
      spent, open their eyes.  

      Liz reaches down and STOPS THE BUZZING.  Carter reaches for 
      the remote and STOPS THE PORN.

                                  LIZ
                    What did you say?

                                  CARTER
                    I love you, too?

      Liz is starting to understand what s going on now.

                                  LIZ
                          (gently)
                    You lost your job today?

                                  CARTER
                    I lost my job Monday.  

                                  LIZ
                    Why didn t you say something?

                                  CARTER
                    I tried, but you... and...  I m 
                    supposed to support you!                                                                                    33.



                                  LIZ
                    I don t need you to support me.

                                  CARTER
                    But I m the guy.  I m about to be 
                    the husband.

                                  LIZ
                    And I m about to be the wife.  
                    Which means, as far as I can tell, 
                    that I will have faith in you, and 
                    stand by you, and remind you, in 
                    times like this -- you were top of 
                    your class, Carter!  You ll find 
                    another job!  

                                  CARTER
                    Well, I have a temp job. 

                                  LIZ
                    See?  What is it?

                                  CARTER
                    To be better in bed than that damn 
                    Cadillac.

      She laughs, and finally, so does he.

                                  LIZ
                    Okay, I don t want to discourage 
                    that quest, but I have to admit 
                      something...
                          (giddy)
                    You just were!  That was fantastic!  
                    You can't have a simultaneous 
                    orgasm with a vibrator no matter 
                    how good it is!  And by the way, 
                    I ve never had a simultaneous one, 
                    never even thought I had one, with 
                    ANY OF THE OTHER GUYS I EVER --  

      He cuts her off with a kiss.  And as they continue to kiss, 
      cheesy PORN MUSIC comes up, but this time it's THEIR 
      soundtrack...


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    34.


                                      ACT THREE

      As our THEME MUSIC plays, we again see the three tattoos 
      which represent tonight s three stories: the CHERRY with the 
      words  first time,  the BRIEFCASE with the words  first to *
      go,  and the STAR with the words  first on the list ... *

      CLOSE ON the star tattoo that says  first on the list  which 
      becomes...


      ...a STAR TATTOO on the shoulder of COLLEEN ROUSCH, 30ish, 
      hip, cool, about to drop off her husband, JUDD ROUSCH, 32, a 
      slightly chubby Venice Beach tattoo artist, and his good 
      friend, BOWMAN, single and used to being their third wheel. 

      They are moving slowly in AIRPORT TRAFFIC, trying to get to 
      the airline s passenger drop-off point.   

                                    COLLEEN
                    So, Judd, about this bachelor 
                    party...  Do we need to establish 
                    some ground rules?

                                  JUDD
                    I told you, it s a lame fishing 
                    trip.

                                    COLLEEN
                    I thought maybe that was code for 
                    drunken debauchery with strippers 
                    shooting strawberries out of their 
                    hoo-hahs.

                                  JUDD
                    No, sadly, it s code for lame 
                    fishing trip.  

                                  BOWMAN
                    Since when do we fly cross-country 
                    for a G-rated bachelor party?

                                  JUDD
                    Since the groom lost his job and *
                    needs some cheering up. *

                                    BOWMAN*
                    I bet strippers would cheer him up.*

                                  JUDD
                      Apparently Liz told Carter if he *
                    had strippers, the wedding was off.                                                                                    35.



                                  BOWMAN
                    See?  That?  There?  
                          (to Judd)
                    That s why you re giving me a 
                     better dead than wed  tattoo, 
                    right here on my ring finger.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Hell, yeah!  Then you can see 
                    strippers shooting strawberries out 
                    of their hoo-hahs anytime you like.

                                  BOWMAN
                    What s with you and the 
                      strawberries, Colleen?

                                    COLLEEN
                    It s just... the kind of thing I ve 
                    heard happens.

                                  BOWMAN
                          (pretends it s ridiculous, 
                            then to Judd:)
                    Why would you tell her that?

                                  JUDD
                    I found it disturbing.  I needed to 
                    share. 
                          (suddenly)
                    Ohmygod!  Stop!

                                    COLLEEN
                          (stepping on the brakes)
                    What? 

                                  JUDD
                    Pull over!   

                                    COLLEEN
                    This is first class only.

                                  JUDD
                    Look.  Who s.  Here.

      They follow his gaze.  Up ahead, getting her bags from the 
      DRIVER of a black town car is ALYSSA MILANO.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Hey, it s your girlfriend!

                                  BOWMAN
                    Who are we looking at?  I m lost.                                                                                    36.



                                  JUDD

                                  JUDD
                    And... my Celebrity Exemption List.

                                  BOWMAN
                    Is that a reality show?  I m lost 
                    again.

                                    COLLEEN
                    It s a married thing.  You know, 
                    the list of five or so famous 
                    people you get to sleep with if you 
                    ever get the chance? 

                                  JUDD
                    And it doesn t count as cheating.  
                    It s exempt.  
                          (to Colleen)
                    It s exempt!

                                    COLLEEN
                          (completely supportive)
                    I know, honey.

                                  JUDD
                    So pull over already!

                    I m just waiting for this guy to 
                    pull out.

      Judd looks impatiently at the car in their way.

                                  BOWMAN
                          (to Colleen)
                    Who s on your list?

                                    COLLEEN
                    Well, first, of course: Johnny 
                    Depp.  Then Javier Bardem, Denzel--

                                  JUDD
                          (to Bowman and Colleen)
                    I should go talk to her, right?  
                    But I can t just...  I mean...  
                    What...  How...  What do I say?                                                                                    37.



                                  BOWMAN
                    How about  goodbye ?  
                          (pointing)
                    She just went inside.

                                  JUDD
                          (turning to look)
                    What?  No!  Should I follow her?!

                                    COLLEEN
                    Yes!  Run after her!  Go!  GO!!!

      Judd just looks at Colleen.

                                  JUDD
                    You don t think I can make it 
                    happen, do you?

                                    COLLEEN
                    Not really.  No. 

                                  JUDD
                    Me neither.  Shit. 

                                    COLLEEN
                    But you could talk to her at least.  
                    Tell her what a big fan you are.

                                  JUDD
                    It s not the celebrity conversation 
                    list.  It s the celebrity exemption 
                    list.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Hey, I was game.  

                                  JUDD
                    I know.  I appreciate that.

      As Colleen pats Judd on the shoulder, consoling him...


      Bowman follows Judd through the first class cabin.

                                  BOWMAN
                    The whole point of a fishing trip *
                    is the boat and the beer.  If we re *
                    fly fishing we don t have a boat, *
                    and where do we keep the b--*

      Judd stops so abruptly that Bowman bumps into him.                                                                                    38.



                                  BOWMAN (CONT D)
                    Why d you--

      Bowman sees what Judd sees: Alyssa Milano in a window seat 
      reading a tabloid!  (She s reading about  Virginia s Un-
      Virgin  and there s a bad photo of Frannie.)  Alyssa doesn t 
      notice Judd staring at her, but a male FLIGHT ATTENDANT does.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Sir?  Could you keep moving, 
                    please?  We need to get everyone 
                    into their seats.

                                  JUDD
                    Yeah.  Sure.  Sorry.  

      Judd and Bowman continue on to coach.  Judd s mind is racing.  

                                  JUDD (CONT D)
                    Houston, we have contact!

                                  BOWMAN
                    You have yet to make eye-contact.

                                  JUDD
                    And it s an overnight flight!


                                  JUDD
                    I admit there are a few challenges.

                                  BOWMAN
                    You think?

      As they load their things into the overhead compartment...

                                  JUDD
                    There s the class difference.

                                  BOWMAN
                    First class/coach or 
                      celebrity/nobody?

      Judd gives Bowman a look.  Bowman is enjoying this.

                                  JUDD
                    And she s got a boyfriend.  Some 
                    hockey player...  Perling?  

                                  BOWMAN
                    New York Rangers Perling?                                                                                    39.



                                  JUDD
                    Yeah.

                                  BOWMAN
                    He sucks lately.  All he does is 
                    start fights.  Last week he put a 
                    guy in the hospital. 

                                  JUDD
                    So there s that. 

                                  BOWMAN
                    You know what?  If you end up 
                    beaten to a pulp by a hockey stick, 
                    you did better with her than 
                    anybody expected.

                                  JUDD
                    Would it kill you to be a little 
                    more positive?

                                  BOWMAN
                    I m so positive I m gonna take the 
                    middle seat so you can get in and 
                    out for hot sex with Alyssa Milano.

                                  JUDD
                    That s what I m talkin  about.

      They take their seats.  Judd on the aisle, Bowman in the 
      middle.  The seat by the window is empty for now. 

                                  BOWMAN
                      Seriously, let s say you do this 
                    thing.  You seduce Alyssa Milano 
                    between L.A. and New York.

                                  JUDD
                          (imagining it)
                    Uh huh.  Yeah?

                                  BOWMAN
                    Do you really think Colleen would 
                    be okay with that?

                                  JUDD
                    That s the beauty of the list.  
                    It s sanctioned.

                                  BOWMAN
                    But, and correct me if I m wrong, 
                    isn t the whole premise of the list 
                    that it s never gonna happen?                                                                                    40.



                                  JUDD
                    Probably never gonna happen, unless 
                    all the stars align and you end up 
                    on a flight with the first and only 
                    celebrity on your friggin  list!

                                  BOWMAN
                    I thought you got five people.

                                  JUDD
                    I didn t want five.  Only her.  
                    Whereas Colleen has three to five 
                    guys on her list at any one time, 
                    and they re constantly changing.  I 
                    can barely keep track of who she s 
                    allowed to cheat on me with.

                                  BOWMAN
                    The slut.

                                  JUDD
                    Look, I know it s a long shot.  But 
                    I have to try.  I owe it to a fat 
                    kid from Philly who had a poster of 
                    Alyssa Milano in his room.

                                  BOWMAN
                    You had me at fat kid.

                                  JUDD
                    So how do I do this from coach?  

                                  BOWMAN
                    Send her a drink?

                                  JUDD
                    Drinks are free in first class.  

                                  BOWMAN
                    It s still a nice gesture.

                                  JUDD
                    Unless she s sober.  

                                  BOWMAN
                    If she s sober, you ve got bigger 
                    problems than offending her. 

                                  JUDD
                    So you re saying she d have to be 
                    drunk to sleep with me.                                                                                    41.



                                  BOWMAN
                    It would not hurt.

                                  JUDD
                    And this is you being positive?

                                  BOWMAN
                    Look, you re out of the loop.  I m 
                    still out there, and women, even 
                      non-celebrities, need at least two 
                    drinks to sleep with you.  
                          (a beat)
                    Or is that just me?

                                  JUDD
                    Let s stay focused.

                                  BOWMAN
                    Good idea.

      A moment as they think some more.  Bowman pulls out the duty-
      free catalog, holds it up and smiles as if this is brilliant. 

                                  JUDD
                    What do I do with that?  Send her a 
                    watch?

                                  BOWMAN
                    Or some other kind of crap.
                          (flipping through)
                    Reading glasses?  This butterfly 
                    pendant is nice.  Swarovski 
                    crystals.

                                  JUDD
                    You don t give Alyssa Milano a $29 
                    necklace.  

                                  BOWMAN
                    What have you come up with?

                                  JUDD
                          (a beat)
                    Well, I know she likes tattoos.  
                    I m a tattoo artist.  Maybe I 
                    sketch something for her? 

                                  BOWMAN
                    I love it.  I would sleep with you.  

                                  JUDD
                    You re definitely not on my list.                                                                                    42.



      Judd pulls out a pen and looks for something to write on, 
      decides on the barf bag.

                                  BOWMAN
                    You re gonna draw it on a barf bag?

                                  JUDD
                    I ve got nothing else to sketch on.

                                  BOWMAN
                    In that case, let s revisit the 
                    pendant.

                                  JUDD
                    No, this ll work.  Just don t talk 
                    to me for a while.  I need quiet.  
                    I need to get into  the zone. 

      A Latina woman, ROSA, holding a CRYING BABY BOY, appears at 
      the end of their row.

                                  ROSA
                    Excuse me.  
                          (points to window seat)
                    I have that seat.

      Bowman and Judd stand to let her in.  As the baby CRIES...

                                  JUDD
                    That s not gonna help.

                                  BOWMAN
                    It most certainly is not.


      The baby is STILL CRYING.  Bowman turns to Judd.

                                  BOWMAN
                    Not getting married.  Not having 
                    children.

      Judd hasn t sketched much, although you can see from his 
      drawings that he s good.  (He s the artist from the opening.)  

                                  JUDD
                    He can t cry the whole time. 

                                  BOWMAN
                    No, my friend.  He can and he will.

      Rosa senses their annoyance.                                                                                    43.



                                  ROSA
                    I m so sorry.  He just wants his 
                    mother.

                                  BOWMAN
                    You re not his mother?

                                  ROSA
                    I m his nanny.  His mother is in 
                    first class.  She wanted to sleep.

                                  BOWMAN
                    So the rest of us must suffer?  

      There s a BUMP of turbulence.  Judd s drink spills on his 
      sketches.  He puts the barf bag back in the seat pocket.

                                  JUDD
                    Forget it.  I give up.  

                                  BOWMAN
                    You do not.
                          (to Rosa)
                    Let s try  Itsy Bitsy Spider  
                    again.  He liked that the first 
                    couple... hundred... times.

                                  JUDD
                    Nope.  The dream is dead.  I can t 
                    even get into first class to use 
                    the john, so this whole plan--

      Just then a wealthy-looking woman in her late 30s, KINDRA, 
      arrives.  She has her sleep mask on her forehead.

                                  KINDRA
                    Rosa, I ve been waiting for them to 
                    turn off the fasten seat belt sign, 
                    but with this turbulence--
                          (to the baby)
                    Hi, sweetie.  Mommy s here. 
                          (to Bowman and Judd)
                    He hasn t stopped, has he?

                                  BOWMAN
                          (joking with her)
                    What did you say?  I ve lost my 
                    hearing?

      The COACH FLIGHT ATTENDANT passes through.

                                  COACH FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    M am, you need to take your seat.                                                                                    44.



                                  KINDRA
                    I will.  I am.  I just... 
                          (to Bowman)
                    Would you like to trade seats?

                                  JUDD
                    You re giving up your first-class 
                    seat?

                                  KINDRA
                    The thing is...
                            (whispering)
                    I m sitting next to Alyssa Milano, 
                    and she kept saying,  Why doesn t 
                    that poor baby s mother do 
                      something, and I kept saying,  I 
                    know!   And then I finally admitted 
                    it might be my baby, so now I can t 
                    face her.  I definitely can t 
                    subject her to his wrath.

      A moment as the men absorb this.  Judd looks at Bowman.

                                  BOWMAN
                    How good a friend am I?

                                  JUDD
                    I don t know.  I m waiting to see.

                                  BOWMAN
                          (to Kindra)
                    He ll take your seat.  

                                  JUDD
                          (to Kindra and Bowman)
                    And I will owe you both for the 
                    rest of my life.

      As Judd gathers his things...

                                  BOWMAN
                    Don t forget the barf bag!

                                  KINDRA
                          (looking concerned)
                    Please don t throw up on Alyssa 
                    Milano.  

                                  JUDD
                    No, no.  I have some sketches...

      As Bowman and Judd stand together, letting Kindra into the 
      row, Judd whispers to Bowman...                                                                                    45.



                                  JUDD (CONT D)
                    Do I take off my wedding ring?

                                  BOWMAN
                    I don t know.  Do you?

                                  JUDD
                    No.  Then it feels like cheating, 
                    and it s not cheating.  It s 
                    exempt.

      Judd takes a deep breath and walks off, a man on a mission.


      As Judd goes to his new seat, the male flight attendant tries 
      to intercept him, but Judd will not be deterred.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Sir, the  fasten seat belt  sign is 
                    still illuminated.  And that s 
                      definitely not your seat.

                                  JUDD
                    The woman who was here traded with 
                    me.  
                          (partially to Alyssa)
                    I ve been sitting with her baby.  

                                  ALYSSA
                    It was her baby!  Oh, my God.  I 
                    was so rude about that baby.  
                          (to the flight attendant)
                    Please tell her she can come back 
                    and bring her baby if she wants. 

                                  JUDD
                    No, she doesn t want.  I mean, her 
                    nanny s back there, so...
                          (to the flight attendant)
                    You can ask her yourself.  21C.

      The flight attendant reluctantly leaves them alone.  An 
      awkward moment.  Judd forces himself to forge on.

                                  JUDD (CONT D)
                    I m Judd.  Judd Rousch.

                                  ALYSSA
                    Alyssa.

                                  JUDD
                    Yeah.  I...  I know.                                                                                    46.



                                  ALYSSA
                    So that baby s been crying for, 
                    like...

                                  JUDD
                    Two hours and twenty-four minutes.

                                  ALYSSA
                          (laughs, then)
                    I feel like crying like that on 
                    planes.  I hate turbulence.  My 
                    boyfriend used to have to hold my--
                          (as they hit a BUMP)
                    --hand!  And, of course, the second 
                    I break up with the guy, I m on the 
                    flight from hell.   

                                  JUDD
                    Oh.  So you...  You just broke up?

                                  ALYSSA
                          (playfully)
                    Don t you read the tabloids?  I m 
                    kidding.  I m so glad you don t.

                                  JUDD
                    That must be weird when your 
                      heartbreak is news.

                                  ALYSSA
                    Well, he s a hockey player, and now 
                    his game s gone to shit and 
                      apparently it s my fault.  Even 
                    though he s the one who cheated.  
                    Anyhow, I m so done with ath--
                          (as they hit another BUMP)
                    --letes!  Aaaaah...  You re not an 
                    athlete, are you?

                                  JUDD
                    No, but thanks for pretending that 
                    was a possibility.  I m a tattoo 
                    artist.

                                  ALYSSA
                    I love tattoos.  That s so cool.

                                  JUDD
                          (pointing to her wrist)
                    That s a nice one, the sanskrit.

      She nods, and he notices her death grip on the arm rest 
      because of the turbulence...                                                                                    47.



                                  JUDD (CONT D)
                    You can hold my hand... if it would 
                    help.  Or not.   

      She looks at him.  He seems harmless and sweet.

                                  ALYSSA
                          (re: his ring)
                    And you re married, right?

                                  JUDD
                    Yeah.

                                  ALYSSA
                    Maybe just until they turn off the 
                    fasten seat belt sign.

      She takes his hand.  He s amazed, throws a look back to 
      Bowman, who is on the aisle and can kind of see him...

                                  ALYSSA (CONT D)
                    Although every married guy I know 
                    cheats.  Have you ever cheated?

                                  JUDD
                    No, not yet.  Not ever, I mean!  
                    And I ve been married four years.

                                  ALYSSA
                    So what s the secret?  How do you 
                    stay faithful?

                                  JUDD
                    Well, I love my wife.  She s really 
                    cool.  We trust each other.  And 
                    also...   
                          (getting up his nerve)
                    We have this list.  Of people we re 
                    allowed to cheat with if we ever 
                    get the chance, but we ll never get 
                    the chance because they have to be 
                    like... celebrities.  
                          (trying to avoid admitting 
                            she s his)
                    But anyhow, it makes monogamy seem 
                    more do-able.  But that wouldn t 
                    work for you, because you are a 
                      celebrity, so you can sleep with 
                    whoever you want.

                                  ALYSSA
                    Oh, yeah.  Just the other night I 
                    rang up George Clooney.                                                                                    48.



      Judd laughs.

                                  ALYSSA (CONT D)
                    So who s first on your list?  
                    Angelina?

                                  JUDD
                    I d rather not say.   

                                  ALYSSA
                    I let you hold my hand!  Keira 
                      Knightley?  Penelope Cruz?  C mon!

                                  JUDD
                    You.  Are.

                                  ALYSSA
                    What?
                          (completely surprised)
                    No.  Really?     
                          (off his nod)
                    I m not first on anybody s list 
                    anymore. 

      He shrugs.  Then he feels like he s made her uncomfortable.

                                  JUDD
                    It s more like fantasy football.  
                    You know there will never be a 
                    game, it s just fun to think about.  
                    Not that I m thinking about it now.  
                    Do you want me to get the lady with 
                    the baby back, because, I mean, I 
                    know I m not first on your list--

                                  ALYSSA
                    Well, I don t have a list. 

                                  JUDD
                    Because you don t need a list.    

      Judd feels like a total idiot, which Alyssa finds endearing.

                                  ALYSSA
                    I have a to-do list though.

                                  JUDD
                    Right.  So that s--

                                  ALYSSA
                            (whispering)
                    As in, places I d like  to do  it.                                                                                    49.



                                  JUDD
                    Wait, what?

                                  ALYSSA
                    And guess what s first on my  to-
                    do  list?

                                  JUDD
                      I don t...  I don t know.  

                                  ALYSSA
                          (a beat... she leans in)
                    On an airplane.

      Judd can barely speak.

                                  JUDD
                    I think I left something on my... 
                    in my... back at my seat.


      The mother and baby are sleeping against Bowman, the family 
      he vowed not to have.  His eyes are closed, too, but Judd is 
      whispering something, trying to wake him.  His eyes open:

                                  BOWMAN
                    You need a condom?!

                                  JUDD
                    Shhhhhh!

                                  BOWMAN
                    Are you kidding me?

                                  JUDD
                    She said she always wanted to do it 
                    on an airplane!

                                  BOWMAN
                    I knew I should have taken that 
                    seat!

      Bowman pulls a condom out of his wallet.

                                  JUDD
                    What do I do?  

                                  BOWMAN
                    Unwrap it and put it on your--                                                                                    50.



                                  JUDD
                    No!  I mean, what if Colleen 
                    doesn t understand?

                                  BOWMAN
                    She said she was game.  And worse 
                    comes to worst, the fat kid from 
                    Philly finally got his shot at 
                    Alyssa Milano, and I finally get a 
                    shot at Colleen.

      Before Judd can digest this, they are interrupted:

                                  IN-FLIGHT ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    The Captain has turned off the 
                     fasten seat belt  sign.  You are 
                    now free to move about the cabin.

                                  BOWMAN
                    Go move about the cabin, baby!

      As Judd looks back to first class, excited and worried...


      Judd closes the door behind him.  He and Alyssa are now 
      smashed up against each other, still fully clothed.

                                  JUDD
                    Wow.

                                  ALYSSA
                    Kind of tight in here, huh?

                                  JUDD
                    I should have worked out more... 
                    than once... last year.

                                  ALYSSA
                          (laughing)
                    How do people do this?

                                  JUDD
                    I have no idea.  

                                  ALYSSA
                    Maybe if I sit up on the...  

      As she climbs up on the sink, she knocks the condom out of 
      his hand and it drops on the floor...  

                                  JUDD
                    I just dropped the condom.                                                                                    51.



                                  ALYSSA
                    Can you reach it?

                                  JUDD
                    With my foot maybe...

      As he tries, the  return to your seat  button DINGS and 
      LIGHTS up.

                                  IN-FLIGHT ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, we are 
                    crossing another turbulence zone.  
                    Please return to your seats and 
                    keep you seat belts fastened.

      Alyssa looks nervously at Judd.

                                  JUDD
                    Should we return to our seats?

                                  ALYSSA
                    Is that okay?

                                  JUDD
                    I m pretty sure never having sex 
                    with the first and only person on 
                    my list beats bad sex with the 
                    first and only person on my list.  

                                  ALYSSA
                    So I m  the only?  

      Judd shrugs shyly.  She thinks about this.

                                  ALYSSA (CONT D)
                    What the hell?  A quickie?

                                  JUDD
                    Yeah...  No!  Argh!  I think... I 
                    don t want to cheat on my wife.  
                    Even if it's not cheating.

                                  ALYSSA
                          (nods, then)
                    Is it okay if I lie and say we did?

                                  JUDD
                    Sure.                                                                                    52.



                                  ALYSSA
                    And maybe take a few cell phone 
                    pictures of you naked so I could 
                    leak them to the press and get my 
                    ex really jealous?
                          (off his look)
                    Too far?  Okay.


      Bowman exits the plane just as Alyssa is kissing Judd on the 
      cheek.  She has the barf bag with the sketches on it. 

                                  ALYSSA
                    I m gonna have you do this tattoo!

                                  JUDD
                      Absolutely.

      She smiles and walks off.  Judd grins at Bowman.

                                  JUDD (CONT D)
                    Did you see that?  Huh?

                                  BOWMAN
                    You know what I saw?  A man who was 
                    in the bathroom with Alyssa Milano 
                    for 57 seconds.  I timed it. 

                                  JUDD
                    More importantly:  I finally get a 
                    shot at Colleen?   What was that?  
                    Have you been secretly lusting 
                    after my wife all these years?  Is 
                    that why you re always around?

                                  BOWMAN
                          (smiles)
                    What can I say?  She s first on my 
                    list.  She s cool.

      Judd can t help but take this as a compliment.  He smiles and 
      dials his cell phone.

                                  JUDD
                    She is cool.  She s very cool.  And 
                    wait until she s hears what 
                    happened to her cool husband. 
                          (into the phone)
                    Colleen?  Were you asleep?...  
                    You re still at Jace s party?!  
                    Listen, guess who I just sat next 
                    to on the plane to New York?... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                  JUDD (CONT'D)
                          (smiling at Bowman)
                    Yes!...  She was in first class, 
                    and so was I, because this woman 
                    traded seats with me so she could 
                    be with her baby...  Colleen, the 
                    baby isn t important.  The 
                    important thing is, believe it or 
                    not, I had the opportunity, and I 
                    did nothing.  Well, I held her 
                    hand, but when I had the chance to 
                    join the Mile High Club, I 
                      refrained, because I love you... 
                          (still smiling)
                    What do you mean, that s too bad...
                          (not smiling)
                    Johnny Depp was not at the party...
                          (playing along)
                    Oh, really.  In the cabana.

                                  BOWMAN
                    She s joking, right?

                                  JUDD
                    Of course she s joking.  You re 
                    joking, right?...  Colleen...

      As he dials again, slightly concerned, and our THEME MUSIC 
      comes up...


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    54.

      As FINAL MUSIC plays -- a great, upbeat song that reflects 
      the episode s theme (like  You re My First, My Last, My 
      Everything  by Barry White,  Falling for the First Time  by 
      Barenaked Ladies, or  Feels like the First Time  by 
      Foreigner) we get one last quick coda from one of the three 
      stories:


      Frannie, in dark glasses and a baseball cap, is looking at 
      the tabloid story as Annie tries to help.

                                    FRANNIE
                    It wasn't enough he talked about it 
                    on the radio? He had to out me in 
                    the tabloids?

                                  ANNIE
                    It ll blow over.

                                    FRANNIE
                    And what do they do?  Look for the 
                    worst picture they can find?

                                  ANNIE
                    You look great.  You look thin.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    I look deranged.  How did they even *
                    get this picture?  *
                          (looking more closely)*
                    And whose... is that your arm 
                    around me?

      Annie looks more closely at the picture, then shrugs and sips 
      her soda. Frannie just looks at her. Annie finally smiles 
      (yes, she outed Frannie in the tabloids!) and says: *

                                  ANNIE
                    Payback s a bitch...

      As Frannie takes this in, impressed and appalled...
