SUPER:
AUTUMN, 1987
A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to
London.
JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom
Selleck mustache,
the hopeful look of youth in his
eyes... sitting next to...
KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
rubbing the tears from
her swollen red eyes...
KATE
I got you a few necessities...
Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonneguts Cats
Cradle.
KATE
(CONTD)
Your copy was a mess...
Jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes
off Kate.
She hands him a cassette.
KATE (CONTD)
Every one of these songs will
remind you of me in a slightly
different way...
JACK
All in one tape?
KATE
I also put side two of London
Calling on there...
Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the
lips.
KATE
(CONTD)
That was not officially the
goodbye kiss. It was just an
interim kiss...
He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her
close, kissing her deeply. Then...
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
This will be the final boarding
call for Pan Am flight 4 to
London, Heathrow.
Jack takes Kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to
the gate.
KATE
You have your ticket?
Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.
Kate
nods. They embrace and kiss again.
As they separate.
JACK
Im not even gonna say it,
Kate. Maybe itll be like
I never left...
Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the
gate.
Kate stands there, watching him go.
Then...
...a
moment of intuition. Something isnt right. She
looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway,
trying to decide...
KATE
Wait.
Jack turns. Kate approaches him.
KATE (CONTD)
I have a bad feeling about
this.
JACK
About the plane? What do you
think its gonna crash? Dont
say that...
KATE
(shaking her head)
I know weve talked about this a
thousand times and we both agree
that going to London is the
right thing to do. But in my
heart... this feels wrong.
She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding,
then back into Jacks eyes.
KATE (CONTD)
Dont
go, Jack...
JACK
You mean dont go at all?
What about my internship?
KATE
Believe me I know what an
incredible opportunity this
is for you...
JACK
For us, Kate.
KATE
Right, for us. But...Im
afraid that if you get on
that plane...
JACK
What?
Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant
say...
KATE
(torn)
Go. Im sorry, you should just
go...
JACK
(thinking, then...)
No, youre right.
What are we
doing?
KATE
We're being responsible.
Go.
Get on the plane.
His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...
KATE (CONT'D)
(a smile)
Get the hell outta my sight.
You bother me.
A laugh from Jack.
Kate gives him a calm smile and a
nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
Jack.
JACK
(resolute)
Okay, I'm going...
He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
tight.
Jack looks toward the gate, the line
disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.
KATE
I can't seem to let go of
you...
JACK
You hear me complaining about
that?
A sober look in Jack's eyes.
JACK (CONT'D)
Look, we're at the airport and
no one ever thinks clearly at
the airport so we should just
trust the decision we already
made.
You've been accepted to
one of the best law schools in
the country, I've got this
internship at Barclay's Bank.
We have a great plan, honey...
Kate nods, then, with resolve...
KATE
You want to do something
great, Jack?
Let's flush the
plan...start our lives right
now, today...I don't know what
that life's gonna look like
but I do know it has both of
us in it.
And I choose us...
Jack is jolted by her words.
KATE (CONT'D)
The plan doesn't make us
great, Jack.
What we have
together, that's what makes us
great.
Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
looks toward the gate, only one person left in
line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.
Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...
JACK
I love you, Kate...
...a smile from Kate...relief...then...
JACK (CONT'D)
(taking her face in
his hands)
...and a year in London's not
gonna change that.
A hundred
years couldn't change that...
Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
look back.
Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
the gate door closes behind him.
She waits, almost
willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
doesn't...
DISSOLVE TO:
A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
behind it...
The place looks like a museum display...everything is
of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.
A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.
And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...
...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.
Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.
Jack
shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
where he sees...
A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
turns to him...
PAULA.
Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
mouth...
PAULA
(holding up toothbrush)
I hope you don't mind.
There
were like ten new ones in the
cabinet.
A playful smile from Paula.
JACK
It's not what you think.
I
took Mentadent public...
Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
black dress hanging neatly over it.
PAULA
Did you really mean what you
said about Tuscany?
JACK
Of course I did.
PAULA
Last night was great...
JACK
You are an amazing lover.
You
should be giving motivational
seminars.
PAULA
Thanks.
You're not bad
yourself...
Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
stand, puts it on his wrist.
He looks at Paula as she
slips the dress on.
JACK
I want to see you again.
PAULA
I'd like that, too.
JACK
Tonight.
She turns to him.
PAULA
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
JACK
So we'll get egg nog.
Paula laughs.
PAULA
(putting on her shoes)
I have to go to my parents'
house out in Jersey.
Would
you like to come?
JACK
Jersey?
You know what the
traffic's gonna be like?
PAULA
I'm taking the train...
Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
dangling on his chest.
PAULA (CONT'D)
Don't you have anywhere to go?
JACK
I've got plenty of places to
go.
He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
answer...
PAULA
(a sexy laugh, then...)
Maybe I can try and sneak away
some time tomorrow morning...
(kissing him on
the lips)
Okay?
JACK
(coy)
If it's something you feel
strongly about.
Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.
PAULA
It was nice meeting you, Jack...
CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES
Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the
living room.
He puts a disk into the piano and...
...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.
Jack
hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is
enveloped in music...
Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC
emanating from Jacks apartment...an intrigued glance
back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...
Backs Passion According to St. Matthew is blaring
through the speakers, the music is swelling to full
orchestra...
Jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher
Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...
...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna
suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored
shirts everywhere.
Jacks still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in
front of a mirror.
Jack, wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and
carrying a leather briefcase, a Master of the
Universe smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece
from memory...
The doors open at 6.
Jack self-consciously stops
singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink
coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.
JACK
(a charming smile)
Mrs. Peterson.
MRS. PETERSON
Hello Jack.
You dont
have to stop singing on
my account...
JACK
Its because Im shy,
Betty.
So, when are you
going to leave that old
corpse Mr. Peterson and
run away with me?
MRS. PETERSON
You know you could never
satisfy me the way he
does...
The doors open to the lobby.
Mrs. Peterson walks out
ahead.
TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs.
Peterson...
TONY THE DOORMAN
Merry Christmas, Mr.
Campbell.
JACK
Howd you do this year,
Tony?
TONY THE DOORMAN
About four grand.
And a
bottle of twenty five
year old scotch from Mrs.
Johnson in 9D.
Im
putting it all in
commercial paper like you
said.
JACK
Just until the Deutsche
Mark turns...
Jack exits the building...
9
OMITTED
...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a
smile on his way to the elevators...
CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN
DISSOLVE TO:
The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
this beautiful conference room.
SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
with coffee cups and lunch waste.
At the end of the
table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
of him.
Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
the table.
Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...
JACK
...if MedTech's shares sink
any lower than...
(casually executing
a keystroke)
...forty three, we're in
trouble with the stock
valuation.
So for god's sake
watch what you say to your
institutional customers...
Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.
JACK (CONT'D)
...we still have almost a full
day of trading before zero
hour and I don't want any
trouble...
(distracted by Mintz)
...penny for your thoughts,
Alan...
Alan looks up.
ALAN
Sorry, Jack.
I told Dee and
the kids I'd be home by
dinner.
You know, it being
Christmas Eve and all.
JACK
Is that tonight?
A LAUGH from the group.
Jack approaches Alan.
JACK (CONT'D)
You think I like being here on
Christmas Eve, Alan?
ALAN
I don't know.
Maybe...
Another LAUGH.
Even Jack lets out a good-natured
chuckle.
JACK
Okay, maybe I do have a touch
of tunnel vision this holiday
season.
But in two days we're
going to announce one of the
largest mergers in U.S.
corporate history.
Thirty
billion dollars...
(basking in the glory)
When this kind of deal turns
up you get on and you ride it
`till it's over.
You don't
ask it for a vacation...
A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
energize Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
(to the group)
December 26th.
After that
there'll be so much money
floating around here it'll be
like Christmas every day...
(smiling)
December 26th, people.
If
you'd like to celebrate that
day, you all have my
blessing...
Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
around the table...
ALAN
You're right, Jack.
Sorry...
Jack approaches Alan.
JACK
I don't want you to be sorry,
Alan, I want you to be
excited.
I want my gift to be
the first one you open this
year.
You know why?
ALAN
Why Jack?
JACK
Because my gift comes with ten
zeroes at the end...
A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
smile.
Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.
JACK (CONT'D)
Good man...
The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
messages.
Jack is the last one out.
He's met in stride by
ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
messages.
ADELLE
Only eight thirty?
What's the
matter, had some last minute
shopping to do?
Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
hands him his messages.
JACK
You too?
This holiday's about
giving, Adelle.
And I'm
giving everything I've got to
this deal, so in a way, I'm
more Christmassy than
anyone...
(holding out the candy)
Lifesaver?
ADELLE
(ignoring the candy)
You're a ray of sunshine,
Jack.
They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
President" stenciled on the glass...
...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
messages, and into Jack's office...
A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
Stairmaster...
Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.
ADELLE
Oh, and Oxxford called...
JACK
Ooh, my suits are ready...
He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
reels back.
JACK (CONT'D)
Kate Reynolds...
ADELLE
Her assistant said you could
call her at home after eight.
Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
ghost.
JACK
Her assistant?
ADELLE
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
JACK
(lost in the message)
Kate Reynolds was my
girlfriend in college.
I
almost married her...
ADELLE
(a hearty LAUGH)
You?
Married?
JACK
(snapping out of it)
Almost married.
And almost a
junior broker at E.F.
Hutton...
ADELLE
Excuse me?
JACK
She didn't want me to go to
London.
We're standing at the
airport saying goodbye and she
asks me to stay.
ADELLE
So you left her?
Just like
that?
JACK
God, no.
I thought about it
for practically the entire
flight...
ADELLE
Stop Jack, I'm getting all
weepy.
JACK
I took the road less traveled,
Adelle.
ADELLE
And look where it's led you...
(picking up the phone)
I'm gonna get her on the
phone...
Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
back...
Adelle begins dialing the number.
Finally, Jack
reaches out and hangs up the phone.
JACK
No...
ADELLE
No?!
You almost married this
woman.
Aren't you even
curious what she wants?
JACK
She's probably just having a
fit of nostalgia.
You know,
lonely Christmas Eve, call the
one that got away, that kind
of thing.
Adelle rolls her eyes at him.
JACK (CONT'D)
I'm telling you, it's ancient
history...
Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
the room.
LASSITER
Eight forty-five on Christmas
Eve and Jack Campbell is still
at his desk.
There's a
Hallmark moment for you...
Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
times.
JACK
Peter.
I don't see you
rushing home to trim the tree.
LASSITER
(pouring himself
a scotch)
That's because I'm a heartless
bastard who only cares about
money.
JACK
And God love you for it.
Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
Jack.
LASSITER
(sipping the scotch)
I just got a call from Terry
Haight.
Bob Thomas is
nervous...
JACK
That'll happen when you're
about to spend thirty billion
dollars on some aspirin...
LASSITER
Someone's gonna have to nurse
him through this.
JACK
Why are you staring at my
breasts, Peter?
LASSITER
I need you, tiger..
JACK
Where is he?
LASSITER
Aspen.
Jack pauses for a beat.
JACK
(to Adelle)
Call Aunt Irma.
Tell her I
won't be able to make it
tomorrow...
Adelle rolls her eyes at him...
LASSITER
You're a credit to capitalism,
Jack.
Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.
JACK
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
question.
An old girlfriend
calls you out of the blue on
Christmas Eve...
LASSITER
You suddenly having trouble
getting dates?
JACK
Not by a long shot.
LASSITER
Then leave it in the past.
Old flames are like old tax
returns.
You keep `em in the
file cabinet for three years
and then you cut `em loose.
Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
Knicks hoop.
JACK
(to Adelle)
I'll leave from the office
tomorrow afternoon.
Call the
group.
Schedule an emergency
strategy session for noon.
ADELLE
That'll be a nice little
holiday treat.
Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.
Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.
He
checks his watch.
It's past eleven.
He gets up, goes
to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
glory, then he see it...
...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
the night...
Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
monitors.
FRANK
Mr. Campbell.
Why didn't you
call down, I would've had Joe
get your ride.
Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
street.
JACK
I'm thinking I might walk
tonight, Frank.
FRANK
Nice night for it.
I'll have
Louis send your car home.
A nod from Jack.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
JACK
Thanks.
To you too...
Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
out into the crisp night air...
Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...
SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
behind the counter.
There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...
...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
"CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
coffee machine...
CASH
Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!
She's
a certified winner...paper-
thin but good as gold...
Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.
Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.
JACK
Egg nog?
SAM WONG
(pointing)
Dairy case.
Five dollar.
CASH
(in the b.g., to
Sam Wong)
Y'all do the lotto here...?
`Cause I got me a winner...I
know, I know, Lotto keeps the
black man down... but not
me...
Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
handing Sam Wong his ticket.
Jack heads back toward
the counter...
CASH (CONT'D)
...06...14...18...48...right
there.
Four numbers...that's
two hundred and thirty eight
dollar...
(a smile)
Merry Christmas and shit...
SAM WONG
(barely looking
at ticket)
Ticket bad.
You draw in lines
with pencil.
CASH
What're you talkin' about?
SAM WONG
(throwing the ticket
back)
You draw lines with pencil!
I
know about this!
The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
back...
CASH
What!?
Look at the ticket...!
SAM WONG
Get out, I call 911.
The Santa looks at Jack, confused.
CASH
You're lookin' at me, you're
not even lookin' at the
ticket!
The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.
SAM WONG
You leave now.
Take ticket
somewhere else.
(calling out)
Next customer in line...!
CASH
You first generation,
xenophobic, money-theistic,
hot pastrami sandwich
making...
SAM WONG
(screaming)
Get out!
Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
face...
CASH
LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!
A moment of decision for Jack.
Then...
JACK
(carefully)
Let me see that ticket.
Cash turns to Jack.
CASH
(menacing)
Was I talkin' to you?!
Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
then...
JACK
Maybe I'll buy it from you.
Now Cash walks over to Jack...
CASH
Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
kicked tryin' to be a hero.
Film at eleven...
(then...turning to
the coffee machine)
What?!
Oh no, not another
lookie-loo.
You know how big
a job this is?
The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
confused.
CASH (CONT'D)
You're double bookin' me!
You're gonna get double
billed!
Shit!
Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
SHATTERS.
The woman reels back in terror with the
baby...
JACK
Hey, c'mon...
In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
pants, aiming it at Jack's face.
The woman SCREAMS,
covers her baby.
CASH
(in Jack's face)
Do you want to die?
Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
cool...
CASH (CONT'D)
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
JACK
No.
CASH
(a smile)
Yes you do...
JACK
Look, I'm talking about a
business deal here.
I buy the
ticket for two hundred, take
it to a store where the guy
behind the counter...
(glaring at Sam Wong)
...doesn't have a death wish
(back to Cash)
...I just made myself a quick
thirty eight dollars.
Cash gets closer...
JACK (CONT'D)
Like I said, it's a business
deal...
CASH
Damn, you are the real
thing...
Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
gun back into his pants...
CASH (CONT'D)
C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
here...
(to Sam Wong)
You were lookin' at me, papa,
you shoulda been lookin' at
the ticket.
That ticket was
legit, B.
You're fake...
Cash starts out of the deli.
Jack follows...
Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.
He takes
off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
heads into the bedroom.
Through the large windows we see snow falling...
Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...
CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE
DISSOLVE TO:
Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light...he
opens his eyes...feels something strange...
Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his
chest.
A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to
remember... did he meet a woman last night...?
He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting
faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...
...did she have a dog?
He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to
get a look at her face.
And then he sees her...
...KATE REYNOLDS...
...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter
contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...
His head darts around the room - its cramped and lived
in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on
the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed
and a charming little bay window.
He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch
on the night stand, but its not there.
Its a Timex
Indiglo and it reads, 7:57 A.M...
Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its
a dream...but nothing changes.
Then, Kate stirs...
KATE
Mmmm...ten more minutes,
Jack... its Christmas...
Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...
Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL,
ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room
carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top
of her lungs...
ANNIE
Jingle bells, Santa s
mells, Rudolph laid an
egg...la la la, la-la la
la, la la la la la...
Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up
herself.
She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.
ANNIE (CONTD)
You too, Luce...
The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining
everybody else and leaving very little room.
Annie
starts jumping.
ANNIE (CONTD)
Rise...and...shine...!
KATE
(stirring)
Youre jumping,
sweetheart...
Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own
funeral.
ANNIE
Mom, dont you think we
need to open the
presents?
KATE
(groggy)
Mommy needs five more
minutes in la la land.
That could be her
present...
Josh crawls directly up to Jacks stomach, climbing
on.
ANNIE
Cmon, Dad.
Get up!
She said Dad.
Thats it.
Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then
gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying
next to it.
He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph
bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.
Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself
for the first time...hes naked...
...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on
the bed...
...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow
cardigan off the chair and throws them on...
Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.
KATE
Jack...?
Jack turns by instinct.
Kate grabs him, drawing him
near.
A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her
eyes...
Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her
scream...
KATE (CONTD)
(still groggy)
Strong coffee, okay?
She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...
A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle
of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of
gifts underneath and four red stockings over the
fireplace.
Jack darts to the top of the steps...
KATE (O.S.)
(calling from
the bedroom)
Use an entire can if you
have to!
He looks back at the bedroom, then at the
stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still
in shock.
He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front
door...about to step out when he looks down and
realizes...
...hes barefoot.
He glances at a pair of rubber over-
boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to
leave when...
He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door
lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to
do...
The door opens...into the house, arms laden with
wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both
60s), Kates parents.
Big Eds wearing a ten gallon
hat and a suede overcoat.
Lorraine has a cigarette
dangling from her mouth.
JACK
(drawing on a
memory)
Ed?
Lorraine?
Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of
gifts.
BIG ED
Jack you ol bird dog.
Merry Christmas to ya...
Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jacks cheek.
LORRAINE
Talk to him, Jack.
Please.
One day a year
away from the Ponderosa.
I dont think thats too
much to ask.
BIG ED
I heard that.
This is
who I am, woman!
(a wink to Jack)
Tell her, Jack!
Youre
the only one who gets me,
for gods sake!
Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.
LORRAINE
I need some egg nog...
BIG ED
Course you do.
Hell,
its almost 8 a.m.
(shouting upstairs)
Where are my two lil
pardners?
Annie!
Josh!
Giddy up, Bid Eds here!
JACK
Excuse me.
Jack dashes out the door.
LORRAINE
Where are you going,
Jack?
(to Big Ed)
Wheres he going?
BIG ED
Damned if I know...
They start to remove their coats, when...
The door flies back open...
JACK
Wheres my car?!
Wheres
my Ferrari!?
BIG ED
What the hell are you
talking about?
(to Lorraine)
Whats he talking about?
JACK
Look, can I just borrow
your car?!
I promise
itll be returned!
BIG ED
The Caddy?
Why dont you
take your own damn car!
LORRAINE
Oh just let him borrow
your precious Cadillac,
for gods sake.
Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.
BIG ED
Hes got a perfectly good
mini-van sitting out
there in the driveway!
Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...
Jack sees a sign, George Washington Bridge - 3 miles...
Jack driving over the bridge.
A sigh of relief as he
passes under a sign for Manhattan.
Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby
desk where FRANK the security guard sits.
Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.
FRANK
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold
it right there...
JACK
Frank.
Wheres Alan
Mintz?
Is he here yet?
FRANK
Mr. Mintz?
(a knowing chuckle)
I dont think
so...buildings closed
pal.
Youll have to come
back tomorrow.
JACK
Look, I dont know whats
going on here but I am
Senior Vice President of
this company.
FRANK
I dont care who you
are.
Its Christmas and
like I told you the
building is closed.
JACK
Maybe youre not hearing
me.
I am Jack
Campbell...
(approaching the
building directory)
Right here.
Jack
Campbell, President...
And then he sees it...ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT, listed
plain as day on the building director...
Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building
directory...
A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in
shock...
CHAPTER FIVE - WHATS HAPPENING?
Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a
burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the
back seat...
CASH
Might wanna fasten your
seat belt, Jack...
JACK
(recovering)
What the hell is
happening to me?!
Jacks freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute
of it.
Cash hands Jack a paper bag.
Jack starts
breathing into the bag.
CASH
This kinda thing makes a
lotta guys throw up.
Seen it happen.
So if
you get the urge, do it
out the window.
(with a taunting
laugh)
I dont want you marring
this exquisite leather
interior...
Cash looks over at Jack...hes really losing it,
sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash
smiles...
CASH (CONTD)
Look, I dont know what
youre getting so worked
up about, you did
this...you brought this
on yourself.
JACK
Brought what on myself?!
I didnt do anything!
CASH
No?
Cmon, Jack...Ive
got everything I need, I
dont have regrets,
thats just not for me...
sound familiar?
JACK
You mean because you
thought I was cocky Im
now on a permanent acid
trip?!!
Cash gets a laugh out of Jacks overreaction...
CASH
Everyone else in that
store is a statue, they
see their lives passing
in front of their eyes,
but not you.
Youre
making a business deal...
JACK
(enraged)
Give me my goddamn life
back!
CASH
You?
What about me?
Im
working hard for you
here, Jack.
On Christmas
too!
Now you did a good
thing last night,
intervening that way.
I
was moved...
JACK
(interrupting)
Please.
Just tell me
whats happening to me.
In plain English.
None
of that mumbo jumbo...
Cash turns to Jack.
CASH
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
JACK
I glimpse?
A glimpse of
what!?
What glimpse?!
Glimpse!
CASH
Look, eventually,
everybody gets one...some
of em take a couple
seconds...
(looking at Jack)
...some of em take a lot
longer...
JACK
I asked you a direct
question!
A glimpse of
what?!
A look from Cash.
CASH
Figure it out.
You got
plenty of time.
JACK
How much time?!
CASH
As long as it takes to
figure it out.
Which, in
your case, could be
considerable.
JACK
Look, I just want my life
back.
Now whats it
gonna take?
You wanna
talk turkey?
Lets talk
turkey!
How much
money...?
Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.
He flashes
Jack a smile.
CASH
Do I look like I need
your money.
It doesnt
work like that and I
cant tell you why.
JACK
Why not?
CASH
Because you got to figure
it out for yourself.
(beat)
Are you listening to me?
JACK
Figure it out?
Figure
what out?!
Cash just stares at him...
JACK (CONTD)
Thats it?
Thats all I
get?!
A glare?!
CASH
Look Jack, in my
experience the best way
people deal with this is
to just relax and breathe
through it...let it come
to you.
Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.
JACK
Look, I dont have time
for this right now.
Im
in the middle of a
deal...
CASH
Oh youre working on a
new deal now...did I
mention that?
JACK
You know what?
Ive had
it with you.
Ive had it
with all of this shit...
SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically
sending Jack through the windshield.
Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next
to the mini-van.
Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to
Jack...
CASH
Here...
Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE
BELL.
He looks at it curiously.
JACK
Whats this, a signal?
Will you come whenever I
ring it?
CASH
Do I look like I live in
a bottle?
Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.
JACK
(lost)
But what do I do?
CASH
Look Jack Im late.
Id
love to help you out some
more but I gotta go
handle my business...
(gesturing to
the mini-van)
Happy trails.
Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back
to Cash.
JACK
Hey, you did this to me,
you cant just leave me
like this.
Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.
CASH
Fine.
You want to know
everything, Ill tell you
everything.
But not
here.
Lets get some
air...
Jacks still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the
driver side door...
JACK
(relieved)
Thanks, man...
Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn
around, Cashs door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in
a blast of horsepower...
Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to
the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears,
disappearing...
The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the
Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand,
and finally to the mini-van.
Jacks trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the
steering wheel and the cars registration in his
hand...
He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty
science kit box to the trash.
His wife, JEANNIE, also
late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of
fruit in hand...
Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the
window.
JACK
Excuse me.
Do you know
where Merrison Street is?
Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.
ARNIE
(turning to his wife)
Jeannie!
I found Jack!
Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly
decorated suburban home, Arnies arm around his
shoulder.
ARNIE
You look terrible...
Jack takes in the decor  its a male leisure time
fantasy  old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart
board, and kitschy 50s style bamboo bar...
ARNIE (CONTD)
Truth is I expected you.
Kate called before and
asked if I knew where you
were.
Arnie notices Jacks fascination with the room...
ARNIE (CONTD)
I know, I moved the
Barca-lounger into the
corner.
Its throwin
everybody off.
What do
you think?
JACK
(with a nod)
Great room...
A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jacks approval means
something to him.
ARNIE
You and me, buddy.
We
know how to live...
Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink
out of a bamboo bottle holder.
ARNIE (CONTD)
So Jack, you okay?
Jack doesnt respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team
photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy
with the caption, Plainfield, N.J. Softball League
Champs, 1994.
ARNIE (CONTD)
I mean you leave the
house on Christmas
morning, you dont tell
anyone where youre
going...
Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...
JACK
Were friends, arent we?
ARNIE
Maybe I dont say it
enough but you moving in
next door to me...
Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.
Jack
nods.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Talk to me...
A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there,
open eyed, ready to listen.
JACK
Im having kind of a bad
day.
ARNIE
(nodding)
I read somewhere that the
suicide rate doubles
during the holidays...
A raised eyebrow from Jack.
ARNIE (CONTD)
(to himself)
What am I saying?
You
dont need to hear
that...
(back to Jack)
All I meant was a lot of
people have a hard time
dealing with all the
forced reverie, thats
all.
Is that you?
JACK
Is it...?
ARNIE
Trouble at work?
JACK
I dont think so.
ARNIE
Its not Kate, is it?
Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.
Arnies eyes
widen...
ARNIE (CONTD)
(proudly)
You see, its like were
in each others heads...
JACK
Kates my wife...
Jack looks at Arnie as if hes seeking confirmation.
ARNIE
(a playful smile)
Just keep saying it,
Jack, like a mantra.
Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the
arm.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Cmon, I better walk ya
home.
Shes mad enough
as it is, right...?
Jack steps inside.
He turns back to the door but
Arnies gone.
Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...
KATE
(into phone)
Hold on a second...
She cups the receiver.
Jack looks at her, shes
dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.
JACK
You cut your hair...
A curious look from Kate.
KATE
Ten years ago...
Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away
nothing.
KATE (CONTD)
Are you okay?
JACK
Yeah...fine.
She gives him a resolute nod, then...
KATE
(into phone)
Never mind, he just
walked in...
Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then
stares him down angrily.
KATE (CONTD)
Do you have any idea what
you put us through
today?!
You walk out of
here at 7:30 in the
morning, dont tell me
where youre going, or
even that youre going,
and I dont see you til
hours later.
I had state
troopers looking for
you!
I called
hospitals...
(pointing at
the phone)
...I was just on the
phone with the morgue
for gods sake!
Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face
building.
KATE (CONTD)
What kind of man leaves
his family on Christmas
morning without a word
about where hes going?
KATE (CONTD)
What kind of man does
that!?
JACK
(jumping in)
I dont know!
Please
stop yelling at me!
She looks at him curiously.
KATE
Where were you?
JACK
I was in the city.
KATE
The city?
New York
City?
Why?
JACK
Because thats where I
live.
KATE
Jack...dont even
start...
JACK
Look, you dont
understand.
I woke up
here...and this is very
strange ...this is not my
house...
A raised eyebrow from Kate.
Jack moves around the
room...
JACK (CONTD)
(pointing upstairs)
Im not Dad....
Kate,
youre not my wife...
Kate looks him over, assessing, then...
KATE
You know what, Jack?
Its not funny this
time.
Im really angry.
She stares him down, expecting an answer.
But he has
no answer.
KATE (CONTD)
(loudly)
Jack!
Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash
gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts
RINGING it furiously.
Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.
ANNIE
(re: bell)
Whats that?
Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand
and takes the bicycle bell...
ANNIE (CONTD)
(examining the bell)
I like this...
(jumping up and
giving hima peck
on the cheek)
...thanks, Dad!
Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.
Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...
KATE
You missed the whole
thing, Jack.
The
pancakes, the
presents...you spent six
hours putting that bike
together and you didnt
even get to see the look
on Annies face when she
opened it...
Jack sees the disappointment on her face...
KATE (CONTD)
You missed Christmas,
Jack.
Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in
to the moment...
JACK
Im...Im sorry.
Kate looks at him.
He seems sincere enough...
KATE
Look, we dont have time
for this right now, well
talk about it later.
Now
get dressed...
(pointing to his
outfit)
Youre not wearing that
to the Thompsons party.
I dont care how
hilarious you think it
is...
JACK
Party?
Oh no, I cant go
to a party...
KATE
You look forward to this
party all year.
Whats
with you today?
JACK
Trust me on this Kate.
I
really dont think going
to a party is the right
move for me at the
present time.
Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.
KATE
Fine.
Do whatever you
want.
She picks up the phone, starts dialing...
JACK
What are you doing?
KATE
Telling my mother she
doesnt have to stay with
the kids.
JACK
Why not?
KATE
Because youll be here.
Kate just looks at him.
JACK
Ill be ready in ten
minutes.
He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate
watching him...
He opens the door...its a closet.
JACK (CONTD)
Christ...
(turning around)
Where the hell is the
bathroom?
KATE
Funny, Jack.
Im
laughing on the inside.
The light comes on...
Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to
collect himself...but somethings not right...
He glances around...the bathroom is small and its
cluttered with Kates razors, loofah, skin creams...
...none of this stuff is his...
...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a
forlorn sense of displacement...
...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it...
anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...
After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his
face...
Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar
slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather
shoes...
He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the
sport coats.
JACK
This is just...
(searching for
the words)
...this is sub-par...
Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the
closet.
He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look
exchanged... then, Annie runs away...
Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a
pair of the slacks...
As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jacks
arm...
EVELYN
(suggestively)
Like the dress...?
JACK
(glancing at it)
Its lovely...
EVELYN
(a satisfied smile)
I thought I saw you
notice it at the kids
recital.
Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying
to catch up with Kate...
The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the
b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...
Jacks eyes dart around the room...its large, neater
than his and Kates house but still very lived in...The
Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with
new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything
imported from Europe, but everyones having a good
time...
...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and
THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a
walking advertisement for Levis Cotton Dockers...
NICK
Did you see Van Horn last
night?
This kids gonna
single-handedly save
basketball in the state
of New Jersey...
JACK
The Nets?
Youre kidding,
right...?
Nick looks at him in disbelief.
JACK (CONTD)
(recovering)
Well...theyre certainly
due.
BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his
plate, tugs at Jacks shirt.
BILL KRAMER
So tomorrows the big
day, Jackie...
JACK
Okay...why?
BILL KRAMER
Triple bypass.
Im going
under the knife.
I told
you, didnt I?
JACK
Triple bypass?
(pointing to his
plate)
You really think you
should be eating all
that?
BILL KRAMER
Why not?
I figure Im
going in for a cleaning
tomorrow, I might as well
load up on the fried
stuff tonight...
ARNIE
Good thinking, Bill.
Have another drink.
(whispering to Jack)
Hell be lucky if he
lives through the
night...
Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of
Dutch Masters cigars.
He shows them to Jack, Jack nods
politely.
Nick eagerly hands him one...
Nick lights Jacks cigar, then his own...enjoying that
first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a
puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but its an
effort...
Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in
hand...
EVELYN
(holding out a
puff to Jack)
Finger food...?
JACK
I dont think so, thank
you...
EVELYN
(suggestively)
Cmon, as soon as I put
them down, youre gonna
grab a couple...you
always do...
Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the
other side of the room...Kate watches as...
Evelyn holds the puff up to Jacks mouth, slowly
putting it near his lips...
EVELYN (CONTD)
Let me.
Theyll melt in
your mouth...
He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the
treat inside...
EVELYN (CONTD)
Good?
On Jacks face...if freezer burn were a facial
expression, this would be it...
JACK
(forcing a smile)
Theyre great!
Thank
you!
...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands
Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...
A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...
EVELYN
Mushroom puffs arent the
only thing I do well...
JACK
Well do whatever it is
you do well, and
just...just do it.
Excuse me...
Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...
Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the
stairs...
Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with
guests coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED
telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...
JACK
(loudly, into phone)
...what do you mean he
wont come to the phone?!
(standing, indignant)
Do you realize how much
money Ive made for that
sonuvabitch in the last
eight years?!
Click.
A dial tone.
Jack slams the phone down...
JACK (CONTD)
Damnit!
He slams the phone again...and again...and again...
KATE (O.S.)
Jack...?
Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching
him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on
her face.
KATE
Are you sure youre
okay...?
A forced smile from Jack.
JACK
Yes, Im fine.
Its just
this god awful football
phone!
Who has a phone
like this anyway?!
KATE
(doubtful)
Uh huh...
Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.
KATE (CONTD)
You must really love
Evelyns mushroom puffs,
huh?
(with a wink)
You know theyre not
real...
She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...
Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.
He looks across the room and sees...
Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her
jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.
Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him,
slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...
He catches Kates eye...she gives him a subtle smile.
KATE
(to guests)
...then she asks me to
put this sweater on.
What choice do I have,
right?
Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...
KATE (CONTD)
But as Im slipping it on
I notice shes misspelled
the word lawyers.
(laughing)
I had to go through the
entire day wearing a hand
embroidered sweater that
said, Non-Profit Layers
Do It For Free.
The guests laugh again.
Even Jack finds himself
laughing, until...
JACK
(to Kate, off-hand)
So youre a lawyer...?
A chuckle from the group.
Kates confused.
JACK (CONTD)
A non-profit lawyer...
People are starting to LAUGH.
KATE
(a little embarrassed)
Jack...
JACK
Pro bono.
You dont get
paid at all.
Nobody
makes a dime.
Well,
bravo...
Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...
CUT TO:
Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets
them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his
face.
KATE
I better go wake my
mother...
Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.
KATE (CONTD)
Here you go...
JACK
Youre kidding me...
KATE
Shes your dog, Jack.
JACK
No, shes not.
KATE
Fine, shes the kids
dog.
Lets go wake Josh,
see if he wants to walk
her.
JACK
But its twenty degrees
outside...
KATE
(sympathetic)
Youre having a bad day,
Ill go with
you...actually, theres
no way in hell youre
gettin me back out
there...
Jack looks at the dogs face.
Lucy couldnt be more
excited.
Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the
leash.
KATE (CONTD)
(heading up the
stairs)
Make sure you reward her
verbally when she does a
number two...
CUT TO:
Kate is in bed, fast asleep.
Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the
cold outside.
He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.
He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly
on the chair.
He looks over at the pair of flannel
pajamas folded on the dresser.
He shakes his head,
resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...
CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT
Morning light streams into the room.
The clock reads,
7:14.
Jack opens his eyes  a burst of light hitting them
from the window...like the morning light in his
Manhattan loft...
He reaches across the bed...its empty...
A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on
the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...
The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A
pained look on Jacks face as he realizes hes still in
Jersey.
Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment,
hoping itll stop...it doesnt.
Then, he hears the
sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.
He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...
The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING Beast
of Burden.
Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with
the song...
JACK
Hello?
No answer...
JACK (CONTD)
(louder, over music)
Hello!
KATE
(singing)
...my feet are hurtin...
JACK
(yelling)
HEY!
Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the
shower curtain open...
Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...thats
something hes missed...then...
JACK (CONTD)
Uh...that babys crying...
KATE
(unimpressed)
And...?
...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her
naked body.
KATE (CONTD)
Dont give me that look,
Jack, Tuesdays your day
and you know it.
And try
to get Josh to day care
on time, okay?
He missed
the macaroni painting
last week...
She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.
CUT TO:
Annies watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger
as...
Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table,
Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of
plastic keys.
Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to
the baby.
He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and
rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.
Josh playfully
grabs at Jacks nose.
He looks over to Annie.
Shes still staring at him
like hes a Martian.
He looks at the instructions on
the box of Huggies.
JACK
Pull tape...
Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then
gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from
the babys bottom, and seeing whats inside.
JACK (CONTD)
Holy mother of god!
Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for
a place to put it.
Annie points to a Diaper Genie by
the dresser.
Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the
lid.
Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.
JACK (CONTD)
You must be kidding...
Annie stares at him a beat.
Then...
ANNIE
Youre not really our
dad, are you?
Jack turns to her.
Shes looking back at him with
complete earnestness.
They stare at each other another
moment.
Then...
JACK
No, Im not.
A look of curiosity from Annie.
JACK (CONTD)
I work on Wall Street,
you know with the big
buildings...?
No response from Annie...
JACK (CONTD)
I live in an apartment
house with a doorman, I
can buy just about
anything I want...
Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.
JACK (CONTD)
This isnt my real life.
Its just a glimpse...
ANNIE
Wheres my real dad?
JACK
I dont know...
A concerned look on Annies face, Jacks petrified that
shes about to cry.
JACK (CONTD)
But dont worry, he loves
you and Im sure hell be
back very soon...
(to himself)
...very, very soon...
Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair
and tugging firmly at his hair.
ANNIE
They did a pretty good
job.
JACK
Who did?
ANNIE
The aliens...In the
mother ship.
You look
just like him.
JACK
Uhh...thanks...slightly
better looking though,
right?
Annies now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.
JACK (CONTD)
Youre not going to start
crying, are you?
Because
Im not really sure I
could deal with that
right now.
She thinks about it for a moment.
ANNIE
Do you like kids?
JACK
On a case by case
basis...
ANNIE
You know how to make
chocolate milk?
JACK
I think I could figure it
out.
ANNIE
You promise not to kidnap
me and my brother and
implant stuff in our brains?
JACK
Sure.
Beat.
Then...a smile from Annie.
ANNIE
Welcome to earth.
Jacks driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...
Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by
monkeys  his shirt buttons are off by one, and theyre
clearly supposed to be in the back.
ANNIE
Stop here...
Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care
Center.
ANNIE (CONTD)
This is day care.
Its
where babies go when
their parents are at
work.
JACK
Check...
He gets out of the van...
Jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he
spots something a hundred yards down the road...
JACK
Good Lord...
...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed
Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...
Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming
with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...
Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from
behind the counter...
BIG ED
Jack my boy!
You are
looking mighty worse for
the wear...Hey, guess who
I played bridge with two
nights ago...?
Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...
BIG ED (CONTD)
Hell, youll never
guess.
One Sydney
Potter.
Thats Sydney
Potter, Chief Executive
Officer of BuyRite
Transport.
Only the
third largest trucking
company in the state.
I
even let the sonuvabitch
win, which wasnt easy
because the guys been
bashed in the head by
Teamsters so many times
his brains like
porridge.
Anyhoo, hes
looking for a new parts
supplier... we can handle
that kind of volume,
right?
Jack considers this briefly.
JACK
Im gonna have to get
back to you on that...Ed.
Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking
at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter
as...
Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking
by.
He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.
JACK (CONTD)
Do I have a private
office somewhere in the
building?
KENNY
Uh...sure Jack...
(nervously pointing)
Right back there...
JACK
Thank you.
Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...
Theres no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or
bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls
littered with tire inventory and price lists...
Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.
He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of
the room and sits down behind it...
On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a
plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar
and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word,
Bowlers Do It In An Alley embossed on its base...
He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top
drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking
inside...
He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it
back...
Jack picks up the Bowlers Do It In An Alley figurine
and gives it a good look...
JACK
Bowlers do it in an
alley?...Non profit
lawyers do it for free...
what is it with these
people?
Dont they
realize this refers to
sex?
He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer
where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.
He lifts it
out...
JACK (CONTD)
At least you splurged on
some decent scotch...
He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.
He
drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the
cup, throwing it toward the NETS basketball
hoop/garbage can near the door.
He misses...
He looks more closely at the photographs...most are
family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at
the pony rides, at Joshs birth...in every one of them,
Jack is smiling...
JACK (CONTD)
(to Jack in
the photo)
What are you smiling
about...?
He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall
behind him.
It reads, Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1
Junior Sales Associate, 1988.
Jack raises an
eyebrow...
JACK (CONTD)
Number one...not bad.
He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more
carefully...
JACK (CONTD)
1988...?
I was in London
in 1988...
Jacks jarred into reality...
JACK (CONTD)
(to Jack in the photo)
You never went to London...
(picking up the photo)
...you never got on that
plane...
He stays there a moment...in shock.
Then...
The P.A. system comes to life...
ESTELLE
(over P.A.)
Jack to mag
wheels...Jack, youre
needed in mag wheels,
customer waiting!
CUT TO:
Kenny leading Jack toward the Mag Wheels section.
JACK
...I was the number one
junior sales associate at
E.F. Hutton in 1988.
Did
you know that?
KENNY
No, I didnt...thats
great.
JACK
Thats the kind of thing
you can really build
on...
KENNY
Uh huh...
JACK
I mean sales has always
been a feeder for M and
A, always...
They approach Mag Wheels where TOMMY, a slick sales
associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the
displays...
KENNY
Here we are, mag wheels...
(a little concerned)
Hey Jack, are you sure
youre okay?
JACK
Well, Im just a little
confused right now about
why I work here...
Kenny looks at him nervously.
KENNY
Uh...I just started here
last Tuesday.
Jack nods compassionately.
Kenny takes off leaving
Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with
the customer.
TOMMY
(to the customer)
So youre all set on the
Skip Shift eliminator and
the Brembo rotors.
Jacks our point man on
alloy wheels...
JACK
(turning to Tommy)
Do you know why do I work
here...?
TOMMY
Because youre the best
damn tire guy in the
state of New Jersey...
(proudly, to the
customer)
Jack taught me everything
I know about the
business...
The customer nods, impressed.
JACK
I taught you the business?
Another nod to the customer.
TOMMY
And hes a crack-up.
JACK
Everything I taught you.
I want to hear it all,
right now.
Tommys confused.
CUSTOMER
Hey, Im ready to buy
here...
JACK
(to the customer)
What do you want?
CUSTOMER
I want some alloy wheels.
Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding
it out to the customer.
JACK
Here.
These are great.
Youll need four.
The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it
confused...
CUSTOMER
But I dont like these...
JACK
Hey, you heard the guy,
Im the best damn tire
guy in the state of New
Jersey.
(turning to Tommy)
Everything.
TOMMY
Okay...
(hesitating)
Rule number one, the
customer is always
right...
A satisfied smirk from the customer.
Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the
phone...
JACK
(into phone)
...I have no idea what
our inventory level is,
thats why Im asking
you...
A KNOCK at the door...
JACK (CONTD)
Look, just send us what
you sent us last month,
okay...?
And keep doing
that until further
notice...
He hangs up the phone as the door opens.
Big Ed sticks
his head in...
BIG ED
Got a minute, Jack?
JACK
Ive got all the time in
the world...
Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a
tough looking man...
BIG ED
Jack, meet Sydney Potter,
BuyRite Transport, one of
Jerseys top
businessmen...
Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair,
trying to place the name.
Then...
JACK
...and a helluva bridge
player.
Eds told me a
lot about you...
They shake hands.
Potter nods his head at Jack,
immediately impressed.
Big Ed is beaming.
POTTER
(in a heavy Jersey
accent)
Lucky in cards, lucky in
business, lucky in love.
My cup runneth over...
(to Big Ed)
Hes a nice looking
boy...
BIG ED
My daughters no slouch
either...
A smile from Potter, then a serious look.
POTTER
Lets cut to the chase,
Jack.
Big Ed tells me
youre the grease that
makes the wheels turn
around here.
I need a
new parts supplier for my
fleet.
You seem to have
the parts.
That we
know.
What we dont know
is why the hell I should
buy them from you.
Potter stares Jack down.
But Jacks not about to be
intimidated by him.
He pauses, matching Potters
stare.
Then...
JACK
I have no idea...
A surprised look from Potter.
An anxious laugh from
Big Ed.
BIG ED
(nervous)
Cmon Jack...
JACK
(to Potter)
I mean it.
From what I
can tell, were a mom and
pop operation, were
already over-extended in
sales, and any price
advantage we could offer
would easily be matched
by a larger supplier...
Jack continues to stare down Potter.
JACK (CONTD)
So like I said, I dont
have any idea why you
should buy your parts
from us...
The staring match continues.
Big Eds getting more
nervous.
Potters the first to blink.
POTTER
Okay, you got my
attention...
JACK
Except for rule number
one...
Jack smiles.
JACK (CONTD)
The customer is always
right.
A clich?
Sure.
The difference is, we
mean it.
Were small, we
need our customers.
We
cant afford to
disappoint them, ever.
Yeah, you could go to
some leviathan supplier,
probably save a few
pennies on the price of
oil filters, but with us
you get more than a
supplier, you get a
bridge partner...
A smile from Potter.
Jack gives Ed a wink.
Ed
watches, thrilled...
JACK (CONTD)
You want to bid hearts,
were right there with
you.
You feel the need
to redouble, youre not
going to get any argument
from us...
Potter nods at Jack.
Jack moves in for the kill.
JACK (CONTD)
The big guys may have the
high cards, but you know
as well as I do, Sydney,
high cards dont always
take the trick.
Potter pauses a minute, then...
POTTER
(to Big Ed,
re: Jack)
I like him...
Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.
BIG ED
(a wink to Jack)
Thats my boy...
(an arm around Potter)
Cmon, lemme show you the
rest of the ranch...
Big Ed and Potter exit the office...
BIG ED (CONTD)
(turning back to Jack)
Nice shootin, Jack...
...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his
face.
Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman
REPORTER at the anchors desk...
CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
...advancers led
decliners by a nine to
four ratio and the
closing tick was a mildly
bullish plus seventy
six.
Much of the
markets action today was
fueled by the latest
round of merger mania to
hit Wall Street...
The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a
graphic in the corner of the screen...
CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
...when Global Health
Systems and MedTech
Pharmaceutical announced
their intentions to join
forces in a massive one
hundred and twenty two
billion dollar stock swap
deal.
Though neither
side expressed
significant regulatory
concerns at the
announcement press
conference, it is
believed that both the
FDA and the FTC will be
closely scrutinizing the
marriage, the largest
ever in the health care
industry.
When asked
about possible anti-
competitive implications,
Global Chairman Bob
Thomas referred reporters
to P.K. Lassiter and
Company President Alan
Mintz, the original
architect behind the
deal...
Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super
confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas hand at the
press conference.
CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
Ironically, Mintz first
met Thomas at a Lamaze
class...
JACK
A Lamaze class...!?
CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
...while coaching their
pregnant wives, Mintz and T
homas struck up a
dialogue about the need
for consolidation in the
rapidly growing health
care industry and two
months later, the deal
with MedTech was born...
JACK
What?!
Thats my deal?
CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
In other business news,
U.S. Labor Department
officials announced today
that two hundred and
seventy-five thousand new
jobs were created last
month, twenty-five
thousand less than
economists were
predicting, leading to a
mild rally in the bond
markets before midday.
But as the trading
session drew to a close,
the profit takers stepped
in and the long bond
closed at ninety seven
even, up only two ticks,
the yield inching down to
six point zero seven
percent...
Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only
Jacks NYU sweatshirt...
KATE
The kids are asleep...
She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.
Jack
looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.
KATE (CONTD)
Jack.
I said the kids
are asleep...
JACK
(distracted)
Well thats just
great...those little
monkeys can be a real
handful...
Kate shuts off the TV.
JACK (CONTD)
Hey!
I was watching
that!
KATE
I thought we had a deal
about you watching CNBC
in bed.
JACK
Im working on a new deal
now...
Kate throws a Kate Bushs The Sensual World into the
CD player.
KATE
Fine, but not tonight...
She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.
JACK
Wait a second.
You want
me, dont you?
KATE
That is the general idea,
yes...
Kate starts kissing him...but Jacks a little
uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back,
a little nervous.
JACK
Shouldnt we grab some
dinner first?
Maybe a
bottle of wine...?
KATE
Its ten thirty, Jack.
By eleven youre gonna be
sprawled out on the bed
snoring your head off.
We dont have time for
wining and dining.
JACK
Whatever you say...honey.
She starts kissing him again...but this time he just
goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair
hes brought back to a different time and place...
Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...its
like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven
years...
JACK (CONTD)
God...youre beautiful...
She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the
compliment...
KATE
Thanks, Jack...
JACK
No, Im serious...youre
really stunning...
KATE
This is good stuff, Jack,
keep it coming...
JACK
I mean back in college,
you were a very pretty
girl, theres no question
about that.
But this...
(lost in her)
...youve really grown
into a beautiful woman...
Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back,
reacting to the intensity in his stare...
KATE
How can you do that?
JACK
(nervous)
Do what?
KATE
Look at me like you
havent seen me every day
for the last twelve
years...
Jack freezes.
Theres love in her eyes but its not
meant for him...
She kisses him...
KATE (CONTD)
Dont move.
She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...
He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...
He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...
Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the
bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...
At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.
She
turns off the CD player and heads into bed.
She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the
light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him
sweetly on the neck...
KATE (CONTD)
night, honey...
Close in on Jacks face...turned away from Kate...he
opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on
his face...
CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MENS DEPARTMENT
DISSOLVE TO:
Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annies
hand, passing through the Mens Dept., Jack lagging
behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a
beleaguered look on his face.
KATE
(back to Jack)
Were almost done here...
ANNIE
Mary Janes, Mom.
You
promised.
KATE
Thats right.
Okay,
lets make a quick stop
at the kids shoe
department, pick up my
watch from the battery
place, then Ill run into
the linen store...
An unhappy look on Jacks face.
JACK
Why dont we just go to
all the stores?!
Kate looks back at Jack.
JACK (CONTD)
Every single store in
this godforsaken shopping
mall.
We can go to them
all.
Kate gives him a look.
Then...
KATE
You know what, Jack?!
Ill go with the kids.
Why dont you just hang
out here in the mens
department... okay?
Jack glances at the Mens Dept., sighs and gives Kate a
nod.
She takes off with the kids...and then he sees
it...
...the Zegna section.
Hes drawn to the neat rows of
beautiful suits like a moth to the light...
He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit,
gently touching the soft wool.
SALESMAN (O.S.)
Its perfect for your
frame...
Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.
SALESMAN
Would you like to try it
on?
CUT TO:
Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.
It is
perfect for his frame.
The color is spectacular, the
line is dazzling.
Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else
out... its like hes seeing his old self...
KATE (O.S.)
You look amazing in that
suit...
Jack snaps out of his trance.
He sees Kate standing
behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet
away.
KATE
I mean...wow...off the
charts great.
JACK
Its an unbelievable
thing.
Wearing this suit
actually makes me feel
like a better person.
(taking one final
look)
Im gonna buy it...
Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.
KATE
$2,400?!
Are you out of
your mind?
JACK
(pointing to Annies
new Mary Janes)
She got those shoes...
KATE
Those shoes were twenty
five dollars.
Cmon,
take it off.
Well go to
the food court and get
one of those funnel cakes
you like.
Jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.
JACK
No.
Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.
KATE
No?
JACK
Do you have any idea what
my life is like?
KATE
Excuse me?
JACK
I wake up in the morning
covered in dog saliva...I
drop the kids off, spend
eight hours selling tires
retail...retail, Kate.
Kate just stands here, aghast...
JACK (CONTD)
I pick up the kids, walk
the dog, which by the
way, carries the added
bonus of carting away her
monstrous crap...I play
with the kids, take out
the garbage, get six
hours of sleep if Im
lucky, and then it starts
all over again...and why
is it that I always have
to drive everyone
everywhere?
I spend
practically my entire day
in that slow as hell
mini-van listening to
Raffi tapes and trying to
figure out how the cup
holders work...Im sick
of it.
KATE
Really.
JACK
Whats in it for me?
Where are my Mary Janes?
Kate stares at him, shaking her head...
KATE
Its sad to hear your
life is such a
disappointment to you,
Jack.
JACK
I cant believe its not
a disappointment to you!
(letting it all out)
Jesus, Kate, I couldve
been a thousand times the
man I became.
How could
you do this to me?
How
could you let me give up
on my dreams like this?!
Kate stares at him in disbelief.
Then...
KATE
Who are you?
Kates words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.
JACK
(lowering his voice)
Look, Im sorry.
Im
sorry I was such a saint
before and Im such a
prick now.
Maybe Im
just not the same guy I
was when we got
married...
KATE
Maybe youre not.
The
Jack Campbell I married
wouldnt need a $2400
suit to make himself feel
better about his life,
but if thats what its
gonna take, then buy it.
Just buy the goddamn
suit ...we can take the
money out of the kids
college fund.
They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...
JACK
Forget it...
(taking off the
jacket)
Well get a funnel cake.
Itll be the highlight of
my week...
Theres an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the
wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger
on her face...
CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING
Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh
in the back, both asleep...
JACK
(to Kate)
Listen, Im sorry about
that back in the store.
I really dont want to
fight with you...
Kate just keeps looking out the window.
JACK (CONTD)
But you must sometimes
wonder how we ended up
here.
I mean back in
college, did you see
us...
(looking around)
...here...?
She turns to him.
KATE
Ill give you this, life
has thrown us a few
surprises...
A glimmer in Jacks eye...
JACK
It really has, hasnt
it?
So if you had
to...what would you say
was the biggest surprise?
She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.
KATE
Well...Annie for one.
JACK
Surprise.
Were
pregnant...
(a laugh)
Yeah...that mustve
been...I mean that was
very unexpected.
But
what are you gonna do,
right?
KATE
I think it worked out
okay, dont you?
JACK
Sure.
I really like
Annie.
KATE
Good, Jack.
Maybe well
keep her.
JACK
No, I love Annie.
We had
a lot of good times,
didnt we?
KATE
We were young...
(a nostalgic smile)
Remember that little
place on Charles Street
we used to go to?
JACK
Charles Street?
In the
Village?
When we were
living in Greenwich
Village...?
(off her nod)
Great times.
Whyd we
ever leave?
KATE
You cant really raise a
kid in an apartment in
the Village...
Jack nods, starting to piece it together.
KATE (CONTD)
The trek out to the
hospital every day didnt
help either...
(looking at him)
You were great.
Surviving the heart
attack was one thing...
JACK
You had a heart attack?
KATE
(a laugh)
Jack, stop that. I'm
still mad at you...
(a sigh)
...who knows what
wouldve happened if you
hadnt stepped in at the
store.
JACK
Thats why I work for Big
Ed?
A look from Kate.
JACK (CONTD)
(recovering)
I mean, thats why I work
for Big Ed...
Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all
together in his mind.
JACK (CONTD)
(almost to himself)
So we had a baby, Big Ed
had a heart attack, we b
ought that house, and
Ive been working for him
ever since...Sayonara,
Wall Street.
Kate looks at him a little strangely.
JACK (CONTD)
(turning to her)
Our life in a nutshell...
KATE
If you want to look at it
that way...
JACK
How would you look at it?
She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at
Jack.
KATE
A great success story...
A smile from Jack.
He admires her outlook even if he
cant bring himself to share it.
DISSOLVE TO:
A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...
Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the
nickname The Hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt
pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball
down the lane...
Its ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the
gutter.
JACK
Damn...
ARNIE
(O.S., from behind)
Jesus, Jack, this is a
league match, for gods
sake!
Jack turns.
Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the
scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the
sport.
Jack scowls.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Wheres your follow
through?
Wheres your
stance?
JACK
Hey, Im doing the best I
can...
(under his breath)
Id like to see you hit a
squash ball after
seventeen beers...
ARNIE
Youre right.
Why am I
so competitive!?
Compensation, I guess.
Look, just focus, Jack.
You can still pick up the
spare...
Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely
concentrating...
JACK
(quietly, to
himself)
You are Jack Campbell.
Youre better than this
sport.
You shot the
rapids at Kenai.
You ran
with the bulls at
Pamplona.
You jumped out
of a plane over the
Mojave Desert, for
Christs sake.
You can
do this...
Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the
ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he
can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four
others.
JACK (CONTD)
(screaming, excited)
Yeah!!
He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care
less...
ARNIE
(to TEAMMATE)
Okay, Pete, youre up.
Jack walks out of the mens room, heading toward the
lounge.
He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a
woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a
bowling ball to a far lane.
EVELYN
Hi Jack...
A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.
Then...
JACK
Evelyn, right?
EVELYN
Very funny.
I saw you
out there on lane five.
What do you have the flu
or something?
JACK
Something like that.
EVELYN
(with a wink)
Need a nurse?
JACK
Youre a nurse?
Evelyn laughs.
EVELYN
If thats what you
want...
She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack
follows her with his eyes a moment, then...
JACK
Wait a second...
She turns.
JACK (CONTD)
Are we...?
EVELYN
Are we what, Jack?
JACK
Is there something going
on between us?
Evelyns surprised at Jacks directness.
She stands
there a beat, then walks back toward him.
EVELYN
Are we finally being
honest?
JACK
It would help me if we
were.
EVELYN
Okay, youre right, weve
been dancing around this
for years...
Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her
face.
EVELYN (CONTD)
God, my heart is racing.
Here goes...
(a smile)
When I get dressed for a
party and I know youre
going to be there...
well, lets just say I
dont go strapless
because my husband likes
it...
An intrigued smile from Jack.
EVELYN (CONTD)
Ive got six sets of snow
tires piled up in my
garage and I wont even
drive in the snow...And
our kids just happen to
be in the same ballet
class every year?
She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.
EVELYN (CONTD)
So, if youre asking me
whether Id like it to be
more, the answer is
yes...
A look of surprise from Jack.
EVELYN (CONTD)
...and Kate would never
have to know.
Jack considers this for a moment.
JACK
Do I have your number?
A wide smile from Evelyn.
EVELYN
Steves out of town with
the kids this week.
Why
dont you just stop by...
She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her
sashay back to her lane.
Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.
He heads
over to Arnie whos having a beer at the bar.
ARNIE
(looking at Jack)
Hey Jack, youre all
flush.
I guess that
seventy-one took a lot
outta you.
JACK
(sitting down)
I just saw Evelyn
Thompson.
ARNIE
She is relentless.
JACK
She wants to have an
affair with me.
ARNIE
She said that?
JACK
Pretty much.
ARNIE
Oh yeah...
(shaking his head)
What is it about you?
JACK
(pushing over a
napkin)
So could you write down
her exact address?
ARNIE
Whoa...whoa...wait a
second, Jack.
Youre not
actually gonna cheat on
Kate?
JACK
It wouldnt really be
cheating...
(off Arnies
doubtful
look)
Its complicated.
ARNIE
Look, maybe Im not as
good a consigliere as you
are but you have to trust
me on this one.
A little
flirtations harmless but
youre playing with fire
here.
The Fidelity Bank
and Trust is a tough
creditor.
You make a
deposit somewhere else,
they close your account
forever.
JACK
Im telling you, those
rules dont apply to me,
Arn.
ARNIE
(a chuckle)
Screw the rules.
Im
talking about the choice.
Jack looks at him curiously.
ARNIE (CONTD)
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons
got no class.
She
doesnt marry Dr. Steve,
the womans living in a
trailer.
JACK
Hey, is that really
necessary?
ARNIE
All Im saying it there
isnt a guy in Union
County who wouldnt give
his left nut to be
married to Kate...
Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...
ARNIE (CONTD)
Ill see ya later,
Jack...
He leaves Jack alone, thinking...
CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS
Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.
He
dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the
kitchen where...
Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over
some legal documents.
KATE
(not looking up)
How was the game, honey?
JACK
(opening the fridge)
Long, boring, and
generally pretty sad.
Arnie seemed to enjoy
it...
(peering inside)
Hey, wheres that chocolate
cake...?
Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate
cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go
into her mouth.
KATE
(with a smile)
You mean this chocolate
cake?
JACK
Thats my piece.
I was
saving it because I got
nauseated from that store
bought chicken.
Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to
the side of her mouth.
KATE
Its good...
Jack approaches the counter.
JACK
Gimme that cake.
She takes another bite.
KATE
No way.
He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out
where he cant reach it.
JACK
Cmon.
KATE
Sorry, Jack.
Its too
important to me.
They stare each other down a moment.
Then...
He tries to swipe the plate.
Kate jumps out of her
chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake,
laughing...
Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the
house... just about the catch up to her when...
She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows
her...
JACK
I want that cake!
...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down
playfully on top of him...
KATE
(laughing)
You want the cake!?
JACK
(out of breath)
I want it...
She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her
hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...
Beat.
Then, Jack starts laughing...
JACK (CONTD)
Thank you...
KATE
Its good, right?
He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her
mouth.
They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding
each other cake, laughing.
Jack leans back on the stairs.
He looks at Kates
face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and
realizes...
...he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years.
Then...
JACK
Are the kids asleep?
A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing
passionately right there on the steps...its heating
up...
KATE
(caught up in the
moment)
Say it, Jack...
JACK
What...?
KATE
Cmon, you know what I
like to hear...
JACK
(in the throes
of passion)
Yeah, baby, I know what
you like to hear...
KATE
(kissing him)
Then say it...just say it
to me...!
JACK
(swept up in the
moment)
Oh yeah, youre a bad
girl, baby... You make me
so hot...Im gonna take
you to that special
place...
Kate pulls away.
KATE
What...?
Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the
passion drain from her face...
JACK
Not it...?
KATE
Nice, Jack.
Youre
sweeping me off my feet.
JACK
What? You make me hot...
She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into
the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.
Then,
he feels something licking at his hand...
He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him,
wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an Ive
gotta go look on her face.
Jack heaves a sigh,
then...
JACK (CONTD)
Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of
us can get a little
relief tonight...
He leads the dog toward the front door...
The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a
leash, his face red from the cold outside.
He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his
coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...
He walks through the quiet house, into the living room,
rubbing his hands together to warm them up.
CHAPTER ELEVEN  HOME MOVIES
He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a
scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...
He strolls through the room, looking at some of the
family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing
on his own face in the pictures, studying the
expressions...
He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf,
marked with titles like, Trip to Yosemite, 96" and
Joshs 1st Birthday.
He runs his fingers along the
tapes, stopping at one marked, Jack Singing.
His
eyes linger there a moment...
He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...
ON TV:
Its a party for Kates birthday thrown at the Kramers
house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party,
cheesy Happy Birthday decorations.
The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...
Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail
music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...
ARNIE (O.S.)
Jesus, Bill, this thing
is an antique.
Dont you
even have image
stabilization?
Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.
BILL KRAMER
Four hundred bucks at Best
Buy, Arn.
Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his
face.
JACK
And everyone knows image
stabilization is for the
weak...
Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...
Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily
putting an arm around Jack...
ARNIE
So Jack, its your wifes
birthday, got anything to
say to her?
JACK
(to Kate)
Its your birthday?
Today?
Whats your
name?
Where were you
born?
KATE
Jack.
JACK
Wait a minute.
Youre my
wife?
She slaps him playfully on the arm...
JACK (CONTD)
I do have one thing I
wanna say...
Kate looks at him expectantly.
Then...
JACK (CONTD)
(singing to her)
Oh those fingers in my
hair, that sly come
hither stare, strips my
conscience bare, its
witchcraft...
Jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but
hes not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems
to like it, theres a twinkle in her eye...some of the
guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate.
Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...
JACK (CONTD)
...and Ive got no
defense for it, that heat
is too intense for it,
what good would common
sense for it do...
Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the
basic chords for Witchcract, sounding it out as he
goes along...
JACK (CONTD)
...Cause its
witchcraft, wicked
witchcraft...and although
I know its strictly
taboo...when you rouse
the need in me, my heart
says yes indeed in me,
proceed with what youre
leadin me to...
The camera catches the reactions of guests in the
crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up
in the romance of the moment.
Envy on the mens faces
as they watch Jack serenade his wife...
A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his
jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie
captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...
Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front
of the gathered guests...
JACK (CONTD)
Its such an ancient
pitch, but one that Id
never switch, there aint
no nicer witch than
you...
Jack watches himself move gracefully.
But its no
longer embarrassment on his face, its fascination...
Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson
watching longingly as Jack moves back toward
Kate...Evelyn cant take it anymore, she abruptly turns
and walks toward the kitchen...
Jack raises an eyebrow...
In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldnt have
a more delighted look on her face.
He picks up the
verse...
JACK (CONTD)
Cause its witchcraft,
that koo koo
witchcraft...and although
I know its strictly
taboo...
The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are
getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly,
unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words
along with Jack, almost as if hes studying him,
revering him...
Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he
underestimated his alter ego...
On the video...Jack staring into Kates eyes...
JACK (CONTD)
...when you rouse the
need in me, my heart says
yes indeed to me, proceed
with what youre leadin
me to...
Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...
JACK (CONTD)
Its such an ancient
pitch, but one that Id
never switch...
Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from
the crowd.
JACK (CONTD)
Cause theres no nicer
witch than you...
Kate brushes a hand across Jacks face...
Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the
connection, the heat between them...coveting it...
Back to the video...the music building...the crowd
completely in the palm of Jacks hand...
JACK (CONTD)
...than you...
The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music
builds to a crescendo...
JACK (CONTD)
...than you...
A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks
out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...
Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video,
the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...
Back on video...
JACK (CONTD)
(speaking quietly
to Kate)
Happy Birthday
sweetheart...I love you.
Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and
AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their
own little world...
Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile
fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...
A tear at the corner of his eye...
The SOUND fades in Jacks head as the action in the
video continues...
Hes left standing there...silent, still...
DISSOLVE TO:
Lucy licking Jacks face.
Jack pushes the dog
away...as...
The ALARM RINGS.
Kate pushes the button to stop it.
KATE
(groggy)
Time to get up, honey...
Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed,
putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still
practically half-asleep.
Jack walks into the kitchen.
He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the
fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and
heads upstairs.
...into Joshs room.
Josh is wide awake, standing up
in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.
Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily,
and then walks out of the room...
CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on
the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide
smile on her face.
Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.
He looks
behind, as if to ask whether its for him, then back to
Kate.
KATE
Happy Anniversary,
honey...
Terror on Jacks face.
KATE (CONTD)
(pushing the gift
forward)
Before you do whatever
crazy stunt youve got
planned I want you to
open mine...
Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.
JACK
Maybe I should wait...
KATE
No, open it...
He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package,
revealing...
...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna
suit...
KATE (CONTD)
I found it at an outlet
store.
I know its a
knock-off, but I think
itll look great on
you...
JACK
(examining the label)
Zeena...
Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, its a ZEENA, but
this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done
for him...
JACK (CONTD)
(tearing up)
You really are
incredible...
KATE
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Jack looks at Kates expectant face, suddenly
remembering how truly screwed he is.
JACK
Youre probably expecting
something from me...
Hes sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical
look on her face...
JACK (CONTD)
Heres the thing.
I
really hadnt planned on
giving you your...uh...
anniversary gift until
tonight.
(an uncomfortable
smile)
You know, anniversarys
good all day...
KATE
What are you talking
about?
You never wait
all day.
You can barely
wait until its light
out.
JACK
I know that, but...
Beat.
Kate looks at him like shes looking into his
soul.
KATE
You forgot.
Jack stands there, silent.
KATE (CONTD)
You actually forgot our
anniversary.
JACK
Ill fix it.
Ill go out
right now and get you
something.
Ill make it
right.
That didnt help.
KATE
(holding back
the tears)
Jesus, Jack...Is this
where we are now?
Is
this our marriage?
Suddenly Im the wife who
has to drop hints two
weeks before her
anniversary so her
husband doesnt fuck it
up?
Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on
his...
JACK
Please dont cry...
Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.
KATE
(shaking her head,
crying)
I dont want to be that,
Jack...
Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes
it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...
Jack is left standing alone, holding Kates gift...
CUT TO:
Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch
for some air...
He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
pity on his face.
He notices Annies bike leaning against the side of the
porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its
handle bar.
He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle
RING ...he looks around, as if hes expecting someone
to appear ...but theres no one.
He RINGS the bell
again, louder this time, really trying to attract
someones attention.
JACK
Cmon...cmon...
Nothing.
Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air,
RINGING the bell with everything hes got...
JACK (CONTD)
(shouting to the
sky)
Cmon, goddamnit, how was
I supposed to know the
date of their
anniversary!?
I never
married her!
Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.
ANNIE
(slowly)
Put the bicycle back on
the ground...
Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.
Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.
Annie, arms
folded, is waiting expectantly.
He finishes, sliding
the glass to her.
She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate
milk mustache on her lip.
ANNIE
Not bad...I shoulda
warned you.
Dad always
does something really
special for their
anniversary.
JACK
Like what?
ANNIE
One year he had a solar
system named after her...
JACK
Dont you think thats a
little gimmicky?
ANNIE
Mom liked it.
Jack raises an eyebrow.
JACK
Maybe theres a jewelry
store back at the mall.
I could get her a pair of
earrings or something.
ANNIE
Thats good but...you did
forget the anniversary.
JACK
Right.
Thats a major
oversight...
(thinking aloud)
So if Im Kate...I cant
really afford the finer
things, my husbands
career is a crushing
disappointment to me,
Im trapped in suburbia...
Then...
JACK (CONTD)
Did he ever take her to
the City?
Annie smiles, impressed.
ANNIE
Youre really gettin the
hang of this.
Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jacks face.
For the first time, he seems like a man in control.
Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get
dressed.
Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet
carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy
little black one.
Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.
KATE
Which do you think?
Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very
seriously...
ANNIE
The black one...
Kate nods.
Shes about to put it on when she looks at
Annie...
KATE
Fightings a part of it,
Annie.
You know that,
right?
ANNIE
Im not worried, Mom.
Hes still learning our
ways...
Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.
Its true.
She puts down the dress and holds out a
hand to Annie.
KATE
Cmere.
Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a
lipstick...
ANNIE
(excited)
Really?
Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annies
lips.
KATE
Now go like this...
Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do
it.
Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her 
Annies beaming.
KATE (CONTD)
Youre gonna break a lot
of hearts, you know.
A smile from Annie...
Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door,
watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...
79
OMITTED
Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.
Its not a
Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.
He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate
restaurant...
He helps her off with her coat.
Kates wearing the
sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its
effectiveness...
JACK
You look beautiful...
A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.
Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...
JACK (CONTD)
(instinctively)
Thanks, Catherine...
Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives
him a pat on the back...
KATE
You okay?
He takes Kate by the arm...
JACK
Fine...
He leads her to the main room.
She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French
country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...
KATE
(quietly to Jack)
Jack...can we afford all
this?
JACK
Whats the difference?
Im taking my baby out
for our anniversary, damn
the costs...
KATE
How do you even know
about this place?
Jacks caught for a moment.
Then...
JACK
Arnie...
(insistent)
Arnie.
Hell throw you a
curve ball once in a
while, thats for sure...
Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the
cheek...
Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER
standing next to them.
Jacks not even looking at the menu.
JACK
Well have the tureen of
quail breast with
shiitake mushrooms to
start, then the veal
medallions in raspberry
truffle sauce and the sea
scallops with pureed
artichoke hearts...sea
scallops, North of the
Caspian...
Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on
her face.
WAITER
Very good, sir.
And may
I say those are all
excellent selections.
JACK
You may...
(perusing the
wine list)
Also, well have a bottle
of Lafite, 1982.
Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading
it upside down.
KATE
Its five hundred and
fifty dollars, Jack!
A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost
perfect.
JACK
Just a glass of red wine
for each of us...
The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...
KATE
You are so not off the
hook yet, slick.
JACK
But Im gettin close, right?
A noncommittal nod from Kate.
Then Jack notices her
look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.
JACK (CONTD)
You want to dance?
A puzzled look from Kate.
Theres nobody else
dancing.
There isnt even much room to dance...
KATE
I dont think theres
dancing here, Jack.
Jack gets up and holds out a hand.
JACK
Sure there is...
Kate looks around again, then she smiles.
Kate rises, taking his hand.
Jack takes her in his
arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space,
confident and self-assured.
The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role
in this romantic moment.
Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.
They look good together...in sync with each other...
People are watching them...some of the men are
impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are
clearly charmed...
KATE
(whispering to
Jack)
Pretty good for a tire
salesman from Jersey...
Jack flashes her his most charming smile.
JACK
I have my moments...
They continue to dance, in a world of their own...
Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.
Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.
She takes a bite.
KATE
Mmmm...
(spearing a scallop)
...here, try one of
these...
Jack takes a scallop from Kates fork.
JACK
(savoring the scallop)
God I missed that
taste...
Kate laughs.
JACK (CONTD)
Why are you laughing?
Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.
Jack looks back
at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his
fork.
JACK (CONTD)
I need to tell you
something.
KATE
Okay...
JACK
I think it may help us
but theres a slight
chance it could make
things worse.
She hears the seriousness in his voice.
KATE
Now Im worried...just
say it.
Whatever it is
well deal with it.
JACK
Are you sure?
She nods.
Jack searches his mind for the right words.
Then...
JACK (CONTD)
I feel like Im living
someone elses life...
Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.
But she just
nods reassuringly.
He continues...
JACK (CONTD)
I used to be so sure
about everything, you
know?
I knew exactly who
I was and what I wanted.
Then one morning I woke
up and suddenly it was
all different...
KATE
Worse, you mean...
JACK
No.
Well, maybe a few
things.
But mostly just
different...
Jack lets out a small smile.
Now hes the one whos
reassuring Kate.
JACK (CONTD)
I never used to be like
this, Kate.
I had it all
figured out.
No doubts,
no regrets.
KATE
And now...?
JACK
Now...I dont...
He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost
desperate for understanding.
KATE
Me neither.
A raised eyebrow from Jack.
KATE (CONTD)
I think its good to be a
little unsure about who
you are.
Its very
human.
JACK
But you always seem so
certain.
KATE
Cmon, Jack, you think
there arent mornings
when I wake up and wonder
what the hell Im doing
in New Jersey...
JACK
Thats a big one for me,
too.
KATE
My office is a dump, I
answer my own phone...and
youve seen my pay check.
JACK
Your pay check is a
disgrace to pay checks.
KATE
I mean yes, I help people
that need it...
JACK
I guess...some of them
are probably faking.
KATE
(a laugh, then...)
God, sometimes I think it
would be so nice not to
have to stretch ground
beef or maybe drive a car
with a CD player...
He smiles, right there with her.
KATE (CONTD)
Imagine having a life
where everything was
easy...where you asked
for things and people
just brought them to
you...
JACK
Its wonderful...
Kate laughs, nodding.
A pause, then...
KATE
I think about it, too,
Jack.
I do.
I think
about the kind of person
Id be if I hadnt
married you...
Its as if shes inside his head.
They stay like this
for a moment, looking into each other.
JACK
And...?
She stops a moment, considering.
Then...
KATE
And I realize Ive just
erased the things in my
life Im most sure
about.
You, the kids...
Jack nods.
JACK
Good things...
KATE
What are you sure about?
Jack looks into Kates eyes.
JACK
Im sure that right now
theres nowhere Id
rather be than here with
you...
Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.
Its been
a while.
CUT TO:
The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms,
enters...
Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique
furniture...its like walking into another world...
KATE
This is so beautiful...
Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a
silver ice bucket...
KATE (CONTD)
You know champagne makes
me do crazy things.
JACK
(pouring)
Ill just full yours up
to the top.
(handing her a
glass)
Happy anniversary,
sweetheart.
Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jacks.
KATE
I dont know how you did
it, hoss, but you pulled
it off.
JACK
Im out of the doghouse?
KATE
Way out...
Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.
Jack follows
her...
KATE (CONTD)
(turning to him)
You may even get lucky
tonight...
Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see
the powerful effect it has on him.
Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost
in her.
JACK
Youre so...beautiful...
KATE
I already told you you
were gonna get lucky,
Jack...
They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.
Then...
Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...
JACK
My god, all this time...I
never stopped loving
you...
KATE
(a wide smile)
Thats all I wanted to
hear...
She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands
caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches
behind her to the light.
The room goes dark...
DISSOLVE TO:
Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...
Kate, in Jacks arms, her head on his chest, a
contented smile on her face...
Jacks eyes open...adjust to the light.
He looks over
at Kate.
Theres something different in his eyes...something
deeper.
Jack smiles...a broad, Im in love kind of
smile.
Kate stirs, gently stroking Jacks chest.
KATE
Mmmm...Jack...
Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.
KATE (CONTD)
I feel like I should give
you money...
Jack laughs.
KATE (CONTD)
I mean, my god, Jack you
were always good but
this...this was... like a
porno movie.
Kate lays her head back on Jacks chest, looking at
Washington Square through the window.
KATE (CONTD)
I could stay here
forever...
JACK
I dont think Id fight
you on that one...
Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.
They
kiss.
Annie walking through the downstairs of the house,
practicing her violin...its a noise bordering on
MUSIC, but not quite...
She walks into the kitchen where...
Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the
Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.
He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she
strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he
goes back to his paper.
Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
sleeve oxford...
...but hes still focused on Lassiter through the
window, cant take his eyes off him...
He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two
blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach
Lassiter...
...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the
phone...
But cant bring himself to hit the blinking light.
Then...
JACK
(to Estelle, into
intercom)
Tell Kate Ill call her
back...
INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE
ESTELLE
(into intercom)
It sounded pretty
important.
JACK
(into intercom)
Im with a customer.
Ill call her back.
He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back
outside the store...
CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER
Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his
cluttered, cramped office.
JACK
...truth is, Mintz was so
busy timing his wifes
breathing he didnt see
that MedTech needed
Global more than the
other way around.
Ten
days, two weeks tops,
they wouldve approached
you with an offer, and
Id bet anything it
wouldve been thirty
billion, not twenty
nine...
(a knowing smile)
Problem was, Peter, you
had a pussycat running
the show. What you needed
was a rottweiler.
Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack,
an intrigued look on his face...
LASSITER
(nodding)
Well, Im impressed.
A smile from Jack.
LASSITER (CONTD)
I really am...
Jack savors the moment, until...
LASSITER (CONTD)
So, about my car...
Hes jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...
JACK
Sure. Were going to
have to special order
that tire. Itll be
ready in about two days.
Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his
wallet.
LASSITER
This has my office address
on it...
(thinking, then...)
Why dont you drop it off
yourself?
A smile from Jack.
CUT TO:
Kate, sound asleep in bed...
Pan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in
thought...
Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk,
distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the
GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.
HECTOR
...I say to her, Margarita,
we already have four kids,
why do we need more?
Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he
eyes the door...
HECTOR (CONTD)
But she say she want an
even number. I say four
is an even number! But
she say she want six.
Jack checks his watch...
HECTOR (CONTD)
I tell her, Margarita, I
just got my green card,
I like to sit back and
rest a little bit...
JACK
(interrupting)
Hector...do I usually
listen to your personal
problems?
HECTOR
Sure, Jack, all the time...
Jack nods, then...
JACK
Look, I have some business
that I have to take care
of in the city so Im
leaving early...
(getting up)
My advice to you...follow
your dreams.
CUT TO:
Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the
SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes
crazy...
Jack and Lassiter walk together...
LASSITER
...were really more of a
boutique operation, as
you can see...
JACK
But youre not interested
in boutique dollars...
(a smile)
I get it...
They walk into...
Past the assistants desk...
MINTZS ASSISTANT
(seeing Lassiter)
Hes expecting you, Mr.
Lassiter...
Lassiter doesnt even slow down...
Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from
the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a
play pen where the bar used to be.
Jack enters,
immediately struck by the difference...
LASSITER
(to Mintz)
Alan, this is Jack
Campbell...the one I was
telling you about...
Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the
desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.
ALAN
Jack, of course.
They shake hands.
JACK
(appropriately
deferential)
Mr. Mintz.
ALAN
Please, call me Alan. We
try to cultivate a casual
atmosphere around here...
JACK
(re: play pen)
I can see that, Alan.
A chuckle from Mintz.
ALAN
You have kids, Jack?
JACK
(hesitating, then...)
Uh...actually, yes. Two...
good ones.
Another laugh from Mintz.
ALAN
Thats great...
(gesturing to
the sofa)
Why dont you have a seat?
Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and
Lassiter take the chairs.
ALAN (CONTD)
So, Peter mentioned that
you were an avid CNBC
watcher but didnt say
whether you had any
actual Wall Street
experience?
Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not
realizing he was walking into an interview...
He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.
JACK
I was a sales associate,
at E.F. Hutton.
ALAN
A broker? Really. And now
youre in the tire
business?
JACK
Thats right. And auto
supply...
ALAN
Uh huh. The retail end, I
understand.
Jack nods...
JACK
Uh...we actually get about
sixty percent of our
business from automotive
service.
ALAN
Mind if I ask what kind of
sales you did last year?
Ballpark...
JACK
We did one point seven
million in total revenue...
ALAN
Uh huh...one point seven.
And what do you project for
this year?
Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing
questions, the smirk on Mintzs face...
ALAN (CONTD)
Any thoughts at all on
that?
As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent
of his handicap...
ALAN (CONTD)
Jack?
He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter
then ...a confident smile.
JACK
Well, Alan, I think were
gonna have a banner year.
Sales are up almost
twenty percent in the
first quarter and we just
landed a major trucking
company account.
ALAN
Really. So youre
projecting what, a tad
over two million?
A gleam in Jacks eye.
JACK
Thats right. And that
would make us number one
in our market...
(getting up)
You mind if I stand?
A raised eyebrow from Mintz.
Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he
crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of
water...
JACK (CONTD)
Look, I know our paltry
little two million in
sales is about what you
spend on office supplies
in a year.
And I know
some regional trucking
company account is
nothing compared to a
sixty billion dollar
merger...
ALAN
Im not trying to knock
the tire business, Jack.
JACK
(a confident chuckle)
Its okay, Alan. I get it.
Im in your shoes, Im
thinking exactly the same
thing...but heres the
thing. Business is
business.
Wall Street,
Main Street, its all
just a bunch of people
getting up in the morning,
trying to figure out how
the hell theyre gonna
send their kids to
college.
Its just
people...
Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter
appears intrigued...
JACK (CONTD)
And I know people.
ALAN
Im sure you do...
LASSITER
(intervening)
Lets let the man have
his say...
Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...
JACK
(to Mintz)
Take you, for instance...
ALAN
(defensive)
What about me?
JACK
You drink about sixteen
Diet Cokes a day. Youre
an excellent father, but
you feel guilty about the
time you spend away from
home. You drink bourbon,
but you offer your
clients scotch...
Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.
JACK (CONTD)
And your wife decorated
this office...
A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a
caught look on his face.
LASSITER
He certainly has your
number, Alan.
JACK
(turning to Lassiter)
Youre a little tougher,
Peter.
A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game...
JACK (CONTD)
For one thing, you like
expensive things.
LASSITER
(smiling proudly)
Thats easy. Youve seen
my car.
JACK
(a chuckle)
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de
Monterreys. Youre a
scotch man, single malt,
not because its trendy
but because youve been
doing it for forty years,
and you stay with what
works. You have two great
loves in your life, your
horses and this company.
You wept openly the day
the Dow hit ten thousand...
Lassiters impressed.
JACK (CONTD)
And youre a man who
prides himself on finding
talent in unusual
places...
LASSITER
Oh? And how would you
know that?
Jack smiles.
JACK
Because Im here.
On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on
smile.
JACK (CONTD)
Im prepared to do
anything it takes to get
this job. Start anywhere
you need me to start.
Ill park cars if I
to...
(into Lassiters
eyes)
The biggest part of
judging character is
knowing yourself. And I
know this, I can do this
job. Give me a chance,
Peter, I wont let you
down.
Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a
moment, he turns to Mintz.
LASSITER
(to Mintz)
Alan, why dont you show
Jack around a bit...
ALAN
Id love to.
CUT TO:
Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway...
EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving
back...
ALAN
(pointing)
...thats our war room.
We did seven major deals
last year, three of them
hostile.
JACK
(not particularly
impressed)
Seven.
Really.
They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of
the corridor.
Mintz stops, turning to Jack.
Jack returns Mintzs
gaze with a quizzical look.
ALAN
Lets cut the shit, huh
Campbell? What, did you go
through his wallet or
something?
Jacks a little taken aback.
ALAN (CONTD)
No matter. That circus
act back there may have
dazzled Lassiter
momentarily but it
doesnt do shit forme.
Even if you get this job,
which I highly doubt, let
me warn you, Lassiter
loses interest in his pet
projects very quickly.
Im in the big office
because Ive proved
myself to him year after
year and nobody is going
to come in here and start
turning the old mans
head. Especially not some
tire salesman from New
Jersey. So you watch
yourself and stay away
from Lassiter, and maybe,
just maybe, Ill keep you
on after he gets tired of
you. Do we understand
each other?
Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent,
expressionless.
ALAN (CONTD)
Do we?!
Then, a broad smile from Jack.
JACK
God, you really are
different, arent you...
(nodding)
I mean...wow...I am
impressed.
Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.
JACK (CONTD)
Good for you. Why shouldnt
you protect whats yours.
ALAN
I dont think youre hearing
me.
JACK
Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.
Thats not the problem.
The problem is that what
you think is yours, is
really mine.
And I dont
care how low on the totem
pole I start, I will get
it back...
(poking him in
the chest)
So do yourself a favor and
dont get too attached to
that view because sometime
soon, maybe very soon, you
and your French country
antiques, your chintz sofa,
and your little play pen
are gonna be moving out of
that office.
Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...
JACK (CONTD)
Oh, and by the way, you
try selling tires for a
living.
I promise you,
youd starve.
Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune,
leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?
CUT TO:
A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge
duplex.
Kate looks around, taking the place in.
JACK
Welcome to Xanadu...
The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural
lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
its striking but not at all homey like the Jersey
house.
JACK (CONTD)
Pretty incredible, isnt
it?
KATE
Its like a museum.
Jack nods.
KATE (CONTD)
(turning to Jack)
So whats the big
surprise? You didnt
rent this place for
the weekend, did you?
JACK
Think bigger.
KATE
For the week?
Jack chuckles.
JACK
This place is a perk,
Kate.
KATE
A perk for what?
JACK
A company called P.K.
Lassiter and Associates
Investment House uses it
to attract new
executives...
Kates confused.
JACK (CONTD)
Youre talking to their
new Vice President of
Mergers and Acquisitions.
KATE
What are you talking
about, Jack?
JACK
Im going into arbitrage,
honey.
Turns out I have
a knack for it.
Ill be
making two hundred grand
a year plus a hefty bonus
and thats just to
start.
And, we can live
in this apartment
practically rent free for
as long as we want.
Jack measures her reaction. Its not good...
JACK (CONTD)
We can finally afford to
move back into the city.
In style.
Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...
KATE
Are you out of your mind?
JACK
I dont think so. This
is going to be a better
life for all of us,
honey.
Well put Annie
and Josh in private
schools...
KATE
Annie goes to a great
school.
JACK
Im talking about the
best schools in the
country here, Kate...
KATE
Jack, what could you
possibly be thinking?
What about my job?
JACK
This is New York City,
its like the needy
people capital of the
world.
Those Jersey
clients of yours arent a
tenth as pathetic as the
ones you could get
here...
KATE
(cutting him off)
I cant believe you want
to move back into the
city.
I thought the
reason we left was
because we didnt want to
raise the kids here?
JACK
No, this is the center of
the universe.
If I were
living in Roman times, I
would live in Rome, where
else?
Today, America is
the Roman Empire and New
York is Rome itself.
John Lennon.
KATE
(cutting him off)
Jack.
Jacks starting to struggle...
JACK
Look, Im detecting a
kind of funky tension
here...We dont have to
live in this apartment.
I dont need this...Ill
commute...Ill drive to
work...
Jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked
apart...
KATE
In traffic?
Its over an
hour each way?
Thats
almost three hours a
day.
When are you going
to see the kids?
Hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather
himself. Then...
JACK
Kate. Youre not
understanding me. Im
talking about a great
life.
A perfect life.
Everything we pictured
when we were young. The
whole package. You said
it yourself, life has
thrown us surprises, and
so we made sacrifices.
But now I can finally get
us back on track...
A sad chuckle from Kate.
JACK (CONTD)
I can do that.
I want to
do that.
For all of us.
I need to do that as a
man...
(imploring her)
Think about it.
No more
lousy restaurants, no
more clipping coupons, no
more shoveling snow...
KATE
Then get a goddamn snow
blower!
Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.
KATE (CONTD)
Dont get a new career
without even telling me.
Dont take Annie out of a
school she loves.
Dont
move us out of a house
weve become a family
in...
Kate stands there, wounded...
KATE (CONTD)
(quietly)
Dont do that...
JACK
Look, youre making this
into something its not.
This isnt a referendum
on our lives, Kate. Its
a step forward...
(appealing to her)
Dont you see?
Im
talking about us finally
having a life other
people envy.
Silence.
Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing
look...
KATE
They already do envy us,
Jack...
Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.
102
OMITTED
Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack
walks in.
Its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed
notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.
JACK
Very nice. What is it?
ANNIE
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
JACK
Ah. A classic...
Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the
dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and
down its sides...
Jack studies them...in every one Jacks face is totally
contented.
Jack studies them, looking at his own face.
Annie lowers the bow, watching him...
Jack turns to her.
JACK (CONTD)
Please dont stop...
She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.
He turns back
to the pictures...
Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.
He looks at Lassiters business card, sitting on the
surface of the desk...
He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a
bookshelf...a book...
He moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a
tattered copy of Vonneguts Cats Cradle.
He pulls
it off the shelf, theres something inside...a
bookmark...
...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...
...inside...a boarding pass...From: London/Heathrow,
To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.
He looks at it...somethings not right...
JACK
From London to New York...?
(looking up)
I came back...
Then...a NOISE...
Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway,
standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am
ticket sleeve.
KATE
Our finest moment,
right...
A quizzical look from Jack.
KATE (CONTD)
When you got on that
plane I was sure it was
over.
I left the airport
afraid Id never see you
again.
And then you
showed up the very next
day...
(a wistful smile)
That was a good
surprise...
She continues into the room, leaning against a
bookshelf.
KATE (CONTD)
I think about you on that
plane, about what must
have been going through
your mind...you sitting
there imagining our life
together, our life
apart...I think about the
decision you made...
Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.
KATE (CONTD)
Maybe I was being naive
but I believed wed grow
old together in this
house.
That wed spend
holidays here, have g
randchildren visit us
here.
I had this image
of us all grey and
wrinkly, me working in
the garden, you
repainting the deck...
Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.
KATE (CONTD)
Things change, right?
People change...
(pausing)
If you need this, Jack, I
mean really need this, I
will take these children
from a life they love,
and take myself from the
only home weve ever
shared, and move wherever
you need to go.
Ill do
that because I love
you...
The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...
KATE (CONTD)
I love you, Jack. And
thats more important to
me than our address...
Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him,
kisses him gently on the forehead.
KATE (CONTD)
I choose us.
She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there,
the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at
her as she goes...
Jack walks into the room...
The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.
He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.
Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next
to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around
her, drawing her in...
In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jacks embrace.
He
savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...
They lay there...side by side...together...a single
person.
DISSOLVE TO:
The morning light streams into the room.
Kate opens
her eyes.
Jacks not in bed.
A look of curiosity.
Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.
She goes over to the window...opens the blinds...
revealing...
Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the
snow with Annie and Josh.
Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her
face...
Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around
until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees
its empty...
And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL
RINGING, echoing through the room.
A shudder passes through his body...
He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door,
sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.
Its an eerie moment for Jack...
JACK
What are you doing?
ANNIE
(a curious look)
Ringing my bell...
On Jacks anxious face...
109
OMITTED
CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE
On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local
convenience store...checking out the bags of rock
salt...
He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...
JACK
Four ninety nine?! Its just
salt for gods sake...
On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG
GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...
She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package
of gum...
From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach
the counter...
On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of
salt from the shelf, when...
CASH (O.S.)
Thatll be sixty five cents,
little angel...
Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking
over to the front counter...where he sees...
Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store
uniform, ringing up the teenager...
An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...
JACK
You...!
Then...the color drains from Jacks face...
JACK (CONTD)
What are you doing here...
Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...
JACK (CONTD)
Youre not sending me
back...
The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar
bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter
to Cash...
CASH
Jack, its good to see
you...
Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for
ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...
CASH (CONTD)
(to the girl)
Thank you darlin...
The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has
given her the wrong change...
CASH (CONTD)
(back to Jack,
seeing the
rock salt)
What do you got there,
rock salt?
Look at you,
all domestic and shit...
You really figured some
things out, huh?
The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...
JACK
Im not going back...
The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...
CASH
(to the girl)
Everything okay...?
She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...
TEENAGE GIRL
Yeah...fine.
JACK
(raising his voice)
Hey! Did you hear me...?!
Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to
the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...
A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches
into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...
Cash looks at Jack.
CASH
(making a note
in his book)
That was a character issue...
(shaking his head)
...and for nine dollars?
Thats just sad...
JACK
Hey, Im talking to you!
I am not going back, do you
understand...?!
Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.
JACK (CONTD)
You cant do this. You
cant keep coming in and
out of peoples lives,
messing things up...
CASH
Cmon, Jack...
Jack throws six bucks on the counter...
JACK
Ive got kids, Im going
home...
CASH
You know what the word
glimpse means, J? Its
by nature an impermanent
thing.
Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and
turns at the door...
JACK
(pointing at
Cash)
Im staying.
Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs
face as Jack leaves...
Jack walks to Josh.
Hes sleeping soundly.
Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to
wake him.
Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.
ANNIE
(stirring, groggy)
Is it morning yet?
JACK
No, honey. Go back to
sleep.
She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment
looking at her, sadness all over his face.
JACK (CONTD)
Take care of yourself,
Annie.
Im going back to
the mother ship...
Finally, he turns to go...
The clock reads, 11:17.
Kate is already in bed as
Jack walks in.
KATE
(looking up from
her book)
Hey...
Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...
JACK
These last weeks, Kate, I
know that Ive done
some...some unusual
things.
Kate nods.
KATE
Its been interesting,
thats for sure.
JACK
But Ive done some good
things too, havent I?
KATE
Youve been Jack
Campbell.
And thats
always a good thing...
She kisses him on the cheek.
He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the
eyes.
JACK
I need you to remember
me, Kate.
How I am right
now, right this very
moment.
I need you to
put that image in your
heart and keep it with
you, no matter what
happens.
KATE
Are you okay, Jack?
JACK
Please, just promise me
youll do that. You have
to promise, Kate.
Because if you dont,
then its like it never
happened and I dont
think I could live with
that.
Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love
with him.
KATE
I promise, Jack...
JACK
Promise me again...
KATE
I promise. Come to bed,
honey.
Jack stands up, heading toward the door.
JACK
Soon...
The room is dark...
Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.
He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad
look in his eyes...
As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own
eyelids appear to grow heavy...
He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
focusing on her...but its no use...
Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep
sleep...
CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE
DISSOLVE TO:
A PHONE RINGING
Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto
his face ...he stirs...
THE PHONE STILL RINGING...
Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one
there.
Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment...
his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...
Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not
wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...
JACK
(groggy, dazed)
Yeah...okay, send her
up...
He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes
stay closed for another moment...then...
His eyes open...
He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his
old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.
JACK (CONTD)
(sadly)
Damnit.
Jack looks at the clock, 9:23 a.m.
He gets out of
bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves
the room...
...Jack walks to the door just as...
The doorbell RINGS.
He stops, then cautiously opens
the door, seeing...
PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her
face.
PAULA
Waiting for me by the door,
huh?
Jack looks at her.
JACK
Paula...
Paula opens her coat  the only thing she has on
underneath is a sexy little teddy.
JACK (CONTD)
(momentarily
distracted)
Thats totally see through...
PAULA
(smiling)
Merry Christmas...
JACK
(confused)
Christmas?
It cant be
Christmas...
Jack stares at her, totally confused...
PAULA
(lasciviously)
Its whatever you want it
to be, Jack...
Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a
shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically
running down the corridor.
PAULA (CONTD)
Jack?...Jack!
CUT TO:
Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.
A curious look on Jacks face, its been a while since
hes heard that sound.
JACK
(answering phone)
Hello?
ADELLE (O.S.)
Hey Santa, where are you?
Everybodys here.
JACK
Adelle?
ADELLE (O.S.)
You were supposed to be here
half an hour ago...the
emergency strategy session?
Your trip to Aspen? Theyre
all panicked here...
Silence from Jack...
ADELLE (CONTD, O.S.)
Jack...? Are you going through
the tunnel?
Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.
JACK
Ill be there in twenty
minutes...
CUT TO:
Its a beehive of activity...
Jacks TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow
charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...
Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking
a moment to observe the action...
Mintz spots him...
ALAN
(into phone)
Thank god, Jacks here. Ill
call you right back...
He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to
Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.
ALAN (CONTD)
(approaching)
Jack, are you okay?
JACK
(in a daze)
Whats going on here?
ALAN
Its not good.
Bob Thomas
has secretly been talking to
a European drug company.
Were not sure which one,
Julias on it right now.
Word is theyre willing to
let him buy a minority stake
and keep running the entire
company.
The Global people
are up in arms.
They say
we shouldve been prepared
for this.
Were in trouble
here, Jack...
Jack looks at Alan for a minute.
JACK
You know something, Alan.
Theres a much more assertive
person somewhere inside of
you...
Alan looks at him, confused.
ALAN
Excuse me?
JACK
But I think I like you better
this way...
ALAN
Is this another one of those
Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
A sad laugh from Jack.
JACK
No.
ALAN
So what are we gonna do,
Jack?
Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...
ALAN (CONTD)
Jack...?
Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of
the group...
JACK
Ill tell you exactly what
were going to do.
Youre
going to do whatever you
have to do to find out which
European company hes been
talking to.
Then Im going
to clean myself up, fly to
Aspen, and drink egg nog
with Bob Thomas.
His wife
and kids will be playing in
the background while I spend
Christmas day convincing him
that the European company is
the devil and Global is the
answer to his prayers, after
all...
(growing wistful)
Then Im going to spend four
hours skiing. Alone. On
Christmas day. Completely
and utterly alone. Im going
to do that because that is
my life, that is whats
real, and there is nothing
I can do to change that...
Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his
team.
Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out
the window, watching the buildings pass by...
He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it
up...
JACK
(dialing 411)
For Manhattan...Kate
Reynolds...I need an address
too...
Jack jots something down on a business card.
Then he
hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the
window, then turns to the driver...
JACK (CONTD)
Make a right here...
DRIVER
But the airports the other
way...
JACK
Were not going to the
airport...
CUT TO:
Jack stands outside an apartment door.
He hears The
Clashs London Calling BLARING from inside.
He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets
lower...
Kates assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack
exchanges a curious look with her.
LORI
Are you from the shipping
company?
JACK
Im Jack Campbell...Im an
old... friend of Kates.
I just called.
The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...
LORI (O.S.)
Kate! Some guys here!
Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...
KATE (O.S)
(to Lori)
Did you call the airline
like I asked?!
Jacks eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans
and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the
same.
JACK
Kate...
KATE
Jack...God, its been so
long...You look...
She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.
JACK
You look great.
KATE
Its good to see you...
She looks at him another moment, then turns...
KATE (CONTD)
(yelling inside)
Lori! Wheres that box?!
Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.
...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes,
sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor,
SHATTERING it...
JACK
(bending down)
I'm sorry...
KATE
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity  Lori on the
phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing
up...
JACK
Whats going on?
KATE
(searching around)
Im moving to Paris...it was
right here...
(to Lori)
Its a box marked Jack.
I
put it in the stack for the
Salvation Army...
JACK
Paris?
LORI
(to Kate, with
attitude)
Do you want me to look for
the box or call the airline?
KATE
Hey, kind of under a little
pressure here.
LORI
Hey, kind of giving up
Christmas day for my ex-boss
here.
Jack watches this back and forth.
KATE
You didnt seem to mind
offering to help me on
Christmas day when you were
unwrapping that Prada bag
I gave you.
LORI
Maybe its by the wardrobe
boxes...
Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.
JACK
Youre moving...
KATE
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm
has an office there and
Im going to be heading
it up.
JACK
(stunned)
To Paris. Paris, France.
KATE
(searching the
boxes)
Thats the one...
JACK
So youre not at a non-
profit firm?
KATE
(a chuckle)
Not with what they pay me...
JACK
Youre not married, are
you?
KATE
No, Jack, I never got
married. You?
JACK
Not exactly...
(looking around)
Can we just take a minute
here?
Maybe get a cup of
coffee or something...?
LORI
(yelling)
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
KATE
Yes!
A relieved smile from Jack...
KATE (CONTD)
I found it!
LORI
Congratulations. The La
Guardia flights canceled
but I got you out of
Kennedy on United at nine.
Am I good or what?
Jacks smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box
marked, Jack...
KATE
Here you go.
Its just
some old things of yours...
Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...
JACK
Do you ever think about us,
Kate?
About what might
have happened...?
A bemused LAUGH from Kate.
Then she sees hes not
laughing...
KATE
Youre serious...
A nod from Jack...
KATE (CONTD)
Ill tell you what, Jack,
if youre ever in Paris,
look me up. Maybe well
go for that cup of coffee.
One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...
Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that
this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years
ago, or left yesterday.
JACK
Sure. Goodbye, Kate.
He leaves...
CUT TO:
A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song All Of My Love,
fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmills by his
side, goes through the box Kate gave him.
He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft
material, then a Mondale for President button, which
Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
ticket stubs...
He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale
button on the lapel.
He digs back into the box,
finding...
A messy, dog-eared copy of Cats Cradle...not the one
Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...
Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness...
then...
He looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  ONE LAST TRY
CUT TO:
Jack looking at the board. The nine oclock to Paris -
Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...
...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the
front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate
attendant.
He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some
annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.
JACK
(calling out)
Kate!
Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her
face.
JACK (CONTD)
You cant go!
KATE
Jesus, Jack...
JACK
Dont get on that plane!
KATE
Jack.
JACK
Please. Lets just go have
a cup of coffee. Thats all
Im asking for. Im sure
theres another flight to
Paris tonight.
KATE
What do you want from me?
You want me to tell you
everything that happened
was okay?
Jack just stands there, unsure...
KATE (CONTD)
Well it is. Yes, I was
heartbroken ...But I got
over it. I moved on.
People change, Jack. I
changed. I dont know
why you suddenly feel the
need to revisit that time
in our lives but I assure
you, its over...
Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing
there...
He watches her walk to the podium, realizing shes
right...
He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the
attendant...
Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...
JACK
(at Kate)
We have a house in Jersey!
Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.
KATE
Dont do this, Jack...
But he continues...
JACK
We have two kids, Annie and
Josh...
...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
interested...
JACK (CONTD)
...Annies not much of a
violin player but she
tries really hard. Shes a
little precocious but thats
only because she says whats
on her mind. And when she
smiles...
Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the
tears...
JACK (CONTD)
And Josh...he has your eyes.
He doesnt say much but we
know hes smart...
(lost in the memory)
...hes always got his eyes
open, always watching us...
sometimes you can look at
him and just know that hes
learning something new...
its like witnessing a
miracle...
Kates expression has sifted from annoyance to
curiosity.
JACK (CONTD)
...the house is a mess, but
its ours...
(chuckling)
...well, after a hundred
twenty two more payments
it will be...
Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of
the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...
JACK (CONTD)
And you...youre a non-
profit lawyer. Thats right,
completely non-profit. But
that doesnt seem to bother
you...
Kate raises an eyebrow. Its something shes thought
about.
JACK (CONTD)
And were in love. After
thirteen years of marriage
were still unbelievably
in love...
(with a chuckle)
You wont even let me touch
you until Ive said it...
Jack gets closer and closer...Kates spellbound now...
imagining the picture Jacks painting...
JACK (CONTD)
...I sing to you...not all
the time but definitely on
special occasions...
Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a
row of passengers...
JACK (CONTD)
(off hand, to passenger)
Excuse me...
(to Kate)
We made a lot of sacrifices,
dealt with our share of
surprises, but we stayed
together...
Jacks nearly there...
JACK (CONTD)
You see, youre a better
person than I am...
Not in this life, and Kate knows it...
JACK (CONTD)
...and it made me a better
person to be around you...
Kate is perfectly still, Jacks words echoing in her
ears.
JACK (CONTD)
Maybe it was all a
dream. Maybe I went to
bed one lonely night in
December and imagined it
all. But I swear,
nothings ever felt more
real to me...
Hes right in front of her. She cant take her eyes
off him.
JACK (CONTD)
And if you get on that
plane right now, itll
disappear forever.
Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little
world...airport business going on around them...
JACK (CONTD)
I know we can both go on
with our lives. And wed
both be fine. But Ive
seen what we can be like
together...And I choose
us...
Jacks words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a
hand to her arm...
JACK (CONTD)
Please, Kate, one cup of
coffee. You can always go
to Paris. Just please, not
tonight...
She stands there, frozen, staring into Jacks eyes,
searching for the answer.
KATE
Okay, Jack...
DISSOLVE TO:
Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty
airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow
falling outside.
From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over
a cup of coffee...
FADE OUT.
