  Tyrol comes out of the Tunnel and into the HUB, where several 
    different hand-dug tunnels converge.  Two other men are 
    already here, their faces barely discernible in the gloom:  
    ANDERS and TIGH.  Tyrol puts down the heavy object he s been 
    carrying:  the WIRELESS SET.      'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 2.




    There s a sharp BANG as the DOOR OPENS, and Laura looks up in 
  time to see GAIUS BALTAR ENTER the cell with a CHAIR.  He 
  sets it up in the room as the door is closed and locked 
    behind him.  


  Tyrol working on the wireless while Anders looks on. Tigh 
    lights a cigarette nearby.

                                TYROL
                You hear the Cylons cut food 
                  rations, Colonel?

  Tigh says nothing, keeps smoking.  Anders answers for him.

                                ANDERS
                We heard.  How long until the next

                  They re talking about shutting down 
                the marketplace -- saying it s a 
                   security risk.

    Anders gives Tigh a reproachful look.  Tigh shrugs it off.

                                TIGH
                  We ll shift targets.

                                TYROL
                        (shocked)
                You were going to hit the 
                  marketplace?  The market?  It s 
                  full of civilians -- this is 
                  getting crazy.  Whose side we are 
                we on?

  Tigh barely looks up, but the quiet venom in his voice is 
    nearly palpable and his words send a chill down Tyrol s back.

                                TIGH
                  Which side are we on?  We re on the 
                  side of the demons, Chief.  We re 
                  evil men in the gardens of 
                  paradise... sent by the forces of 
                  death to spread destruction and 
                  devastation wherever we go.
                        (beat)
                I m surprised you didn t know that.

  Tyrol just looks at Tigh, not sure he even knows Tigh 
    anymore.  Anders isn t entirely comfortable here either, but 
  he keeps his own counsel.  The wireless BEEPS and Tyrol 
    checks it.  Tigh pulls a sheet of paper from his pocket, 
    smooths it out.

                                TYROL

                        (hands him the paper)
                  Send it twice, just to make sure.

  Tyrol reads the message and starts TAPPING in the response, 
  using a form of CODE.


  Laura watches Baltar dully as he sits in the chair and 
    regards her with sympathy.  

                                BALTAR
                  I heard you were on the list and I

                you had not been harmed.  Here -- 

    Baltar pulls her GLASSES from his pocket and hands them to 
  her as he tries to connect with her.

                  I can help you, Laura.  I can 
                  protect you.  But you have to 
                  understand that things have changed 
                  now.  The insurgency has crossed a 
                  redline.  Suicide bombing -- it s 
                  abhorrent to everything we believe 
                in.  You and I -- we have to 
                  condemn these tactics.  They cannot 
                be legitimized in any way and the 
                  insurgency must be stopped from 
                  employing them ever again.

  She doesn t and Laura can t really bring herself to say 
    otherwise.  She opts to deflect the conversation to another 
  topic rather than engage it directly.

                You see, the Cylon is a machine.

                  emotional complexity built into the

                  cheap sentimentality which clog 
                  human decision-making are not for 
                the Cylon.  No.  They calculate 
                  where we trust.  They analyze where 
                we hope.  And their hearts only 
                  reason while ours only feel.

  That stings Caprica Six -- is this what he really thinks?

                  situation... and obey the dictates

  Kara is sitting on the couch, watching dully as Leoben sits

                  pretty -- funny -- great smile.  
                You would ve liked her.  She died 
                  during delivery, but Kacey s heart

                  I ve seen her path.  It will be

                  She ll know the mind of God in her 
                  lifetime... and she ll see the patterns 
                  that others do not.  She probably gets

                No way -- Cylons would want to keep 
                  them safe just in case they needed 
                to use one of those ships someday.  

                                HELO
                  She s right.  Keys gotta still be 
                  there somewhere.  Probably locked 
                up tight, though.

                We could make a weapons  drop to 
                the insurgents -- they know the lay 
                of the land and they ve been 
                  hitting the Cylons in the teeth for 
                  months.  Give them the tools to get 
                the keys themselves.

                                LEE 
                No way.  The only thing you ve got 
                  going for you so far is that 
                  they ve reduced their defense 
                  perimeter to just five baseships.  
                You put heavy weaponry down there, 
                the Cylons are gonna know for sure 
                  you re in contact with the 
                  population.  They ll call in ten 
                  more baseships and then your whole 
                  plan is toast.

  Kat turns a hostile eye on Lee.

    Everyone looks to Adama, who calmly keeps looking over the 
    papers on his desk as if he didn t hear that.

  He turns over the papers on the desk, but clearly things are 
  far from settled between him and Lee.

    ASSEMBLY HALL

  The pieces of the torn DIPLOMAS fluttering down after the 
    explosion...

    ASSEMBLY - DAY 

    Jammer is standing somewhere in the ranks of NCP graduates, 
    watching as his fellow NCP Officers march up to the podium to 
    accept their diplomas and a handshake from Leoben and D Anna.  
  He watches DUCK ascend the stage.  Everything is perfect...

    ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY 

  CLOSE ON Jammer s face.  The aftermath of the explosion.  
    Jammer lying face down on the Assembly Hall floor.

  He struggles to get up -- can t.  Something s pinning his 
  head down.  He tries to yell -- no sound comes out of his 
    mouth.

    ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY 

  He squirms, tries to move -- discovers that his head is being 
    pinned down by someone s LEG.  He pushes and pulls -- and the 
  leg falls away, a bloody STUMP at the end.  He recoils, 
    manages to turn over -- and discovers that he s in a PILE of 
  dead bodies, all crumpled on top on him like dolls.  Only the 
    mounting horror of the moment drives him to claw his way out 
  of the corpses and stand amid the sea of bodies and body 
  parts strewn across the Assembly Hall.

    Dualla takes a MESSAGE from a PRINTER and reads it.  Lee can

    A short time later, Lee is confronting Adama in his quarters.

                  command, that s not the issue ---

                the Cylons came.  They re the safe

                  after the attack on the Colonies. 

  Adama is taken off-stride, wasn t expecting this particular

  Kacey is SCREAMING her head off.  Kara is pacing in the 
    apartment, trying to ignore the shrieking child sitting on 
  the couch.

  But there s nothing like a crying child to pierce the 
    toughest of exteriors and drive you insane.  Kara finally 
  just walks out of the room --


  Kara ENTERS, and goes to the sink, turns on the faucet and 
    splashes water on her face, trying to drown out the SCREAMING 
  from the other room.  She looks up into the mirror.

    Suddenly -- there s a muffled THUD and the crying STOPS.  She 
    wonders about that for a moment, looks up at her reflection 
    again.

    Despite her better instincts, Kara finds herself walking 
    toward the door...


  ... and going back into the living room.  She looks around -- 
  no sign of the child.  Maybe it is really gone.  Then she 
  steps around the couch --

  KACEY

  Is lying unconscious on the floor at the foot of the concrete 
    steps.  A small POOL of BLOOD is spreading from behind 
    Kacey s head.  

                                KARA
                  Kacey...?

                                                                        FADE OUT.

                                    ACT THREE

  FADE IN:


  Kara is sitting at the side of the bed where the unconscious 
  form of Kacey lies.  The child s head is wrapped in bandages, 
  an IV hooked up to a stand.  Kara watches Kacey silently, 
    staring down at the wounded child with obvious concern.  

  The door OPENS and Leoben ENTERS, carrying two cups of 
    coffee.  He silently hands one to Kara, who takes it without 
    a thought.  Leoben sits down next to her and watches Kacey 
  with Kara Thrace... two parents keeping silent vigil...


  CALLY is sitting barefoot in the same kind of barren, 
    brightly lit cell that Laura occupied not so very long ago.  
  The door OPENS and she looks up to see BOOMER.  It s a 
    charged moment for them both -- feelings of anger, jealousy, 
    resentment, fear, and familiarity wash over them both.

                                BOOMER
                Hi, Cally.  It s me -- Boomer.

    Boomer was prepared for a reaction like that, but it stings 
    nonetheless.  She nods, moves toward the door.

                If I can help you... I will.  I

  Cally shakes her head in disgust, looks away.  Boomer EXITS.

    SECURITY CAMERA POV144144

  A B&W (MOS) image, from a high-angle, looking down on...


    A SECURITY CHECKPOINT against a large compound.  TWO Masked 
  NCP Guards are checking ID s on a few humans before they pass 
    through the checkpoint and go into the compound.  A WOMAN 
    casually walks up to the checkpoint, waves at the Guards and 
  tries to pass through.  Guard #1 waves her off, tries to stop 
  her.  Suddenly the WOMAN SHOOTS Guard #1 and bolts past the 
    checkpoint and into the compound just beyond as Guard #2 
    reacts a second too late and tries to shoot at her.  Then -- 
  AN EXPLOSION from within the compound ERUPTS and BLOTS OUT 
  the image, which goes to STATIC.  The tape REWINDS...

    A full-scale meeting is underway.  Baltar, TWO D ANNAS, TWO 
    DORALS, ONE SIMON, TWO CAVILS and THREE SIXES (including 
    Caprica Six) all watching the security tape on a monitor.  
  Cavil #1 shuts off the monitor.

                The power substation was crippled.  
                  Almost half the city is without 
                  power and our best estimates put 
                the repairs at two weeks.

                  We ve got a very serious, very 
                    straight-forward problem.  We have 
                to increase control or we will lose 
                  control.  That is a fact.  So... we 
                  think it s time to take stronger 
                  measures.

                                D ANNA #2
                We agree.

    Reaches in and takes his hand in hers... 


  The Cylons are now gone and Baltar is alone in the room with 
  only NUMBER SIX standing there in her red dress.  There s a 
    slightly surreal quality to the light in this suspended 
    moment in time.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  There s nothing you can do, Gaius.  
                  It ll be all right.

                                BALTAR
                  It s good to see you.  I ve... 
                  missed you.

                                NUMBER SIX
                        (smiles)
                  I know.

                You have to sign.  They ll kill you 
                if you don t.

                                BALTAR
                  I am not... a villain.

  She puts a hand to his face.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Sometimes even heroes have to do 
                  things they hate... so they can 
                  survive to fight again another 
                  day...

  She guides his hand to sign the warrant.

                                BALTAR
                  Don t leave me again...

                                NUMBER SIX 
                I m always here, Gaius.  Always.


  The Cylons are here and we re back in the same moment we 
  left.  Baltar signs the warrant.  D Anna snatches it off the 
  table and Doral puts away the gun.  OFF Baltar as he tries to 
  deal with what he s just done...

    REVEAL Sharon walking up in a DRESS UNIFORM.  She smooths out 
  the fabric of the jacket.

  They head down the Corridor.

                You know what this means to me?

                One of the first things they taught 
                us at the Academy was that symbols 
                  matter.  Uniforms.  Flags.  
                  Banners.  Even mascots.  They re 
                  like... pieces of your heart you

                  This uniform... it means a lot to

                  I know it does, Helo.  It means a 
                lot to me too.

                  I won t betray it.


    Adama, Helo, Kat and a ROOMFUL of other OFFICERS are in DRESS 
    UNIFORMS and gathered here for a ceremonial occasion.  Adama 
  is administering the oath of office to Sharon.  She looks 
    scared, and happy, and five thousand other emotions that are 
  too complicated to ever fully know.

  Adama shakes her hand, a woman named Sharon is a lieutenant 
  once more, and one of many circles is now complete.  


  ELLEN TIGH is putting on her bra and grabs her skirt from the 
    floor.  A man s HAND reaches out and strokes her thigh 
    appreciatively.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Now, that was... something.

                                ELLEN
                  Thought you might like that.

                                ELLEN
                You said you wanted something 
                  memorable...

  She gets up and finishes getting dressed.  The moment she 
  turns away from him, we see the look on her face change to 
    bitter self-contempt.  Cavil reaches for his pants.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  How s Saul?

  She freezes.

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  Don t bother to deny it, Ellen.  We 
                  know he s their leader.  Why do you 
                  think we let him out of detention?

                                ELLEN
                        (bitter)
                  I thought it was the twist.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Well -- that too, in all honesty.  
                But having the Colonel out and 
                  active in the resistance presents 
                us with certain... advantages.

                                ELLEN
                  I don t know anything about what--

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Let s take your denials as read, 
                  shall we?  What I want is a 
                  specific place and a specific time 
                for a high level meeting of the 
                  insurgent leadership.  If I don t 
                get it, Saul will be picked up once 
                  again... and this time he ll lose 
                  more than an eye.

  FADE IN:


  Tyrol and Anders are going over a hand-transcribed message 
  with Tigh.

                                TYROL
                  Tomorrow, Galactica s sending a 
                  Raptor, a few Marines and a ground 
                  liaison officer to brief us on the 
                  rescue plan and coordinate our evac 
                  plans with them.

                                TIGH
                  I ll be damned... it s really 
                  happening.  Who s the liaison 
                  officer?

                                TYROL
                        (hesitant)
                  Sharon...

                                TIGH
                  I hope that s your idea of a joke.

                                TYROL
                  Nope.  The Admiral s given her a 
                  uniform and a billet.  She s a 
                  serving officer now -- which is 
                  more than you can say about us, 
                  technically.

  Tigh shakes his head for a moment.

                                TIGH
                Old Man s lost his mind.  All 
                  right.  Where s the rendezvous?

                                TYROL 
                  They left it up to us.

                                ANDERS
                  Here s my suggestion...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 39.

  He takes out a folded MAP of the surrounding area from his 
    pocket and starts to go over the markings with Tigh.

                                ANDERS (cont d)
                If they Jump into Breeder s Canyon 
                out here in the southern range, 
                  they probably won t get picked up --

    Suddenly there s a BANG-BANG from outside.  Tigh moves to 
  peer through the flap --  sees Ellen is standing outside, 
    waiting patiently by the Man guarding the entrance.  Tigh 
  picks up a CUP and BANGS once on the tent pole and Ellen is 
    cleared to ENTER.

  She gives Tyrol and Anders a quick smile.

                                ELLEN
                Hi, guys.

                                ANDERS
                  Ellen.
                        (back to map)
                  Anyway -- if they Jump in here, 
                  they won t get picked up on Cylon 
                  dradis.  

  Ellen busies herself in the tent, but she s also nervously 
    listening to every word and surreptitiously watching the map 
    discussion.

                                TIGH
                  Long way out there... lotta ground 
                to cover on foot.

                                ANDERS
                I d meet em half-way... right 
                  about... here.  It s good cover 
                  from the air, pretty isolated.

                                TIGH
                  Gotta be sure... may be the most 
                  important meeting we re ever gonna 
                  have.

  That registers on Ellen s face... she doesn t want to do 
  this, but Cavil s words echo in her ears.  She takes a deep 
    breath...







                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 40.

                  Cylons ll never find em up here.

                                TIGH
                  Okay.  Gimme the map.  You got the 
                  message memorized?  All the 
                  wireless freqs?  Then gimme the 
                  message too.

  Tigh reaches out for his cane, starts to drag himself to his 
  feet -- but Ellen moves to him quickly.

                                ELLEN
                  I ll do it, Saul.  Don t get up.

                                TIGH
                  Thanks.

  She takes the message and the map, turns her back to them and 
  then leans down to OPEN the TRAP on the small STOVE in the 
  tent.  Out of their sight, she tosses in the message, but 
    POCKETS the MAP inside her clothes.


    Sharon, in her flightsuit, is getting ready to board a 
    RAPTOR.  Adama and Helo are seeing her off.

                                HELO

                                SHARON
                See you soon.

  They embrace, then Adama holds out a hand.  She takes it, 
    pauses for a beat:

                                SHARON (cont d)
                Can I ask you something?  How do 
                you know -- how do you really know 
                you can trust me?

                                ADAMA
                  I don t.  That s what trust is.  
                  Good hunting.

    Sharon looks at him for a beat, then climbs into the Raptor.  'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 40A.




  The next day.  Baltar is sitting at his desk, drinking, 
    smoking, and popping pills, trying to wash away the guilt 
  over what he s done, when Gaeta ENTERS at a clip, carrying a 
  piece of paper, and filled with tension.

                                GAETA
                Did you sign this?

                                BALTAR
                Not now, Mr. Gaeta... I m tired...

                                GAETA
                  This is a death warrant -- have you 
                  seen the names on here?  Do you 
                  have any idea what they re about to 
                do out there?  Are you listening to 
                me?

    Baltar looks up -- sees a copy of the death list in Gaeta s 
  hand.

                  I didn t have any choice...

                        (astonished)
                You didn t have any...?  What the 
                  hell s the matter with you!

                                BALTAR
                  Don t take that tone with me --

                                GAETA
                  There are over two hundred names on 
                  this list!  Have you looked at the 
                  names?  LOOK AT THE NAMES, GAIUS!

                                BALTAR
                  I VE SEEN THEM, ALL RIGHT?
                        (beat)
                  I ve seen them.  And... there was 
                  nothing I could do.

  Gaeta looks wildly at Baltar for a moment, completely freaked 
  out and yet unable to figure out what to do.  He turns and 
  bolts from the cabin...


  Laura is grading papers when the tent FLAP OPENS and two 
    MASKED NCP OFFICERS ENTER.  

                                OFFICER #1
                  Laura Roslin?  Come with us, 
                  please.

  Off Laura s face as she realizes this is serious trouble...    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 42.




    Sharon at the controls, MARINES in the back.

                                SHARON
                  Jump complete.  Right on target.  
                      (to Marines)
                  Okay, hang on -- I m dropping down 
                to the landing point and we ve got 
                  some heavy turbulence up ahead...

  The ship is shaken around...

  Laura is in the back of a TRUCK with about a DOZEN other 
  HUMAN detainees.  Everyone is scared.  No one is talking.  
  The truck bounces to a STOP, the back FLAP OPENS and TOM 
  ZAREK is hustled inside by masked NCP officers.  The FLAP 
    CLOSES and the truck starts MOVING AGAIN.

                                LAURA
                  Hello, Mr. Vice-President.  Need a 
                  lift?

                                ZAREK
                  Guess so.

  Zarek finds a spot to sit in the cramped area.

                                LAURA
                  Haven t seen much of you lately.  
                  Must be very busy these days.

                                ZAREK
                Not much to do in detention.

                                LAURA
                How long have you been held?






                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 43.

                                ZAREK
                  Four months.  I think.  They play 
                  with time in there.  I told Baltar I 
                  wouldn t have any part of 
                  collaborating with the Cylons and... 
                  well, he got a little pissed.

                                LAURA
                  Well, guess what?  He s a little 
                  pissed at me too.

  Laura smiles and puts out her hand.  Tom grins after a beat 
  and shakes her hand.  Then the gravity of their situation 
  sinks in once more.

                                ZAREK
                At least I ll die with someone I 
                  respect.  I guess that s something.


  Kara and Leoben are still keeping vigil over Kacey.  Kara is 
    praying as Leoben looks on.

                                KARA
                ... oh, Lords... please don t take 
                her life... it was my mistake... 
                  don t punish her for it...

    Leoben puts a hand on her arm, and without realizing it, she 
  lets him.

                                LEOBEN
                It was an accident, Kara.  Nothing 
                  more.

    Suddenly, Kacey stirs... coughs... and then looks around and 
  cries as she WAKES UP.  

                                KARA
                  Kacey!  Oh my gods!  Kacey!  We re 
                  right here, honey.  We re right 
                  here...

  As Kara holds the child and Leoben looks happy at last -- and 
    they re still holding hands...


  The truck with Laura and Zarek has stopped on a desolate 
    plain, far from prying eyes.  Jammer comes up to Brother 
    Cavil.  Other NCP Officers wait in the b.g.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                      (to Jammer)
                Let them stretch their legs for a 
                few minutes.  

                                JAMMER
                  Yes, sir.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Precipice' FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 46.

    Jammer pulls his mask down over his face and OPENS the back 
  of the truck.

                                Jammer (cont d)
                  Everybody out!  Five minute rest 
                  break.  C mon!  Move!
