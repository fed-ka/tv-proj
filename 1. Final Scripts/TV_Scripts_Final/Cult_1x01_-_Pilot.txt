      STRAIGHT DOWN ON A DESKTOP, CAMERA SPINNING

      The desktop is awash with freaky CRIME SCENE PHOTOS, BLOODY
      CLOTHES SCRAPS, PD FILES, MAPS.  The SPINNING makes us feel
      like we're looking into a nightmarish kaleidoscope.

                    Billy Grimm's followers have them--

      CAMERA stops spinning, and PUSHES IN on a MUG SHOT stamped
      with the name:  BILLY GRIMM.  He's 45, eyes filled with
      intellect.  And madness.  Staring right at us.  WIDEN to:

      INT. LAPD - COLLINS' OFFICE - NIGHT

      1 a.m.  Lit by harsh lamp light.  Detective ERIC COLLINS
      (mid-30s, sleepless good looks) leans intensely over his
      littered desk, cell phone to his ear.  Nobody's answering
      his call.  His partner, detective PAZ HALDERON (30s), stands
      nearby--

                                      COLLINS
                    I had Jen's brother move them.  He
                    was going to hide them somewhere
                    new, somewhere safe.  Then he was
                    supposed to call me.

      Collins slams off his phone in frustration.  Paz glances at
      a TV monitor nearby:  A RECORDING of Collins intensely
      interrogating Billy Grimm on some previous occasion.  Collins
      looks wound tight; Billy looks supremely at ease.

      Paz studies Collins -- worried about his partner's mental
      state.  Collins labors to make sense of the disjointed clues
      before him.  Suddenly a thought flashes--

                                      COLLINS
                    What was it that latest vic kept
                    repeating before he died?

                    It was really weird, he said -- "These
                    things snap off."  What things was
                    he talking about--

                                      COLLINS
                    No, that wasn't it.  Not exactly. 
                          (straining to remember)
                    He said, "Well -- hey -- these things
                    just... just snap right off."

                                    PAZ
                    But these Billy Grimm whack-jobs are
                    always saying nutty junk, like they're
                    revealing the secrets of the universe--

                                      COLLINS
                    "Well, Hey, These Things..."

      Collins puzzles it out...

                                      COLLINS
                      W.H.T.T.--

      And he quickly shoves through the papers on his desk, finds
        a wrinkled-torn GAS STATION MAP.  Handwritten in what looks
      like BLOOD:  letters scribbled all around the map.  Collins
      grabs a marker, starts finding and circling initials --

                                    PAZ
                    Uh, that's evidence you're marking
                    up--

                    "...Just Snap Right Off."  J.S.R.O...

      Collins finishes.  Considers the pattern.  Then -- he quickly
      draws spokes between them.  Circles the point where the spokes
      all intersect.  He looks at Paz.  He may've figured it out.

      On the TV monitor, the RECORDED IMAGE of Billy Grimm now
      stares at the interrogation camera... seemingly right at
      Collins in this room.  Right at us.  Eerie.CULT

      EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

      Foggy.  HEADLIGHTS strobe between tree trunks.  Collins'
      LAPD SEDAN bounces madly down a barely-existent dirt road.

      INT. COLLINS' SEDAN - NIGHT

      Collins drives way too fast for this road.  Paz, the map in
      his lap, just holds on for dear life.

                                    PAZ
                    Even if this map means something, it
                    doesn't mean Billy's people have
                    taken your family--

                                      COLLINS
                    They wanted me to find this place.

                                    PAZ
                    What place?  There's nothing out
                    here--

                                      COLLINS
                    Yes there is...

      UP AHEAD:  a rough-hewn ISOLATED CABIN.  Dark, ominous.  Lit
      only by the full moon.  A 70's PLYMOUTH VALIANT, a distinctive
      dull-orange color, is parked in front.

      INT. ISOLATED CABIN - NIGHT (ONE MINUTE LATER)

      The door is KICKED open.  It's Collins -- WEAPON and MAGLITE
      in hand.  He enters the shadowy cabin -- and freezes at what
      he sees.  Paz is a step behind him.  He also freezes.

      EVERY SURFACE - WALLS, WINDOWS, TABLES, FLOOR -- IS COVERED
      IN WORDS AND DRAWINGS.  Crazed.  Chilling. 

      Collins eases into the hellish environment.  Paz follows.

                                      COLLINS
                      Definitely the work of Billy's
                      followers. 

      Collins is at a section of the chaotically-painted wall where
      the ancient wallpaper has buckled, creating an uneven texture. 
      Then, suddenly, as he's watching:  A PAIR OF HUMAN EYES OPEN -
      INSET IN THE WALL.  Collins and Paz react in shock:A MAN'S
      BODY is inset in this wall, painted to perfectly blend in.

                                    PAZ

      Collins and Paz pull the man free, leaving a perfectly-shaped
      indent in the wall.  The man, nearly dead, stares up at
      Collins, barely any voice--

                      ...Where's Jen?

      The man tries to form words, straining...

                                      COLLINS
                    Jen and Andy -- where are they?

                    them...

      Collins' worst nightmare has just come to life.

                                      COLLINS
                    It was Billy Grimm's people, wasn't
                    it?  Where did they take them?
                          (no answer)
                    Douglas-- !

      The man meets Collins' eye.  And with his dying breath, says--

                                    MAN
                    Well hey... these things just...
                    snap right off...

      The man falls back, lifeless.  Collins stares in gathering
      horror.  HOLD on Collins.  And then...

      Something completely unexpected happens:  we suddenly HEAR
        appreciative LAUGHTER.  Then, from seeming nowhere, PEOPLES'
      VOICES CALL OUT:  "Whoa!"  "Total freak out!"  "I knew it!" 
      "Say buh-bye, Collins - your wifey and son are his-tor-y!" 
      "The cult's got 'em now!"  

      And we slowly PULL AWAY from Collins TO REVEAL... a WALL-
      MOUNTED 70-INCH TV.  Collins is now on the TV.   What the
      hell is happening?  We PAN OFF to reveal we are actually in--CULT

      INT. UPSCALE DOWNTOWN BAR - NIGHT

      A good CROWD.  Everybody drinking, having a good time. 
      Watching the bar's 70-INCH.  A banner reads:  "CULT" NIGHT
      at Henri's.  Every Weds Nite.  Be Here - Or bleed!

      On the TV:  Collins is outside the cabin, face ashen, trying
      to catch his breath.  And it begins to sink in on us...

      Everything we've just watched with Collins and Paz - is a
      television series called "CULT". 

      And we CUT AROUND TO:

      MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

      -- In a SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM, a YOUNG COUPLE draped on the
      sofa, watching "CULT"...

      -- In ANOTHER HOME, TWO SISTERS, 30s, glasses of wine,
      watching...

      -- In an OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY, two SECURITY GUARDS (one
      male, one female) watching on a small TV...

      -- In a TEENAGER'S ROOM, TEEN GIRLS on the bed, laptops open,
      simultaneously on LIVE CHATS about the show while watching...

      And finally --

      INT. FANDOMAIN CAFE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

        A brightly-colored, cool-retro place - dedicated to TV and
      its FANS.  FOLKS lounge, drinking coffee, watching TV on
      various wall-mounted sets.  We PUSH PAST other sections where
      different TV shows, past and present, live and recorded, are
      being watched and enjoyed.  To:

      A section in the back.  The section dedicated to "CULT".

      The "CULT" FANS are a cross-section.  Most just watch and
      enjoy the show.  But there are a few others who are far more
      engrossed -- they actually have notebooks or laptops open...
      their focus on the show much more serious. 

      We SWEEP through the "CULT" fans - finally coming upon: 
      NATE SEFTON, 25, scruffy -- with a certain lost puppy dog
      vibe.  He's rapid-fire texting with somebody. 

      His eye goes to his well-worn "CULT"-centric notebook in his
      lap -- filled with arcane writing and drawings.  Then he
      looks at the TV -- with a very different expression than
      anyone else.  His is a look of excitement mixed with --
      nervous uncertainty.CULT

      He has to find his voice, calls over to a conservatively-
      dressed woman seated across the way with her own filled
      notebook and pen at ready as she watches the show--

      The woman looks up, sees Nate's expression, reacts, and
      instantly hurries over.  This is MERRIAM LIVINGSTON, 47.

                    I think so...

      Merriam's expression tells us:  whatever this is, it's huge. 
      Nate rapidly starts gathering his things.

                                      MERRIAM
                    C'mon, you and I are in this together.

      But Nate is already rushing for the exit.  He slams into
      buoyant coffee server KIRSTIE, 20.  Kirstie turns to watch
      Nate exit, and we SEE a moment of worldly-awareness in her
      face that we don't expect from someone so young.  Has she
      overheard what Nate just said?

      Kirstie delivers a coffee to Merriam, and she clocks Merriam's

      EXT. SANTA MONICA - SOUTH OF THE PIER - DAY

      The next morning.  We're CLOSE on a billboard advertising
      "CULT".  Featuring a distinctive, insanity-inspired BOX
      DRAWING (the show's logo - and our show's logo, too).  Jagged
      psycho letters announce:  "Weds nights 10pm on ABC".

      PAN TO:  the Strand in sunny, colorful SoCal.  In direct
      contrast to the billboard. 

      CUTS:  ROLLERBLADERS, SUNBATHERS, VOLLEYBALLERS.  Young,
      carefree.  The "real" world -- blissfully unaware that there
      could ever be anything unseen out there that's dark and
        unexpectedly dangerous...

      And we find ourselves in front of the funky, faded-pastel
      offices of:  The Word.  The beach community's decades-old
      local paper.

      INT. THE WORD OFFICES - MORNING

      As funky inside as out.  The STAFF is an eclectic group
      befitting the area.  We SWEEP through this bullpen, as--

      FIND JEFF SEFTON, 32 -- more educated and urban than the

      haunted quality, that he can't completely hide.  Presently,
      he's in the midst of his daily spirited verbal sparring match
      with his editor, BERT QUINN, 55, ex-radical.  Bert holds a
      print-out of Jeff's latest article--

                                    JEFF
                    I wrote it the way you wanted me to
                    write it.  With that fun "sand between
                    the toes relaxed feeling"...

      Bert keeps moving, Jeff chases after him--

                                    BERT
                    Jeff, pal o'mine, I'm only cutting
                    two paragraphs--

                                    JEFF

                    It's not like when you worked here
                    before.  The new owner wants to try
                    to turn at least some profit with
                    this dinosaur of a paper.  That means
                    light and airy--

      A SMART-ASS YOUNG REPORTER passes, throws to Jeff--

                    Hey, Sefton -- if you want to write
                    real substance, want to be short-
                    listed for the Pulitzer two years in
                    a row, why don't you just go back to
                    your wildly-impressive job at the
                      Washington Post?
                          (snide grin)
                    Oh, that's right.  You can't.

      Jeff tosses a look.  Meanwhile, Bert takes his red pen and
      crosses out the two paragraphs.

                                    BERT
                    Glad to have you back, buddy.  And I
                    know you'll get into the swing of
                    things around here again in no time...

      HOLD on Jeff.  The last thing he wants is to get the swing
      of things around here again.  And--

      AT JEFF'S DESK

      Jeff plops down in his wobbly desk chair.  Looks at a FRAMED
      PHOTO of himself in front of the Washington Post building. 
      All smiles.  He lifts the photo.  Tosses it in the trash.

      Then he notices a Phone Message Post-It on his desk phone: 
      "Brenda Wyle -- D.C. -- called -- 2x".  Jeff's heart takes
      the hit.  This is the last thing he wants to see.  Moment... 
      then he crumples the message.  And -- his cell phone RINGS. 
      Jeff takes a beat before he checks the Caller I.D.  It reads: 
      Nate.  Jeff answers--

                                    JEFF

                    are you, man?

      Jeff recognizes a quality in Nate's voice.  Breaths a SIGH. 
      He doesn't want to ask, but--

                                    JEFF

      INTERCUT - INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - DAY

      CLOSE as Nate's hand anxiously checks the deadbolt and door
      lock.  PAN UP.  Nate is even more on edge than last night. 
      Into his CELL PHONE--

                                    NATE
                    I'm... it's just that I'm freaking
                    out here a little... definitely
                    freaking out...

      Instead of being concerned, Jeff just shakes his head.

                                    JEFF
                    C'mon, bro.  We talked about this.

      There's a NOISE beyond Nate's door.  Could be nothing.  But
      it totally spooks Nate that somebody might be out there.

                                    NATE
                    I've got to see you--

                                    JEFF
                    You agreed.  We're not going to start
                    this up again.

                                    NATE
                    Please.  It's maybe a matter of life
                    and death.
                          (another NOISE outside)
                      Definitely life and death--

      Jeff has been here with Nate too many times before.  But he
      also can't stop himself from caring for Nate.  Resolved SIGH--

                                    JEFF
                    You want me to come to your apartment?

                    No.  Uh, someplace public.  The pier.

                                    JEFF
                    ...Half an hour.

      And with a resigned look, Jeff hangs up.

      ON NATE.  Also hangs up.  Glances at his messy desk.  Eyes
      his "CULT" NOTEBOOK.  Stares like it's a coiled rattlesnake. 

      We PUSH IN on the cover.  Among the other chaotic drawings
      is Nate's hand-rendering of the insanity-inspired "CULT"

      And we PICK UP -- SKYE YARROW, late 20s, smart-cute, laptop
      case over her shoulder, morning Starbucks in hand, hurrying
      in to work.  She has called out to GARY FISHER, 45, the show's
        Co-Executive Producer, reading script pages as he walks.

                                      FISHER
                    'Morning, Skye.  You're in early

                    Second week and I couldn't be happier. 
                    Already I've done deep background on
                    several truly twisted aberrant cult-
                      psychology studies.  I'm in total

      Skye's interest in all-things-creepy is in direct contrast
      to her straight-forward, bright-eyed good looks.

                                      FISHER
                    Well, glad you're happy.

      He turns to walk away.  But there's something on Skye's mind
      this morning.  And when she's got something on her mind, she
      has a hard time restraining herself.  She just kind of moves
      along beside him.  Fisher looks over--

                    Yes, but these hard-to-get-into sites --
                    the people who post seem to have
                    some sort of -- of special connection
                    to the show.  Some of them actually
                    seem kinda...

                    Scared?  Scared of what exactly?

      Now Fisher fully regards her -- but his look says he's
      wondering if maybe she's a little meshuga.  Skye reads his

                    night and I -- I think they're after
                    me now.

                    It's... a TV show.

      Jeff can't believe his ears.

                                    NATE
                    I know how it sounds.  But it's not
                    just a show--

      Jeff stares.  He's got so much going on in his own life right
      now, and now this.

                                    NATE
                          (fast, manic)
                    The... the show is called "Cult".

                          (wary grimace; never
                            heard of it)
                    -- "Cult"?

                                    NATE
                    But it's not just a TV show, it goes
                    beyond that!  Way beyond that!

      Suddenly Nate sees something that makes his jaw drop in real 
      fear.

                                    NATE
                    That car... the orange one...

      Jeff turns, SEES it down in the pier parking lot:  an orange
      Plymouth Valiant (identical to the one we saw in our opening
      scene, in the "CULT" TV show).  The windshield facing this
      way, though we can't see who -- if anybody -- is inside.

                                    JEFF
                          (a sigh)
                    Okay, so who's in the car...?

      Nate just backs away, afraid of that car.  Jeff watches as
      the car drives slowly away.  No evidence it had anything to
      do with Nate. 

                                    NATE
                    I want out!  Please, help me get

                    from the drama--

      Nate looks around, tentatively holds up his "CULT" notebook--

      Jeff looks at the crazy writing and drawings on the cover. 
      He's had it.

                                    JEFF
                    No, Nate.  I've been through these --
                    these obsessions of yours too many
                    times.  Not this time.  No.

      And staying strong, Jeff just starts away.

                                    NATE
                    Jeff--

      Nate rushes to Jeff and shoves something into his hands. 
      Jeff looks.  Bizarre.  It's:  a pair of old-fashioned red/blue
      3-D GLASSES.

                                    JEFF
                    What--

                                    NATE
                    Just take them!  You -- you might
                    need them!

      Jeff stares at the glasses, then at Nate.  We can tell this
      is very hard for Jeff, but he turns -- and just keeps walking.

      INT. SKYE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      LEXI, 25, Skye's roommate, is getting ready to go out.  Skye
      sits at the kitchen table, working at her laptop.

                                    LEXI
                    Todd's lame connections actually

                                    SKYE
                    That's okay.  You guys go.

                                    LEXI
                    But it's Channel X -- you love them. 
                    And this is their last L.A.

                                    SKYE
                    I've got work to do.

                                    LEXI
                    All you do is work.

                                    SKYE
                    This is something for me...

      And Lexi looks at her suspiciously--

                    Not those websites again...

      EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT

      The lights and colors of the Strip swirl around Jeff as he
      fills up at the AM/PM at San Vincente.  He's lost in thought
      about all that's going on in his life right now.  Suddenly --
      A SCREAM.  Jeff spins.  A GROUP of carefree young CLUB GOERS
      hurry past.  It was one of the GIRLS who screamed -- Jeff
      realizes the scream was just a fun squeal.  Then, loud--

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey you!

      Jeff looks around--

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yeah, I'm talking to you.

      And Jeff realizes the voice is coming from -- the GAS PUMP
      TV SCREEN.  The SCREEN is full of STATIC.  Then -- JAGGED
      CUTS of NIGHTMARE IMAGES.  Then -- PSYCHO LETTERING flashes
      madly.  "CULT".  It's a promo for the show.

      Jeff stares. 

      A MAN'S FACE pops on.  Piercing eyes that appear to be staring
      right at Jeff.  With a chilling smile.  His voice mesmerizing--

      Just a coincidence, but the way he says this, seemingly
      looking directly at Jeff, it's freaky.

      Then CAMERA jumps in on Billy as he stares out and says--

      Jeff can't help but get a little pang.  Sure, it's just a TV

      Jeff stands there a moment.  Not sure whether Nate is
        bullshitting him or not.  He hits auto-dial.  Pause.  And
      the call goes directly to VOICE MAIL.

      Jeff doesn't know whether he should be royally pissed -- or
      sincerely worried.  Right now, he's both.  HOLD, and--

      EXT. NATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      On a small side street in Hermosa Beach.  Jeff hurries up to
      Nate's apartment, still trying the phone.  Nate still isn't
      answering.  Ready to ream his brother, Jeff reaches Nate's
      door -- and pauses.  The door is already ajar.  Jeff frowns.  

      INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Jeff eases open the door.  The place is a neglected mess.

                    Nate...?  You in here?

      The TV is ON.  We notice that "CULT" (muted) is playing as
      Jeff moves past.  He checks the kitchenette, opens the bedroom
      door.  Nobody home. 

      He moves to the cluttered desk and -- finds Nate's CELL PHONE
      still here.  Jeff's expression darkens.

      While Jeff tries to fathom all this, his hand accidentally
      brushes the desk chair.  It slowly turns.  And Jeff jumps.

      THE CLOTH CHAIR IS SOAKED THROUGH WITH BLOOD.

      Jeff stares in gathering horror.  ON the TV beyond him: 
      "CULT" plays...

      EXT. NATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      After midnight.  A couple of COP CARS in front now.

      INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Two UNIFORMED COPS, a pair of DETECTIVES.  Jeff, very
      troubled, watches as a CSI GUY takes a sample from the blood-
      soaked chair.  Too-good-to-retire LAPD detective ROSE SAKELIK,
      55, eases around the room, taking it all in, listening to--

                                    JEFF
                    He called me around nine.  He sounded --
                      distressed.  It was a bad connection. 
                    The call ended... or was cut off. 
                    So I decided to come over and talk
                    to him face to face...

      Sakelik studies him.

                                      SAKELIK
                    You think the call was cut off?

                                    JEFF
                    Could've been.  I don't really know.

                    No signs of aggressive contact.  No
                    forced entry.  The blood is contained,
                    no splatter. 

      Sakelik looks at him curiously.  Jeff explains--

                    college was working city crime in
                    Philly.  When will you have DNA on
                    whether the blood is Nate's?

      he's under suspicion.

                    Fine.  We got along fine.

                    yesterday afternoon, he was troubled

                    Lookee here.

      A UNIFORMED COP is exiting the bedroom -- holding up an
      evidence back containing a DRUG PARAPHERNALIA KIT.  He hands
      it to Sakelik.

      The CSI Guys glance at Sakelik now.  They've gotten the
      message.  Jeff realizes the search is taking a new direction.

      Jeff is near Nate's desk -- sees a sliver of Nate's CELL
      PHONE showing beneath some papers.  He glances at Sakelik
      who is now poking in the kitchenette. 

      Jeff decides.  And covertly slips the cell phone into his
      pocket.  Suddenly--

      Jeff jumps.  Sakelik's partner, detective MARIO ZAVALA, 35,
      is referring to the TV.  He didn't see Jeff take the phone.

      Zavala looks at what's playing.  Means nothing to him.  He
      moves off.  Jeff glances at the TV -- and reacts to the sight
      of:  Billy Grimm, that creepy guy from the "CULT" promo. 

      This is Jeff's first real look at the show. 

      Frowning, Jeff eases closer.  Eying the screen.  Curious. 
      Uncertain.  Moment, then he turns up the SOUND enough to
      hear.  We PUSH IN on the TV.  And suddenly we're watching--

      EXT. BILLY GRIMM'S COMPOUND - DAY

      Billy Grimm crouches, pleasantly engaging one of the happy
      TODDLERS who are part of the tapestry that is Billy's
      Compound. 

      The compound itself is a large clearing among the lush
      greenery of Topanga Canyon.  The buildings are different-
      sized and aged trailers.  Billy's faithful FOLLOWERS, ages
      17-70, tend gardens, hang out wash. 

      Billy himself is about 40, sinewy -- his lined, tanned face
      brimming with humor, intelligence, and, of course, that
      mesmerizing stare.  He wears jeans and a very distinctive
      worn leather vest.  Most disconcerting is the well-used 10-
      inch bowie knife prominent on his belt.

      Billy glances up, and a smile of recognition breaks on his
      face.  Detective Collins walks determinedly toward him.

                                      BILLY
                    Eric.  Ignoring your department's
                      interdiction about not coming
                      physically near me...?

      Collins grabs Billy hard. 

                                      COLLINS
                    Where are they, Billy?

      Billy's Followers instantly turn.  Billy looks at them -- an
      unspoken command.  They start this way to help him.  Collins
      sees this -- knows he's outnumbered.  It takes everything he
      has to pull his hands from Billy.  Billy straightens his
      clothes, looks at Collins with "sincerity" --

                    Just as you used to...

      This strikes an unsettling cord in Collins -- exactly the
      cord Billy wanted to strike.

                                      BILLY
                    All those times your parents left

                    Because I know what you're capable
                    of.

      Billy offers just the smallest of smiles.

                                      COLLINS
                    Joey Keller will return my family --

      Billy motions towards:  an area of mismatched tables under a
      canvas overhang.  At the tables:  FOLLOWERS working computers. 
      Lots of them.

                                      BILLY
                    What you have to understand is even

      Billy holds out his hand.  Palm down.  Collins looks.  And
      there on the back of Billy's hand is a self-carved BOX TATTOO

      mention:  he reaches into his jacket -- and brings out the
      identical 3-D glass.  The ones Nate gave him at the pier.

      He looks around at the cops, to say something.  But they're
      all across the room, with the drug paraphernalia kit in hand,
      in hushed conversations.  Jeff glances back at the 3-D
      glasses.  It's all so crazy. 

      Sakelik heads this way, and Jeff instinctively shoves the

                    No problem.

      The slightest moment passes between them -- then Jeff moves 
      off with Teri.

                    I must say, I'm so glad that the
                    Post is willing to give a fresh look
                    at our show.

                                    JEFF

                      Unfortunately your Mr. Shales thought
                    we were a tad on the dark side. 
                    But, as you know, today's television
                    is just so competitive.  And we're
                      justifiably proud that "Cult" is
                    truly like nothing else presently on
                    the air.

                                    JEFF
                    I'm particularly interested in knowing
                    about the show's impact on the people
                    who watch.

                    as a publicist so much easier.

                    Are you aware of any particular --
                    influence the show has?  Anything
                    that goes... beyond the show itself?

                    you mean.

      Jeff studies her expression.  She seems to sincerely have no
      idea what he's talking about.

      Then Teri's young assistant, ANNE, 23, hurries up to Teri. 
      Anne throws Jeff a nervous look, whispers to Teri, handing
      Teri a business card.  Teri's expression hardens.  To Jeff--CULT

                    mail you some promotional materials. 
                    Used the e-mail address off your
                      Washington Post business card here. 
                    And much to her surprise -- the 
                    e-mail bounced back. 

      Jeff knows where this is going.

                                    JEFF
                    I can explain--

                                    TERI
                    So she called the Post.  And
                      discovered a very interesting piece
                    of information.  Namely -- you don't
                    work there anymore.

                                    JEFF
                    Look, I'm sorry.  I just -- I need a
                    few minutes with this Steven Rae.  I
                    need to ask him about his show--

      Now Teri figures she has him pegged--

                                    TERI
                    You fans will do absolutely anything
                    to try to get to Steven--

                                    JEFF
                      I honestly don't give a damn about
                    your show.  I know how it sounds,
                    but... my brother's the fan, and he --
                    he's disappeared.

      Jeff feels like a jerk saying this.  Meanwhile, Skye perks
      as she hears this.  Teri regards him -- is he potentially
      dangerous?  To Anne--

                                    TERI
                    Call Security.  Tell them we have an
                    intruder.  Tell them to make it fast.

      Jeff wants to try to rationalize with her.  But knows he
      can't.  Everyone is staring at him now.  The only one with a
      different expression is -- Skye.

      Roger continues into the Production Office.  Jeff, reeling,
      continues on.  Then--

                    Excuse me!  Hey!

      Jeff, still a little off-kilter, turns.  Skye is hurrying
      toward him.  She moves up fast.  Then -- doesn't know exactly
      what to say.

                                    SKYE

                    And -- I heard what you said about
                    your brother.

      There's something about this that has particular significance
      for Skye.  Now Skye sees something o.s.  Jeff looks.  TWO
      STUDIO SECURITY MEN hurry toward the production office. 
      Thinking fast, Skye grabs Jeff--

                                    SKYE
                    C'mon!

      And she quickly pulls him toward an open SOUND STAGE door. 
      Jeff has no idea who this dervish is, but -- they disappear
      into the stage as the Guards race past.

      As they race inside from the stark sunlight.  Jeff's eyes
      adjust -- and he reacts to the chaotically-painted
        surrounding.  THEY ARE IN THE ISOLATED CABIN SET from the
      show (as seen in our opening).  Empty now, lit by worklights.

                                    JEFF
                    Is this... from the show?

                                    SKYE
                    Yeah.  You don't watch?

      Jeff eyes the walls with ill-ease, and definite distaste.

                                    JEFF
                    No.  But my brother does.  A lot,
                      apparently.

                    ...And he's disappeared?

      And, again, that sense that this holds special meaning for
      Skye.  Jeff nods, still eying the surroundings.CULT

                    Just because he watches the show, it
                    doesn't mean--

                                    JEFF
                    I saw him yesterday -- before he

                    to him, it had everything to do with
                    this show.

      Skye considers this.

                                    JEFF
                    You work on the show?

                    Is there any reason my brother's
                      disappearance could be related to...?

      Skye doesn't answer.  But Jeff reads the uncertainty in her
      eye.

                    They think his disappearance might
                    be drug related.  My brother's had
                    some problems in the past.  But I

                    might know something.  Considering
                    that your brother's also--

      He doesn't finish the thought -- clearly troubled that his
      wife may be missing with Jeff's brother.

                    But there was a tone in her voice.

                    Six months ago, after our daughter's
                    wedding, Merriam just seemed... lost. 
                    It happens, I know.  Facing the empty
                    nest.  Didn't know what to do with
                    herself.

                    months she's actually been perkier

                    No.  Neither of us do.  We only have
                    the one set.  It's in the den.  I'm
                    not even sure it's plugged in.

      INT. BLAIR HOUSE - DEN - DAY

      Kirk leads Jeff inside.  Points to the TV off to one side,
      books stacked on top.  Kirk glances around the room--

                                    KIRK
                    Merriam spent so much of her time in
                    here.  It was supposed to be my den,
                    but Merriam made it into her sewing
                    room.

      Jeff notes the decor -- so warm and wholesome.

                                    KIRK
                    She was always making clothes and
                    such -- whatever members of our church
                    needed.
                          (beat)
                    This was her little hideaway.  

      Jeff looks at the TV.  Its presence somehow ominous.  The
      phone RINGS o.s.  Kirk says anxiously--

                                    KIRK
                    Maybe that's...  Excuse me, please--

      And he hurries off.  Jeff glances at the completely wholesome
      sewing room.  He notices Merriam's large sewing box, with a
      needlepoint decoration inlaid in the top.  And he freezes --

      Hidden in the needlepoint pattern:  the "CULT" box logo.

      Chilled, Jeff reaches out, opens it.  All the typical sewing
      accouterments.  Then Jeff sees a flap of material, and pulls
      it.  Revealing -- a false bottom.  Jeff lifts it and sees:

      Screen captures from the show, pages of madly-scribbled notes,
      sketches.  Beneath these:  a folded green dress.  Then he
      sees:  a photograph.  In the photo is Merriam -- wearing the
      dress Jeff just found.  And beside her stands -- Nate.

      The hair on Jeff's necks stands up.  His brother is wearing
      the outfit cult leader Billy Grimm wears on the show -- with
      the 10-inch bowie knife held prominently in his hand.

      Jeff stares.  Suddenly -- his cell phone RINGS.

      ON JEFF -- absorbing this.  Moment, then his eye goes to the
      photo in his hand.  And he focuses on Merriam.  Standing
      next to his brother.  His brother holding a very big knife.

      HIGH ANGLE of an elaborate crime scene.  LAPD cars, red/blue
      lights swirling, CORONER WAGONS, dozens of COPS and CRIME
      SCENE WORKERS.  The sky beyond is perfect CRIMSON DUSK. 
      CAMERA SWEEPS DOWN to REVEAL oil-smeared BODIES being
      extricated from the tar pits.  Several of them.

      CAMERA GLIDES THROUGH all the activity to:  Collins standing

      Collins has a hard time masking his anger -- and especially
      his anxiety.  And suddenly something crosses in front of us --
      THE CAMERA.  Riding its JIB ARM.  Now our own ANGLE adjusts
      to reveal--

      The CREW of the "CULT" production unit.  All watching this
      scene from "CULT" being filmed.  A good-sized CLUSTER of
      ONLOOKERS is held back behind sawhorses by SET SECURITY.

      Our CAMERA MOVE takes us past network exec Kyle Segal, who
      is visiting the set -- murmuring into his phone despite the
      fact that the scene is still filming.  The MOVE takes us to--

      -- Skye.  She holds some faxed pages, whispering to the
      director, DEAN, 30s.  He looks at the pages, and calls out
      in frustration--

      They look around.  There's some painted graffiti on a rock. 
      Skye hands Dean a faxed page, and he shows it to the actors.

                    Oh, for the love of--

                    Guess we missed it.

      Skye gives the Supervisor a "Sorry" look.  Segal grabs the
      faxed page, looks at it.  There's a symbol:  the LETTER "M"
      inside a CIRCLE.

      of them snapping PHOTOS of the set with their phone cameras.

                      completely on your side on this. 

      And he throws the paper to the ground.  The actors exchange
      a look -- they know they're being handled.  Skye sees the
      crumpled paper starting to blow away.  She starts for it. 
      When -- her phone rings.

      down and scoops up the paper.  As she rises, we SEE it is--

      -- Kirstie.  The Fandomain waitress.  She uncrumples the
      paper, looks at it.  And her eye goes to the actors standing
      with Segal.

      Cameras FLASH all around Kirstie as she simply stares at
      those men.  HOLD, and--

      WIDER - it's Jeff's phone we're seeing.  Jeff, lost in
      concerned thought, scrolls the countless Discussion threads
      about the show.  Around him -- the cafe is busier now.  Jeff
      looks up, notices something, and hurries to--

      -- Skye.  She's just entered the cafe.  Jeff reaches her--

                                    JEFF
                    Thanks for coming...

                    pretty freaked on the phone.

                    I didn't know who else to call.  You
                    know about this show.  And I can't
                    go to the police with any of this,
                    not until I have at least some idea
                    what Nate's mixed up in.  And, well--

      Jeff hands over a photo.  Skye looks:  Nate and Merriam in
      costume.  Skye instantly knows what has Jeff so troubled.

      INT. ROOM #5 - NIGHT

      Collins kneels in this darkened room, holding JOEY KELLER,
      35, who lies on the floor beside the bed, absolutely terrified--

                                      COLLINS
                    Dammit, Joey -- where's my family?! 
                    Where are they?!

      Joey stares -- but Collins isn't who he's afraid of...

                    If Billy finds out I let you find

                    What have you done with my wife and
                    boy?

      Joey sees the desperation in Collins' eyes.  Perhaps hoping
      for some sort of redemption, he finally says...

                                    JOEY

                    I don't want Billy mad at me...

      And, suddenly, Joey pulls a gun from behind his back.  Collins
      instantly grabs for it -- but Joey doesn't aim it at Collins,
      instead swings it against his own temple, and--

      EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

      A few middle-class cars, a plumber's truck, parked around.

      Jeff and Skye step from their car.  Suddenly -- SEVERAL PEOPLE
      come rushing from one of the rooms. 

      Many of the MEN are dressed like Billy Grimm.  A few of the
      WOMEN wear Jen's green dress.  But unlike the characters on
      the show, these people are all different ages, sizes, races. 
      Jeff stares -- it's both strange and bizarrely funny at the
      same time.

                    Trekkies have nothing on these guys...

      The roleplayers all run toward their cars.  Now Jeff and
      Skye see the panicked look on their faces.  Jeff snags an
      overweight FAUX BILLY GRIMM--

                    What's the matter-- ?

      The Faux Billy Grimm just looks scared, leaps into his car. 
      The cars are all racing away.  Jeff and Skye regard the open
      door to that room.  It's dark inside.

      Jeff and Skye exchange a look.  And slowly ease toward that
      door.

      The door is ajar.  Jeff notes:  it's Room #5 -- same as in
      the show.  Bitter irony.  They hear a WOMAN'S FRIGHTENED
      WHIMPERING.

      No answer -- just more FRIGHTENED WHIMPERING.  Jeff and Skye

      And now they are close enough to see the terrified woman's

                                    JEFF
                    -- Merriam?

      Jeff is extremely relieved to find her.  But the condition
      he's found her in is another matter.  Merriam tries to pedal
      even farther into the corner, trying to protect herself.

      Merriam's eyes narrow, filling with instant paranoia.

      Jeff just keeps easing forward.

      INT. LAPD OFFICES - SAKELIK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      FRAMED in a doorway, we SEE Merriam's husband, Kirk, ashen,
      out in the bullpen, talking to a pair of DETECTIVES.

      ANGLE ADJUSTS -- Jeff, shaken, looks out at Kirk with
      sympathy.  Skye sits beside him, also wearing the effects of
      what they witnessed.  Sakelik stands behind her desk, her
      natural suspicious expression even more pronounced now...

      His eye goes to the one place in the room where the true

      screen staring back at him blankly.  Ominously.

      Billy Grimm at his compound (the scene he watched earlier). 

      Jeff JUMPS again.  ON THE TV:  Collins with Joey Keller in

      Curious, Jeff stops, let's this scene play...

      INT. ISOLATED CABIN - NIGHT

      Collins moves purposefully into the cabin.  His partner Paz
      is with him.  There's the man-shaped space in the wall, but
      otherwise the room is unchanged.

                                    PAZ
                    C'mon, Collins.  There's no way your
                    family were ever here.  After we
                    found your brother-in-law, the whole
                    place was combed and combed again--

      Collins keeps pacing the room, drinking in the madness on
      the walls, desperate for an answer.  The answer.

      Then, suddenly, a thought hits him.  And he pulls out the   
      3-D glasses that Billy Grimm gave him.  Puts them on and
      begins to scan the chaotic images on the walls.

                                    PAZ
                    Collins -- c'mon--

                          (with desperation)
                    Look beyond what's right in front of
                    you...

      Finally, Collins looks down at the floor.  And--

      SOMETHING SUDDENLY JUMPS OUT AT HIM FROM THE FLOOR --
      startling him.  It is:  A 3-D IMAGE hidden among the
      overlapping graphics.  It's a representation of a trapdoor.

      Collins falls to his knees, starts urgently feeling around.

                    What is it?  What did you see?

      Collins' hand touches -- A RECESSED HANDLE.  Completely
      obscured.  Paz stares in amazement.  Collins pulls his gun. 

      Collins yanks open a trap door.  The trap door is lined with
      insanely thick sound-proof padding.  Jagged wooden stairs
      lead down.  Collins starts down--

      INT. A MUD-LINED CELLAR - NIGHT

      Dark and disturbing.  Collins hears -- a tiny WHIMPER.

      Across the room is a sealed box.  Collins races to it.  He
      smashes the latch, throws it open.  And FREEZES.

      Inside is his SON.  Dirt-streaked, disheveled -- but alive.CULT

                    Andy-- !!

      Collins sweeps him up, hugs him tightly with streaming tears.

                                      COLLINS
                    It's okay, son... it's okay...

      Paz spies something taped to the inside of the box.  He
      reaches for it.  It's a slate-black DVD -- blank, except for
      that CIRCLED M SYMBOL carved on it (Steven Rae's important
      "graffiti" symbol from earlier).

      Then Paz notices something else -- as little Andy clings to
      Collins, his t-shirt has ridden up.

                                    PAZ
                          (quaking voice)
                    Look...

      Collins looks.  There's something on the boy's skin.  Collins
      lifts the shirt.  And his blood runs cold:  there's a large
      box tattoo on his son's abdomen.

      As Collins stares in horror and anger, the boy says weakly--

                                    ANDY
                    Where's mommy...?

      HOLD on Collins, and--

      INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Back to Jeff, staring at the TV.  He plops back against Nate's
      desk, trying to fathom it.  He glances over, sees a photo
      Nate has kept of the two of them as boys.  In their bedroom
      at home.  Happier times.  Then something tucked in the shelf
      beside the photo catches his eye--

      The spine of a brightly-colored book.  Jeff thinks he
      recognizes it.  He pulls it out, revealing--

      Nate's "CULT" notebook.  That book Nate had with him that
      day at the pier.  Jeff looks at the psychotically-drawn "CULT"
      box logo on the front.  Jeff really doesn't want to open it. 
      But he does...

      INSIDE:  Nate's copious notes, drawings, pasted screen
      captures, Nate's own matching photos of the same locations.

      Jeff keeps flipping pages.  And he comes to -- a page pasted
      with a repeat pattern of baseballs.  Odd.  Then, slowly,
      Jeff begins to recognize it.  He grabs the photo of Nate and
      him in their childhood room.  Behind them -- the wallpaper
      is the exact same pattern of baseballs.CULT

      MEMORY HIT - INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

      12-YEAR-OLD JEFF and 5-YEAR-OLD NATE -- as they peel back a
      section of the wallpaper.  There's a hidden hole -- their
      childhood hiding place -- full of candy, baseball cards,
      comic books...

      BACK TO SCENE

      Jeff stares at the identical baseball pattern on the page. 
      Puzzling it.  Then he touches the page, and notes:  there's
      a slight unnatural thickness to this page.  It's actually
      two pages glued together.  And there's something hidden
      between them.

                                    JEFF
                    Look beyond what's right in front of
                    you...

      Jeff quickly tears at the page.  And his eyes widen at the
      sight of:  a slate-black DVD disc, with the CIRCLED M SYMBOL
      carved in it.  Identical to the one he just saw on TV.  Jeff's
      heart immediately jumps.

      He looks over at the TV.  Where "CULT" continues to play...

      EXT. JEFF'S RENTED HOUSE - NEAR THE BEACH - NIGHT

      A fog diffuses the narrow street near Jeff's rented place,
      eerily isolating:  Skye, outside her car, checking a hastily-
      scribbled address in her hand.  A figure emerges from the
      fog, approaching fast.  It's -- Jeff.

                                    JEFF
                    You came.

                                    SKYE
                    You didn't think I would?

                                    JEFF
                    You didn't have to. 
                          (beat)
                    I don't mean to keep involving you--

                                    SKYE
                    I'm already involved.  I work on
                    this show.  And until I fully
                      understand what's really going on,
                    and who's behind it, I'm as alone in
                    all of this as you are.

      Jeff regards her.  But that clearly isn't her only reason. 
      Her voice softens--

                                    SKYE
                    And I know...  there is nothing worse
                    in the world than losing someone you
                    love... and never knowing what really
                    happened to them...

      Jeff realizes she's talking about the disappearance of her
      father.  Skye meets his eye, and--

                                    SKYE
                    So -- where is it?

      WIDEN - Jeff and Skye at Jeff's desk.  Jeff lives in a small,
      one-bedroom place near the beach.  Windows open to the SOUND
      of the surf.

                                    JEFF
                    He wanted me to find it.

                    What's this mean?

                    It's a new symbol Steven is
                      introducing.  It's supposed to lead
                    into some whole new story thread.

                                    JEFF
                    Thread to what?

      Skye doesn't know.  Jeff turns the disc in his hand--

                                    JEFF
                    What's on the disc that Collins finds
                    on the show?

                                    SKYE
                    Collins puts it in and it -- it co-
                    opts his computer.  Uploads all his
                    personal information.

                                    JEFF
                    Uploads it where?  To whom?

                          (beat)
                    Collins does it because he knows --
                    the only way he's going to find his
                    wife is by stepping completely away
                    from his normal life.  Completely
                    immerse himself into this... this
                    shadow world.
                          (indicates the Circled

                    My guess is this symbol represents

                    this shadow world.

      head.  She knows better.  Moment, then her eye goes to a

      inside is a BODY.  ASIAN MALE, 35.  He's wearing one of the
      red t-shirts with the Box graphic.  His face ghostly pale,

      What a strange time for her to ask.  Then Jeff realizes --
      it's her way of dealing with the tension.  Long moment, then--

                                    JEFF
                    I lied to protect my source.  My
                    real source...
                          (beat)
                    The story never would have run without
                    a source.  And I couldn't use the
                    real one.  These scumbag cops would've
                    killed him for sure.

      Skye studies him.

                    It was a judgment call.  And I'd do
                    it again.  But... it cost me a lot,
                    too. 
                          (moment)
                    There was a girl in D.C.  I never
                    told her the truth...

                          (surprised)
                    But you told me...

      Jeff looks at her.  Yeah, he did.  He somehow trusts her in
      a way he hasn't trusted anyone else.  Play the moment.  Then--

      Jeff's laptop begins to go wild.  Rapid-fire IMAGES, wild,
      insane, begin to FLASH.  Jeff and Skye stare.  It's like
      reaching the top of the roller-coaster, when you have no
      idea what's about to come.

      The IMAGES FLASH faster and faster -- building to --
      something.  Then--

      Jeff's CELL PHONE RINGS.  Loud.  Startling them.  And very
      bizarre timing.  Jeff tentatively opens his phone.  HEARS --
      that distant STATIC again. 

                                    JEFF
                    Hello...?

                    Jeff?  Jeff... it's me.  It's Nate...

      Skye realizes.  She leans in.  Jeff cants the phone so she
      can hear, too.  Their faces very close as--

                                    JEFF

                                    JEFF
                    Yes.  How did you know?  Where are
                    you?  Nate-- !

      The connection is dead.  Skye sees Jeff's devastated
      expression.  Moment, then she notices--

                                    SKYE
                    Look...

      She indicates the LAPTOP SCREEN.  The craziness has stopped. 
      RED LETTERS are beginning to appear.

      Then, suddenly -- Billy Grimm's face appears.  It's the promo
      for the show -- but eerily distorted now, as if copied
      multiple generations.  Billy stares out at us...

      INT. SAKELIK'S PD SEDAN - NIGHT

      Back at that alley, we WATCH Sakelik slide into her sedan,
      leaving the crime scene.  She puts in the key, then notices
      that her detective's notebook has fallen from the passenger
      seat.  She reach for it, her sleeve rides up.  And--

      THERE IS ONE OF THE BOX TATTOOS ON HER FOREARM.

      She casually pulls down her sleeve, fires up the car, and--

      EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT

      Foggy here, too.  Network exec Kyle Segal exits one of the
      clubs.  Feeling like master of his universe.  He hustles
      across the street, past the AM/PM gas station where we saw
      Jeff earlier.  We GLIMPSE the Billy Grimm PROMO playing on
      the multiple PUMP TVs as Segal moves past the station.

      EXT. SMALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Segal enters this small lot behind the AM/PM.  Apparently
      deserted at this hour.  Segal is almost to his Porsche. 
      When --

      A very hot YOUNG WOMAN, in sexy black club clothes, seems to
      appear from nowhere.  Stumbling drunkenly.  Segal is surprised
      as -- she trips.  Literally falling into his arms. 

                                      SEGAL
                    Whoa!

      She looks up into Segal's eyes.  It's Kirstie.  Segal smiles
      his smarmiest smile at this very cute, very drunk, young
      woman.  And, suddenly -- a DARK FIGURE engulfs the distracted
      Segal from behind.

      INT. BACKSEAT OF A CAR - NIGHT

      A bundle is thrown in.  It's Segal.  Bound psycho-style with
      duct tape.  Eyes wide with fear.  His SCREAMS muffled. 

      Kirstie is already in the front seat.  Now someone climbs in
      behind the wheel.  Kirstie snuggles close.  We don't see the
      driver's face -- but we do SEE:  CLOSE STUDIES of what the
      driver is wearing.  Jeans, and that very distinctive vest. 
      Billy Grimm's clothes.  And, of course, that 10-inch knife.

      CAMERA PULLS OUT THROUGH the car window--

      EXT. DESERTED SIDE STREET - NIGHT

      -- and continues PULLING BACK to reveal:  the orange Valiant. 
      Parked on this deserted street.  And as it fires up and glides
      unhurriedly away... we SUPER:
