ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail
of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails
behind him. The cries of sailors echo.
Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are
looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as
Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see...
London.
Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and
mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in
relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
toward its prey.
Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and
magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The
gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The
black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from
a thousand chimneys.
London. Sulfurous London.
Anthony is awestruck.
ANTHONY
I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders
From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru,
But there's no place like London--!
Then--

Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting--
TODD
No, there's no place like London.
ANTHONY
Mr. Todd...?
TODD
You are young.
Life has been kind to you.
You will learn.
Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the
approaching city.

Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the
shadowy figures on the docks.
Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the
scale and aura of the city.
ANTHONY
Lord ... takes your breath away,
doesn't it?
Todd shudders violently, almost snarling.
TODD
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it
And its morals aren't worth
What a pig could spit
And it goes by the name Of London.
At the top of the hole
Sit the privileged few
Making mock of the vermin
In the lower zoo,
Turning beauty into filth and greed.
I too
Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders
For the cruelty of men
Is as wondrous as Peru,
But there's no place like London!
Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction
to the city.

TODD
I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My
mind is far from easy. In these once
familiar streets I feel shadows
everywhere...
ANTHONY
Shadows...?
TODD
Ghosts.
Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly:
TODD
There was a barber and his wife,
And she was beautiful,
A foolish barber and his wife,
She was his reason and his life,
And she was beautiful,
And she was virtuous.
And he was...
(a breath)
Naive.
Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...

...Fifteen years before.
Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded
flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries
their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA.
Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling.
Chatting with his wife. Happy.
TODD (V.O.)
There was another man who saw
That she was beautiful,
A pious vulture of the law,
Who with a gesture of his claw
Removed the barber from his plate.
Then there was nothing but to wait
And she would fall,
So soft,
So young,
So lost,
And oh, so beautiful!

During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a
saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches
of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her.
With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The
Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered
face never quite disguising his lethality.
The Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the
Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The
Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator.
And we return to...

Music continues.
ANTHONY
And the lady, sir ... did she succumb?
TODD
Oh, that was many years ago...
I doubt if anyone would know.
A quiet beat.
TODD
I owe you my life, Anthony. If you
hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on
the ocean still ... Thank you.
Todd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go.
ANTHONY
Will I see you again?
TODD
You might find me, if you like, around
Fleet Street.
ANTHONY
Until then, my friend.
He offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes.
Then Todd quickly turns and goes.
Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall
that hangs over his friend.

Todd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling
within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter:
TODD
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it...
He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--
7
7
--We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at
lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards
-- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London
at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending
us hurtling to--
8

Fleet Street.
We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty
and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to
it. Imposing and dead at the same time.
There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened
second floor room with a window overlooking the street.
The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in
front of the shop, considering it deeply.
The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and
then gone.
Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...

12
The Beadle is leading a nervous Lucy along an exclusive
street of dark stone mansions, grand but somehow menacing.
Lucy is wearing her best dress.
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
The Beadle calls on her, all polite,
Poor thing, poor thing.
The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite,
He blames himself for her dreadful plight
She must come straight to his house tonight!
Poor thing, poor thing.
13
15
They emerge from the pie shop. She begins to scale the
exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. He
hesitates.
MRS. LOVETT
Come along...
She continues up, he slowly follows.
16
17
Anthony, now out of his sailor's uniform, is walking along
the sidewalk near the Judge's mansion, absorbed in a copy of
Baedeker's London.
He stops, lost, trying to get his bearings, studying his map.
Then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan
bustle. It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to
see...
JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and
hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars,
humming to herself as she does needlepoint.
Anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized.
Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing. He carries a long,
wooden pole with little bird cages attached.
JOHANNA
Green finch and linnet bird,
Nightingale, blackbird,
How is it you sing?
How can you jubilate,
Sitting in cages,
Never taking wing?
Outside the sky waits,
Beckoning, beckoning,
Just beyond the bars.
How can you remain,
Staring at the rain,
Maddened by the stars?
How is it you sing
Anything?
How is it you sing?
Then ... she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below.
Music continues. There is a long look between them. Her
intense, melancholy expression moves him.
She continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of
her words seem intended only for him...
JOHANNA
My cage has many rooms,
Damask and dark.
Nothing there sings,
Not even my lark.
Larks never will, you know,
When they're captive.
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 21.

CONTINUED:
17
Teach me to be more adaptive.
Green finch and linnet bird,
Nightingale, blackbird,
Teach me how to sing.
If I cannot fly,
Let me sing.
Then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her
room. She looks terrified.
Below, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from
the window.
He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy
tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second
skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:
BEGGAR WOMAN
Alms! ... Alms! ...
For a miserable woman
On a miserable chilly morning...
(Anthony drops a coin into
her hand)
Thank yer, sir, thank yer.
ANTHONY
Ma'am, could tell me whose house this
is?
BEGGAR WOMAN
That's the great Judge Turpin's house
that is.
ANTHONY
And the young lady who resides there?
BEGGAR WOMAN
That's Johanna, his pretty little
ward. Keeps her snug, he does, all
locked up ... So don't you go
trespassing there or it's a good
whipping for you -- or any other young
man with mischief on his mind...
She suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault:
BEGGAR WOMAN
'Ow would you like a little muff, dear,
A little jig jig
A little bounce around the bush?
Wouldn't you like to push me parsley?
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 22.
17
CONTINUED: (2)
17
It looks to me, dear,
Like you got plenty there to push.
She grabs at Anthony's crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she
turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other
pedestrians as she goes:
BEGGAR WOMAN
Alms! ... Alms!...
For a desperate woman...
Anthony considers the mansion. He sees a figure standing at a
window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him.
He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:
ANTHONY
I feel you,
Johanna,
I feel you.
I was half convinced I'd waken,
Satisfied enough to dream you.
Happily I was mistaken, Johanna!
I'll steal you,
Johanna,
I'll steal you...
Then the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony
stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open...
Anthony is expecting Johanna...
But it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's
flashback, who steps into the doorway.
He seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles
and beckons to Anthony.
Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the
warm smile.
JUDGE
Come in, lad. Come in...
Anthony goes into the mansion.
18
19
The Beadle drags Anthony through a rear door of the mansion
and flings him into a filthy alley.
Anthony pulls himself up. Stunned.
BEADLE
Hyde Park is that way, young sir ... A
right and then a left, then straight
on, you see? ...

BEADLE (cont'd)
(points)
... Over there.
Flustered, Anthony turns to look--
The instant Anthony's back is turned, the Beadle swings his
lethal billyclub and SLAMS him from behind brutally, in the
kidneys -- Anthony's knees buckle--
The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck --
Anthony falls hard--
The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over--
Anthony gazes up at him, panting for breath, in agony--
BEADLE
You heard Judge Turpin, little man.
He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthony's forehead,
grinding it hard--
BEADLE
Next time it'll be your pretty brains
all over the pavement.
With that, the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the
door.
Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over,
coughing up blood.
A long beat as Anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his
face.
Still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity:
ANTHONY
I'll steal you,
Johanna,
I'll steal you!
Do they think that walls can hide you?
Even now I'm at your window.
I am in the dark beside you,
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair.
He pulls himself up, every movement is agony. He makes his
way down the alley, leaning on the wall for support.
20

The music swells as Anthony emerges from the dark alley into
the bright sunlight. He makes his way along the sidewalk:

ANTHONY
I feel you, Johanna,
And one day I'll steal you.
Till I'm with you then,
I'm with you there,
Sweetly buried in your yellow hair...
The soaring music continues as Anthony stops at a park across
the street from Turpin's mansion, bravely gazing up at
Johanna's window.
21

Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are moving quickly, she
struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. He carries
his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.
TODD
He's here every Thursday?
MRS. LOVETT
Like clockwork. Eyetalian. All the
rage he is.
TODD
Not for long.
22
DAY
22
They round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace. A
steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering
coster-mongers fill the air.
Todd and Mrs. Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan
dominating one corner of the marketplace. It is painted like
a Sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims:
"Signor Adolfo Pirelli -- Haircutter to His Royal Majesty the
King of Naples."
MRS. LOVETT
Oh Mr. T., do you really think you can
do it?
TODD
By tomorrow they'll all be flocking to
me like sheep to be shorn--
He stops abruptly when he sees--
The Beadle casually strolling through the crowd. Todd is
transfixed, his ancient enemy so close.
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 27.
22
CONTINUED:
22
MRS. LOVETT
(seeing the Beadle,
pulling his arm)
Come along now, dear, he might
recognize you--
TODD
I will do what I have vowed to do ...
(he continues to glare at
the Beadle, his voice
low)
... Come closer, my friend, closer...
Then, TOBY -- a 13-year-old boy, a bit small for his age,
malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirelli's
caravan. He bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers.
A crowd begins to gather at the caravan as:
TOBY
Ladies and gentlemen!
May I have your attention, perlease?
Do you wake every morning in shame and despair
To discover your pillow is covered with hair
Wot ought not to be there?
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
From now on you can waken at ease.
You need never again have a worry or care,
I will show you a miracle marvelous rare,
Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose
from the dead!
(A woman gasps, he smiles
and wiggles a finger no)
On the top of my head.
He dramatically doffs his cap, revealing mountains of hair
which cascade to his shoulder.
TOBY
'Twas Pirelli's
Miracle Elixir,
That's wot did the trick, sir,
True, sir, true.
Was it quick, sir?
Did it in a tick, sir?
Just like an elixir
Ought to do!
(To a Bald Man)
How about a bottle, mister?
Only costs a penny, guaranteed.
(Pours a drop on the bald
man's head)
Does Pirelli's

Stimulate the growth, sir?
You can have my oath, sir,
'Tis unique.
(Applies the bald man's
hand to the wet spot)
Rub a minute,
Stimulatin', i'n it?
Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week!
More customers are stepping up and buying bottles.
Todd opens a bottle of the Elixir, takes a whiff. Disgusting.
He smiles to Mrs. Lovett, his plan falling into place.
TODD
(loudly, to Mrs. Lovett)
Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?
MRS. LOVETT
Are we standing near an open trench?
TODD
(to a woman in the crowd)
Must be standing near an open trench!
The crowd responds to Todd and Mrs. Lovett, looking askance
and sniffing at the bottles. Toby nervously tries to distract
them:
TOBY
Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir:
Anything wot's slick, sir,
Soon sprouts curls.
Try Pirelli's!
When they see how thick, sir,
You can have your pick, sir,
Of the girls!
Want to buy a bottle, missus?
TODD
(sniffing bottle of
Elixir)
What is this?
MRS. LOVETT
(sniffing another
customer's bottle)
What is this?
TODD
Smells like piss.
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 29.
22
CONTINUED: (3)
22
MRS. LOVETT
Smells like -- phew!
TODD
This is piss. Piss with ink.
The music speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate:
TOBY
Let Pirelli's
Activate your roots, sir--
TODD
Keep it off your boots, sir--
Eats right through.
TOBY
Yes, get Pirelli's!
Use a bottle of it!
Ladies seem to love it--
MRS. LOVETT
Flies do too!
Suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung
wide to reveal--
PIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy
hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a
moment. Then:
PIRELLI
I am Adolfo Pirelli,
Da king of da barbers, da barber of kings,
E buon giorno, good day,
I blow you a kiss!
(he does so)
And I, da so-famous Pirelli,
I wish-a to know-a
Who has-a da nerve-a to say
My elixir is piss!
Who says this?!
TODD
I do.
(Todd moves forward
boldly.)
I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.
I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's
elixir, and I say to you that it is
nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted
from piss and ink.
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 30.

The crowd gasps. Pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but
Todd continues--
TODD
And furthermore --
"signor" -- I have
serviced no kings,
yet I wager I can
shave a cheek with
ten times more
dexterity that any
street mountebank.
He snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to
see, turning to display the wondrous razors:
TODD
You see these razors?
MRS. LOVETT
(to the crowd)
The finest in England.
TODD
(glaring at Pirelli)
I lay them against five pounds you are
no match for me. You hear me, sir?
Either accept my challenge or reveal
yourself as a sham.
MRS. LOVETT
Bravo, bravo.
The crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the
bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the
meek TOURIST we saw earlier.
Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the
crowd with a confident smile:
PIRELLI
You hear zis foolish man? Watch and
see how he will regret his folly!
Music begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the
challenge:
TODD
Friends, who's for a free shave?
Two men step forward. A plain wooden chair is brought for
Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan...
He carefully turns to ... The Beadle.
TODD
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 31.
22
CONTINUED: (5)
22
Mrs. Lovett's eyes shoot to Todd, alarmed--
The Beadle moves toward Todd ....
Todd smiles amiably, but quivers internally at being so
dreadfully close to his prey...
Mrs. Lovett watches, concerned. Will the Beadle recognize the
features of Benjamin Barker...?
Apparently not.
The Beadle stops right before Todd and smiles.
BEADLE
Glad, as always, to oblige my friends
and neighbors
(to the crowd)
... Let the challenge commence!
One man sits in Todd's plain chair as the other moves to an
elaborate chair on Pirelli's caravan. Pirelli shakes out a
fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. Toby prepares
Pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel
and tucks it around his man's neck.
BEADLE
Ready?
PIRELLI
Ready!
TODD
Ready.
BEADLE
The fastest, smoothest shave is the
winner.
He blows his shrill whistle. Agitated music begins.
Pirelli strops his razor quickly, Todd in a leisurely manner.
Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways
throughout, frightened of Todd's progress. He starts whipping
up lather rapidly:
PIRELLI
(while mixing furiously)
Now, signorini, signori,
We mix-a da lather
But first-a you gather
Around, signorini, signori,
You looking a man

Mr. Sweeney-so-smart--
(Splatters the customer
with shaving cream)
Oh, I beg-a you pardon -- 'll
Call me a lie, was-a only a cardinal--
Nope!
It was-a da Pope!
Unexpectedly, Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave
his man. He merely watches Pirelli's performance. Mrs. Lovett
looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it.
Pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as
he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate
gestures of wiping the razor.
PIRELLI
To shave-a da face,
To cut-a da hair,
Require da grace
Require da flair,
For if-a you slip,
You nick da skin,
You clip-a da chin,
You rip-a da lip a bit
Beyond-a repair!
Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop,
shoop, shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowd's
attention.
PIRELLI
To shave-a da face
Or even a part
Widout it-a smart
Require da heart.
Not just-a da flash,
It take-a panache,
It take-a da passion
For da art.
Todd is unconcerned. He just continues to slowly strop his
razor -- shoop, shoop, shoop -- which flusters Pirelli.
PIRELLI
To shave-a da face,
To trim-a da beard,
To make-a da bristle
Clean like a whistle,

To take-a da

While Pirelli holds this note elaborately, Todd, with a few
deft strokes, quickly lathers his man's face, shaves him and
signals the Beadle to examine him.
BEADLE
(blowing whistle)
The winner is Todd.
Pirelli deflates.
MRS. LOVETT
(feeling the customer's
cheek)
Smooth as a baby's arse! -- (to Todd) -
- Well done, dear!
The crowd laughs and applauds Todd as Pirelli goes to him:
PIRELLI
(a profound bow)
Sir, I bow to a skill far defter than
my own.
TODD
The five pounds.
Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a
five pound note, gives it to Todd:
PIRELLI
Here, sir. And may the good Lord smile
on you --
(a quick stab of a smile)
-- Until we meet again.
He bows his head quickly and then moves away, beckoning to
Toby:
PIRELLI
Come, boy.
TOBY
We're pulling out, sir?

Without warning, Pirelli SLAPS Toby viciously across the face
--Toby almost falls--
PIRELLI
(snarling)
We're pulling out, yes. Quickly.
Mrs. Lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with
Todd, who is making his way inexorably toward the Beadle.
Some eager customers surround Todd, among them is the
TOURIST.
EAGER CUSTOMER
Mr. Todd, sir, do you have an
establishment of your own?
Mrs. Lovett is on him like a hawk:
MRS. LOVETT
He certainly does. Sweeney Todd's
Tonsorial Parlor -- above my meatpie
emporium in Fleet Street.
Todd has led them right to the Beadle:
TODD
I thank you for your honest
adjudication, sir. You are a paragon
of integrity.
BEADLE
Well, I try to do my best for my
friends and neighbors ... Your
establishment is in Fleet Street, you
say?
TODD
Yes, sir.
BEADLE
Then, Mr. Todd, you will surely see me
there before the week is out.
TODD
You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford,
and I guarantee to give you, without a
penny's charge, the closest shave you
will ever know.
PAGE 35.

Todd and Mrs. Lovett are walking away from the marketplace.
She chatters happily:
MRS. LOVETT
... Like to give me a coronary right
there! What if he had recognized you!
Lord, my heart was beating a mile a
minute, just like a little finch it
was. Aren't those lovely birds now?
Always so twittery and happy...
She continues chattering...
But Todd is not listening.
His eyes dart to the side to see--
The Gentleman is walking next to him, whispering, subtle,
insinuating...
GENTLEMAN
Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned.
Like a perfect machine 'e planned...
The Banker moves in next to the Gentleman...
BANKER
Barbing the hook, baiting the trap,
Setting it out for the Beadle to snap...
The General joins them...
GENERAL
Slyly courted 'im, Sweeney did,
Set a sort of a scene 'e did...
GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL
Laying the trail, showing the traces,
Letting it lead to higher places...
Sweeney...
The last word echoes ... And then they are gone ...
disappearing from Todd's mind ... swallowed up by the crowd
of pedestrians...
Todd looks to Mrs. Lovett and she continues chattering:

MRS. LOVETT
... Suppose it's just me gentle heart,
but I do hate to see a boy treated

Doreen's dog -- Mr. Todd, are you

TODD
Of course.
But then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters. He
only sees strangers.
24
25
Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a
clinking sound. Metal on pavement.
He quickly moves across the street and looks...
A key, dropped from above.
He looks up to the shutters and smiles, then snatches up the
key and hurries off.
26
28
... Mrs. Lovett quickly moves down the steps outside the
barber shop to greet Pirelli and Toby as they are about to
ascend.
We see a new sign on the stairs: "Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial
Parlor."
PIRELLI
Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?
MRS. LOVETT
Plying his trade upstairs, don'tcher

staircase, blocking their
way, looking at Toby)

You wouldn't mind if I gave him a nice
juicy meat pie, would yer?
PIRELLI

Yes, yes, whatever you like.
Pirelli climbs the stairs, as she takes Toby by the hand and
leads him toward the pie shop door:
MRS. LOVETT
Come with me now. Your teeth is
strong, I hope?
They go into the pie shop.

Toby vaults up the stairs to the barber shop--

The Judge and the Beadle walk away from the impressive
edifices of the Old Bailey.
BEADLE
Thank you, your Honor. Just the
sentence we wanted.
JUDGE
Was he guilty?
BEADLE
Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely
done something to warrant a hanging.

order to shield her from the evils of
this world, I have decided to marry my
dear Johanna.
BEADLE
Ah, sir, happy news indeed.
JUDGE
Strange, though, when I offered myself
to her she showed a certain ...
reluctance.
The Beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy:
BEADLE
Excuse me, my lord,
May I request, my lord,
Permission, my lord, to speak?
Forgive me if I suggest, my lord,
You're looking less than your best, my lord,
There's powder upon your vest, my lord.
And stubble upon your cheek,
And ladies, my lord, are weak.
As they round a corner, the Judge feels his chin:
JUDGE
Stubble, you say? Perhaps at times I
am a little overhasty with my morning
ablutions...
BEADLE
(cheerily)
Fret not though, my lord,
I know a place, my lord,
A barber, my lord, of skill.
Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord,
Some eau de cologne to brace my lord
And musk to enhance the chase, my lord,
You'll dazzle the girl until
She bows to your every will.
JUDGE
A barber, eh? Take me to him.

BEADLE
I am honored, my lord. His name is
Todd ... Sweeney Todd. And he is the
very last word in barberin'.
They head off.
37
39
--In Todd's mind.
We are moving with him as he stalks relentlessly, holding his
razor, striding down a busy street like a tiger.
The many pedestrians he passes don't even notice him. He is
invisible to them, a wolf among the sheep, as he beckons--
TODD
All right! You, sir,
How about a shave?
Come and visit
Your good friend, Sweeney--!
PAGE 61.
40

Todd continues to stride, beckoning to another man:
TODD
You, sir, too, sir--
Welcome to the grave!
I will have vengeance,
I will have salvation!
41
41
Todd continues to stride, beckoning to another man:
TODD
Who, sir? You, sir?
No one's in the chair--
Come on, come on,
Sweeney's waiting!
I want you bleeders!
42
42
Todd continues to stride, beckoning to another man:
TODD
You, sir -- anybody!
Gentlemen, now don't be shy!
Not one man, no,
Nor ten men,
Nor a hundred
Can assuage me--
I will have you!
43
43
Todd continues to prowl...
TODD
And I will get him back
Even as he gloats.
In the meantime I'll practice
On less honorable throats--
44
44
Todd suddenly falls to his knees, keening in anguish--
TODD
And my Lucy lies in ashes
And I'll never see my girl again,
But the work waits, I'm alive at last
(CONTINUED)

(a final exalted cry)
And I'm full of JOOOOOOY!!
He raises his razor high on the soaring last note as we pull
back ... our view is suddenly obscured by a strange, frenzied
fluttering of black wings ... We continue to pull back ... We
discover the black wings are pigeons, thousands of them,
flying up in a great cloud...
We continue to pull back to finally discover that Todd is
kneeling in the heart of a church square...
Empty but for him.
As his cry ends we slash back to--

50
Anthony is racing toward the front of mansion when he sees--
A hansom cab is just pulling away -- Johanna's terrified face
looking at him through the window--
ANTHONY
JOHANNA!
Anthony sees the Beadle pulling her away from the window as
the carriage clatters off--
Judge Turpin stands on the steps of the mansion -- Anthony
goes to him in a murderous rage:
ANTHONY
Where are you taking her?! Tell me or
I swear by God--!
The Judge spins and roars -- a hellish howl that echoes--
JUDGE
WOULD YOU KILL ME, BOY?! HERE I STAND!
Anthony's eyes burn into the Judge -- but he is no killer.
He turns and races after the hansom cab. It rounds a corner
and is gone.
The Judge watches as Anthony pursues the cab, disappearing
around the corner.
And we fade to...
51
51
...The face of the Beggar Woman.
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 72.
51
CONTINUED:
51
She sits, crouched on her haunches, peering up from under her
few greasy locks of hair.
She is watching something intently. A few pedestrians move
quickly down the sidewalk past her, excited. They chatter
back and forth eagerly...
The Beggar Woman uncoils and follows...
And we finally see what the Beggar Woman has been watching so
intently...
52
52
Mrs. Lovett's wretched establishment has been transformed!
She has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables,
surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns. A fresh coat of
paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the
feeling of upward mobility.
A new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop:
"MRS. LOVETT'S WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES!" And then in smaller
letters: "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE."
The eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the
tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about.
All eating, eating, eating...
...The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever
imagine. Crispy crust. Thick, luxurious gravy. Tart and tangy
meat.
The customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming
gravy oozing down greedy faces.
Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.
The Beggar Women stands across the street, ravenously hungry.
She finally gets the nerve to approach when--
Toby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from
the shop and circulates through the customers:
TOBY
Ladies and gentlemen,
May I have your attention, perlease?
Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well
At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell?
Yes they are, I can tell...
(CONTINUED)
PAGE 73.
52
CONTINUED:
52
He moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor
garden and toward the street as:
TOBY
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
That aroma enriching the breeze
Is like nothing compared to its succulent source,
As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course.
He arrives at the street and drums up some more business:
TOBY
Ladies and gentlemen,
You can't imagine the rapture in store--
(Indicating the pie shop)
Just inside of this door!
There you'll sample
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies,
Savory and sweet pies,
As you'll see.
You who eat pies,
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies
Conjure up the treat pies
Used to be!
Just then Mrs. Lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of
hot, steaming pies.
Like her shop, she has been transformed as well. She wears
her somewhat gauche notion of a "fancy dress." Buckets of
decolletage. And her hair has been dyed a rather unique
aubergine color.
MRS. LOVETT
Toby!
TOBY
Coming!
(pushing past a customer)
'Scuse me...
MRS. LOVETT
(indicating a beckoning
customer)
Ale there!
TOBY
Right, mum!
MRS. LOVETT
Quick, now!

The customers suddenly exclaim their joy through awkward
mouthfuls of pie:
CUSTOMERS
God, that's good!
Toby scurries inside to get a jug of ale, whisks back out and
starts filling tankards as Mrs. Lovett circulates grandly.
She is a bundle of activity -- serving pies, collecting
money, giving orders, addressing the patrons individually and
with equal buoyant insincerity:
MRS. LOVETT
Nice to see you, dearie...
How have you been keeping?...
Cor, me bones is weary!
Toby--!
(Indicating a Customer)
One for the gentleman...
Hear the birdies cheeping--
Helps to keep it cheery...
She spots the Beggar Woman approaching and responds with
unusual ferocity:
MRS. LOVETT
Toby!
Throw the old woman out!
CUSTOMERS
God, that's good!
Toby shoos the Beggar Woman away, but she soon comes skulking
back.
MRS. LOVETT
(continuing to customers)
What's your pleasure, dearie?...
No, we don't cut slices...
Cor, me eyes are bleary!...
(As Toby is about to pour
for a drunken customer)
Toby!
None for the gentleman!...
I could up me prices--
I'm a little leery...

(Spilling ale)
Oops! I beg your pardon!
Just me hands is smeary--
(Spotting a freeloader
trying to sneak out
without paying)
Toby!
Run for the gentleman!
Toby catches him, collects the money, as Mrs. Lovett turns to
another customer:
MRS. LOVETT
Don't you love a garden?
Always makes me teary...
(Looking back at the
freeloader)
Must be one them foreigners--
CUSTOMERS
God, that's good that is delicious!
MRS. LOVETT
What's my secret?
(To a woman)
Frankly, dear -- forgive my candor--
Family secret,
All to do with herbs.
Things like being
Careful with your coriander,
That's what makes the gravy grander--!
The customers are getting more rabid now -- stuffing in the
gorgeous meat pies in great fistfuls--

Todd stands at the top of the stairs, watching the street
hungrily. As, below, Mrs. Lovett smiles to another customer:
MRS. LOVETT
Incidentally, dearie,
You know Mrs. Mooney.
Sales've been so dreary--
(She spots the Beggar
Woman again)
Toby!
(Continuing to the
customer, about Mrs.
Mooney)
--Poor thing is penniless.
(Indicating Beggar Woman
to Toby)
What about that loony?
(To the customer as Toby
shoos the Beggar Woman
away again)
Lookin' sort of beery--
Oh, well, got her comeuppance--
(Hawklike, to a rising
customer)
And that'll be thruppence -- and

Eat them slow, 'cos

She hangs up a "Sold Out" sign.
MRS. LOVETT AND TOBY
Come again tomorrow--!
She spots a man in need of a shave approaching:
MRS. LOVETT
Hold it--
CUSTOMERS
More hot pies!
MRS. LOVETT
Bless my eyes--!
She sees the man going up to the barber shop. Todd is still
standing at the top of the stairs. He smiles secretly to Mrs.
Lovett as he ushers the man in.
MRS. LOVETT
Fresh supplies!
The man goes into the barber shop as she happily takes down
the "Sold Out" sign and turns again to the customers:
MRS. LOVETT
How about it, dearie?
(expecting more pies)
Be here in a twinkling!
Just confirms me theory--
Toby--!
God watches over us.
Didn't have an inkling...
Positively eerie...
TOBY

Fit for a king,

There is no meat pie--

Mrs. Lovett then spots the Beggar Woman approaching again,
she spins to Toby with truly shocking viciousness:
MRS. LOVETT
Toby!
Throw the old woman out!
Mrs. Lovett watches intently as Toby leads the Beggar Woman
away.
The Customers, meanwhile, are building to a pure frenzy of
mastication -- chewing and gulping and snapping at the
heavenly pies:
CUSTOMERS
God, that's good that is de have you
Licious ever tasted smell such
Oh my God what perfect more that's
Pies such flavor

The music comes to a rousing conclusion as Mrs. Lovett stands
at the door to her shop. Triumphant.

searching through the streets for Johanna. We see him in long
shot as he moves through the contours of the city.

He starts his search in a luxurious area of wealth. His
journey through the city will take him lower and lower, into

Even now I'm at your window.
I am in the dark beside you,

increasing frenzy. She grabs a stunned Toby -- who is
carrying some packages toward the pie shop:

Tell 'em! Tell 'em!
She spots Mrs. Lovett emerging from the pie shop and explodes
in desperation, pointing madly:
BEGGAR WOMAN
Help!!! Fiend!!!
City on fire!!!
Toby pulls away from her, as she begins to scuttle off:
BEGGAR WOMAN
City on fire...
Mischief ... Mischief ... Mischief... Fiend...
She appeals to other pedestrians as she goes:
BEGGAR WOMAN
Alms! ... Alms! ...
Toby turns to consider the horrible black smoke belching from
the chimney of the pie shop. Something about the foul, ebony
smoke troubles him.

opium dens and depraved taverns of the East End.

Mrs. Lovett and Todd rest on a picnic blanket, just like any
other couple out enjoying the fine day.
The remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them
and Toby can be seen flying a kite a bit away.
Mrs. Lovett watches happy couples moving about ... dogs and
kids running hither and yon ... military officers squiring
their ladies ... nurses with prams...
Todd is distinctly ill at ease, brooding, as she chatters:
MRS. LOVETT
... which is not to say we couldn't
get some nice taxidermy animals to
bring a touch of gentility to the
place. You know, a boar's head or
two...
(glancing at the
unresponsive Todd)
Mr. T., are you listening to me?
TODD
Of course.
MRS. LOVETT
Then what did I just say?
TODD
(back in his somber
reflections)
There must be a way to the Judge!
MRS. LOVETT
(snaps)
The bloody old Judge! Always harping
on the bloody old Judge!
(she massages his neck)
We got a nice respectable business
now, money coming in regular and --
since we're careful to pick and choose
-- only strangers and such like wot

No response from Todd. She leans across and pecks him on the

MRS. LOVETT
Oooh, Mr. Todd--
(Kisses him again)
I'm so happy--
(Again)
I could--
(Again)
Eat you up, I really could!
You know what I'd like to Do, Mr. Todd?
(Kisses him)
What I dream--
(Again)
If the business stays as good,
Where I'd really like to go--
(No response)
In a year or so...

Don't you want to know?
TODD
(couldn't care less)
Of course.
MRS. LOVETT
Do you really want to know?
TODD
(forces a pained smile)
Yes, yes, I do, I do.
The music continues as she leans back comfortably, beginning
to imagine a wonderful, domestic future...
MRS. LOVETT
I've always had this dream of living
at the seaside ... I got a picture
postcard from me Aunt Nettie once. Oh,
it seems like such a grand place...
(notes Toby flying his
kite)
And all that fresh aquatic air's bound
to be good for the lad's poxy lungs...
By the sea, Mr. Todd,
That's the life I covet;
By the sea, Mr. Todd,
Ooh, I know you'd love it!
You and me, Mr. T.,
We could be alone

Down by the sea...
TODD
(grumbles)
Anything you say.
MRS. LOVETT
Wouldn't that be smashing?
And we go to...
83
83
...In Mrs. Lovett's mind.
She and Todd sit in the exact same positions as in Hampstead
Heath. Only now they are sitting on a beach.
They are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside
bathing clothes.
Toby, who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy-cheeked
in her fantasy, is building a sandcastle nearby.
Mrs. Lovett is sitting with her Dream Todd, of course, so he
has a bland smile on his face. Somewhat unnatural.
In fact, there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about
all of this.
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
With the sea at our gate,
We'll have kippered herring
Wot have swum to us straight
From the Straits of Bering.
Every night in the kip
When we're through our kippers,
I'll be there slippin' off your
slippers
By the sea...
With the fishies splashing.
By the sea...
Wouldn't that be smashing?
Down by the sea--
TODD (V.O.)
Anything you say,
Anything you say.

Mrs. Lovett strolls with Todd on a boardwalk. Artificially
lovely couples, like rotogravure magazine pictures, move
about.
Toby runs along ahead of them.
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
I can see us waking,
The breakers breaking,
The seagulls squawking:
Hoo! Hoo!
I do me baking,
Then I go walking
With yoo-hoo...
(she waves to Toby)
Yoo-hoo...

Mrs. Lovett and Todd recline on comfortable deck chairs,
having tea and scones.
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
I'll warm me bones
On the esplanade
Have tea and scones
With me gay young blade...

Mrs. Lovett's notion of a fashionable little seaside cottage.

She is making Toby try on a sweater. Todd is writing a
letter.
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
Then I'll knit a sweater
While you write a letter...

Back on the beach, she cuddles into Todd:

Toby pulls Mrs. Lovett over to examine his little sandcastle
as:
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
Don't you love the weather
By the sea?
We'll grow old together
By the seaside,
(Beckons to Todd to join
them)
Hoo! Hoo!
By the beautiful sea!
Music continues as Todd joins them. He kneels with Toby to
help him work on the sandcastle. Mrs. Lovett stands, watching
them, the picture of the doting mother.
MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
It'll be so quiet
That who'll come by it
Except a seagull?
Hoo! Hoo!
We shouldn't try it,

The music concludes as she throws her arms affectionately
around her two men.
We cut back to--
94

--Mrs. Lovett is sitting in the exact same position with
Todd. Silence.
Her smiles fades as she considers him. The grim, brooding
reality is so clear next to her lovely dream.
She watches him in silence as we fade to...
95
96
Mrs. Lovett begins going down the stairs outside the barber
shop.
Then she stops. She stands for a long moment, disturbed that
Todd's demons are again devouring him.
She looks down and sees Toby washing the tables in the
outdoor garden. Toby is serious about his work, vigorously
scrubbing the tables with soap and water.
She watches him for a moment and then continues down the
steps:
MRS. LOVETT
Toby ... Mr. Todd requires you.
TOBY
Yes'm.
He goes up the steps. She just stands, deep in thought.
97

Toby walks back to the pie shop, upset.
He stops when he sees Todd at the window above, unblinking,
gazing like a falcon into the street.
He continues on to Mrs. Lovett, who is clearing up the
remains of a meal in the outdoor garden.

TOBY
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand ... And
on the way back I went by the
workhouse. And I was thinkin' ... But

Others can desert you--
Not to worry--
Whistle, I'll be there.
Demons'll charm you
With a smile
For a while,
But in time
Nothing can harm you,

Music continues:
MRS. LOVETT
What is this foolishness now? What are
you talking about?
TOBY
Little things wot I been thinking ...
About Mr. Todd...
Not to worry, not to worry,
I may not be smart but I ain't dumb.
I can do it,
Put me to it,
Show me something I can overcome.
Not to worry, mum.
He leans into her, she puts her arms around him, but her
expression is deeply troubled.
TOBY
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true,
I don't need to,
I won't never
Hide a thing from you,
Like some.

MRS. LOVETT
Now, Toby dear, haven't we had enough

No, no, love -- this is just something

We gotta go, ma'am, right now -- we

MRS. LOVETT
Hush now, Toby, hush ... Here, you
just sit next to me nice and quiet ...
(calming)
... How could you think such a thing
of Mr. Todd, who's been so good to us?
He calms down a bit as she holds him.
And she comes to a painful, dreadful decision.
MRS. LOVETT
Nothing's gonna harm you,
Not while I'm around.
Nothing's gonna harm you, darling,

Demons'll charm you

chat right now ... 'Cause I was just
thinkin', you know how you've always
fancied coming into the bakehouse with
me to help make the pies?
TOBY
(dreamily)
Yes, ma'am.
She quickly dries her eyes and then turns him to look at her.
MRS. LOVETT
(smiles)
Well ... no time like the present.

Todd and Mrs. Lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the
barber shop, urgent. Todd has a razor.
MRS. LOVETT
... I got him locked in -- but if he
escapes he'll go to the law!
TODD
Then he can't escape.
MRS. LOVETT
Mr. T. -- I don't know -- maybe we
could--
TODD
The Judge will be here soon! I have no
time, woman! Come on--!
They turn a corner and walk straight into--
The Beadle!

MRS. LOVETT
Excuse me, sir! -- You gave me a
fright.
BEADLE
Not my intention, good madam, though I
am here on official business.
(elaborately prepares a
pinch of snuff)
You see, there's been complaints.
About the stink from your chimney.
They say at night, it's something most
foul. Health regulations -- and the
general public welfare, naturally --
being my duty, I'm afraid I'll have to
take a look ...
(inhales the snuff,
Sneezes and daintily
wipes his nose)
... at your bakehouse.
TODD
(smoothly)
Of course ... But first why don't you
come upstairs and let me attend to
you?
BEADLE
Much as I do appreciate tonsorial
adornment, I really ought see to my
"official" obligations first.
TODD
An admirable sentiment -- But I must
ask you, out of professional curiosity
you understand, is that a cream or a
tallow pomade?
BEADLE
(touches his hair)
Oh, not a pomade at all! Me secret is
a touch of ambergris.
TODD
But, sir, hair that delicate requires
a genuine pomade! Come along, let me
show you the difference.
BEADLE
(considering)
Well ... you are the expert in these
matters...

TODD
And we'll finish you off with a nice
facial rub of bay rum.
BEADLE
Oooh, bay rum is bracing.
TODD
And all on the house, for my friend,
Beadle Bamford.
BEADLE
Well, sir, I take that very kindly ...
Lead on.
TODD
(bowing)
I am, sir, entirely at your --
(his eyes flit to Mrs.
Lovett)
-- disposal.
He leads the Beadle away.
Mrs. Lovett allows herself a breath.

From across the street, we see Todd leading the Beadle up the
stairs to the barber shop, chatting with him easily.
We realize we are seeing the perspective of the Beggar Woman,
hunched across the street, watching them closely.

The Beggar Woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber
shop:
BEGGAR WOMAN
Beadle ... Beadle ...
No good hiding, I saw you!
Are you in there still?
