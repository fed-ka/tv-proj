                Thank you, Charles.  I will need 
                your help eventually, but I m still 
                mired in the early stages of

                  interested. 

  Charlie grabs his stuff off the table, hurries for the door.  
  Grabs some raspberries.

                              CHARLIE
                I gotta check something and find 
                Don.  But I ll be home for dinner.

  Charlie is gone.

  Off Alan, just another day with Charlie Eppes.

  Charlie talks to Don and Warner.  He has the NOTEBOOK open on 
  his desk.

                              CHARLIE
                I think I know why Danny Roberts put 
                so much time into picking second 
                place finishers.  He designed a 
                system that identifies arbitrage 
                  opportunities.

                              WARNER
                What does that mean?

                              DON
                Give him a minute.

                              CHARLIE
                It means he was looking for 
                  bargains.  

                              WARNER
                  Bargains?

                              CHARLIE
                The racetrack uses a parimutuel 
                betting system.  Market forces 
                  determine the odds.

                It was actually invented by a French 
                perfume maker in the 1800s--

                              DON
                Charlie.  A little focus.

                              CHARLIE
                Okay, okay.  In parimutuel betting, 
                the odds fluctuate according to how 
                much is wagered on each horse.  It s 
                like an auction...

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION

  A CALLER AT A CATTLE AUCTION reels through the increasing 
  bets.  

                              CHARLIE
                The more people there are who want 
                to buy something...

  RANCHERS signal their bids.  The CALLER keeps upping the 
  price.  

                              CHARLIE
                The more expensive it becomes.

  Going once... twice... SOLD!

  EXIT VISION

                              CHARLIE
                In horse-racing, more expensive 
                  translates into lower odds.  In 
                other words, the lower the odds, the 
                smaller the return on the bet.

                                WARNER
                So the favorite is just the horse 
                with the most amount of money bet?

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly.  And because everyone is 
                focused on picking the winner, 
                there s an active exchange of 
                  information about the favorite.  
                Tips.  News.  Even rumors.  The 
                odds end up in line with the return 
                on the risk.  It s an efficient 
                market.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS  #306/43  "Longshot"  GOLDENROD Rev  9-12-06     19.

                              DON
                But for a horse no one s paying 
                  attention to...

                              CHARLIE
                The market can be highly 
                  inefficient.  That inefficiency 
                creates situations where the 
                  potential for reward outweighs the 
                risk.  Roberts was betting on those 
                  opportunities.

                              WARNER
                But that still doesn t explain how 
                Roberts won thirty straight bets?

                              CHARLIE 
                No, it doesn t. 
                      (a beat, thinking)
                Something had to change.  Either in 
                his system, or at the track.

                Whatever it was, it got him killed,

                Well, to figure that out, I m gonna 
                need data from races; test Roberts  
                system against recent results.

                              WARNER
                How recent?

                Danny didn t even talk to other 
                people at the track.  He was too 
                focused on working his system.

  A BLANK CHALKBOARD.  Charlie and Larry pace between the 
  boards.

                              CHARLIE
                Six winners.

                              LARRY
                Six consecutive winners.

                              CHARLIE
                And a streak of thirty wins.  

                              LARRY
                All from a system designed to pick 
                the second place horse.

                In theory, it should never have 
                  happened.

  They stop pacing.  Alan enters.

                We have been dealt a paradox of 
                theory versus praxis.

                              ALAN

                more distracting than I

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUFFER: FIVE VICTIM PHOTOS on the plasma.  
  The war room is BUSY WITH AGENTS.  Don talks with Megan, 
  Colby and Warner.

                I got two overdoses and a fatal hit 
                and run.

                Other two deaths were caused by  
                drowning and a fall.

                              MEGAN
                So, all five deaths were 
                  accidental?  What are the odds of 
                that?

                About the same as all five winning 
                the Pick-Six... We need to assume 
                these are homicides.

                                WARNER
                Then kills them so they can t talk

                              DON
                So we find the money.  Connect it 
                back to Tabakian.

  Off their hurried exit.


  As usual, Charlie is scribbling on his boards.  Larry enters.

                              CHARLIE
                Don asked me to see if I could 
                connect the Pick-Six winners to 
                  Tabakian, but there isn t enough 
                data.

  Larry is distracted, doesn t answer.

                              CHARLIE
                Any data-mining algorithm would 
                require way more information than 
                we currently have...

  Larry is paying no attention, and Charlie finally notices.

                              CHARLIE
                Larry!

                              LARRY
                What?

                              CHARLIE
                Did you hear anything I just said?

                              LARRY
                You don t have enough data to 
                connect the people to your mob 
                boss.  

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly.

                              LARRY
                Then focus on the data you do have.  
                Maybe there s a way to connect them 
                through their bets.

  Larry goes back to his pacing.  Charlie stands stunned for a 
  beat.

                              CHARLIE
                Larry... That s brilliant.

  Larry waves it off, still not engaging.

                What is with you?

                Humor me.  Answer the question.

                              CHARLIE
                      (thinking out loud)
                Well, on the one hand, you don t 
                have a house.  But on the other 
                hand, you eat monochromatically...

  A beat, Charlie thinks.

                              CHARLIE
                Do you remember when I was an 
                  undergraduate in your Quantum 
                Physics class.

                              LARRY
                How could I forget?  You wrote a 
                  variation on Ed Witten s Heterotic 
                Duality that I m still trying to 
                grasp.

                              CHARLIE
                That class was the first place I 
                learned about the paradoxes between 
                quantum mechanics and general 
                  relativity.

                              LARRY
                Yes, the two great revelations in 
                modern physics create conceptual 
                problems when we attempt to 
                  intertwine them around a single 
                  explanation of gravity.  A unifying 
                theory is the brass ring for a 
                  physicist.
                      (a beat)
                What exactly are you suggesting?

                              CHARLIE
                That there s no unifying theory of 
                Larry Fleinhardt either.  We all 
                have our contradictions.

                started fixing the Pick-Six.

                What do you mean?

                              CHARLIE
                Well, at first, they were fixing 
                races once a month.  Then twice a 
                month.  And then more frequently.  
                There s a regular progression in 
                the pattern.

                              WARNER
                Charlie, we already know they were 
                fixing races...

                              CHARLIE
                But now we know exactly when they 
                were doing it.  
                      (a beat, waiting...)
                Don t you see?  Don, they killed 
                the five Pick-Six winners right 
                after they got their money.  If 
                they were killing those people, 
                then what about all the other 
                winners of other fixed races?  

                                WARNER
                That would be...

                              CHARLIE
                Eighteen other murders.

                              DON
                That s a lot of bodies, Charlie.  
                The FBI would probably know if Ivan 
                  Tabakian s group had killed 
                eighteen people.

                              CHARLIE
                Not if they staged the deaths as 
                  accidents.

                                WARNER
                Do you have the dates?

                              CHARLIE
                The dates?

                                WARNER
                For the fixed races you found.

                              CHARLIE
                Right here.

                That s another one.  Not deceased.  
                I don t think we re looking at

                Well, in the first place, it s not 
                eighteen different people...  It s 
                six guys who won a lot of bets over 
                the course of the eighteen dates

  CLOSE ON LARRY.  Fully dressed, he s sitting on the edge of

                It didn t seem to be helping.  And

                You take as long as you need...

                Thank you.

                              ALAN
                You alright?

                              LARRY
                The efforts I ve made to simplify 
                my life are becoming complicated.

                              ALAN
                You know, not too long ago, I was 
                worried about Charlie.  I wanted 
                him to be able to have a normal 
                life.  

                              LARRY
                  A challenging goal given the 
                  circumstances of his genius.

                              ALAN
                That s what I realized.  Normal may 
                not be the right target for 
                Charlie.  Maybe for you, simple is 
                off the mark.  

                              LARRY
                I can t recall it ever being 
                simple.

                              CHARLIE (O.S.)
                Larry?

                              LARRY

  Charlie enters, head buried in the NOTEBOOK.

                              CHARLIE
                I need you to look at something for 
                me.
                      (looks up)
                Why are we all in the bathroom?

  Alan shrugs.  Charlie charges on, hands the notebook to 
  Larry.

                What am I looking at?

                              CHARLIE
                That s my question.
                      (off Larry, confused)
                Look closely.  If you didn t know 
                that was evidence in an FBI 
                  investigation, what would say it 
                was.

                              LARRY
                I m still not sure I get what 
                you re asking...

                              CHARLIE
                Ignore the context of the murder 
                and maybe imagine the page a little 
                bigger, what does it look like?

                              LARRY
                It looks like a blue book one of my 
                teaching assistants has graded.

                              CHARLIE
                That s exactly what I thought. 

                              ALAN
                A blue book.  You mean one of those 
                things you guys use for student 
                exams?

                              CHARLIE
                I think someone was helping Danny 
                Roberts.  Someone who was checking 
                and improving his work.

                              LARRY
                He had an accomplice.

                              CHARLIE
                Who was very talented at math.

                So Connors is in on this.

  Just as there s a knock on the glass --


  Warner waits for Don, with Colby... 

                              WARNER
                You remember I told you how I 
                followed a drug supplier to the 
                track.

                Turns out the supplier s name was 
                on Colby s list of people who won 
                money on the fixed races. 

  She hands Don the list.

                              WARNER
                Looks like Tabakian was paying for 
                drugs by fixing races and 
                laundering the money at the same 
                time...

                Right.  The drug suppliers place 
                bets with dirty money, Tabakian 
                cashes them out with clean

  Inside, the place has been trashed.  BOOKCASES TURNED OVER,

  They clear the small house...

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUFFER: It s a crime scene now.  The FBI 
  FORENSIC GUYS are busy.  Colby talks with Warner.  Megan is

                Locals are running a neighborhood 
                canvas.  But so far, nothing.

  Colby & Megan follow a manager down a mid-scale hotel 
  hallway.

                Someone transferred the money to an 
                  off-shore account.  Techs traced 
                the transfer to an IP address in 
                use at this hotel.

                              COLBY
                  Tabakian s crew must have found the 
                login IDs for the account when they 
                tossed the girlfriend s place. 

                              MEGAN
                So they kill our only living 
                witness and take back the money. 

                              COLBY
                Why leave a half mil  on the table 
                when you don t have to. 

  They reached the door and wait as the ASSISTANT MANAGER 
  slides his PASS KEY through the door lock.

                              MEGAN
                If this is one of Tabakian s 
                crew...

  Colby nods, and they draw their weapons.


  Colby and Megan crash the room.

  SHARRLYN SMITH drops a laptop onto the bed.  Raises her hands 
  in surrender.  Her HAND IS BANDAGED.

  Megan and Colby lower their weapons.  Exchange a confused 
  glance.

                Danny asked me if I d look at his 
                system.  It just... it wasn t 
                working anymore.

                              SMITH
                Cheating was the only way to 
                explain the results.  So I wrote an 
                  algorithm that included a proviso 
                for it.

                We were afraid the Tellers would 
                notice he was winning.  But the 
                  Pick-Six... it would be enough for 
                us to start a life together...

  A beat.
