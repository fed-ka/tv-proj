      Under a brilliant white glare, one-by-one, Scott, Allison and 
      Stiles burst up from the water in the steel tubs, gasping for 
      breath.

      Fingers wrapping around the sides of the tub, Scott sits up, 
      blinking away the water dripping down his face. He peers 
      about, squinting under the glare.

      Feet land on tiled floor as the three teenagers pull 
      themselves out.

      They gaze over a large and empty, industrial white room. A 
      room that might have once housed dozens of cubicles, but is *
      now devoid of any life.*

      Soaking wet, Allison, Scott and Stiles look to each other in *
      confusion. Until they notice something even stranger...

      At the other end of the room, a massive TREE STUMP seems to 
      grow right out of the tiled floor.

      Without a word spoken, the three teens begin a cautious 
      approach. Scott reaches the stump first and looks down with 
      widening eyes at the numerous rings of the tree.

      His hand rises to his arm, pulling his wet sleeve up to gaze 
      on the two bands of his tattoo.

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    What does it mean?


      Scott presses his finger to a dust-covered table and traces a 
      circle.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know. It s just something I 
                    traced with my fingers.

      Two fingers pressed down, he draws a larger circle around the 
      first. Two rings. Just like the rings in the stump of a tree.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/132.



      Almost by instinct, Scott reaches a hand out to the rings on 
      the base of the tree stump. The moment he touches the wood 
      with his fingertips, his eyes close and--


      Windshield wipers battling the sudden torrent of rain, 
      Victoria Argent drives while talking to Allison.

                                    ALLISON
                    I get it, but it just seems kind of 
                    weird when he takes off in the 
                    middle of the night rushing out 
                    with duffel bags full of automatic 
                      weapons... 

      She pauses, sitting up in her seat as she notices--

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Mom--look out!

      Victoria SLAMS on the brakes. Tires SQUEALING, the SUV veers, *
      nearly hitting Scott as he races into the road. Swerving back 
      into their lane, Victoria struggles to right the car.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    You almost killed him.

                    He ran into the middle of the road.

                                    ALLISON
                    We have to go back.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Go back?

                                    ALLISON
                    What if he s hurt? Mom, turn 
                    around. Mom!

      With a breath of frustration, Victoria slows and spins the 
      wheel to pull the SUV into a one-eighty.


      The three surrogate sacrifices lie perfectly still in the 
      water of the steel tubs. Scott, Stiles and Allison--their 
      faces breaching the surface of the water just enough to 
      breathe while their bodies remain submerged.

      All at once, THEIR EYES SNAP OPEN and they lurch up, surging 
      back to consciousness. Water SPLASHES across the floor as 
      they each grasp for the edges of the steel tub.

                                  SCOTT
                    I saw it--I know where it is.

      One-by-one they scramble out of the tubs, soaking wet.

                    We passed it--there s a stump--this 
                    huge tree--not huge now--it was cut 
                    down--but big. Very big.

                                  SCOTT
                    It was the night we were looking 
                    for the body--

                                  STILES
                    The night you were bit by Peter.

                                    ALLISON
                    I was there too. In the car with my 
                    mother. We almost hit someone.

                                  SCOTT
                    It was me--you almost hit me.

      They look to the others, elated by their discovery.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (to Deaton)

      They face confusingly muted reactions. Deaton, Isaac and 
      Lydia share looks far less hopeful.

      Scott looks to the windows to see that it s still night. But 
      Stiles is the first to make the realization.

                                  STILES
                    How long is a long time?

      A gentle hand helps Derek drink from a bottle of water. 
      Fighting for consciousness, he slowly looks up and tries to 
      focus on the face in front of him.

      Cora. She smiles at him.

      Towel pulled tight around his shoulders, Stiles shakes his 
      head at Scott.

                                  STILES
                    No, dude. You re not going back to

                    I made a deal with Deucalion.

                      I wouldn t trust him, no. But you 
                    could certainly use him to your

                    him. Deucalion may be an enemy. But

      Scott looks to his friends, each of them ready to risk their 
      lives. Finally, he nods in agreement.

      The sound of the FRONT DOOR opening interrupts them. 
      Following Deaton, they look out to the waiting room to see 
      Ethan standing just behind the gate.

      They smile, a moment of levity. Argent notices something

      A strong wind whistles above. They hear the beams creaking, 
      wood stretching and bending. Dirt tumbles in through one of 
      the broken windows.

                    Just the wind.

      A wind that HOWLS with an unnatural strength. The three

      ominous sounds of the roof pressing down on them.

                    But I bet she has an idea. Don t

                    But you feel something, don t you?

      She hesitates. But then slowly nods.

                    What do you feel?

                                  LYDIA
                    I feel like... like I m standing in 
                      a graveyard.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1312.



      The door clicks open and Allison quickly leads Isaac and 
      Scott inside. Phone to his ear, Scott talks to Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just grab anything. Stiles, I m not 
                    smelling your dad s boxers. Socks?
                          (nodding reluctantly)
                    I ll smell the socks.

                                  ISAAC
                    What about me?

                                    ALLISON
                    See what you can find in my Dad s 
                    closet. Anything with the strongest 
                    scent.

      She turns into the office, but stops short. Special Agent 
      McCall and TWO DEPUTIES stand over her father s desk which is 
      still covered with weapons.

                                  AGENT MCCALL
                    Quite an arsenal your father s got 
                    here, young lady.

      McCall s confidence fades when Scott appears in the doorway.

                                  AGENT MCCALL (CONT D)
                    Scott--

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing here?

                                  AGENT MCCALL
                    Following one of the only leads I

                          (calling out)
                    You too, Isaac.

      With a curious look, Isaac steps in from the hall.

                                  ISAAC
                    How do you know my name?

                    To be honest, the rest of what s 
                    going on around here has me 
                    stumbling in the dark for even the 
                    smallest clue.

                                  SCOTT

                    don t have a clue, I learned that a 
                    long time ago.

      McCall gives a soft smile at the jab.

                                  AGENT MCCALL
                    I m really hoping to avoid the 
                      embarrassment of dragging my own 
                    son into an interrogation room. 
                    Really hoping.

      Allison and Isaac watch Scott, waiting for his lead. Finally, 
      he starts into the office as--


      Kali's clawed foot SMASHES the blinking red security light on 
      the alarm panel. With Aiden behind her, she turns her glare 
      on Ethan and Lydia.

                                  KALI
                    Where is he?

                                  LYDIA
                    I think he said he was heading out 
                    to do some shopping. Run a few 
                    errands. The usual werewolf 
                      afternoon.

      Kali starts toward Lydia who does her best to stand fearless. 
      Aiden watches with concern but makes no move to interfere.

                                  KALI
                    Who do you think you re talking to?

                                  LYDIA
                    Someone desperately in need of a 
                    pedicure? I d be happy to give you 
                      a referral.

      Still approaching, Kali s eyes begin to GLOW RED. But she 
      pauses at the sound of a LOW GROWL from behind her. Then 
      turns to see Aiden looking on her with palpable threat.

                                  KALI
                    Oh really?                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1314.



      Outside his loft, Derek gets into the car with Cora by his 
      side. Peter looks in from Cora s window.

                                  PETER
                    Don t call until you re at least a 
                    hundred miles from here.

      Derek pauses at the wheel, however, unsure of his decision.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Go.

      Finally, Derek shifts into gear and pulls away.


      Allison, Isaac and Scott sit stone-faced before Argent s desk 
      while a pacing Agent McCall tries to crack through to them.

                                  AGENT MCCALL
                    I m not going to lie. I m more than 
                    a little disturbed by not only the 
                    number of missing parents, but the 
                    fact that it s Stiles s father--
                          (to Allison)
                    Your father--
                          (to Scott)
                    And your mother.

                                  ISAAC
                    Mine are both dead.

      With a smug smile, he reaches to the desk for a box of mints. 
      As he takes one, McCall grabs it back out of his hands.

                                  AGENT MCCALL

                    to. You listening, Scott?

      Silent, Scott s eyes focus on an object among the arsenal on 
      Argent s desk. A FLASHBOLT.


      Clawed feet ticking across the cement floor, Kali circles a 
      stoic Aiden as Lydia and Ethan look on.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1315.

      A body falls to the floor but lands solidly on two feet. 
      Rising amid the shards of still-falling glass, Jennifer 
      levels her hate-filled gaze on Kali and the Twins.

      FADE IN:


      The claws on Kali s feet slash through the air in one 
      roundhouse kick after another. But none seem to land on an 
      impossibly fast Jennifer.*

      Ethan and Aiden race to each other to connect, but Jennifer 
      pulls them apart. Enduring a whirlwind of blows from each 
      twin, she manages to keep them from conjoining, sending one 
      and then another SMASHING into the walls.

      Lydia ducks under the debris and flying bodies, trying to 
      keep out of the fray as--

      Kali tumbles past. Furious, she snaps her head up to face a 
      frighteningly calm Jennifer.

                                  JENNIFER
                    That s right, Kali. Look at me. 
                    Look at my face. Do you know what 
                    it takes to be able to look like 
                    this? To be able to look normal.

                    It takes power like this...*

      WIND hurtles down through the broken skylight, filling the 
      inside of the loft.

      Retreating back, Kali notices the glass on the floor 
      beginning to tremble. With a mere turn of her eyes, Jennifer 
      send the shards FLYING into the air.

      Lydia throws up her hands to protect herself, eyes squeezed *
      shut as she hears the shards fall to the floor.

      Blood slipping across the cement, Kali slumps forward and her *
      red eyes slowly fade to black.

      In a SHARD OF GLASS next to her, the Twin Alpha appears 
      reflected. Jennifer whirls around as it charges toward her. 
      Swiping its claws, the lumbering creature grapples with her. *
      But in one swift move--*                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1317.

      Jennifer SNAPS the Twin Alpha s neck. The monster topples, 
      SLAMMING to the floor. 

      Satisfied, Jennifer looks over to find Lydia cowering in the *
      shadows and gives a sad shake of her head.

      OMITTED1919


      Driving far too fast, Stiles hurtles out of the Beacon Hills 
      suburbs and toward the woods.

      But something strange begins to happen. The wind picks up to 
      gale force, shaking the Jeep. Dust and dirt fly at the 
      windshield as he peers up into the black sky and the strange 
      storm tearing its way into town.


      Frustration rising, Scott levels a cold stare at his father.

                    I ve got a desk full of probable 
                    cause.

      Pushing back her chair, Allison stands to face Agent McCall. 

                                    ALLISON
                    My father is a highly respected

                    That means he has to own a few 
                    weapons.

      She approaches the desk to point out the items of Argent s 
      expertise.

      With barely a pause, Allison picks up the grenade and pulls 
      the pin. It bounces across the desk, COLORED SMOKE pluming 
      into the faces of Agent McCall and the Deputies.

      Allison spins around to Isaac and Scott.

                    Go!

      They jump out of the chairs, moving quickly as--

                      Wait--Scott, wait!

      Coughing, all he can see is a cloud of smoke while listening 
      to the sound of feet pounding across the wood floor.


      Racing into darker and darker terrain, the wind howls about 
      Stiles s Jeep, rattling it. Even threatening to topple it.*

                                  STILES
                    What the hell...

      He squints, trying to see ahead as dust hurtles at him. The *
      storm begins to thicken, obscuring Stiles s view until the 
      next thing he sees is--

      A TREE hurtling toward him. 

      The Jeep SMASHES into it with a horrifying CRUNCH of METAL. 
      Body snapping forward, Stiles slumps against the steering *
      wheel.

      A LINE OF BLOOD drips down his temple as his eyes flutter and 
      close.


      Stepping over the shattered glass, Jennifer slowly approaches *
      Lydia.*

      As Lydia blinks, Jennifer's true face appears before her. The 
      decimated face of the Darach. 

      And Lydia SCREAMS. A powerful shriek that travels up through 
      the shattered glass of the loft and into the night.


      The SCREAM hits both Derek and Cora with sudden power. They 
      swerve to a stop at the side of a road.

                    I need a Guardian. That s a role 
                    that can either be filled by the 
                    three parents I was forced to take 
                    or by you.

                                  DEREK
                    I can t help you. I m not even an 
                    Alpha anymore.

                                  JENNIFER
                    All I need is for you to help me 
                    get Deucalion in the right place at 
                    the right time.

                                  DEREK
                    You just killed three of them on 
                    your own. What do you need me for?

                                  JENNIFER
                    You ve never seen him at his 
                      strongest. I have. And if he s got 
                    Scott with him, I don t stand a 
                    chance. Unless I have you.

                    I have the eclipse in my favor. But 
                    the moon s only going to be in the

                    window. There s no decision to 
                    struggle with. Help me kill him and 
                    the others live. Just help me.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1322.



      Wind and dust continue to pummel the outside of the Jeep as 
      Stiles lies unconscious inside, barely a muscle moving 
      throughout his frighteningly still body.


      Standing over shattered glass, Cora gently takes Lydia s 
      hand, helping her to her feet.

                                  CORA
                    We need to go. Lydia? We can get 
                    help.

                                  LYDIA
                    From who?

                                  CORA
                    I don t know. But we re not staying 
                    here. Okay?

      Pushing the tears from her eyes, Lydia nods. They both pause, 
      however, when they hear a strange sound. Bones SNAPPING, skin 
      STRETCHING. 

      Lydia and Cora turn to discover the Twin Alpha has separated 
      back into Ethan and Aiden. With a brief glance to each other, 
      the girls rush over to the bodies.

      Putting a hand over Ethan s heart, Cora looks to Lydia at 
      Aiden s body.

                                  CORA (CONT D)
                    They re alive.


      Feet pounding down the stairs, Allison and Isaac charge in to 
      find the dusted and dirtied parents tied to posts.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh God--thank God.

      Allison reaches for her father. He blinks away the dust to 
      look at her in pride.

                                  ARGENT

                                  ISAAC
                    They re on the way. They re coming 
                    to help.

      He and Allison begin to pull and tug at the ropes, trying to 
      loosen the complicated knots as quickly as possible.

      But they both pause when they hear an ominous CREAK from 
      above. All eyes turn to the MOONLIGHT blinking through the 
      holes in the ceiling. And the sound of wind picking up its 
      pace.


      With the last of the rope bindings falling to the floor, 
      Allison and Isaac help the parents to their feet.

                                  ISAAC
                    Hurry.

      The group turns for the stairs. But hearing the wind above 
      increasing velocity, they pause. The root cellar SHAKES *
      violently, as if hit by an earthquake.

                                  STILINSKI
                    What the hell was that?

      He s answered by a loud CREAK, SNAPPING sounds all around 
      them. Argent and Melissa take cautious steps back from the 
      walls. Allison and Isaac look to the ceiling as--

      Another VIOLENT TREMOR sends clouds of dirt bursting in and 
      fragments of wood flying. Hand raised over his face, Isaac s 
      eyes widen as he sees--

      THE STAIRS RIP right off the wall and COLLAPSE in a heap of *
      splintering wood and cracking stone.*

      As the dust settles, the group peers up to the entrance now 
      blocked from the outside by branches and dirt steadily 
      pouring in. The parents and two teenagers glance to each 
      other in rising fear while--*

      THE WIND HOWLS louder and louder.*


      Deaton helps Lydia and Cora drag the unconscious Ethan and 
      Aiden into the examining room. Blood at their lips and noses, *
      the twins barely seem to be breathing.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1327.

                                  DEATON
                    Cora, there s an extra steel table 
                    in that room. Hurry. Lydia, grab 
                    his feet.

      As Cora races to get the other table, Lydia and Deaton lift 
      Ethan onto the first. A moment later, Aiden lands on the 
      second table.

      Lydia looks on the mixture of red and black blood dripping 
      from their mouths.

                                  LYDIA
                    What do we do?

                                  DEATON
                    I m not sure yet.

      Deaton feels at Ethan s ribs, gently pressing against them.

                                  CORA
                    Can you save them?

                                  DEATON
                    Only if they start healing on their 
                    own. But getting them to start 
                    healing? That s the hard part.


      Wind tearing through the trees outside, Scott notices dust 
      swirling about his feet inside the distillery. He and 
      Deucalion look to the open doors.

      A hazy SILHOUETTE approaches. Coming into focus, it splits 
      into two. Jennifer and--to Scott s shock--Derek.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing?

                                  DEREK
                    This might be hard to believe, but 
                    I m actually trying to help you.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Like brother against brother. 
                    There s something very American 
                    about this.

      He collapses his cane and begins removing his jacket.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Are you ready Jennifer?                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1328.

      Jacket falling to the ground at his feet, he starts toward 
      her, VOICE becoming strangely demonic.*

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Did you gather your herbs? Pray to 
                    your ancient gods and your oak 
                    trees? Slit a baby s throat, *
                    perhaps?*

      Derek looks to Jennifer and notices the fear on her. The 
      absolute terror.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Should we show them why you needed 
                    to sacrifice nine innocent people 
                    just to face me? Or is it twelve 
                    now?

      Fangs appear between Deucalion s darkening lips as he begins 
      to transform. The color of his skin falls to an ashen gray, 
      shirt tearing at the seams as his muscles enlarge. 

      Eyes surging a SCARLET RED, Deucalion becomes the DEMON-WOLF. 
      He unleashes a EAR-SHATTERING ROAR and charges in for the 
      kill.

      While the dust storm outside threatens to crush the very 
      framework of the root cellar, the teenagers and three adults 
      search for another escape.

      Standing on broken shelves, Isaac tries to reach up to the 
      entrance--

                                  ARGENT
                    Look out!

      BEAMS SNAP above their heads, wood splintering as the roof 
      and walls literally begin to cave in on them.


      Blood dripping from his forehead, Stiles refuses to stir. 
      Completely unconscious.*


      Roaring back, Derek, now transformed as well, meets 
      Deucalion s attack head on. But the Alpha is far too fast and 
      far more powerful.

      Scott barely has a moment to even react as Deucalion rips 
      into Derek, hurling him back. Almost instantly, the Alpha has 
      his hands on Jennifer, slamming her down.

      Blood spitting, bones snapping, he defeats them with shocking 
      efficiency. The pair of sinister RED EYES fall on Scott.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Kill her.

      Barely breathing, Scott looks down at Jennifer as she tries 
      to crawl towards Derek.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Do it.

      Scott hesitates. Deucalion responds with a SUDDEN ROAR. 
      Scott s body responds to the echoing snarl by arcing up, head 
      snapping back as his eyes surge YELLOW.

      Claws out, he looks up in shock to find himself transformed *
      by Deucalion s roar.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1330.

                    Currents. Kill her and it ends.

      Fangs clenched, Scott slowly peers down at his own clawed 
      hand. Then to Derek and Jennifer both trying to pick 
      themselves up from the floor.

      Isaac, Allison and the parents desperately try to push back 
      against the walls and beams supporting the ceiling even as 
      the very structure of the root cellar appears to be 
      collapsing in on them.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1331.



      Cora and Lydia help Deaton as he struggles to save the twins. 
      Each girl holds one twin by the back of the head. Deaton fits 
      an oxygen mask on Ethan.

      As Cora wipes the blood from Aiden s mouth, Deaton tears open 
      a package of syringes. Moving fast, but with ever-heightening 
        desperation.


      Charging toward him, Deucalion grabs Scott by the back of his 
      neck like a dog grabbing a puppy by the scruff. Hand gripping 
      his wrist, Deucalion raises Scott s claws.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Maybe you just need a little 
                    guidance.

      He drags a struggling Scott toward Jennifer, intent on 
      killing her with the boy s claws. None of them notice outside 
      the doors where--

      IN THE SKY, the moon begins to completely disappear under the 
      Earth s shadow.

                                  SCOTT
                    I forgot to tell you something. 
                    Something Gerard told me.

      Deucalion pauses, vise-like grip still on Scott s right hand 
      and neck. He doesn t see Scott pulling his left hand from his 
      pocket.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    One of the last things he said to

      Scott raises a handful of FLASHBOLTS he took from Argent's 
      office. Then hurls them at the ground.

      EXPLOSIONS of LIGHT burst up around them. Deucalion, Derek 
      and Scott are all blinded, none of them immune to the searing 
      glare of the flashbolts.

      Blinking rapidly, Deucalion releases Scott. All Of them 
      unable to see anything but confusing WHORLS OF LIGHT.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1332.

      Time seems to slow down. Dark shapes drifting about a 
      brilliant haze.

      Out of the glow, Scott s eyes attempt to focus in almost 
      total darkness. He sees Deucalion, features returned to 
      human.

      the Earth s shadow.

      The walls and ceiling continue their collapse, closing in on 
      the group. Stripped of his supernatural power, Isaac buckles 
      under the weight.

                    I can t hold it--I can t do it!

      Stilinski slips in beside him to help. Argent, Allison and 
      Melissa follow, hands and backs pressed against the beam.

                    It s too heavy--it s too much.

      They begin to crumble underneath the collapsing weight, 
      looking about to be crushed.

      TWO FEET hit the floor of the cellar.

      AN ALUMINUM BASEBALL BAT slides under the beam just as it 
      DROPS DOWN another inch. Astonishingly, it holds.

      Stilinski turns to find Stiles somehow kneeling right next to 
      him. He looks at the bat. Then to his son.

      Turning, eyes searching, a now human Scott looks about the 
      darkness with rising fear. Derek stands, peering about as *
      well, while Deucalion listens for movement. And then Scott *
      sees something.

                    Oh no...

        A terrifying figure in black approaches from out of a 
      veritable tornado of dust, leaves and dirt.

      From behind her jagged teeth, a GUTTURAL VOICE issues out.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1334.

                                  JENNIFER
                    My turn.

      Under flashes of LIGHTNING, the black-cloaked creature called 
      the Darach hurtles toward them.

      Scott s feet leave the ground. A pained GASP escaping his 
      lips, he FLIES BACK, smashing into steel and metal. With an *
        unparalleled rage, the Darach drags Deucalion up, twisting 
      him about and CRUSHING HIM down into the floor.

      With only his human senses to help him, he barely stands a 
      chance. Hand on the back of his head, the Darach slams him 
      into the cement. Blood fills the cracks.

      Through blurred vision, Scott watches the Darach nearly break 
      Deucalion into pieces.

                                  DEREK
                    Jennifer.

      She snaps her eyes to him.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    He doesn t know.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Know what?

                                  DEREK
                    What you really look like.

      The rage disappears momentarily. She looks down at the 
      gasping Deucalion.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    He knows the cost of bringing Kali 
                    into his pack. But he s never seen 
                    the price you paid.

      Deucalion s BLIND EYES dart about in fear.

                                  JENNIFER
                    No... No, he hasn t.

      Confused, Scott watches the Darach slowly place her pale hand 
      on Deucalion s face, covering his eyes. As LIGHTNING flashes 
      about the distillery, the Darach s eyes begin to GLOW WHITE.

      The process is clearly not painless as Deucalion CRIES OUT. 
      Finally, the Darach staggers back, releasing him.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1335.

                    Turn to me.

      Hands pushing himself up, Deucalion opens his healed eyes to 
      see Scott lying just near him, barely able to move.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    TURN TO ME.

      Slowly, Deucalion looks back at the Darach s horrifically 
      scarred face. The vacant eyes. The ruined teeth. And the 
      moment he blinks--

      It s Jennifer again. Shape-shifted back to her more desired 
      appearance. Breathing hard, she starts forward to finish him. 
      But she falters, looking as if she s about to fall.

      Derek places a hand on her back, steadying her.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    What... what is this?

                                  DEREK
                    Healing him made you weak. Just 
                    like healing Cora did to me. You 
                    won t have your strength for at 
                    least a few minutes.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Then you do it. Kill him.

                                  DEREK
                    No.

                                  JENNIFER
                          (stunned)
                    What?

                                  DEREK
                    Like my mother used to say, I m a 
                    predator. I don t have to be a 
                    killer.

      He grabs her by the throat, overpowering her even as a human.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    But I will if it saves their lives.

      Grasping onto him, she struggles to free herself. But Derek 
      only tightens his grip, strangling her.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Let them go.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1336.

      Furious, she picks him up off his feet, SLAMMING HIM into the 
      wall. Somehow he manages to hold on, still choking her. 
      Jennifer cracks his head against the wall, again and again. 
      Still, he endures.*

      FLASHBACK - Boyd and Cora slash at Derek in the high school s 
      basement. But he holds on, unwilling to let them go. 
      Enduring.

      Enraged by his betrayal, Jennifer CRACKS his head against the 
      wall again. But this time, it s like flipping a switch. 
      Because when he turns to face her--

      His eyes are GLOWING BLUE.

      Behind Derek, Scott stands as well. A silhouette with GLOWING *
      YELLOW EYES, an OMINOUS GROWL emanating from between his *
      teeth. 

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Your fifteen minutes are up.

      He shoves Jennifer back, sending her crashing to the ground. 
      As she scrambles to her feet, Scott and Derek close in on 
      her.*

      Desperate, Jennifer does the only thing she can. Her fist 
      comes up, then opens wide, releasing a handful of MOUNTAIN 
      ASH into the air. It falls into a perfect circle around her.

      Scott slams to a halt as he hits the barrier and a 
      TRANSLUCENT RIPPLE appears briefly about her.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Like I told you, Derek. Either you 
                    or the parents. And I guess I ll 
                    just have to take them. A few more 
                    minutes, they ll be dead and I 
                    won t need a lunar eclipse even to 
                    kill a Demon-Wolf.

      Her eyes turn to Scott, watching curiously as he pulls 
      himself up to approach.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                          (shaking her head)
                    You ve tried this before Scott. I 
                    don t remember you having much 
                    success.

      Hands held up, Scott attempts to breach the barrier. The same *
      way he tried to breach the circle of ash that surrounded *

      Wind whipping up about him, he pushes forward. Once again, 
      the skin begins to tear from his face and hands.

      At the same time, Deucalion rises from the floor and catches 
      a glimpse of himself in the reflection of a steel drum. The 
      sight of his own face seems to take the breath from him. But 
      then he turns to see--

      Scott, still pressing forward and blinking back the pain as 
      his YELLOW EYES begin to change.

      Derek, Deucalion and an equally shocked Jennifer watch the 
      boy s eyes fill with sparks of ORANGE, somehow darkening into 
      a FIERCELY VIBRANT RED.

      With a last monumental effort, Scott steps through. 

      The MOUNTAIN ASH bursts up into a cloud around Jennifer. She 
      staggers back, falling to her knees.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                            (astonished)
                    How--how did you do that?

      RED EYES gazing down on her, Scott responds with a powerful, 
        otherworldly voice.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m an Alpha now.

      She backs away, but he moves quickly, cornering her.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Whatever you re doing to cause the 
                    storm, make it stop or I ll kill 
                    you myself. And I don t care what 
                    it does to the color of my eyes.

      Before she can even respond--

                                  DEUCALION
                    It won t change the color of mine. 
                    So allow me.

      Deucalion charges in and SLASHES her throat with his claws. 

      Jennifer s hands rise to her bloodied neck. She slowly begins 
      to fall. And as she falls, her body changes from Darach to 
      Jennifer and back again, until the moment she hits the ground 
      and--                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1338.



      The wind abruptly stops, dust and dirt falling to the floor 
      as if a switch had been flipped. Quiet surrounds the startled 
      group as they glance to each other.

                                    ALLISON
                    Is it over?


      Feet slowly touching the cement floor, Ethan stands on his 
      own with Cora s help. He looks on her with appreciative eyes. 
      Still lying on the steel table, Aiden peers down to find 
      Lydia holding his hand.

                                  AIDEN
                          (struggling to speak)

                                  AIDEN
                    I knew you liked me.

      And he smiles at her as she shakes her head, not noticing 
      Deaton watching her with a considerable look of admiration.


      Stiles pulls his ringing phone out of his pocket and puts it 
      to his ear.

      Scott looks to a bloodied but very much alive Derek and nods.

      Finally, the group breathes. Isaac is the first to HOLLER in 
      relief. Joined by the others, shouting and hollering in the 
      now very small space of the root cellar.


      Peeking in through the open door, Allison watches her father 
      pack away the weapons, locking them into their respective 
      cases.

      Bag slung over his shoulder, Derek steps past the steel door 
      with Cora at his side, both of them preparing to leave Beacon 
      Hills.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                      I honestly don t know if he s ever 
                    coming back. Part of me hopes so. 
                    But another part hopes that maybe 
                    he ll be okay somewhere else.

      Looking back on the empty loft flooded with light, Derek 
      slowly pulls the door closed. Then puts his arm around his 
      sister, leading her into the shadows.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1341.



      At the end of the hall, a worried Melissa watches her ex-

      knock.

                    My Dad doesn t look like he s going 
                    to be leaving for a while.

      The door clicks open. His father smiles at him. Scott doesn't 
      smile back.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    But just because he s staying, 
                    doesn t mean he s welcome.

      Down the hall, Melissa watches the door SLAM shut in McCall's 
      face. Turning away, she tries not to smile. But can't quite 
      help it.


      Students hurry through the school, a day like any other.

                    Stiles and I both feel it. Every

                    And it makes me think about that 
                    quote Jennifer used to start our

                    I look for my friends.

      Scott carries his motorcycle helmet proudly under his arm as *

      He sees Allison smiling at Isaac as they step down the *
