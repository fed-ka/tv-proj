  A BLURRY, OUT OF FOCUS SHOT of a FIGURE running towards us 
  in SLOW MOTION. No sound except LABORED BREATHING. The 
  Figure comes into focus:

  SPARTACUS,

  bare chested, wielding two swords, his eyes glinting with 
  impending violence. The CROWD ROARS as we RAMP TO NORMAL 
  TIME. Spartacus slams into a HOPLOMACHUS, his swords 
  expertly slicing into the Gladiator s flesh. He slices open 
  the man s neck in a geyser of gore, the BLOOD WIPING US TO:

  A SERIES OF FIGHTS

  in the arena, spanning several months. One after the other, 
  building in speed and ferocity as Spartacus decimates all 
  who oppose him: A MURMIILLO gets his arm hacked off. A 
  THRAEX is run through the chest with both of Spartacus  
  swords. Throats are slit and limbs are lost as Spartacus 
  becomes increasingly splattered in the blood of his 
  opponents, culminating in

    A PROVOCATOR

  being decapitated by Spartacus. He uses a scissor-like move, 
  his two swords crossed then whipped outward, catching the 
    Provocator s neck in between.

  THE CROWD ERUPTS

  as the man s head topples to the sand, followed a moment 
  later by his body. Spartacus throws his swords up in 
  victory, a vicious smile bending his lips: he s actually 
  enjoying this. THE PULVINUS

  SLAVES fan the cheering PATRICIANS that crowd the pulvinus. 
  NAEVIA stands near BATIATUS and LUCRETIA, who sit with 
  ILITHYIA in the front row. Ilithyia barely hides her disdain 
  for Spartacus. SOLONIUS sits opposite Batiatus, trying to 
  ignore his gloating rival.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus, victor again! It is a 
                        marvel good Solonius has any men 
                        left!

  The Patricians laugh as they rise to exit, the games 
  concluded. Solonius forces a smile, fuming.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Must the Thracian appear in every 
                        primus? Does the House of Batiatus 
                        not deem another gladiator worthy 
                      of spectacle?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        They have no one else of note.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus will return to glory 
                        presently.

  Solonius bows as he exits, not believing it.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      As you say.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        A welcome addition. I grow tired of 
                        seeing the Thracian and his 
                        victories.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Perhaps something of note to erase 
                        the tedium. I purchase a fresh 
                        batch of slaves at tomorrow s 
                        auction, to be trained as 
                          gladiators...

  He gives Lucretia a knowing look. She catches his plan, 
  initiates it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We would be honored if you would 
                        grace us at the unveiling.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                  excited)(
                        What sort of beasts shall you 
                        procure?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only the most ferocious, to be 
                        displayed for your pleasure.

  He smiles, eyes twinkling as they exit, WIPING US TO --

  BATIATUS

  approaching with DOCTORE and ASHUR in tow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fortune favors us! A fine 
                        selection, and enough coin to have 
                        our pick.

                        Your competitor approaches.

  Ashur nods towards Solonius making his way through the 
  crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You give the man credit beyond his 
                        position.
                                (to Solonius, 
                                  loudly)
                        Solonius! My heart brims with joy! 
                        I had hoped to see you here, buying 
                      up more men for Spartacus to 
                        slaughter!

  The Crowd laughs. Solonius steps close to Batiatus, bowing 
  slightly.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Batiatus... now purse-proud and so 
                        potent with charm.

                                        BATIATUS
                        How quickly Fortuna shifts her 
                        blessings.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A fact that beloved Ovidius was 
                        unexpectedly made aware.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You speak truth. His murder was a 
                        deep tragedy.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Indeed. One can never know who is 
                        plotting violence, can they?

  Batiatus  smile curls, punctuating the thinly veiled threat. 
  Doctore interrupts.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The auction begins, Dominus.

                      To business, then.

  Batiatus moves closer to the auction with Doctore and Ashur. 
  Solonius glares after them, his hatred for Batiatus 
  expanding exponentially.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The Gaul Segovax demands expense.  
                        And perhaps the two German 
                        brothers, Duro and Agron.

                      Of little worth.

  THE SLAVE TRADER, a seedy peddler of human flesh, steps 
  forward to address the crowd.

                                        SLAVE TRADER
                        Good citizens of Capua! Behold the

                        imposing virtues! I give you 
                        Segovax!

  SEGOVAX, an imposing Gaul, steps forward. Two barbaric 
  German brothers, AGRON and DURO, stand behind him. From the 
  looks on their faces, they don t care for Gauls.

  enters the square, whip in hand. The Gladiators respectfully

                        Five. On the fool.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus steps out, followed by Lucretia and a flushed 
  Ilithyia, who excitedly ogles the Recruits below. Naevia and 
  a few attending Slaves hover in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have been blessed! Each and 
                        every one of you, to find 
                        yourselves here, in the ludus of 
                        Quintus Lentulus Batiatus! Finest 
                        purveyor of gladiators in all the 
                        Republic!

  The Gladiators CHEER. Spartacus allows himself a grim smile. 
  Ilithyia glances at Batiatus, whispers to Lucretia.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Your husband speaks as my father 
                        would before the senate.  He is 
                        quite the orator.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Prove yourself, in the hard days to 
                        follow.  Prove yourself more than a 
                        common slave.  Prove yourself more 
                        than a man.  Fail, and die.  Either 
                        here where you stand, or sold off 
                      to the mines.

                        titans!

  The Gladiators ROAR their approval. Doctore CRACKS HIS WHIP, 
  silencing the uproar. He surveys the Recruits with 
  dissatisfaction as he continues his  welcoming  speech from 
  ep. 102.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A Gladiator does not fear death. He 
                        embraces it. Caresses it. Fucks 
                        it...

                        They are spectacles! I find myself 
                        growing quite fond of this sordid 
                        business of gladiators.

  Batiatus and Lucretia share a glance, sensing opportunity.

                        Perhaps you should consider 
                        purchasing one of your own.

                        Choose a recruit, and he is yours 
                      -- for a nominal fee, of course. 
                        Such funds to cover the expense of 
                        his upkeep and training.

  Ilithyia hesitates, a little girl presented with the option 
  of too much candy. She giggles, unable to resist.

  Gladiators HOWL. Spartacus chuckles. Doctore CRACKS his whip

  The Recruits hesitantly remove their covering. The

  Naevia nods, exits. Ilithyia giggles as she follows her 
  inside. Batiatus stops Lucretia, whispers in her ear.

                                        BATIATUS

  CLOSE ON the bloodied, dead face of Recruit #4 as his body 
  is tossed onto a table by Guards. No glory in the arena for 
  him. WIDEN TO REVEAL MEDICUS inspecting Crixus  wounds. 
  Crixus stands stoic, masking the pain. Batiatus tensely 
  awaits the news.

                                          MEDICUS
                        His wounds need yet more time.

                        A fortnight or two. Possibly three.

                        Recovery may be aided by certain 
                        herbs absent the apothecary.

  Medicus hands Batiatus a list scrawled on a scrap of 
  parchment.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus, I have been without sword 
                        for too long. Let me resume 
                        training.

  Batiatus considers Crixus, his wounds.

                        will return to your hand soon 
                        enough.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Crixus  crushing disappointment...



  Gladiators and Recruits train under Doctore s ever watchful 
  eye. Wooden swords CLASH, nearly missing CAMERA as it SLOWLY 
  PUSHES through the action: Agron spars with Varro. Rhaskos 
  against Duro. Hamilcar and a ND RECRUIT. Segovax spars with 
  Spartacus (two swords, no shield). CAMERA finally escapes 
  unscathed to find

  CRIXUS,

  fuming on a table in the mess hall, glaring at Spartacus. 
  Aching to return to training, sword hand absently clenching 
  and unclenching into a fist.

                        considers selling you to another 
                        master.

  The words are as difficult to give as to receive.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You are mistaken.

                        Would that it were so. Ashur has

                        and to question Vibius on his

                        reward!

  Naevia reaches through the bars and squeezes Crixus  arm.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You must prove to Dominus that your 
                        time has not passed. And prove it 
                        quickly.

  Naevia retreats, disappearing up the stairs to the villa. 
  OFF Crixus, smoldering...



  The Gladiators and exhausted Recruits continue to spar. 
  Doctore strides among them.

                                          DOCTORE
                      To step upon the sands as a 
                        gladiator is the highest station a 
                        slave can pray for. Prove 
                        yourselves. Earn the mark of the 
                        brotherhood. And fight with honor.

  He passes Spartacus, glaring at him as he goes. Spartacus 
  ignores him, deflecting a series of blows from Segovax.

                        when you thrust. It leaves you open 
                        from shoulder to neck. Again.

  Segovax attacks, but his shield dips again. Spartacus cracks 
  him across the shoulder. Segovax grunts in pain.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You strike a solid blow.

  Spartacus turns to see Crixus approaching.

  Segovax glares. Doctore glances over, says nothing.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He may be a fool. But he is one 
                        that is fit to train.
                                to Segovax)(
                        Again.

  Segovax steels himself, but Crixus isn t done yet.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You doubt that I am fully healed? I 
                        would show you otherwise.

  Spartacus gauges Crixus, a faint smile bending his lips.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Doctore! Crixus offers a 
                          demonstration, to the benefit of 
                        the recruits! Shall I indulge?

  Doctore glances up to

  THE BALCONY

  where Batiatus has appeared, chewing grapes. Lucretia and 
  Naevia are with him.

  Lucretia pushes aside her worry, her only concern preventing 
  Crixus from being sold.

                      As do I.

  Batiatus considers, then nods permission to Doctore, curious 
  of the outcome. TRAINING SQUARE

                                          DOCTORE
                        Segovax! Your sword and shield.

  Crixus grins as Segovax trots over, relinquishing his sword 
  and shield to Crixus. He relishes the feel of them: old 
  friends, reunited. Doctore cracks his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Attend!

  All eyes turn towards Spartacus and Crixus. PUSH IN on 
  Spartacus as he extends invitation to Crixus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Show me.

  CRIXUS attacks with fierce determination. Spartacus is 
  surprised by the fluidity of the assault. It s as if Crixus 
  had never been injured.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia steps to the edge of the railing, her eyes dancing. 
  Behind her, Naevia takes in her lover s display, hope 
  swelling.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus deflects and defends, not attempting to strike 
  back. Instead he s letting Crixus overexert himself, much 
  like Crixus did to him in the arena in episode 103. Crixus 
  grunts from the effort, sweat springing from his brow. 
  SPARTACUS SUDDENLY COUNTERS,

  reversing the attack. Crixus is driven back under the 
  assault of Spartacus  twin swords. TIME SLOWS AND 
    ACCELERATES. Crixus swings his sword. Spartacus bends, the 
  blade contrailing the air an inch from his upturned face. He 
  answers the attack, brutally sending Crixus to the sand.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia reacts. Naevia barely conceals her concern.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  To prove a point, Spartacus calls out Crixus  missteps (a la 
  Doctore in Ep. 102).

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      He attacks boldly to hasten 
                        victory. Counter to proper 
                        training.

  Crixus brims with anger, surges forward. TIME SLOWS AND 
  ACCELERATES as Spartacus counters, sending him toppling once 
  more to the sand.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Defeat is delivered not only by the 
                        sword, but also the crowd.
                                (locks eyes with 
                                  Crixus)
                        Fall from their grace, and you may 
                        never rise to former glories.

  Crixus grunts in pain as he rises. Blood seeps from his 
  stomach wound, having partially reopened.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        A true gladiator is taught to 
                        embrace pain and suffering. To 
                        fight until life flees from his 
                        worthless body.

  Crixus attacks, eyes wild with rage. Spartacus delivers a 
  lightning quick combination. Crixus  sword and shield tumble 
  from his grasp as he smashes to the sand, dazed, bloodied, 
  and humiliated.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Learn from this man. Or share his 
                        fate.

  Spartacus rears back with one of his swords, intent on 
  bashing Crixus  skull in.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus.

  Spartacus pauses, glancing up at Batiatus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Return to training.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Dominus.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.
  CONTINUED:

  Spartacus bows slightly, turning his back on Crixus as he 
  rejoins the Gladiators and Recruits. Crixus spits out a 
  mouthful of blood, tries his best to stand, but his 
  aggravated wounds are too much. He glances up to

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus holds his gaze for a moment, then turns away, 
  exiting into the villa. The crestfallen look on Lucretia s 
  face says it all: Crixus has just doomed himself. Lucretia 
  reluctantly joins Batiatus inside. Naevia shares a final, 
  pained look with Crixus before following.

                                          DOCTORE

                        Rhaskos. Hamilcar. See him to

  Rhaskos and Hamilcar help Crixus to his feet, WIPING US TO

  Ashur stands with VIBIUS.

                                        ASHUR
                        A fine offer, good Vibius. I shall 
                        hasten to present it to my master.

  Vibius nods, exits. Ashur spots Solonius approaching, tries 
  to avoid him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                to Ashur)(
                        A moment, slave.

  Ashur turns, masking his hatred with a practiced smile.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        You frequent the market absent 
                        Batiatus?

                                        ASHUR
                        I conduct important business on his 
                        behalf.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Regarding the former Champion of 
                        Capua?

  That catches Ashur by surprise. Solonius clocks the 
  reaction.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would, if found in similar 
                        position. Crixus is champion in 
                        name only. He is but limbs, 
                        dangling from a skewered trunk. 
                        Your master would be well served 
                        pawning him off on a toad like 
                        Vibius.

                                        ASHUR

                      My concern is not for him, but 
                        about him.

  Solonius produces a pouch of coins.

                        Are your ears receptive?

  Ashur eyes the pouch hungrily.

                                        ASHUR
                        I cannot stop a free man from 
                        speech.

                        Were Batiatus to seek reprisal for 
                        offenses he believes I have made, I 
                        would have warning in advance.

  Ashur considers that for a beat, bows slightly.

                                        ASHUR
                        I am a villain.

                        Loyalty can become a crushing 
                        weight, if not braced with proper 
                        support. When your back begins to 
                        break, you will find my shoulders 
                        broad and welcoming.

  Agron, Duro and the Recruits are constructing the training 
  bridge for the final test.  Ilithyia steps out with Batiatus 
  and Lucretia, her face decaying as her eyes fall on

  SEGOVAX

  in the training square, being NAILED TO A CROSS by Hamilcar 
  and Rhaskos.  Doctor, Spartacus, and the Gladiators bear 
  witness.  Segovax screams, the pain driving him to near 
  insanity.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

  Ilithyia stands horrified.

                        Your man would not speak as to his 
                        reason, even when parted with his 
                        cock. Did he give any sign of cause 
                        when you met with him last night?

  Ilithyia forces a smile, giving nothing away.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        No. It is a mystery.

  She turns away. Lucretia eyes her, well versed enough in 
  lies to know when presented with one. THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus joins Spartacus. They stand in silence, not looking 
  at each other as Hamilcar and Rhaskos raise the cross. 
  Segovax groans, nearly unconscious.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I will regain my position, 
                        champion.

                                  looking)
                        I welcome the attempt.

  CAMERA RISES over the back of the cross, looking down at the 
  two rivals. Separated by the vertical beam. Forever joined 
  together in death and brotherhood.
