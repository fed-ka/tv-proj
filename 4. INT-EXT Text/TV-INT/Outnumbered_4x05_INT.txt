    ANGELA and MISTY are still in there looking a little jetlagged.


    KAREN enters 

                                            ANGELA

                        Hello, sweetie, my how you ve -



                                            KAREN

                        I don t want you to sleep in my room, but as you re going 

                        to, this is the list of rules.



    ANGELA takes it.

                                            ANGELA

                        Right&I m not really likely to wee in the bed


                                            KAREN

                        Auntie Maddy did,


                                            ANGELA

                        &Really?


                                            KAREN

                        But she d drunk too much wine. She s borderline alcoholic.


                                            ANGELA

                        Is she?


                                            KAREN

                        She broke rules six and eight as well



                                            ANGELA

                        I can t see a box 



    KAREN  turns the paper over     Outnumbered IV   Episode 5   Shooting Script   17thMarch 201130



                                            ANGELA

                        Oh of course& just below rule 27


    ANGELA signs.


                                            KAREN

                        You haven t read them. You shouldn t sign something if you 

                        haven t read it.  That s how that woman got the wrong side

                        of Rumplestiltskin


    KAREN turns to MISTY

                                            KAREN

                        She doesn t have to sign because she looks sad. (exits with 

                        her form)



    MUM, DAD and JAKE still argue.


                                            JAKE

                        Anyway, Mum s four years younger than you


                                            DAD

                        Oh come on!


                                            JAKE 

                        No, it s  


                                            MUM

                        Jake, what s wrong with going out with girls your age? 



                                            JAKE

                        Well then I would be doing something illegal



                                            MUM

                        Would you?... Would he Pete?



                                            DAD

                        (flummoxed) Not sure, erm&


                                            MUM

                        But you googled it&    Outnumbered IV   Episode 5   Shooting Script   17thMarch 201131


                                            DAD

                        I googled  sex under sixteen & which was a mistake& look 

                        Jake, for a start you have to tell this Victoria your real age&


                                            JAKE

                        Why?... What are you going to do& Go to the police?



                                            MUM

                        Yes 

                              (DAD looks at her in surprise) 

                        Maybe 


                                            JAKE

                        Oh that is just stupid


                                            MUM 

                        It is not stupid



    They start to argue over each other


                                            DAD

                        OK, let s all calm down, before someone say s something 

                        really unfortunate


                                            JAKE

                        She always goes mental when Angela s here



                               DAD

                        Like that 


    24A. INT LIVING ROOM DAY   D1

    ANGELA and MISTY can hear lots of raised, but muffled voices from upstairs.


                                            MISTY

                        &This place doesn t seem very secure&does it have a panic 

                        room?


                                            ANGELA

                        I think this whole house is a panic room, darling.


    CUT TO:    Outnumbered IV   Episode 5   Shooting Script   17thMarch 201132



    DAD comes in the hall door in a dressing gown. MUM is sitting on the sofa in hers.
