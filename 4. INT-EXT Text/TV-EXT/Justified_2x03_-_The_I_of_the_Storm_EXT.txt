    A quiet, backwoods road.  We re on a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS that 
      rolls past us, CHURCH OF THE MODERN DAY SAVIOR painted on the 
      side, and then we re --


      Where we find a number of MINE WORKERS done for the day. 
      Walking to their cars.  Among them is BOYD CROWDER.  He looks 
      tired, beat down.

      Then a guy named PRUITT (30s, sturdy, imposing) walks up 
      alongside Boyd.

                                  PRUITT
                    I ask you something, Crowder?

      Boyd looks to Pruitt.  Takes him in.  Keeps walking.  

                                  PRUITT (CONT D)
                    How d you manage to get this job?  
                    Because I heard of you, some of the 
                    things you done, and even though 
                    this ain t the most reputable 
                    operation in the world, seems to me 
                    they could do better than hiring an 
                    ex-con.

      Boyd just keeps going, tries to ignore him.  Pruitt puts a 
      hand on Boyd s shoulder, stopping him.  Boyd takes him in 
      coolly.  OTHER MINERS now stop, taking this in.

                                  PRUITT (CONT D)
                    You gonna answer me, or you just 
                    gonna stand there, look stupid?

      Boyd considers, then turns to go.  Pruitt s hand stays put.

                                  BOYD
                    Maybe you should ask the people who 
                    hired me.

                                  PRUITT
                    I d rather ask you.

      But Pruitt doesn t.  Standoff, it s about to go down, when:

                                  KYLE (O.C.)
                    Hey, Pruitt?

      Boyd and Pruitt look over, find another miner named KYLE, 
      30s, smart, tough.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    You ain t got cause for this.  
                    Leave him be.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    13.

        CONTINUED:55

      Pruitt looks from Kyle to Boyd, considers it, then walks off.  
      The other miners disperse.  Boyd and Kyle.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Spend all that time lookin  out for 
                    each other down below, only to come 
                    up top, start brawlin .

      Boyd is quiet, doesn t want to engage.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    I m Kyle.

                                  BOYD
                    Boyd.

                                  KYLE
                    I just started a few days ago.
                          (then)
                    How about you?  Been here long?

                                  BOYD
                    Not this go  round.

                                  KYLE
                    I was wondering, if you knew a 
                    place where a man might get a drink 
                    in a dry county?

                                  BOYD
                          (considers, then)
                    There s a bar in Cumberland.

                                  KYLE
                    Tell you what, I ll buy if you d 
                    like to join me.

                                  BOYD
                    Nothing personal Kyle, but I prefer 
                    to drink alone.

                                  KYLE
                    No problem.  Maybe some other time.

      And Boyd nods, walks off.  Kyle stands, watching him.  A 
      moment later, Pruitt and another guy we ll call MARCUS (30s) 
      slide up beside Kyle.  All watching Boyd.  Then, Kyle, not at 
      all the friendly guy he just sold himself as:

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Bit of a cold fish.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    14.

      CONTINUED: (2)55

      Off Pruitt and Kyle, clearly closer than they just led us to 
      believe, something strange happening here...


      The BUS ROBBERY crime scene.  Raylan s taking it in with TOM 
      BERGEN, the State Trooper we met in 201.  

                                  TOM
                    Way I figure it, we got two tracks: 
                    Who was running this Oxy bus, and 
                    who robbed it.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Oh, Tom, I think I know who robbed 
                    it.  I just came to see the swath 
                    of destruction.

      Raylan sees where Bobby s body had been before it was hauled 
      off.  There s a lot of blood.  

                                  TOM
                    Question remains -- who was sending 
                    it through here to begin with?  The 
                    fella who was shot -- Bobby Lawton  
                    -- he s Frankfort, born and raised.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Home of the Dixie Mafia.

                                  TOM
                    Tracks about right.  You have any 
                      experience with that lot?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Little.  

      Their eyes are caught by a police car driving up.  DOYLE 
      BENNETT gets out, walks up to Raylan and Tom.

                                  DOYLE
                    Good day, gentlemen.

                                  RAYLAN/TOM
                    Doyle.  Chief.

                                  DOYLE
                    Quite a mess we got here.

                                  TOM
                    That it is.

      An awkward silence descends.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    15.

      CONTINUED:A6A6

                                  DOYLE
                    I know you two don t hold the local 
                    P.D.. in the highest regard, and I 
                    can t say I blame you after some of 
                    what s transpired down here.  But 
                    the last thing anyone wants is 
                    criminals stealing from criminals 
                    and people shooting at each other 
                    from pickup trucks.  So you all 
                    find anything, or need a hand, you 
                    let me know.

      Raylan and Tom nod, start to walk off.  Then:

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                          (to Raylan)
                    You planning on talking to Boyd 
                    Crowder about this?  It seems in 
                    his wheelhouse as they say.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That it does.

      They begin to walk again, when:

                                  DOYLE
                    Just out of curiosity, and I hope 
                    I m not crossing any line here, but 
                    how do you feel about his current 
                    living arrangement?

      Raylan furrows his brow, not sure what Doyle means.  Which to 
      Doyle, is delightful.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    You don t know?

      OMITTED66


      Boyd lounges on the porch. As up to the house speeds Dewey s 
      CAR.  Stops.  Out steps Dewey, a man on a mission.

                                  BOYD
                    Mr. Crowe.  You come to regale me 
                    with tales of your Floridian 
                      adventures?

                                  DEWEY
                    Surprised you got the nerve to ask 
                    me that, Boyd.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    16.

                                  BOYD
                    I m sorry?

                                  DEWEY
                    Goddamit don t play with me.  I 
                    know it was you. 

                                  BOYD
                    What was me?

                                  DEWEY
                    I saw Cutter, Boyd.  Know you 
                    tipped him off.  I was gonna get 
                    paid two hundred dollars for the 
                    trip and now I got nothin --  

                                  BOYD
                    Hold up.  Cutter?  From the 
                    Commando days?

                                  DEWEY
                    How many Cutters you know?

                                  BOYD
                    And what is it you think I had him 
                    do?

                                  DEWEY
                    Rob the damn bus, whatta you think!

      Now AVA emerges onto the front porch.  Takes in the riff raff 
      causing all this racket.

                                  AVA
                    Well this figures.

                                  DEWEY
                    Oh, hey Ava.

                                  AVA
                          (to Boyd)
                    You ve got two minutes to get him 
                    outta here.

      And Ava s already headed back inside.

                                  DEWEY
                    Bye Ava.
                          (then, to Boyd)
                    She looks good as ever, huh?

                                  BOYD
                    Dewey, are you here because Cutter 
                    robbed your Oxy bus and you think 
                    I m responsible?

                                  DEWEY
                    I don t care that you robbed it 
                    Boyd, but I need that money.  These 
                    here are rock hard times for Dewey 
                    Crowe.

                                  BOYD
                    I had no hand in it.

                                  DEWEY
                    Why should I believe that?

      Boyd stares.  Dewey considers.  Frustrated.  Then, a thought:

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    Alright.  If you didn t have a hand 
                    in it, I ll assume you won t mind 
                    if I make a play on my own behalf.

                                  BOYD
                    What re you thinkin , Dewey?

      Only takes a beat for Boyd to see it.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Don t.

                                  DEWEY
                    Don t what?

                                  BOYD
                    Don t go to Amber Holler and try to 
                    rob some robbers.

                                  DEWEY
                          (then, full of shit)
                    I wasn t gonna do that.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    18.

                                  BOYD
                    They ve probably already unloaded 
                    the goods by now.  And even if they 
                    haven t, they ll be on edge.  
                    High on their own stash.  You don t 
                    wanna walk into that--

                                  DEWEY
                    Spoken like a man protecting his 
                      associates--

                                  BOYD
                    Spoken like a man who doesn t wanna 
                    see you killed.

      Dewey starts off.  Boyd follows, trying to impart reason.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Those pills were someone s property 
                    before Cutter took  em.  And you 
                    can bet that someone will be down 
                    here in short order wanting them 
                    back.  You take  em off Cutter, 
                    you ll have two sets of angry 
                    killers scouring this Earth for you 
                    and that Oxy.

                                  DEWEY
                    I know you think I m stupid and 
                    weak.  But I ain t.

                                  BOYD
                    Gonna ask you one last time not to 
                    do this.

      Dewey considers it, but he can t pass up this chance.  Dewey

      TIGHT ON A FRONT DOOR.  A knock.  A beat, and then it s 
      opened by AVA, pretty in a simple dress, no shoes.  She s a 
      bit thrown, as she realizes the man standing at her door --

      Is Raylan.  First time they ve seen each other since 
        Bulletville, and we should sense that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hello, Ava.  Sorry to just show up 
                    like this, but I need a minute.

                    Okay.*

      Ava comes out, shuts the door behind her.*

                                    RAYLAN*
                    Actually, I came to talk to Boyd.*

                    door to talk to Boyd, or to ask me *
                    why he s living in my house?*

                                    RAYLAN*
                    I m here on business, Ava.*

                                  AVA*
                    Raylan, Bowman didn t leave me with *
                    much more than shitty memories and *
                    a balloon payment on a mortgage I *
                    can t afford.  I been working the *
                    beauty parlor in Corbin, but it *
                    ain t hardly enough.  Boyd helps *

                      I wouldn t be standing here *

      Ava is at first going to yell.  But then she swallows it, *

      Raylan and Doyle.  They re in mid-conversation.  Raylan can 
      vaguely make out someone in the back of Doyle s unit.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    So your C.I. was here when this guy 
                    came in and stole the pills from 
                    Cutter and Elrod?

                                  DOYLE
                    That s right.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And she got a good look at him.

                                  DOYLE
                    Yes she did...
                          (on Raylan: And?)
                    Raylan, you and me go back a long 
                    way.  We grew up around each other.  
                    Both come from families that have 
                    had their... issues with the law.  
                    And then, with all that in common, 
                    we both became lawmen.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (then)
                    I m sorry, what are we talking 
                    about?

                                  DOYLE
                          (smiling)
                    See, I got to thinking: maybe 
                    Raylan isn t the man I thought he 
                    was.  Maybe he isn t the man anyone 
                    thinks he is.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Was that supposed to be an answer?

                                  DOYLE
                    I m saying, sometimes a man does 
                      something, and certain folks might 
                    see it as wrong.  Others, they 
                    might embrace it.  Hell, they might 
                    even be in a position to help that 
                    man out, provided the favor gets 
                    returned later.

                    is there any way you could just say

                    they didn t.

                    Well, he was smaller, kinda 
                    scrawny.  Had a neck tattoo peekin  
                    up outta his shirt, and I never 
                    seen a lawman with a tattoo on his 
                    neck.  Made some strange comments 
                    too.  One at the end about poaching 
                    gators.

                    when we were digging coal together, 
                    you had any inkling of the man I 
                    might someday become?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Seems back then, neither of us knew 
                    what kind of man we d be.  But I 
                    certainly never thought we d end up 
                    on opposite sides of loaded guns.

                                  BOYD
                    I never thought I d make a phone 
                    call like this.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If you re going to tell me about 
                    Dewey, I already know.

                                  BOYD
                          (then)
                    He s at Audry s, doling out Oxy 
                    like it s candy, no sense of 
                      discretion that boy, not one bit.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Thank you, Boyd.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    36.

                    Goodbye, Raylan.

      Raylan reloads, looks at Dewey.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well you wanted to be Raylan 
                    Givens, here s your chance: go get 
                     em.

      On Dewey, not sure whether or not Raylan is serious.  Raylan 
      peeks out the window, sees --

      Elrod and Cutter trying to ADVANCE on the trailer.  Raylan 
      FIRES, sending them both SCRAMBLING back to their COVER.

      Raylan considers, then, YELLING OUT THE SHOT-OUT WINDOW: 
        (*Throughout this, we will continue to CUT BACK AND FORTH 
      between Raylan and Cutter and Elrod.)

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Would you both stop shooting long 
                    enough so s I can have a word with 
                    you?
                          (then)
                    By now I m sure you ve figured out 
                    it wasn t Raylan Givens that robbed 
                    you.  But the person who did do it 
                    is in here with me right now, as 
                    are the pills that he took from 
                    you. That s the bad news.  But the 
                    worse news is that I actually am 
                    Raylan Givens, so right now you re 
                    trying to kill a US Marshal, which 
                    no jury is going to take kindly to.

      Elrod and Cutter both take this in.  Shit.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now, I know you want your pills and 
                    the guy who took  em, and to be 
                    honest I m tempted to give him to 
                    you.  But unfortunately I can t, so 
                    I can only offer you a deal: put 
                    down your guns and let me take you 
                    in.  Then, you give me some idea of 
                    who recruited you to rob that Oxy 
                    shipment in the first place, and I 
                    can promise that the D.A. will go 
                    easier on you for killing Bobby.

                    Or you can keep shooting, and in 
                    two minutes when the cavalry 
                    arrives you ll either be killed, or 
                    arrested and offered a deal much 
                    less sweet than what I m offering.

      Off RAYLAN, who knows if they re not shooting, he must be 
      reaching them --

      ON ELROD AND CUTTER.  Considering it.

                                  CUTTER
                    You wanna be a snitch?

                                  ELROD
                    I don t wanna be dead.

      Then, DOYLE appears behind them both, gun held high.

                                  DOYLE
                    Either of you move I ll kill you.
                          (then)
                    Put the guns down, hands where I 
                    can see  em.

      Off Cutter and Elrod, knowing they re fucked --

      TO RAYLAN, who peeks out, sees Doyle.  Gets to his feet --

      TO DOYLE, speaking quietly with Elrod and Cutter.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    You two get one shot at this: tell 
                    me who hired you to hit that bus.

                                  CUTTER
                    You honestly don t know?
                          (then)
                    It was your brother, Dickie.

                                  DOYLE
                    Yeah, that s what I thought.

      Off Doyle, considering this, we go to --

      RAYLAN, struggling to get a good look at what s going on out 
      there.  Then he HEARS:

                                  DOYLE  (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    Don t do it!

      Followed closely by FOUR GUNSHOTS.  Raylan busts out the 
      TRAILER DOOR --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    42.

      Sees Doyle moving to the BODIES, KICKING their guns away, 
      watching coldly as Cutter and Elrod take their last breaths.

      Raylan moves to them, gun still drawn.

                                  DOYLE (CONT D)
                    Must a thought I was kidding when I 
                    told them to put down their guns.

      As Raylan goes from Elrod to Cutter, both of them already 
      DEAD and GONE.  Doyle holsters his weapon and moves away, 
      already pulling out his phone to call this in.  Off Raylan, 
      staring at these bodies, and then Doyle, on his phone...

                      Goodnight, Raylan.*

      As Ava heads inside.*


      Boyd walks towards his TRUCK (both his WINDOWS have been left 
      down).  Kyle and his friends continue to follow.

                                  KYLE
                    No need to run off.

      But Boyd, ignoring him, opens his CAR DOOR.  Gets in.  Shuts 
      the door behind him, and now we re --


      As Boyd starts the ignition.  Just as Kyle reaches the truck, 
      and REACHES across Boyd to TURN OFF THE IGNITION.

                                  KYLE
                    Hear me out, just two more minutes, 
                    that s all I m asking--

      And in this moment all the anger Boyd s been ignoring, all 
      the pain that has been roiling down deep inside, finally 
      BOILS OVER.  He GRABS Kyle around the NECK with one arm, as 
      he throws the TRUCK INTO REVERSE WITH THE OTHER --

                                  BOYD
                    You wanna talk some more, Kyle?  
                    Fine, you come on with me, we ll 
                    have us some one-on-one time.

      And Boyd quickly BACKS UP, then throws the car into DRIVE, 
      and PULLS OUT ONTO THE ROAD.














                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    49.

      Kyle is pissed off and scared, trying with all his might to 
      shake loose.  His friends try to grab him, but Kyle s quickly 
      out of reach, as he SCRAMBLES TO KEEP UP WITH THE 
        ACCELERATING TRUCK.

                                  KYLE
                    Oh, shit!

      But Boyd is holding tight; there s no shaking loose.

                                  BOYD
                    You wanna hear about my past?  How 
                    I blew shit up, killed people, got 
                    people killed?  That what you re 
                      interested in?

      And now they re out on the open road --

      The SPEEDOMETER AT 25 MILES AN HOUR --

      A FIRE IN BOYD S EYES --

                                  KYLE
                    Stop the car, Boyd!

      As Kyle s FEET BEGIN TO DRAG, and now he s gone from trying 
      to wriggle free to trying to HOLD ON with all his might.

      But Boyd s not stopping.  In fact, he continues to SPEED UP --

      THE SPEEDOMETER now CROSSING 30, to 35 --

                                  BOYD
                    Or, maybe you d like to talk about 
                    God.  About religion, that it?

                                  KYLE
                    Jesus Christ, Boyd--


                                  BOYD
                    You want to talk about Jesus?  You 
                    want to meet him, maybe?
                          (then)
                        WHHHHHEEEEEEEHHHHHAAAAWWWW!!!

      And Boyd, unleashing this YELL, all his fires burning, the 
      SPEEDOMETER at 40, RELEASES KYLE --

      Who GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE PAVEMENT, HEAD OVER HEELS, the 
      kind of fall that could kill a man.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 203 - "THE I OF THE STORM" - REVISED 2ND GREEN - 11/17/10    50.

      CONTINUED: (2)2424

      ON BOYD, as the truck moves down the road, his adrenaline 
      pumping, his eyes still wild with the thrill of the moment.

      But a few beats and Boyd s breathing slows.  His smile fades.  
      He STOPS THE TRUCK.  Cranes out the window, where he sees --

      KYLE, lying motionless on the road --

      ON BOYD, taking in what he just did.  He then turns the 
      wheel, starts to go back to help Kyle, when --

      KYLE MOVES.  Slowly and painfully, but he s moving.  Manages 
      to sit up, holding his arm, banged up but alive.  Not too far  
      away, Pruitt and Marcus are jogging up the road towards him --

      ON BOYD, who reconsiders, straightens out the wheel, and 
      continues on down the empty road.
