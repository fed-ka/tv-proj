Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
house. He yells into his mobile phone.
ARTHUR
(into phone)
What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
You just said he was still at breakfast!
MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.
PROSSER
Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in
front of the bulldozers forever.
ARTHUR
I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.
PROSSER
This bypass has got to be built and it's
going to be built. You should have made
your protest months ago.
ARTHUR
The first I heard of it was when a workman
came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to
clean the windows, and he said he'd come
to demolish the house. He didn't tell me
right away of course. First he wiped a
couple of windows and charged me twenty
quid. Then he told me.

The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the
steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase.
PROSSER
Look. These plans have been on display at
the planning office now for a year.
ARTHUR
On display? I had to go down to a cellar!
PROSSER
That's the display department.
ARTHUR
I eventually found them in the bottom of a
locked filing cabinet in a disused
lavatory with a sign on the door saying
'beware of the leopard'.
PROSSER
Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
just let it roll straight over you?
ARTHUR
How much?
PROSSER
None at all.
FORD (O.S.)
(American accent)
Arthur!
Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.
As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.
ARTHUR
Ford?
He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.
FORD
Arthur! There you are. Here drink and
eat with me. We need to talk.
ARTHUR
Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford
They're going to demolish my home,
FORD
Whoa.
You already know? How?
Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

ARTHUR
But what about my house?
Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him.
ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.
FORD
C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they
won't destroy your house until they've
finished the beers.
ARTHUR
Can we trust him?
FORD
I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.
ARTHUR

We've got two minutes. So drink up.
There's a ROAR OF ENGINES and a LOUD CRASH outside.
Arthur and everyone else in the pub look up.
ARTHUR
My house!
He runs out. Ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from
the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.
FORD
A round for everyone, on me.
BARMAN
You really think the world's going to end?
(Ford nods)
Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over
our heads or something?
FORD
If you want.
BARMAN
Will it help?
FORD
Not really.
He gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits.
BARMAN
Last orders, then?

Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being
bulldozed. Ford strides casually behind in the distance.
ARTHUR
STOP!
STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!
Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY.
11a
A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower
11a
block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is
blown sideways. Trees are uprooted.
Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's
house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side.

He shows Arthur his blinking Sens-0-Matic device.

Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their

GUIDE VOICE
"Space..." says the introduction to the
Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big.
You just won't believe how vastly, hugely
mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you
may think it's a long way down the road to
the market, but that's just peanuts
compared to space..." and so on.
The weightless guide twirls away.
Arthur reaches for it.
The words "DON'T PANIC" alight.

It also says that if you hold a lung full

he totally failed to connect with.
He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips.
His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away.

Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny

hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party
balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside

stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

He moves to a different rack of instruments, consults a
check list, starts flipping some switches.
FORD
I mean, why do you want to know the
Ultimate Question?
ZAPHOD
Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly
a sense of adventure, but mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.
He continues preparing the ship. Trillian consults the
huge MANUAL, turning dials, flipping switches...
ARTHUR
But -- you're President of the Galaxy,
aren't you?
ZAPHOD
Yes, Arman.

For a trip to a place that doesn't exist?

He takes out the Guide.
Zaphod looks to Trillian.
TRILLIAN
Definitely. I'm in.
They're all standing together. They turn to Arthur.
Arthur looks to Trillian. She stares back -- waiting.
ARTHUR
Do I even have a choice?
Zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.
ZAPHOD
No!
Arthur looks at the button.

GUIDE VOICE
The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new
method of crossing vast interstellar
distances without all that tedious mucking
about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive
reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes
through every conceivable point in every
conceivable Universe almost simultaneously,
then selects the appropriate re-entry
point. The principle of generating small
amounts of finite improbability by hooking
the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-
Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter
suspended in a strong Brownian Motion
producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were
of course well understood.
Seconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of
hyperspace and slows to cruising speed.
51
52
We hover above a greenish/purplish planet.
IMPROBABILITY EFFECT - space RIPPLES. Something begins to
materialize, something big and gray - tumbling toward us.
We now see the big, gray thing is a GIANT RHINOCEROS --
which ripples, flips inside out and becomes the Heart of
Gold.
53a

All we can see are the lights of the Heart of Gold's
entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. Or is it fog?
Zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead
of the other three.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
Humma Kavula!
BACK A FEW STEPS WITH ARTHUR, TRILLIAN AND FORD...
ARTHUR
Why does he keep saying that?
TRILLIAN
I don't know. I'm not used to seeing him
this way.
ARTHUR
You mean fully clothed?
She stops, fires him a look.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Sorry, but I can't for the life of me
figure out why you, the most brilliant
woman I have ever met, have ended up with
that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid
politician! I mean, look at him!
They squint through the fog at Zaphod, Head 2 out. His
hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps
whacking them away. He disappears into the fog.

He hands the guide to Trillian. She keeps walking.

Arthur considers this.

Ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow Trillian

In the beginning, the universe was created.
This made a lot of people very angry and

The others approach, watching Zaphod as he stops a
passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him
something, oozing charm. The creature points down the
street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on.
The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under
several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing:

Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders,
staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the
Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a
blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.
ARTHUR
Are we sure this is the right way?
FORD
Yes!
I think.
I don't know.
Maybe not.
ARTHUR
Yes, thank you for clearing that up.
Ford looks puzzled at Arthur. Did I clear it up? A crowd
has gathered. When they see Zaphod, they scream...

want to have your baby!, etc...
Zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he
was given, dons a presidential smile and waves.

Back to the ship. Quickly.
They quicken their pace when suddenly...

been called into existence several miles
above the surface of an alien planet. And
since this is not a naturally tenable
position for a whale, this innocent
creature had very little time to come to
terms with its identity as a whale before
it then had to come to terms with suddenly
not being a whale any more. This is what
it thought as it fell.
The camera moves around the whale as it falls.

WHALE (V.O.)
Ahhhh!!!! What's happening? Excuse me! Who
am I? Hello? Why am I here? What's my
purpose in life? What do I mean by who am
I? What is this 'I' that I want to know
what it is? Calm down, get a grip now ...
ooh! This is an interesting sensation...
ANGLE: From below. The whale is wriggling a bit.
WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Oh! This is an interesting sensation,
what is it? It's a sort of... yawning,
tingling sensation in ... well I suppose I'd
better start finding names for things if I
want to make any headway in what for the
sake of what I shall call an argument I
shall call the world, so let's call it my
stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite
strong now. And hey,what's this whistling
roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly
going to call my head? Perhaps I can call
that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll
do. Perhaps I can give it a better name
later when I've found out what it's for!
It must be very important because there
certainly seems to be an awful lot of it.
Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call
it a tail - yeah! Tail!
The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the
whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight.
WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty
good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to
achieve much but I'll probably find out
what it's for later on. How. Have I built
up a coherent picture of things yet?
No. Never mind. Hey, this is really
exciting, so much to find out about, ao
much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy
with anticipation ... Or is it the wind?
There really is an awful lot of that now,
isn't there?
It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the
whale, abandoning it ...
WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And hey! What's this thing coming
suddenly coming towards me very fast, so
big and flat and round it needs a big
wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round
... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if
it'll be friends with me?
We hear a sickening thud o.s.

GUIDE VOICE
Curiously, the only thing that went
through the mind of the bowl of petunias
as it fell was "Oh no, not again."
We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING.
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
Many have speculated that if we knew why
the bowl of petunias had thought that we
would know a lot more about the nature of
the Universe than we do now.
DISSOLVE TO:

The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the
b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it --
along with a few petunias. They all grimace.
BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks,
aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight.
They walk toward it.

Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.
FORD (O.S.)
Hey...this looks familiar.
Arthur looks up, registers surprise.
THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer.
The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS"
FORD (CONT'D}
Must be portal doors.
ARTHUR
You mean -- the hippies were right?
In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH."
Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone.
Trillian and Ford follow.
Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob,
anything. He must've hit something because the front of
the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING
VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.
ZAPHOD
Okay.
In we go.

What?! Are you out of what's left of your

FORD
We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the
right one, we come back and pick another.
No biggie.
ARTHUR
Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the
last door we ever step through? What if
it rips us into tiny little atomic
particle...thingies.
Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere,
covers her ears - trying to block them out
ZAPHOD
It's the right one.
I have a hunch.
ARTHUR
Ford..?
FORD
He's got good hunches.
I say we go.
ARTHUR
Go with the hunch of a narcissist with
half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous
thinking cap!? Are you insane?!
ZAPHOD
Hey, I think I resent that.
ARTHUR
I don't care what you think you think...
They all start arguing over each other. We focus on
Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers
her ears -- then screams....
TRILLIAN
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery?
They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex.
She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a
rung mop, then sucked inside.
Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.
Ford is
semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.
ZAPHOD
That's supposed to happen...I think.
Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a
scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted...

ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
Hey, wait for me!
He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's
about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in.
Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but
hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable
to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.
ARTHUR
No.
No!
NOOO!!!
He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod
did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He
collapses and buries his head in his hands.
MARVIN
I told you this would all end in tears.

Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a
cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground
next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright
beside them.
Trillian is already heading down the street toward the
Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her.

Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring
across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks
over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying
toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a
crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through
the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.
ARTHUR
Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?
MARVIN
Don't talk to me about life.
ARTHUR
Here I am, God knows how far from home...
MARVIN
Don't talk to me about God.
ARTHUR
...and this is where I see the most
spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on.
We only had the one sun at home. Planet
called Earth.

Oh no, it's beautiful.
Or at least, it

MARVIN
Did it have oceans?
ARTHUR
Yes.
Great wide rolling blue oceans.
MARVIN
Can't bear oceans.
Arthur looks up at Marvin.
ARTHUR
So this is how it will all end, then? Me,
on a dead planet -- with a manically
depressed robot.
MARVIN
You think you've got problems? What are
you supposed to do if you are a manically
depressed robot? No, don't bother to
answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more
intelligent than you and even I don't know
the answer. It gives me a headache just
trying to think down to your level.
SLARTIBARTFAST
(0.S.)
Excuse me.
Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES.
ARTHUR
Aah!
He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Who are you?
SLARTIBARTFAST
My name is not important.
Arthur continues to scramble away from the man.
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
You must come with me. Terrible events are
afoot. You must come or you'll be late.

Late? What for?

SLARTIBARTFAST
Late

It's
a sort of threat you see. Never been
much
good at them myself, but I'm told
they
can be terribly effective.
He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom."
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
Your friends are safe. You can trust me.
ARTHUR
Trust a man who won't tell me his name?
SLARTIBARTFAST
My name? Very well...
(heaves a sigh, reluctant)
My name is...Slartibartfast.
Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.
SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D)
I said it wasn't important.
Slartibartfast motions to the door.
He looks to Marvin.
MARVIN
I could calculate your chances of survival
-- but you won't like it.
Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.
SLARTIBARTFAST
I must warn you. We are about to pass
through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It
may disturb you. It scares the willies out
of me.
He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the
jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you.
Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.
ARTHUR
Whaa!
He is bent, twisted and sucked away.
Slarti follows.
Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to...

THE SKY--

ARTHUR
So -- it wasn't destroyed?
SLARTIBARTFAST
Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
Earth Mark II.
ARTHUR
So you're saying you ... made the Earth?
SLARTIBARTFAST
Well, not me alone. It was a group
effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard
of a place, I think it's called Norway?
101b
Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards
101b
Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's
familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
That was one of mine. Won an award you
know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry
to hear about it being blown up. Shocking
cock up. The mice were furious.
ARTHUR
Mice?
Who cares about bloody mice?
SLARTIBARTFAST
Are you a fan of plate tectonics?
Arthur looks up.
Slartibartfast points down.

ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains to spring

up noisily.
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
Voila!
Himalayas. Good, eh?
Arthur is working very hard to process all this.
101d
JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses
101d
a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
Earthman, you must realize that the planet
you lived on was commissioned, paid for,
and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly
before the completion of the purpose for
which it was built. Ten minutes later, we
would have been free and clear. But we
gave them our standard ten million year
warranty and they have come here to
retrieve this back-up copy. And they've
brought you with them.
The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.

ARTHUR
They brought...I'm sorry, when you say
"mice" do you mean the little white furry
creatures with the cheese fixation?
SLARTIBARTFAST
These creatures you call "mice" are merely
the protrusion into our dimension of hyper-
intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The
whole business with the cheese must've
been a front. They were experimenting on
you, you see. A vast computer program...
ARTHUR
Ah. I see where you're confused.
You see
-- we were experimenting on them.
101e
Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them.
101e
SLARTIBARTFAST
Oh, I gather they arranged for you to
conduct some primitively staged
experiments so they could prod your
thinking here and there. But you were
actually elements in the computer program.
They really are very clever hyper-
intelligent pan-dimensional beings.
(looking down)
Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.
101f
They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands
101f
on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.
ARTHUR
So -- you're trying to tell me that mice
designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep
Thought designed the Earth...which was a
giant supercomputer...that you built...to
calculate the Ultimate Question. Only,
Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the
program was completed?
SLARTIBARTFAST
That's bureaucracy for you.
ARTHUR
Actually, this explains a lot. All my
life I've had this strange feeling that
something was going on in the world,
something big, something sinister ...
SLARTIBARTFAST
That's just perfectly normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe has that.

yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy

No. That's where it all falls down of
course.

Here we are, then.

The platform slows to a stop.
Arthur steps out and is

stunned to see...
HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies
intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of
hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his
house alright.

Slartibartfast nods.
Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward
the house.
