501501EXT.  ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDEN - 1786 - DAY

      In a dreamy haze of summer light, an ornate FOUNTAIN stands
      twined with idyllic blooms.  From the far side of the
      fountain, a soft Scottish BURR recites a sonnet:

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    When I am gone, dreame me some
                      happinesse, Nor let thy lookes our
                    long hid love confesse...

      CAMERA TRUCKS AROUND FOUNTAIN where we find --

      MACLEOD

      in a Beau Brummel flouncy shirt, wind gently blowing his
      long, flowing, backlit locks.  He shuts a sheaf of sonnets,
      declaiming from memory, with great sensitivity --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Nor praise, nor dispraise 
                    me... ...nor blesse nor curse 
                    Openly love's force...

      Suddenly a blood-curdling SCREAM shatters this idyll.  MacLeod
      quickly puts the book aside, to see --

      ROXANNE

      young, beautiful, and bodice-ripped: a delicate-mannered
      innocent of noble breeding who looks like she's been ravished
      against her will.  She dashes into the garden, stumbles as
      she looks over her shoulder in tear-streaked fear.  MacLeod
      catches her up in his arms.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    What is wrong, fair lass?

                                      ROXANNE
                    Save me!  Save me, kind sir, for
                    pity's sake!

      She claws at his shirt in desperation, tearing MacLeod's
      blouse open, exposing his powerful chest.




                                                                (CONTINUED)96505    "Dramatic License"    2.    Final Shooting Script 8/12/96

501CONTINUED:501

                                      MACLEOD
                    What miserable villain would take
                    liberties with one so fair?

                                      ROXANNE
                      A monster... a depraved, unspeakable
                    beast... Coventry!

      MacLeod pulls her protectively close.  Between ripped bodice
      and ripped shirt there's a lot of exposed skin in contact.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Fear not.  None shall harm you, save
                    he first defeat me.

                                      TERENCE (O.S.)
                          (shout)
                    There you are!

      She gasps in fear.  MacLeod moves her aside, to face --

      TERENCE COVENTRY

      storming into view.  Scowling, unshaven, a barbarian with
      huge black boots and a large, ugly, hairy mole on his cheek. 
      He glares at Roxanne, cowering behind MacLeod.

                                      TERENCE
                    Damned wench!  I warned you what
                    would happen if you ever tried to
                    leave me.
                          (beat)
                    Now get back to my bedchambers!

                                      ROXANNE
                          (repulsed)
                    I would rather die.

                                      TERENCE
                    You'll wish it so... once I've had
                    my way with you.

      He leers and reaches for her, but MacLeod grabs his arm in a
      grip of steel, holds him fast.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The lady does not want you.
                          (beat)
                    And any fool can see why.

      He pushes Terence away.

                                      TERENCE
                    I've flayed men alive for less than
                    that!

501CONTINUED: (2)501

                                      MACLEOD
                    And I have heard frogs with a louder
                    croak.

                                      TERENCE
                    You dare to insult me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I believe I do.

                                      TERENCE
                    Then you are a fool and you are soon
                    to be a dead fool.
                          (beat; proudly)
                    You must not know to whom you are
                    speaking.

      MacLeod sizes up Terence, strolls around him with a studied,
      casual air.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think I do.
                          (beat)
                    Let me see.  Now, don't coach me, I
                    want to get this right.
                          (beat; eyeing Terence)
                    A bully, a wart hog... and from what
                    I see, one who must make up in sheer
                    ugliness for what he lacks in...
                          (beat)
                    Other areas.

      Terence goes white with rage, draws his sword.

                                      TERENCE
                    You'll need more than fine manners
                    and a sharp tongue to save you.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (confident)
                    I have a sharp sword.

      Without warning, Terence lunges -- but MacLeod dodges the
      thrust, pulls his own sword.  The fight is old-time Hollywood:
      parry, thrust, dramatic leaps on the fountain -- nasty LOW
      BLOWS that MacLeod agilely LEAPS to avoid.  MacLeod is
      polished, classy -- Terence a graceless, backstabbing cur. 
      It's Errol Flynn vs. Conan.

      ROXANNE

      watches through wringing hands, each near-miss bringing
      adlibbed GASPS and CRIES.

      As MacLeod gains the upper hand --


                                                                (CONTINUED)96505    "Dramatic License"    4.    Final Shooting Script 8/12/96

501CONTINUED: (3)501

      Terence pulls a DAGGER, slashes MacLeod's shoulder.  MacLeod
      falls back, blood marking his pure white blouse.  Roxanne
      screams, but MacLeod only shrugs off the pain, and goes for
      Terence with more force.

      Terence falls back, looking like a trapped rat.  He lunges,
      grabs Roxanne, and puts his sword to her throat.

                                      TERENCE
                    Drop your blade, or she dies!
                          (beat)
                    I swear, I will kill her where she
                    stands.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You coward.

                                      TERENCE
                    Drop it.
                          (beat)
                    Drop it, I say.

      MacLeod has no choice.  He reluctantly lowers his arm, lets
      the sword fall to his feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Harm one hair and you'll answer to
                    Duncan MacLeod.

                                      TERENCE
                    Fie upon you, MacLeod!  Here's my
                    answer.

      Keeping an eye on MacLeod, his blade at her throat, he RIPS
      her dress, exposing her shoulder, runs his unshaven mouth
      over her skin.  She shudders in disgust as Terence ravishes
      her, and turns pleading eyes on MacLeod.

                                      CAROLYN (V.O.)
                    Roxanne hoped, deep in her heaving
                    breast, that this stranger, this
                    Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod,
                    would somehow save her... but with
                    the brutish Coventry's blade at her
                    throat, all seemed lost.

      ECU - MACLEOD

      there's a twinkle (OPTICAL - SFX: TRIANGLE) in his eye.

                                      CAROLYN (V.O.)
                    Then suddenly...

      ANGLE - MACLEOD S BOOT

      The sword lies across it.  Suddenly MacLeod flips it UP --

      WIDER

      as he deftly catches the sword, brings it back in a god-
      almighty swing, and we:

                                                                          FREEZE FRAME.

                                      AMANDA (V.O.)
                    And?  And?!

502502INT.  BOOKSTORE - PRESENT DAY

      A chain book-store, and there's a "reading" going on. 90% of
      the customers are women -- the few guys are the type that
      cruise these events.

      AMANDA

      is in the group.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    So what happened?  Does he save her?

      CAROLYN MARSH

      stands at a microphone, eyes Amanda with barely contained
      annoyance.  30, hip expensive clothes, she's definitely not
      saccharine -- a big ego and plenty of attitude.

                                      CAROLYN
                    For that, you'll have to buy the
                    book.

      She shuts her copy book, turns coolly from Amanda -- takes a
      book from the crowding CUSTOMERS and begins to sign.

                                      AMANDA
                          (overly sweet)
                    Oh, I'll buy two.

      REFRAME AMANDA

      to include an oversized COVER-FLAT next to her: the lurid
      artwork of a mainstream historical romance novel.  An artist's
      rendering of a swashbuckling version of "Duncan MacLeod"
      stands heroically, sword aloft, exaggerated chest, a buxom
        Roxanne-type wrapped around his legs. (The "Duncan MacLeod"
      in the artwork should resemble only superficially our Duncan
      MacLeod -- the same coloring, but a different face.)  The
      signage reads "Author CAROLYN MARSH reads from her novel,
      'BLADE OF THE MACLEODS.'"

      MacLeod is working on a water pipe with a wrench and other
      tools.  He gets the BUZZ and pivots to see:

      AMANDA

      entering, clutching enough designer bags to qualify for the
      Imelda Marcos medal.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, that's it.  Would you believe
                    I maxed out every card I have?

                      Everything but your library card.

      He continues working.

                    Speaking of books...

      She pulls out her book, flips to a section.

                    "As he strode into the room, she
                    felt her knees weaken.  The dark
                    eyes that roved over her were the
                    color of midnight.  His muscles as
                    hard as the Highland hills that formed

      He continues to work, but it looks like he's sucking in his
      gut.

                          (punching it)
                    "This Duncan MacLeod."

      The sound of his name causes him to tug the wrench harder
      than he wanted.  The pipe comes loose, soaking him with water.

                    Gotcha.

      MacLeod grabs the book away.  And OFF his face --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

504504INT.  DOJO - A LITTLE LATER

      MacLeod and Amanda are leaving the elevator.  MacLeod fumes
      as he thumbs through the book as Amanda looks on, sucking on
      a popsicle.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't believe it.

                                      AMANDA
                    Neither do I, frankly.
                          (beat)
                    I mean, she got the eyes just about
                    right.... but "Muscles as hard as
                    Highland hills..."?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I meant that someone's actually
                    writing this!

                                      AMANDA
                    Figured you'd written it yourself...
                    Except I met the writer.

                                      MACLEOD

                    I thought you might know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think I'd tell a mortal about
                    our lives?

                                      MACLEOD
                    But not some romance novelist.

                                      AMANDA
                    Someone did.  You're a best-seller,
                    MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not funny.
                          (beat, reading)
                      "Roxanne's breath came in labored
                    gasps as he crushed his lips to hers,
                    her hands reached for his kilt, where
                    they found..."
                          (stops, disgusted)
                    I don't believe it.

      Amanda looks interested, grabs the book away.

                                      AMANDA
                    I missed that...
                          (reads, interested)
                    Ooh.  So it's a little purple.
                          (off his look)
                    The prose, I mean.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A little!  That's not even close to
                    the way it happened...

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

505505EXT.  ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDEN - 1786 - DAY

      The FOUNTAIN from the teaser, but it's grungy, covered with
      pond scum.  A MAN bends over it, slurps noisily.  He
      straightens -- it's MACLEOD, unshaven and travel-worn,
      stopping to water himself and his horse in the fountain.  He
      slaps clouds of ROAD-DUST off his breeches, examines a couple
      RIPS in his pants -- real life.  He looks up at --

                                      ROXANNE
                    'Elp!  'elp, 'ee's after me!

      An over-painted, busty hussy, ROXANNE, ducks through the
      trees.  The same woman in the Teaser -- but she has a coarse
      ACCENT, heavily-rouged cheeks, cheap but sexy.

                                      ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                    Sir! Sir!  'Elp me, I beg you!

      She throws herself into MacLeod's surprised arms -- and from
      his reaction, we note that she's not a fan of soap.  Still,
      chivalry and all that...

                          (beat)
                    What seems to be the problem?

                                      ROXANNE
                          (pointing off)
                    That pig!  E s tryin' to take
                    advantage 'o my maidenly honor!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (eyeing her)
                    Isn't it a little late for that?

      MACLEOD

      gets the BUZZ.  He pushes Roxanne aside, and she almost falls. 
      MacLeod turns to face --

      TERENCE COVENTRY

      riding up on his hunter.  He gets the BUZZ.  He's now
      elegantly dressed, smooth shaven and mole-less.  He has a
      civilized, couth air, and his anger is all civil indignation.

                                      TERENCE
                    So!  Thought you could take advantage
                    of a gentleman?

      He's off his horse and moving towards the cowering Roxanne,
      who grabs MacLeod.

                                      ROXANNE
                    Save me, kind sir, from a fate worse
                    than death!

                                      TERENCE
                    Oh, please.
                          (to MacLeod, politely)
                    I beg your pardon, sir, but this is
                    none of your affair.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm afraid it is, sir.  It seems you
                    are distressing this... this...
                          (for lack of a better
                            word)
                    lady.

                                      TERENCE
                    Lady?
                          (amused)
                    Stand clear, sir.  The hussy and I
                    have a score to settle.

      He steps forward.  MacLeod stops him with a hand.

                    I beg to differ.  She is under my
                      protection now.

                                      TERENCE
                    Do you know what you are protecting?

                                      MACLEOD
                    A woman in need.

                                      TERENCE
                    That is no woman, sir.

                          (offended)
                    I beg your pardon!

                    Your opinion of her is no matter to
                    me.

                                      TERENCE
                    I am amazed how easily you discard
                    something you have not heard.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Whatever she is, she needs my help.

                          (droll)
                    Oh, spare me.

      Terence pulls a sword out.  MacLeod draws his own sword,
      handing the reins of his horse to Roxanne.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am Duncan MacLeod, of the Clan
                    MacLeod.  I have no wish to kill
                    you, but I will defend what's left
                    of the lady's honor.

      Terence bows slightly in acknowledgement.

                    And it's clear she has none left to
                    defend.

      Terence makes the first move, but this time, he is a fighter
      of accomplished skill.  The pair show great elan as they
      fight around the fountain, then break --

                    You've been duped, sir.  The woman
                    is a common thief, a barmaid who has
                    stolen my purse.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Harsh words, sir.  Where is your
                    proof?

      Terence points with his sword.  MacLeod turns to see --

      ROXANNE

      on MacLeod's horse, spurring it to gallop.

      RESUME MACLEOD

      stunned.  He takes a few futile steps after her.

      She doesn't.

                    See?  You see how chivalry is
                    rewarded?  There's no justice.

      They look at each other, then both sheath their swords.

                    I'd buy you an ale to drown your
                      sorrows... but she stole every penny
                    I had.

      MacLeod hefts his coin purse, the coins chinking.

                    At least you have a horse.  If you'll
                    give me a ride to the next tavern,
                    I'll buy the ale.

                    We can discuss the death of chivalry.

                    Gentlemen of our caliber must stick

                    her.

      TERENCE

      picks up the book, flips to the title page, rips out the
      imprint.

      He goes.  Terence looks at the back page of the flyleaf with

                    Now you're going to pay.

      He holds up Carolyn's PICTURE and slowly, with feeling--
      tears it in half.  And OFF his dark look --

507507INT. DOJO - DAY

      THREE YOUNG MUSCULAR JOCKS glisten with sweat.  One skips
      rope, another, a lithe black guy, buzzes the speed bag, a
      third pounds a heavy bag with bone-crushing hooks.  Enough
      rippling muscle to propel a roller coaster.

      CAROLYN

      enters the dojo and surveys the pumping flesh.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, my.

      She moves closer, looking like a fox in a chicken coop, as
      she samples the material: grabs the biceps of one, the buttock
      of another.  She's a man-eater.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                          (to Jock#l)
                    MacLeod?  Duncan MacLeod?

      The fondled BOXER jumps and backs off, shaking his head. 
      Carolyn shrugs and moves on, pausing by the rippling black
      guy.  He sees her staring, looks back.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Don't suppose you're Scottish.
                          (off his stare,
                            regretful)
                    Oh well, forget it.

      She sights on the next guy, moves toward him.

508508INT.  DOJO - OFFICE - DAY

      MacLeod is on the phone, agitated.  Amanda lounges in his
      chair, idly playing with the slinky as:

                    The editor of the Carolyn Marsh books,

                    No, I do not want to be put through
                    to her fan club!

      Too late.  MacLeod puts down the phone, hard.

                                      AMANDA
                    I didn't expect you to take this so
                      seriously.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's my name... my life!  You want
                    me to just ignore it?

      Amanda is suddenly staring out into the dojo.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, well.  Look what the cat dragged
                    in.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (following her look)

                                      AMANDA
                    By the look of it?  I'd say she's
                    shopping for tenderloin.

      MacLeod heads into the dojo.  Amanda follows.

509509INT. DOJO - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod crosses over to Carolyn.  Amanda hangs back slightly,
      grinning -- this oughta be good.

      CAROLYN'S POV - MACLEOD

      irritated, but looking the total leading man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Excuse me, but is there something I
                    can do for you?

      She goggles, touches his arms, losing her composure for a
      BEAT.

                                      CAROLYN

                    Okay.  I'm Duncan MacLeod.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Thank God!  I thought I'd died and
                    gone to Chippendales.

      She runs a hand down his arms.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    You know what I've been through to

                    There's a funny smell in here.

      Amanda's had enough.  She steps in.

                                      AMANDA
                    Probably lust.
                          (to MacLeod; wickedly)
                    This is Carolyn Marsh.  You know,
                    the one with the book?

      MacLeod gives her a look -- "thanks for mentioning it."

                                      MACLEOD
                    You don't say.

                          (to Amanda, frosty)
                    Excuse me, but do I know you?

      The cat claws come out.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Sorry. With so many fans, just another
                    face in the crowd... you understand.

                    can't I -- we have to talk.

                    Good. It'll be so much easier to
                    explain over a drink.

      She takes MacLeod's arm.  Amanda takes his other arm.

                                      AMANDA
                    Come on.  We can all talk about it.

                    Anything.  But let's do it before I
                    lose an arm.

      They head toward the door, Carolyn shooting daggers at Amanda,
      MacLeod in the middle.

510510INT.  JOE'S - DAY

      Amanda, MacLeod and Carolyn are sitting at a table nursing
      drinks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (fishing)
                    So, Carolyn, your book's pretty... 
                      imaginative.

                                      CAROLYN
                    And you're wondering where I get my
                    ideas?
                          (off his look)
                    A lot of people ask that.

                                      AMANDA
                    Really.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's simple.  Duncan MacLeod is real.

      MacLeod chokes on his drink.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    For four hundred years, that name's
                    been popping up in legends all over
                    the world.  Scotland, Italy, Turkey...

                                      AMANDA
                    Turkey?  Imagine that.

      MacLeod kicks her under the table.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's always the same story.  A warrior
                    from the Highlands, fighting battles,
                      protecting the weak... always Duncan
                    MacLeod.  What do you think of that?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Fascinating.

                                      CAROLYN
                    At first it drove me crazy.  Then I
                    finally figured it out.
                          (pause for effect)
                    I know the truth.

      MacLeod and Amanda trade looks.

                          (strangled)
                    Which is?

                    What does man need most?
                          (off Amanda's look)
                    Besides that.
                          (beat)
                    Heroes... and when there aren't any,
                    we create them.
                          (beat)
                    "Duncan MacLeod" exists because we
                    want him to exist!  We need him to

      She slaps the table in triumph.

                                      AMANDA
                    Then, you don't really think it's

      She laughs.  Amanda laughs.  She slaps MacLeod's back hard --
      MacLeod finally laughs.

      He rises.  Carolyn rises, stopping him.

                                      CAROLYN
                    But this is a gold mine!

                    Not interested.

      MacLeod rises, taking Amanda's arm.  Amanda shrugs a "you
      lose" look at Carolyn.  Carolyn goes after them.

                    Look, I saw your dojo, or whatever
                    you call it -- I've seen dumpsters

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe you'll find out he was born in
                    the Highlands of Scotland four hundred
                    years ago.

      MacLeod stops her with a look.

511511EXT. PUBLISHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

      A lavish manse, stretch limos in the drive, as we hear the
      CLINK of champagne glasses and swirling MUSIC.

512512INT. PUBLISHER'S PARTY - NIGHT

      MacLeod is forcing a pained smile to a group of admiring
      young women, several holding copies of Carolyn's book. He
      gives a bow to his "fans" and moves away to Amanda, wearing
      an elegant black number, watching in amusement.  In the
      background, two men are at the door checking invitations and
      letting people in.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I hate this.

                                      AMANDA
                    You agreed... and I don't remember
                    any torture chamber.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What choice did I have?

                                      AMANDA
                    Come on, admit it. You love being
                    the all-Scottish action hero.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's ridiculous.

      A couple of stunning YOUNG WOMEN go by, beaming at him. 
      MacLeod beams back, preening perceptibly.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    But I'll just have to force myself.

      Amanda rolls her eyes.

      ANGLE - NEAR FRENCH WINDOWS

      Carolyn huddling with her flack, TIM, a slightly fey, balding
      young man.  Both are scanning the room.

                    What's the body count, Tim?

                    So far, three reviewers and a Vanity
                    Fair editor had to have smelling
                    salts.  Carolyn, he's absolutely
                      brilliant.

      AMANDA AND MACLEOD

      stroll up to Carolyn and Tim.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Duncan, this is Tim, my publicist.

      As MacLeod and Tim shake --

                    In your research on MacLeod, did you
                    ever come across any... archetypal

                    But she was just a cheap whore and a
                    thief.  Not worth mentioning.

      BEAT -- MacLeod and Amanda react to a BUZZ.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Excuse us for a moment, will you? 
                    We have something to discuss.

      He pulls Amanda away from Carolyn and the smitten Tim, and
      heads for the patio doors and the BUZZ.

                          (looking past him)
                    I'm here for her.

      His eyes stare through the patio doors, into the party where
      we see --

      framed in the French doors, signing books, oblivious to the
      danger.

      Terence starts for Carolyn, but MacLeod blocks him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If anyone had a reason to kill her,
                    it should be me.  I'm the one with
                    my name on the cover.

                                      TERENCE
                    And I'm the pig with a mole on my

                          (points to his face)
                    Do you see a mole?!  Do I dress like

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's a book, Terence -- it'll be
                    forgotten in a few months.

                                      TERENCE

                    You think that's bad?  She called me
                    a cheap whore and a thief.

      A LONG BEAT as the two men fall silent.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (indignant)

                    Terence, I don't like it either, but
                    it's just a book.  You can't kill a
                      defenseless mortal.

                                      AMANDA
                    Says who?

      MacLeod's reply is forestalled as he notices, over Terence's
      shoulder, Carolyn making her way toward them.  He hastily
      shifts so that Terence and Amanda are looking the other way,
      don't see Carolyn.

                    We haven't finished talking.

      He strides past them to meet Carolyn.  Amanda and Terence
      watch him go, both looking pissed.

                                      TERENCE
                    She needs to have an accident.  Break

                                      AMANDA

                    I do like the way you think.

      He offers his arm.  Amanda takes it, and they head into the
      party.

                    off like that.  Remember our deal.

                    Now don't pout... it's not very

                    Your public's waiting.

      MacLeod is about to answer -- he spots Terence and Amanda
      entering.

      MacLeod takes Carolyn's arm and quickly leads her into the
      crowd.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look, you've made your rounds...

                    Why, Duncan...   That would be a
                    premature evacuation, n est-ce pas?
                    Why the rush?

      heading their way.  Murder in his eyes.

                    I'll tell you later.

      CAROLYN

      follows his look -- sees Terence for the first time.  She
      winces, covers it, smiles at MacLeod.

                    Okay.  Your place.

      MACLEOD

      is cornered.  Terence is bearing down, making his way through
      the crowd like a gentleman -- intent on murder.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now.

      He grabs her arm.  He pulls her toward the door and the two
      men checking invitations.  He points to Terence.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)

      the door.

                    is every woman's sexual fantasy.  A
                    warrior with the heart of a poet.

                    But he's more than that.  He's a man

                                      CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The first time Duncan MacLeod turns
                    up, he's a chieftain's son, raised
                    to lead a Highland Clan.  He fell in
                    love with the daughter of a
                      neighboring chief, but she was pledged
                    in marriage to his kinsman.  You
                    know, a Romeo and Juliet kind of
                    thing?  Anyhow, there was a fight...
                    and he killed his cousin.  Now here's
                    the tragic part... the woman he loved
                    died anyway.  He left his clan shortly
                    after that... the stories are pretty
                    unclear about exactly why... but
                    they say he's wandered the world
                    ever since.

      MACLEOD

      is lost in thought, moved by the memories.

                                      CAROLYN
                    You know they still tell that story
                    in a little village in Scotland...
                      Glenfinnan.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (far away)
                    On the shores of Loch Shiel.

                                      CAROLYN
                    How did you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat, covering)
                    It's in your book.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Of course.
                          (moving in)
                    And I thought you weren't a fan.

      She moves up behind him, running her fingers over his back,
      his shoulders.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    Imagine the loss ...
                          (with feeling)
                    Wandering the earth alone, longing
                    for warmth, for companionship... for
                    love.  With no one who can truly
                      understand his soul, share his pain.

      MacLeod is distracted -- it's his LIFE she's describing. 
      She's moving as she speaks: touching him, playing him.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    I'd do anything for that man.  I'd
                    be his willing slave.

      Suddenly she plants a wet one on him, pulling at his shirt --
      trying to jump him.  MacLeod tries to pull free, but Carolyn
      hangs on like a tick.  They fall backwards over a table --

      NEW ANGLE

      and land on the floor, Carolyn STRADDLING MacLeod, jockey-
      like, kissing him passionately.

                                      CAROLYN
                    I want it, you want it... stop
                    fighting it!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (muffled)
                    Mgumph!

      She crushes his mouth with hers again.  MacLeod's EYES grow
      wide as he feels a BUZZ.  Finally he wrenches his lips free,
      looks up to see --

      AMANDA

      staring down at them, eyes like icy stalactites a mile
        underground.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Well, yipee-kayai.  The rodeo's in
                    town.

      They scramble to their feet, Carolyn smoothing her dress
      down, pissed.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Didn't you ever learn how to knock?

                                      AMANDA
                    You'd be surprised what I learned.
                          (ominous)
                    Maybe you want to find out?

      She steps forward, murder in her eyes.  MacLeod quickly steps
      between them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, it's not what you think!

                                      AMANDA
                    What I'm thinking, you don't want to
                    know.
                          (beat)
                    There's a cabby waiting downstairs. 
                    Thirty bucks, to bring me back from
                    your little soiree.

      MacLeod opens his wallet, starts to proffer a fifty then
      sees her face and thinks better of it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll be right back.  Just don't...

      He looks at them, sees enough electrical tension in the room
      to start a lightning storm.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Just don't.

      He heads towards the elevator.  The women cross their arms
      and stare at each other.

517517INT.  DOJO - NIGHT

      MacLeod quickly pays off the CABBY standing at the door.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Keep the change.

      The Cabby smiles and leaves.  MacLeod turns to go back to
      the loft -- he gets the BUZZ.  He freezes.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Please.  Not now.

      He turns, expecting the worst, and finds it as --

      TERENCE

      lurches in, obviously in his cups, and pissed off.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    She's here, isn't she?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (blank)
                    Who?

                    Think I'm a fool?  Carolyn Marsh,
                    who else!

      He lurches around MacLeod, voice dripping sarcasm as he quotes
      from memory:

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    "Sable mane..." "Muscles hard as
                    hills..." "Eyes like..."
                          (faltering)
                    Potatoes, or whatever the hell she
                    said.  You're sleeping with her!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why would I do that?

                                      TERENCE
                    To make yourself look good, and make
                    me look like a fool!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I swear, I never went near her.

                                      TERENCE
                    No?
                          (quotes)
                    "... as Duncan's lips crushed her to
                    him, her hands went to his
                      breeches..."

                                      MACLEOD

      He throws a haymaker -- catches MacLeod on the chin.  He
      winces, holding his temper.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    Don't get between us again.

      He lurches out the door.  MacLeod turns to go back, rubbing
      his jaw.

517A517AINT.  MACLEOD S LOFT - NIGHT

      MacLeod enters from the stairs.  He looks around the loft.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where is she?

                                      AMANDA
                    She's gone.

      MacLeod reacts.

                    On the elevator?

                    On her broom.

      MacLeod takes off down the stairs.

517B517BINT.  DOJO - NIGHT

      Carolyn heads from the elevator to the front door where
      Terence just left.  MacLeod enters from the stairs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carolyn, wait!

      She turns.  MacLeod moves toward her.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Maybe you shouldn't go home tonight.

      Carolyn smiles, misunderstanding.  She pats his cheek.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Sweet... but somehow I don't think
                    your girlfriend would understand.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (exasperated)
                    There's nothing to understand!

      Carolyn shakes her head at this naivete.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Men.  First thing you do is get to
                    that all night florist on Water
                    Street.  Two dozen white roses might
                    do the trick.

      She kisses him on the cheek, starts to head toward the door. 
      MacLeod gets in her way.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carolyn, I'm serious.  You're not
                    safe.

      We hear a drunken bellow from outside.

                                      TERENCE (O.S.)
                    Carolyn!

      MacLeod grabs Carolyn's arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Back door.  Quick.

      She's too startled to object as he hustles her to the side
      door, pushes her through.  Slams it shut behind her.

                                      TERENCE (O.S.)
                    Carolyn, where are you?

      MacLeod turns, looking "innocent" as Terence comes in the
      front door.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    I heard her voice.  Don't deny it. 
                    Where is she?

      Terence raises himself shakily up to full height.

      CAMERA PANS DOWN from two dozen WHITE ROSES standing in a
      vase on a table.  Amanda lies in bed in a soft pool of light,
      reading "Blade of the MacLeods" with rapt attention as she
      munches nuts from a bowl.

                    them caress her ivory skin..."

      There's enough Vaseline on the camera lens to start a
      chopstick factory.  CAMERA PANS OVER the identical ripped
      dress worn in the TEASER; it lies draped over a chair.  The
      same satin shoes are on the floor beside the bed.

      ANGLE - THE BED

      where a naked BLONDE lies, her hair fanned out on the sheets,
      face hidden by a dark-maned MacLeod as he kisses her
      sensually, as OVER we HEAR:

                                      AMANDA (V.O.)
                    "... her silken blonde tresses
                    cascaded over both their bodies as
                    he caressed her.  She had been kissed
                    by men before, but never like this
                    ..."

      The woman's face turns so we can see it: back arched, eyes
      half-shut in breathless excitement -- it's Amanda!  She stops,
      takes MacLeod's head in her hands, searches his eyes
      anxiously:

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)

                    Then take me... now!

      He does.  The two roll under the covers, FLASHES of bare
      flesh, blonde Amanda CRYING out in sheer ecstasy.

                                      AMANDA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "... under his caresses, her skin
                    burned with a white hot passion she
                    had never known in her life."
                          (reading, with growing
                            excitement)
                    "They moved together, bodies joining
                    in exquisite union again and again,
                    until she could no longer bear it. 
                    Finally he cried out, the sound she
                    was longing to hear..."

      And OVER, drowning out everything -- a huge, male SNORE.

                                                                                SMASH TO:

520520INT.  MACLEOD S LOFT - NIGHT - PICK-UP ACTION.

      Amanda lies in bed, reading, eyes glued to the book.  Again
      the SNORE, and she looks over at --

      MACLEOD

      splayed in bed beside her, hair a mess, rumpled and snoring. 
      Definitely not the sex machine in the novel.

      Amanda gives him a speculative look.

                                      AMANDA
                    Duncan?

      More SNORING.  No action there.  Amanda reaches over and
      pinches his nose shut.  MacLeod SNARFS, rolls over.  Amanda
      sighs, gives him a fond pat and goes back to her book.

521521INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY

      Carolyn and Tim are preparing for a book signing, fussing
      over the positioning of the poster and the stack of books. 
      Tim suddenly lights up like a bulb.

                                    TIM
                    He's here.

      MACLEOD

      entering the store.  He's not smiling, but several female
      CUSTOMERS ogle him as he approaches the display.

                          (re: the customers)
                    Look, they're already drooling.

                                    TIM
                          (sighs)
                    Isn't he beautiful.
                          (as MacLeod approaches)
                    Mister MacLeod, Duncan... I'm so
                    glad you could make it!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (politely)
                    Thank you.
                          (to Carolyn)
                    Could I see you in private?

                                      CAROLYN
                    Now isn't the time, Duncan.  We have
                    work to do...

      She motions to the Tim to bring over a garment bag.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    And you've got to get into character.

      And OFF this, Tim holds up a Scottish costume.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)
                    We had it sent in from Western Costume
                    in Hollywood.  It's the real Clan
                    MacLeod tartan.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (losing patience)
                    I'm not here to play "Duncan MacLeod"
                    for you.

                                      CAROLYN
                    I see.
                          (cooling)
                    Then put it in two words or less.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (enunciating)
                      Terence... Coventry.

      The shoe drops.  Carolyn turns to Tim.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Tim?  Give us five?

      Tim moves off, holding the costume.

                          (avoiding)
                    Why bring up Terence Coventry?  He's
                    the villain from my book.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And from the party yesterday.
                          (off her look)
                    Drop the act, Carolyn.  What's between
                    you and Coventry?

      She gives up, throws her pencil aside.

                                      CAROLYN
                    All right.  Terence and I...

                                      MACLEOD
                    And you expect him to ignore it and

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's a switch.

                          (feeling cornered)
                    And I don't need advice from a cover

                          (re the costume)
                    Are you going to do the "Duncan

522522INT.  JOE'S - DAY

      MacLeod and Amanda are finishing lunch.  MacLeod signals for
      the bill.

                                      AMANDA
                    I told you she was trouble.  Why go
                    in the first place?

                                      MACLEOD
                    To try and get her to stop.  She
                    can't keep doing this to Terence.
                          (beat)
                    She can't keep doing this to me.

                    That's a problem?

                                      MACLEOD
                    She wanted to dress me in a kilt.

                                      AMANDA
                    Really?  I kind of like you in a
                    kilt.
                          (off his look)
                    Nice legs.

      MacLeod gives her a look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Very flattering, but no thank you.

                                      AMANDA
                    So you're done with all of this?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Absolutely.

                    I know.  Putting knives in my back.

                    I have a right to make a living.

      He grabs the book and waves it.

                    me!

      He turns, raging, to the few CUSTOMERS gathered there.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    Do you see a mole?  Am I that ugly?!

      The Customers fall back.  Carolyn grabs the book, grabs her
      pen, and inscribes Terence's book.

                                      CAROLYN
                    You want me to write something?

                    before Duncan MacLeod shows up!

      That does it.  Terence throws her over his shoulder and
      carries her, kicking and screaming, towards the exit.

                                      CAROLYN (CONT'D)

      There's a high-octane argument going on between Carolyn and
      Terence.

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's my book, Terence... what I do
                    in it is my business.

                                      TERENCE
                    Not when you use my name, it isn't.
                          (beat)
                    And how could you make me such a
                    tasteless bastard?

                                      CAROLYN
                    I suppose you think I should have
                    made you the hero.

                                      TERENCE
                          (exploding)
                    You should never have written any of
                    it!

                                      CAROLYN
                    Are you finished?

                                      TERENCE
                          (softer)
                    Carolyn, why are you doing this?

                                      CAROLYN
                          (hesitates; without
                            rancor)
                    Look, Terence, let's just forget it.
                    You go your way, I'll go mine.

                                      TERENCE
                    What about the book?

      Not exactly what she wanted to hear.  The hard edge returns.

                                      CAROLYN
                    That's all you're interested in,
                    isn't it?
                          (off no response)
                    Wait 'til you see the sequel.

      She turns away.  Terence stops her.

                                      TERENCE
                    Carolyn, you know that's not all I'm
                      interested in.
                          (beat)
                    Come to the house tonight.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Why?  So the staff can hold me down
                    while you put a knife through my
                    heart?

                                      TERENCE
                    It'll just be you and me... I'll
                    even make dinner.

                                      CAROLYN
                    All by yourself?
                          (sarcastic)
                    Then what?  I sit around for five
                    hours while you tell me what a hero
                    you've been and about all the women
                    you've had?

                                      TERENCE
                    You talk.  I'll listen.

                                      CAROLYN
                    That'll be a change.

                                      TERENCE
                    Just say yes.

      He's earnest, beseeching.  She hesitates, waffling.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Maybe.

      She stalks off.  And OFF Terence's look --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

527527INT.  EXCLUSIVE CLOTHING STORE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY

      Amanda steps from a cubicle to stand before a three way mirror
      in the outfit she's trying on.  It's a knockout -- black,
      slinky, showing every feature to best advantage.  As she
      looks herself over, reflected in the mirror beside her,
      ANOTHER FIGURE steps out --

      CAROLYN

      wearing an identical outfit.  Carolyn freezes, eves Amanda's
      body -- she doesn't like the competition.  She smooths her
      hips, preens a little.

                    I think Duncan would like this, don't
                    you?

                                      AMANDA

                    On me.

                                      CAROLYN
                          (frost)
                    You might want to try last year's
                    model.  I hear it's a little roomier.

                                      AMANDA
                    Why spend all that money getting
                    into a dress?
                          (beat)
                    It'll come right off when the first
                    man gets within fifteen feet.

      An ASSISTANT approaches, seeing a double sale.

                                      ASSISTANT
                          (brightly)
                    You both look absolutely faaaab-ulous! 
                    Are you sisters?

      They turn, look daggers at him.  The Assistant backs quickly
      off.  Amanda sidles up to Carolyn, hands on hips --
      intimidating.

                                      AMANDA
                    Forget Duncan.  You're way out of
                    your league.
                          (beat)
                    He and I go back a long ways.

      Carolyn holds her ground.

                                      CAROLYN
                          (snide)
                    And I wasn't going to bring age into
                    this.

                                      AMANDA
                    Listen, you garden variety slug, I
                    read your little book.  You think
                    you're going to turn a guy like
                    MacLeod into your fantasy lover,
                    with you as the lady in distress?
                            (dismissive)

                          (breaking down)
                    How... you...

      Carolyn's eyes begin to well up with tears.  She storms back
      into her dressing room, slams the door.

      Amanda turns back to the mirror -- mission accomplished --
      then from Carolyn's cubicle, we hear SOBBING.

                                      AMANDA
                    What did I say?

      Amanda shrugs, about to walk away -- but the sobs keep on. 
      Carolyn is really torn up.  Amanda waffles, but feels a twinge
      of compassion -- finally she knocks.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Hey in there.  You all right?

                    Leave me alone, I'm fine!

      Still crying.  Amanda pushes open the door, finds Carolyn
      sitting there, miserable, tear-streaked.

                                      AMANDA
                          (quietly)

                    I know someone who's a complete wreck
                    when I see them.

      Carolyn looks at her -- and howls even louder.  Amanda rolls
      her eyes -- she doesn t feel like mothering this woman, but
      she forces herself to pat Carolyn s back.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (without conviction)
                    There, there. It s gonna be okay.

      She uses part of her outfit to wipe Carolyn's tears.

      Amanda and Carolyn wearing the matching dresses move down
      the street.  Amanda is trying to be nice.

                                      AMANDA
                    So tell me all about it.

                    C'mon... You had me fooled.

                                      CAROLYN
                    Right... Maybe if I had hundreds of
                    years like you, I'd get it together.

      BEAT.  Carolyn sees her mistake, but it's too late.

                    How much do you know?

      Carolyn looks trapped, sees it's too late to back out.

                                      CAROLYN
                    A little.
                          (beat)
                    A lot.

                    Oh, boy.  And the book?  All this
                    stuff about the Blade of the MacLeods?

                                      CAROLYN
                    It was a great story.

                    And it was a way to get back at

                    I was.
                          (beat)
                    We met at a Charity Ball six years
                    ago.  Everyone was in costume.  He
                    looked so good in a waistcoat.  He
                    started telling me these stories
                    about an ancestor who'd been a
                    wandering bard and a hired swordsman. 
                    I said he should write a book.  He
                    just laughed.
                          (beat)
                    I fell in love.

                    So... why not happily ever after?

                          (beat)
                    He told me about being Immortal. 
                    That the stories were true -- that
                    they were about him.

                    All the worlds I'd dreamed of, read

                    He's had princesses, queens...
                          (beat)
                    He's going to live forever.  And
                    me... I'm just going to get fat, get
                    old.  And always be from Newark.

                    It was only a matter of time.

                    So you left him first.
                          (off Carolyn's
                            miserable nod)
                    Changed all his stories.  And decided
                    to come on to MacLeod.

                          (beat)
                    I wanted to hurt him... To make him

                      Congratulations, it worked.  If he
                    doesn't kill you, he's sure gonna
                    kill --

528528INT.  TERENCE'S HOUSE - DUSK

      MacLeod enters the house warily, his senses in overdrive. 
      He gets the BUZZ, follows it to --

529529INT.  TERENCE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

      Where Terence, his APRON on, is cooking over the stove with
      a large SPOON.  He turns as he feels the BUZZ -- MacLeod.

                                      TERENCE
                          (icy)
                    What are you doing here?

                    Where's Carolyn?

      Terence tightens, advances on MacLeod, spoon in hand.

                                      TERENCE
                    On her way.  And we'd like to be
                    alone, if you don't mind.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think I'm just going to leave
                    her here?

                                      TERENCE
                          (laughing)
                    Always the hero.  Sounds like you're
                    starting to believe your own
                      publicity.
                          (beat)
                    What are you planning to do?  Be the
                    lady's champion on a white charger?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a sigh)
                    If I have to.

                                      TERENCE
                    En garde!

      MacLeod looks almost embarrassed, clears his throat.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    What?!

      Then he sees he's holding the SPOON, wearing his apron.  He
      rips it off, tosses them aside, and pulls his sword.

      THE DUEL commences -- the dinner is being demolished, stuffed
      tomatoes lose their stuff, a whole duck is a half duck.

      TERENCE

      is actually a pretty polished swordsman.  The battle moves
      out of the kitchen and into:

530530INT.  TERENCE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      There's a table set for two: candles, champagne, flowers. 
      They fight past it, then -- the BUZZ.

      AMANDA AND CAROLYN

      make their entrance.  MacLeod and Terence react to their
      arrival.  MacLeod tries to hastily conceal his sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carolyn.  Uh, we were just --

                    Fighting over me?  How romantic!

                                      MACLEOD
                    No!

                                      TERENCE

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes?

                                      TERENCE
                    You won't have her!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't want her!

                                      TERENCE
                    Then what are you here for?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm just trying to keep you away
                    from her.

      TERENCE

      rushes him, sword swinging.

                                      TERENCE (CONT'D)
                    What sort of hero are you, coming
                    between a man and his wife?

      is struggling to A) keep up with the twists, and B) keep
      away from Terence's sword.

                    Like you didn't know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I didn't.

                                      AMANDA
                    He didn't.

                    We didn't.

      MACLEOD

      deftly rebuffs Terence's thrust.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                      I wouldn't.

      MacLeod steps back, raises his sword in a "time out" position.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Terence, there's nothing between
                    Carolyn and me!

                                      CAROLYN
                    It's true.

                                      TERENCE

      He moves toward her, locks eyes with her.

      glinting.

      and shoulders, following the passage she's reading.

                          (reading)
                    "... tracing the delicate line of
                    her hair, down her throat, gently
                    slipping her gown from one creamy
                      shoulder."

      As she says it, he does it.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "Her breath quickened as his mouth
                      approached the newly-bared flesh."

      MacLeod stops, looks at her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Put the book down.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's just getting good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We can do better.

      She lets go - the book drops.  CAMERA FOLLOWS it to the floor,
      PUSHES IN on the cover art.  A BEAT later --

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    Mmmmm. You're right.

531A531AEXT. LAKE - DAY (E)

      MacLeod and Amanda walk arm and arm by the lake.

                                      AMANDA
                    God, I'm a sucker for romantic
                    stories.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I couldn't tell.

                                      AMANDA
                          (beat)
                    So, do you think they'll live happily
                    ever after?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know.

      They stop walking.

                                      AMANDA
                    Of course you don't know.  What I'm
                    asking you to do is guess.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why?

                                      AMANDA
                    Because it's part of the conversation.
                          (beat)
                    I ask you a question. You answer the
                    question.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Okay, my guess is maybe.

                                      AMANDA
                    You're no fun at all.

      She starts to walk off by herself.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a wry smile)
                    That's not what you said last night.

      That stops her in her tracks.

                                      AMANDA
                    Bragging now, are we?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (smug)
                    As a matter of fact
                          (beat)
                    Yes.

                                      AMANDA
                    Okay... okay... I've got no problems
                    with you in that department, but...
                          (listing them)
                    You are vain.  You are willful.  You
                    are proud.  And you are and always
                    will be a boy scout.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (in fun)
                    One of the reasons you love me.

      Amanda reacts to MacLeod's last statement.

                                      AMANDA
                    Do we love each other, MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    In our own way.

                                      AMANDA
                    And what way is that?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, you know this never turns
                    out well.

                                      AMANDA
                    What?  What never turns out well?

                                      MACLEOD
                    When we try to dissect what we are.

                                      AMANDA
                    You know what you sounded like just
                    then?

                                      MACLEOD
                    What?

                                      AMANDA
                    A man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda... I am a man.

531ACONTINUED: (2)531A

                                      AMANDA
                    That's beside the point.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What we have is incredibly special. 
                    But it's not mortal love.

                                      AMANDA
                    So?

                                      MACLEOD
                    So I want you to be honest with me. 
                    How many years... no, decades...
                    maybe centuries could you see us
                    spending together?  I don't mean
                    every now and then.  I mean every
                    day... every hour.

                                      AMANDA
                    You mean until one of us killed the
                    other?

                                      MACLEOD
                    My point exactly.

      Amanda turns and starts to walk off.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's not fair.  All a girl wants is
                    a little romance.  To be swept off
                    her feet every now and then.

      MacLeod comes up behind her and sweeps her off her feet.  He
      lifts her in his arms as if she was as light as a feather. 
      He kisses her.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Now that's more like it.

      He looks at her, lovingly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I do love you, Amanda.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know.

      As MacLeod carries her off --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
