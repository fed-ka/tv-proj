      A familiar dirty black Porsche cruises down Main St. in 
      Venice... a charmingly bedraggled HANK MOODY at the wheel.  
      He stops at the light where Main meets Rose.

      He stares up the giant ballerina clown atop the building 
      there, contemplative.

      He feels a hand on his thigh.  He looks -- Karen is next to 
      him.  Smiling.  The ray of sunshine to his dark cloud.

                    What are you thinking about?

                                  HANK
                    How much I absolutely fucking 
                    loathe this city.

                                  KAREN
                    Just as I was thinking about how 
                    much I absolutely love it.

                                  HANK
                      Meanwhile, I haven t written a 
                    goddamn word since we got here.

                    Relax.  Blame it on the weather.

                                  HANK
                    That s how it starts:  with the 
                    weather.  Then, before you know it, 
                    you re smoking the Hollywood crack

                    Well, at least you re not being 
                    dramatic about it.

                                  HANK
                    What can I say?  I miss New York.

                    And I miss you.  Because you re

      She smiles.  Which makes it impossible for Hank not to kiss 
      her.  A car horn HONKS, napalming the moment.  Hank is yanked 
      from his reverie.  He s alone in the car.  

      He looks -- sees a gorgeous California blonde in the 
      convertible next to him.  Smiling.  The postcard-worthy 
      promise of a better day.  She s been watching, bemused.

                                  THE BLONDE
                    Who are you talking to?

                                  HANK
                    Sorry.  Professional hazard.

                                  THE BLONDE
                    What do you do?

                                  HANK
                    Me?  I m a writer.  Non-practicing.*

                                  THE BLONDE
                    Who isn t?  Here, maybe you could *
                    read something of mine.

      She flies a paper airplane into his car.  Zips off.  Hank 
      unfolds the paper:   CALL ME.   Followed by a phone number.

      Hank smiles, shakes his head.

      As he drives off, we cut to MAIN TITLES.


      Hank pulls up in front of the cover of Dwell magazine.

      Today is a day he would very much prefer to honk the horn, 
      but he decides to suck it up and ring the doorbell.

      And so he does, bracing himself for the very real possibility 
      that a certain comely 16-year-old might answer.

      The door opens, revealing not Mia but her sire, BILL, an 
      annoyingly handsome and seemingly decent fellow who also just 
      happens to be Hank s nemesis.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.

      Hank shakes his head, starts to walk away, turns back.  Walks 
      past Bill, into the house...

                                  HANK
                    You know... Bill, is it?

                                  BILL
                    Yep -- still Bill.

                                  HANK
                      I appreciate the parenting advice, 
                    but maybe -- just maybe -- it s not 
                    such a great idea to give your kid 
                    too much space.  Maybe too much 
                    space is what gets them in trouble.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.  Please.  My daughter is 
                    sixteen.  She s an angel.  Clearly 
                    I m doing something right.

                                  HANK
                    You poor bastard.

                                  BILL
                    Excuse me?

                                  HANK

                                  HANK
                    Gotcha.

      Bill is stunned by the inanity of it all.  Hank notices a 
      recently unpacked painting leaning somewhere nearby.  It s 
      hideous -- absurdly expensive and completely pretentious.

                                  HANK
                    What the fuck is that?

                    What do you think?  I could ve

                                  HANK
                    I think you should still buy the 
                    car.  And run over whoever painted 
                    this.  It s fucking hideous.

                    My book.  Not my movie.

                                  BECCA
                    Not my problem.  I like your movie.

                                  HANK
                    How is that even possible?

                                  BECCA
                    Because it proves you re not the 
                    asshole they say you are.

      Hank holds out his palm.  Becca produces a dollar bill.  
      Which Hank quickly pockets.

                                  HANK
                    Now who says I m an asshole? 

      An awkward moment as looks are exchanged.  Becca deadpans.  
      Hank is forced to give her the dollar back.  Hank starts to 
      lead Becca away, but Karen interjects:

      Hank pulls up in front.  Gets out with a bottle of Glenlivet.  
      Walks the walk.  Hearing signs of life from the --

      POOL AREA

      Where he finds a lone swimmer in the pool:

      It s MIA, of course.

      She pulls herself up and out of the pool, dripping wet, 
      string bikini, more naked than not.  All that s missing is a 
      pair of heart-shaped glasses.

                    Oh, Daddy... I m sure it s nothing 
                    he hasn t seen before.

      An uncomfortable beat.  She walks off.  It takes everything 
      Hank s got not to watch as she goes.  Bill appraises Hank.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.

                                  HANK
                    Tim.

                                  BILL
                    Thanks for coming.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks for having me.

                                  BILL
                    It s my pleasure.

                                  HANK
                    No, it s my pleasure.

                                  BILL
                    You know, I think this is an 
                    important step we re taking here 
                    tonight.

                                  HANK
                    What step is that, Bill?  The one 
                    where I stand by and let you steal 
                    my family out from under me?  I 
                    don t think so.  Game on, broheme.

      Bill sighs, reaches out to take the bottle of booze...

                                  BILL
                    You didn t have to do that.

      ...but Hank pulls away.

                                  HANK
                    I didn t.  This is for me.

      At the same time, Karen walks out with a 40ish friend and 
      neighbor.  SONJA.  Hank goes in for his customary kiss and 
      gets his usual rebuke.

                                  KAREN

                    I love your writing.

                                  HANK
                    How much were you paid to say that?  
                    Cuz I ll double it for the truth.

                                  SONJA
                    I read your adaptation way back 
                    when Soderbergh was going to do it.  
                    I fucking loved it.

                                  HANK
                    Ah, yes.  The salad days.  There I 
                    was, across from the man of my 
                    dreams.  You re so in love and you 
                    know you re going to fuck and make 
                    this beautiful baby.  Then all of a 
                    sudden you turn your head, and when 
                    you look back, he s gone, replaced 
                    by some hack imposter.  Yet you 
                    still sleep with him because he s 
                    vaguely attractive and you talk 
                    yourself into thinking he ll be a 
                    great father.  Nine months later...

                                  SONJA
                    ...you wish you had sucked down a

                    Oh, we re going to get along just

                          (to Sonja)
                    Excuse me for a moment.

      Hank smoothly tugs Karen out of earshot.

                                  HANK
                    What are you doing?

                    Nonsense.  I just thought it might 
                    be nice for you to have a play date 
                    with someone your own age.

                                  HANK
                    And if we get along swimmingly...?

                                  KAREN
                    Hank.  I left you, remember?  I m 
                    not holding a torch here.  You need 
                    to get on with your life.

                                  HANK
                    And you need to get in touch with 
                    your emotions, woman.


      An infinitely more relaxed Hank finds everyone gathered at 
      the table.  Bill at one end -- Karen at the other.  Charlie, 
      Marcy and Becca lined up on one side.

      Hank finds himself forced to slide between Sonja and Mia on 
      the other.  Almost immediately, he feels a hand on his leg.  
      He looks -- it s Sonja.  He looks at her.  She s smiling.

      He looks away, catches Karen s gaze.  Somehow she 
      instinctively senses the chemistry between Hank and Sonja.  
      Hank can t help but smile.  And then he feels something.  
      Another hand on his leg.  Looks down...

      It s Mia s.  He looks at her.  She s smiling too.  He looks 
      away, catches Bill staring at him.  Becca pipes in:

                                  BECCA

                                  HANK
                    Sure.  As long as it poops here.

                                  BILL
                    We ll talk about it, honey.

      Hank winces, doesn t like the  honey.   Bill realizes.

                                  BILL
                    Sorry, Hank.  My apologies.

                                  HANK
                    No worries.  She is very sweet.

      Nervous laughter.  Bill clears his throat, raises a glass.

                                  BILL
                    Allow me to propose a toast.  To 
                    friends, family, a new beginning...

      Under the table, Mia has found Hank s dick.

                                  MIA
                    And a happy ending.

                                  BILL
                    Well said, honey.  Cheers.

      Everyone drinks up.  Hank drains his entire glass, squirming 
      in his seat as Mia grinds him hard.  Sonja continues to 
      stroke Hank s inner thigh, oblivious to the tugjob action.

                          (to Karen)
                    So how did you and Bill meet?

      Karen is immediately uncomfortable.

                    Probably not the best setting for

                    Are you kidding me?  Couldn t ask 
                    for a better setting.  Bill hired 
                    Karen to redo his place.  This 
                    place.  Along the way, they talked 
                    Zen and the art of the mid-life 
                    crisis and fell head over heels.

                    A bit of an oversimplification,

                    writing.  And that was it.  Nine 
                    months later, I was born.  They 
                    never got married, of course.  But 
                    they stayed together a long time.  
                    A lot longer than most people do.

      No one knows what to say.  Hank smiles sweetly at Becca.  
      Looks at Karen, who is dodging both his look and Bill s.

      Mia gives Hank s cock a final squeeze and gets up from the 
      table.  She kisses Bill goodbye.  And so she goes.

      Mia sees Hank.  Takes in his disheveled state, very amused.

      Hank reclines in the Porsche, looking up the sky, the top
