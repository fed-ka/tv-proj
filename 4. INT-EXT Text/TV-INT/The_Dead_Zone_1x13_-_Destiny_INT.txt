          VERA SMITH, in a flowery seventies dress, opens her door
          to reveal the Father and Son sales team.

                                        JAMES
                        Afternoon, Mrs. Smith.  I'm James
                          Stillson, this here's my son Greg. 
                        We're from the church, can we
                        borrow a moment of your time?

                                        VERA
                                (not unpleasant)
                        From First Beacon?  I don't believe
                        I've seen you before...

                                        JAMES
                        That's right, Ma'am.  Reverend
                        Mackey sent us, you filled out
                        your name on this card here...

          He holds up a registration card.  Vera remembers.

                                        VERA
                        Oh, you're from the bible company.

                                        JAMES
                        Now she's got it.

                                        VERA
                        Well, I do have, I mean to say,
                        we already have several bibles in
                        the home...

                        Not like this one, Ma'am.

          And Greg steps forward, holding a mammoth white bible in
          his arms, size of a fat picture album.  He opens it,
          displaying several color plates intermixed with text. 

                                        GREG
                        You can see it has beautiful art*
                        from all the great masters.  In*
                        color.  See, you can see the baby*
                        Jesus right there.  See...

                        Beautiful. 

                                        GREG
                        And there's over forty five of
                        these color plates, and they tell
                        the whole story.  See, here's
                        Jesus with the loaves and fishes.

          Vera smiles at Greg, clearly taken with him.

                                        VERA
                        You know your bible pretty well,
                        I'd say.

                                        GREG
                          I learned from the pictures first,
                        they made me want to read. 

                                        JAMES
                        You can see how this adds value
                        to a home.  I can tell you it has
                        for mine.  Greg here is the proof. 

          Greg smiles his warm smile.  Vera smiles at Greg's charming
          mix of huckster and innocent.

                                        VERA
                        I'll get my pocketbook. 

          Vera steps out of the way to reveal JOHNNY, nine years
          old, standing behind her, curious.

                                        VERA
                        Oh, I didn't see you there, Johnny.

          She heads for the kitchen.  Johnny and Greg stare at each
          other.  Greg in his cheap suit, Johnny in a cotton polo.

                                        JAMES
                        Johnny, is it?  Have you read the
                        good book, son?

          Greg smiles, and hands over the tome to Johnny.  And as
          Johnny adjusts to hold its weight, the tips of his fingers
          touch the tips of Greg's fingers under the book...

          The CLOSE-UP image of their FINGERTIPS touching grinds to
          a HALT, and a RUMBLING SOUND BEGINS...

          FREEZE FRAME - JOHNNY'S EYES

          As the rumbling gets louder, a Freeze Frame of GREG'S
          EYES dissolve over Johnny's in an overlay, changing the
          color of both their eyes into a deep violet, and then we
          PUSH IN through the iris to see, for the first time, the...


  44MONOLITH IMAGE 

          The image is blurry, out of focus, but we can make out a
          THIN BLACK SHAPE in the dead center of the frame, set
          against an ORANGE-RED background.  A push-in/zoom-out
          effect brings the background closer as the black tower
          seems to stand in place...  the RUMBLING is almost
          unbearable now, testing the lower registers of TV speakers
          all across the nation...

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  55SOUND CUTS OUT

          We are back in the quiet Smith house.  Johnny drops the
          bible, which claps against the floor.  He staggers, weak
          in the knees, then almost faints, collapsing to an awkward
          sitting position.

          Instead of offering Johnny a hand, Greg bends down and
          picks up the bible, dusting off the merchandise and almost
          scowling at Johnny. 

          Vera is back on the scene, hoisting Johnny up. 

                                        VERA
                        Oh boy.  You okay? 
                                (to Stillsons)
                        Johnny fell and knocked his head
                        on the ice, 'bout two months ago. 
                        He's had a couple fainting spells
                        since, from the concussion... you
                        okay?  You want some water? 

          Johnny nods.  Vera smiles.  James smiles.  Greg smiles.  



          James doesn't start the car, looks at Greg for a beat.

                                        JAMES
                        Which picture'd you show, again?

          Greg opens a thick red bible, finger points to a page. 
          James savagely SLAMS the book shut with Greg's hand caught
          inside.  Greg gasps in pain as James holds it shut.

                                        JAMES
                                (very calm)
                        Now let's go over this again. 
                        What do we sell? 

                                        GREG
                        But... but she bought...

                                        JAMES
                        We sell the whole set.  How are
                        we supposed to sell the whole set
                        when you knock down the buyer's
                        kid right in front of her, and
                        then pick up the bible instead of
                        the kid.

                                        GREG
                          I didn't...

          James presses harder, Greg squints out tears.

                                        JAMES
                        You didn't think.  You just
                          reacted.  Like a dumb animal. 
                        You want to be a dumb animal? 
                        You want to be doing this job for
                        the rest of your life?

          Greg musters inner strength, glares at his father.*

                                        GREG
                        No.*

          James releases the pressure, opens the book.

                                        JAMES
                        Damn right you don't.

          He starts the car, tosses Greg his handkerchief.

                                        JAMES
                        Wipe off the page.

          Greg, trembling, nursing his swollen hand, looks out the
            window... and spots Johnny, watching from an upstairs
          window.  Greg holds the stare, and their eyes never leave
          each other's until the Mercury rolls out past the gate.

          FADE IN:


          CHUCK CHATSWORTH, 18, a popular, handsome high school
          football star who also manages to be a nice guy, reads
          from a thin paperback book.  Johnny is tutoring Chuck in
          his father's study.

                                        CHUCK
                        "The clerk barely looked up to 
                        ask, 'Relation to the deceased?'   
                        Hammond smiled, took off his hat,*
                        and told the truth.  "He was my
                          partner."
                                (closes the book)

                        Just in time for my friends.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right after questions.

                                        CHUCK
                                (standing up)
                        C'mon, Smitty, I already graduated. 
                        You were there.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell it to the S.A.T.'s. 

                                        CHUCK
                        That's like four weeks away. 
                          Tonight, on the other hand...*

          Chuck pauses, waiting for something.  Sure enough, a
          DOORBELL rings from downstairs.  Chuck smiles broadly.

                                        CHUCK
                        ...Is the party. 

          Chuck bounds out of the room.  Johnny can't help but smile
          to himself.

          Chuck pounds down the stairs and jogs past the living
          room down the hall to the front door.  He opens it,
          greeting friends - two GIRLS and a GUY. 

          But we hang back in the living room, where ROGER
          CHATSWORTH, wealthy industrialist, watches TV on a huge

          screen.  Roger is a self made man, self-assured but down
          to earth.  He perks up as Johnny walks down the stairs.

                                        ROGER
                        Here he is. 

          Roger stands, picks up a slip of paper from an end table,
          holds it out for Johnny.  His paycheck.  Johnny takes it.    

                                        ROGER
                        Just want you to know, this does
                        not measure my level of gratitude. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.  It was very satisfying. 

                                        ROGER
                        You succeeded where others failed. 
                          Remember that. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Chuck's the one who really
                        succeeded.  With a reading phobia
                        like Jackson's Syndrome, I've
                        found it's the high achievers who
                        suffer the most... 

          Roger nods, attention distracted by the TV.

                                        ROGER
                        Wait, shh, look at this.

          And Roger turns up the volume on the remote.  The TV is
          showing an interview between anchor GEORGE WALTERS and
            congressional candidate GREG STILLSON, now 36 and very
          handsome - the curious eyes now sharper, more knowing. 

                                        GEORGE WALTERS (TV)
                          I didn't mean to imply that, I'm
                        just having difficulty trying to
                        articulate your platform.  One
                        wants to say moral reform-

          Greg cuts him off, speaks with speed, passion, and anger.

                                        GREG (TV)
                        Yes, but no.  I don't want to
                        reform the morals of the people. 
                        They have morals, they're
                        Americans.  What they need is
                          RESPECT.  And faith.

                        I'm against bad government, George. 
                        And I've got a message for every

                        the papers again.  People are

          by a THUNDERCLAP and we ROCKET INTO JOHNNY'S EYE without
          warning where FIRE envelopes the frame.  We hear awful
          HOWLS of human terror (this happens so fast it should
          make everyone JUMP)...

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:



          CLOSE ON FLAMES from a gas range.  They die down as SARAH
          turns off the burner.  She scoops scrambled eggs onto two
          plates and walks them over to WALT and JOHNNY JR.

                        Smells good.

          She seems agitated as she watches them dig in.

                          Whatever happened to Dana?  Is

          But then Walt realizes why.  Sarah shrugs, looking down.

                        Just wondering.

                          I assume she's still on the police
                        beat, but Dana was always looking
                        for a promotion.  She did write
                        some articles on Johnny...

                        Maybe she moved on to something
                        better. 

          The tone of his voice is very pointed.  Sarah now looks
          at him.  Johnny Jr. looks back and forth between them. 
            Obviously something is going on between Mom and Dad, but
          he doesn't know what. 

          Sarah is about to say something when the PHONE RINGS.

          Walt looks at Johnny Jr., who now gets what they were

          a bit of before she closes her fingers around it.

          from it, head bowed.  We can't see his face because the
          fire is back-lighting him, turning him into a silhouette. 
          He is in the dead center of the frame, and from this angle
          he looks exactly like the BLACK MONOLITH, set off against

          FADE IN:



          Greg Stillson leans back in a squeaking office chair as
          an intrepid twenty year old campaign volunteer named KATIE
          sits on his lap, riding him.  Katie is no more than twenty,
          and she's completely naked except for a straw hat with a
          red, white, and blue ribbon on top.   

          Greg, on the other hand, is almost fully dressed.  In
          fact, as Katie bounces, we see that her hands are working
          the buttons on his cotton shirt - buttoning them up. 

                                        GREG
                        Now the tie.

          And she reaches for a silk tie, playfully wraps it around
          his collar...



          James Stillson sits next to the DRIVER while he reads
          through poll reports.  He gets up and heads back through

          Greg unceremoniously shoves Katie off.  Panicked and
          blushing red, Katie rapidly grabs her strewn about clothes
          to cover her body.

          Daddy Jim ignores his son, walks past him, past the
            bathroom, and flings open another door to reveal a tiny
          office where a handsome, Aryan looking man with green
          eyes checks stocks on a laptop.  This is SONNY ELLIMAN,
          Greg's right hand man.  The astute observer will note a
          pistol and shoulder harness hanging on the back wall.

          He reaches out, straightens Greg's collar over his tie,
            finishing up Katie's job.

          All the press turn to see Johnny, and scramble away from
          Greg and over to Johnny, like bees to a bigger rose. 
          Dana doesn't follow them, grimacing at the vulture-like
          behavior of her colleagues, and feeling sorry for Johnny.

          THE PRESS

          Descend like buzzards, pecking with questions.

                                        VARIOUS PRESS (O.S.)
                        What did you see?  Mr. Smith? 
                        How long did you know about it?

          Johnny hikes up his collar over his face. 

          Sonny Elliman steps up next to his boss, who smiles.

                                        GREG
                        How about that.  Upstaged by a
                          psychic.  Look at 'em go.

                                        SONNY
                        They're not serious about this
                        freak, are they?

                                        GREG
                        He must be good.  Can't blame him
                        for playing the angle, though. 
                        We've all been there...

          Greg watches Johnny get into his car, and we cut EXTREMELY
          CLOSE ON GREG'S EYES - The curious twinkle returning...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          22 year old Greg Stillson is closing a sale.  Sitting at
          a small kitchen table, dressed in a solemn black suit,
          and cloth bowtie, he reads from the bible (white). 

          FARMER CROW and his WIFE listen in reverence with eyes
          closed.  American Gothic circa 1988.  Greg had this one
          sewn up about ten minutes ago, and now he's indulging.   

          The reason why is leaning up against the kitchen wall. 
            Seventeen years old and stuck on the farm for all of 'em. 
          CHARLOTTE, the proverbial farmer's daughter.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT TWO - 7/02/02 - YELLOW   22.


    26CONTINUED:26

          Fitting as Greg reads from Proverbs (5:3-6).

          As Greg reads, his eyes never leave hers, and her eyes
          never leave his.  Her parents eyes remain closed.

                                        GREG
                        "For the lips of an adulteress
                        drip honey, and her speech is
                          smoother than oil; but in the end
                        she is better as gall, sharp as a
                          double-edged sword. Her feet go
                        down to death; her steps lead
                          straight to the grave. She gives
                        no thought to the way of life;
                        her paths are crooked, but she
                        knows it not..."

          Off Charlotte, staring at Greg, biting her lip...



          Greg fucks the Farmer's daughter up against a wall, a la
          Sonny Corleone in "The Godfather."  Her sundress is hiked
          up, her legs wrapped around the cheap black suit.

          The door opens and the Farmer's Wife walks in.

                                        MRS. CROW
                        Charlotte?

          She sees Charlotte, lets out a yelp of surprise, followed
          shortly by a SCREAM.

          Greg spins around.  Charlotte falls to a crouch.  Mrs.
          Crow SCREAMS again.

                                        GREG
                        Wait now-

          She SCREAMS again, even louder.  Greg's face tightens and
          he moves toward her.  We never know what he intended
          because Farmer Crow comes through the door, holding a
          SHOTGUN.  Greg backs away swiftly.

                                        FARMER CROW
                        What the hell now!

          Crow instinctively brings up the shotgun, pointing it at
          the one thing in the room that doesn't belong there.  Bad
          move.  Greg grabs Charlotte and holds her as a body
          shield.

          Worse move.  Now this potential comedic incident has become
          an ugly, desperate drama.

                                        GREG
                        Drop it, old man!

                                        FARMER CROW
                        Let her loose now you!  You!

                                        CHARLOTTE
                          Daddy...

          Mrs. Crow SCREAMS again.  Greg pulls Charlotte closer,
          his head craned over her neck, cheeks touching. 

                                        GREG
                        That's a twelve gauge remington
                        you got there, Mr. Crow.  No way
                        to hit me without tearing up your
                        baby here.
                                (calm, regaining
                                  control)
                        Now, we're gonna work this out
                        like gentlemen, and the first
                        rule is you keep that bitch's pie
                        hole shut. 

          Mrs. Crow's shaking hands go quickly to her mouth.



            Charlotte is now in the passenger seat.  Greg pounds the
          steering wheel, furious.

                                        GREG
                        God damn primates!  I'm done with
                        it!  Done!  Driving into piss-ant
                        towns knocking on doors, I'm
                          through!

          He ferociously rolls down the window, almost ripping the
          handle off in the process.

          He drives in silence for a beat, wind whipping his bangs. 
          His face becomes composed, and then puzzled. When he speaks
          again, it's almost under his breath.  But we can hear
          every word, even against the wind.

                                        GREG
                        I'm meant for something else. 
                          Something more.  Like my Dad
                        says... greatness.  And it's not
                        in here.

          He holds up a bible, looking at Charlotte, who is backed
          against the door, staring.

                                        GREG
                        It's in me.

          He throws the bible out the window, and turns back to the
          road.  A faraway look enters his eyes.... 

                                        GREG
                        I get dreams, you know. 
                          Powerful... dreams.  I don't even
                        know what they mean.  They come
                        to me and... I'm gonna get there
                          someday.  Hasn't even started. *
                        But I can feel it coming.  Do you*
                        know what I mean?*

          Greg is so unstable he's almost on the verge of tears. 
            Charlotte stares at him, hypnotized, breathless.

                                        CHARLOTTE
                        Take me with you.

          Greg blinks.  He wasn't selling anything, and this girl
          is ready to buy the whole set.  The faraway look fades
          and the curious twinkle returns, as he witnesses a
          reflection of his powerful potential.  His lips curl.

                                                                                  CUT TO:          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT TWO - 7/02/02 - YELLOW   25.

          standing on the shoulder of the dirt road as the Mercury's
          door slams shut and Greg Stillson drives off, leaving her
          in his dust.  Rolling down the straight farm road leading
          to his future...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


    30A30AOMITTED



          OVERFLOWING with mail of all shapes and sizes.  It
            dominates tabletops, it rules the floor.  Bruce sits across
          from Johnny, a chessboard between them.  Johnny stares
          glumly at the board while Bruce flips through his mail.

                                        BRUCE
                        Dear Johnny, Dear Johnny, Gas
                        Bill, Dear Johnny... hmm...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You gonna make a move?

                                        BRUCE
                        You know you got a letter from
                          Dateline NBC?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do tell.

                                        BRUCE
                                (skimming letter)
                        They want an interview.  They say
                        this is their second letter and
                        they tried to call three times.

          Johnny just shrugs, then gestures to the chessboard.

                        A joke.  Good.  We should be joking
                        about this.  It's ridiculous.
                                (leaning forward)
                        It's also the way the world works.

                        It's not them I'm worried about. 
                        It's...

          Johnny gets up, takes an envelope off the table.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Florence Wickett from Boulder.

                        me where he is so I can get child
                        support outta the cheap bastard."

          Johnny grabs another package, we hear something rattle
          inside.  His grin is gone.

                                        JOHNNY

          Johnny paws through the mail pile.  Bruce looks away. 
          Johnny SWEEPS the pile off the table and onto the floor.

          For a beat, there's just silence.  Then, a phone rings. 
          Johnny and Bruce look at each other.  Bruce spots Johnny's
          CELL PHONE, the one Sarah gave him.  He answers it.

                        You don't want to talk to me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You just caught me at a bad time. 
                        What's going on?

                                        SARAH
                        You tell me.  You don't return
                        calls, haven't left your house...

                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT TWO - 7/02/02 - YELLOW   28.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want me to say, Sarah?

                                        SARAH
                          ...Nothing.  I want to see you.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (closes his eyes)
                        Why?

                                        SARAH
                        Why?  I have to have a reason
                        now?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (eyeing mail on floor)
                          Everyone else does...

                                        SARAH
                        Know what, you have to stop feeling
                        sorry for yourself.  What happened
                        at that restaurant wasn't your
                        fault.  And all those people who-

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that why you wanna come over? 
                        To give me advice?  'Cause I'll
                        save you the trip, I don't want
                        it hear it.  I just want to be
                        left alone.

          He hangs up, snaps off the battery, and looks up at Bruce,
          who is staring at him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got any more advice for me?

                                        BRUCE
                        No, man.  You seem to have it all
                        figured out.

          Bruce leaves.  Johnny sits back, glaring at the chessboard. 
          At the big King piece, surrounded by its defenders...



          A small room has been set up for a catered press
          conference.  Reverend PURDY sits behind a long table,
          flanked on either side by Greg and James Stillson. *
            REPORTERS jockey for questions.  We notice a lack of
          cameras.  Purdy controls the room, singling out questions.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT TWO - 7/02/02 - YELLOW   29.

                          Reverend Purdy, Alex Ross, WPOV. 
                        Most will be surprised by your*
                        backing of Greg Stillson as an*
                          independent candidate.  Does this*
                        signal the alliance is breaking*
                        its ties with the G.O.P?

                                        PURDY
                        I've never felt that I nor the
                        Faith Heritage Alliance swore
                        loyalty to any particular party. 
                        My responsibility is to find the
                          candidate most dedicated to God's*
                        agenda.  This election year, that
                          candidate is clearly Greg Stillson.

          More raised hands.  Purdy smiles as he calls on...

                                        PURDY
                        Yes, Dana.

                                        DANA
                        How are you planning to address
                        your candidate's checkered past? 
                        The alleged claims of bribery,
                        for example? 

                                        JAMES
                        Now that's not appropriate.  This
                        is a press conference for a press
                          release.  If you wanna mudsling,
                        buy airtime and shoot a commercial.

          Purdy leans into his microphone.*

                                        PURDY
                        Really, Dana.  I think that kind
                        of rumor-mongering is beneath
                        you.  The bible warns us not to
                        go down as a talebearer amongst
                        others.

                                        PURDY
                        You see?  Another reason I like
                        him.  

          Light laughter from the press.  Purdy has them where he*
          wants them.  All except for Dana.

                                        PURDY
                        My support for Greg is founded on
                        his future, which promises to be
                        very bright.  Today, we've
                          announced this to the press.  On
                        Sunday we plan on sharing it with
                          everyone, at the Interfaith
                          festival. 

            Reporters scribbling.  One reporter blurts out...

                                        REPORTER ALEX ROSS
                          Reverend, what's your association
                        with psychic Johnny Smith?

          It's like the floodgates were opened.  Other reporters
          start jumping on the bandwagon, as if these were the
            questions they really wanted to know: "Have you talked to
          him?/Is he for real?  /How did he predict the fire?"

          Greg's eyebrow arches as he again loses the spotlight to
          this psychic guy.  And this time he's not even here. 
          Purdy motions for quiet.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny Smith is a dear friend of
                        mine.  I've known him since birth,
                        and have also been his legal
                          guardian for the past five years.

            Questions start up again, but he silences them.

                                        PURDY
                          I believe in miracles.  Of all
                        shapes and sizes.  Johnny Smith
                        works in the realm of big miracles. 
                        I've had the privilege to see
                        them, firsthand.  He has his fair
                        share of detractors, yes, but so
                        did Abraham.  So did Daniel.  So
                        did Christ.

          Somehow Purdy has managed to turn a quote into a sermon. 
          And for a moment the reporters sit there like good Sunday
          School students.  Greg looks at Purdy out the corner of
          his eye.



          The press conference is breaking up.  Dana is slinging
          her purse over her shoulder, edging her way out.  Purdy
          walks over and corners her in the aisle.

                                        PURDY
                        Dana.

                                        DANA
                        Excuse me, Gene.  Gotta go write
                        up your sermon.

                                        PURDY
                        Have you spoken to him?

                                        DANA
                        He's not speaking to anyone. 
                        He's shut himself in his house.

                                        PURDY
                        I can only imagine what he must
                        be going through.

                                        DANA
                        But that won't stop you from using
                        him.

                                        PURDY
                        Using him?  How would I use him? 
                        I look on Johnny as a son.
                                (closer)
                        And you have no business acting
                          righteous toward me.

          He moves away, back to the Stillsons, who are greeting
          faculty.  Dana suddenly feels a chill, turns to see Sonny
          Elliman across the room, leaning up against a wall, looking
          at her with his cold green eyes. 



          Find Johnny making a sandwich in the kitchen.  The phone
          rings.  It's a different ring.  One for the outside
            intercom.  Johnny touches the phone, and grimaces.  He
          picks it up, already knows who it is:

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        Johnny, it's Gene Purdy.  May I*
                        come in?

          Johnny sits across from Purdy at the kitchen table.  He
          eats his sandwich, slightly petulant.

                        I'm glad you stopped by.

                                        PURDY
                        I meant to sooner, but I felt you
                        needed your space...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need money.

          Purdy is caught off guard, but recovers quickly.

                                        PURDY
                        Of course.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A lot of money.  I want to drain
                        my trust.
                                (off Purdy's look)
                        I'm taking a trip.  And I'm not
                        coming back for a while.

          Johnny takes a big bite out of his sandwich.  Purdy nods.

                                        PURDY
                        You can do whatever you want to,
                        of course.  I'll honor your wishes. 
                        But at least consider my offer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What offer?

          Purdy gestures to the piled up mail.

                                        PURDY
                        You can't live your life under
                        these conditions.  I understand
                        that.  I want to help you.

                        Or you can live here.  The bottom
                        line is I will use my resources

          Purdy stares at Johnny for a beat.  Then leans forward,
          his voice drops, becomes almost conspiratorial.

                                        PURDY
                        Have you ever had a boring vision,
                        Johnny?

                        What?

                                        PURDY
                        In the time since your Dead Zone
                        has been active, have you ever
                        touched someone, and seen them
                        mowing their lawn?  Or taking a
                        nap?

          Johnny's never thought about it before.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                        Why do you think that is?  I'll
                        tell you why.  Because you are
                        important.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you mean unfortunate.

                                        PURDY
                        I know this isn't the life you
                        would have chosen.  But it is the
                        life that has chosen you.  And
                        you cannot deny the possibility
                        that some other force is guiding
                        you.  Choosing what you will see.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just say his name, Reverend.  I
                        know you're dying to.

                                        PURDY
                          Destiny, Johnny.  It is your
                        destiny to help people.  I truly
                        believe that.

          Johnny considers this.  Fights not to accept it, though
          deep in his soul, it's a losing battle.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (attempting glib)
                          I always thought destiny was a
                        rosier word for fate.

                        Call it whatever you want.  Every
                        event in your life has been

                        To make you ready.

          And this makes Johnny pause, for something in it rings
          true to him.  Something he's felt before.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ready for what?

          Purdy sits back, pulling back his intensity.  He stands.

                        Think it over.  Call me when you're
                        ready.   

          As he passes Johnny, Purdy touches him on the shoulder. 
          We SPIN 180 degrees to face Johnny, who reacts to the red-
          orange glow as he sees...


  3838VISION FLASH:

          A billowing FLAME CLOUD churning in super slow motion.  
          The BLACK OBELISK roars straight toward us, its impact
          BLACKS OUT THE FRAME.


  3939JOHNNY

          Jolts in his seat.  The vision lasted half a second, but
          has left Johnny in a state of shock.  Reverend Purdy is
          already past him, and didn't notice a thing. 

          Johnny turns around, but words fail to come out of his
          mouth.  Purdy is already gone.  Johnny turns back to the
          table, heart pounding in his chest...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


          Johnny has lit a roaring fire, using some mail as kindling. 
          He stokes the fire with a black iron poker. 

          He regards the blaze for a moment.  Then he leans the
          poker lengthwise against the fireplace mouth.  Walks to
          his couch and sits down, facing the fire with the thin
          black line in the middle.  Staring intently at it.

          Johnny shakes his head.  Doesn't understand what it means

            Suddenly, the unmistakable sound of a key entering a lock. 
          Johnny turns his head.  The sound is coming from outside
          the room, from the front entry way.

          Johnny grips his cane and stands, moves as quickly and
          quietly as he can to the door to the foyer.  He presses
          himself up against the wall, and peeks his eye into the
          darkened room to see Sarah stepping in, her eyes adjusting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah?

                                        SARAH
                                (jumps)
                        Oh, God, you scared me!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Scared you?  How'd you get in
                        here?

          Sarah holds up a key ring.  Johnny crosses to her.

                                        SARAH
                        Gave 'em to me ten years ago.  I
                        was just bringing 'em back.

          Johnny shuts the door, shuts the door, locks the locks,
          puts out his palm.  She hands him the keys.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You came here at ten o'clock to
                        return my keys?

                                        SARAH
                        I would've called first, but that
                        didn't go so well last time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry about that... 

          She walks past him, into the flickering living room, taking
          in all the mail and mess strewn about.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT THREE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW  36.


    40CONTINUED:40

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, Johnny, look at this place.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not that bad.

                                        SARAH
                        No, it just needs a woman's...
                        bulldozer.

          He studies her studying the room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you really here, Sarah?

                                        SARAH
                        I came here to give you something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My keys?

                                        SARAH
                          Something else.

          She turns around, and in her hand, is a red and gold
          plastic ring, a cheap souvenir from a prize machine. 
          Johnny approaches her slowly, pulled by it.

                                        SARAH
                          Recognize this?  You won it for
                        me in a nickel machine the night
                        of the county fair.  Do you
                          remember?  You put it on my finger
                        in the car.  You said, "I know
                        it's not three karats but it is
                        two months salary."

          Sarah chuckles, but Johnny lifts his gaze from the ring
          to stare at her, troubled.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How long have you been holding on
                        to this?  I mean...

                                        SARAH
                          I always meant to give it back to
                        you.  I was just waiting for the
                        right time.  Then I realized...
                        there may never be a right time.

          Johnny isn't buying it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why'd you come over here, Sarah?*



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT THREE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW  37.


    40CONTINUED: (2)40

                                        SARAH
                        I just told you.  How many times
                        are you going to ask me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        'Till you give me the real answer.

          A long moment passes between them.  Sarah lowers her head,
          shamefaced and confused.

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know.  I thought I knew.
                                (beat)
                        I don't know.  Maybe because
                          sometimes I wake up in the middle
                        of the night, and for a second I
                        forget who I am.  Then I look
                        over at Walt, and remember.  But
                        the first thing- the first thought
                        that goes through my brain, is
                        that somehow I've been cheated.

          Johnny isn't ready to hear this.  He begins to shake his
          head, but Sarah refuses to acknowledge it.  She needs to
          get this out, and he's the only one she can tell.

                                        SARAH
                        Then I start to think "what if?" 
                        What if you didn't get in that
                        car crash?  What if we didn't
                        make a son that night?  ...But
                        then it passes, and I come back
                        to myself.  Except lately it hasn't
                        been passing, and I don't know if
                        it's because I feel you slipping
                        away from my life, or because my
                        heart is trying to tell me
                        something.
                                (beat)
                        Do you believe in fate, Johnny?   

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know yet. 

                                        SARAH
                        You don't know?  Doesn't it kill
                        you, not knowing?  Do you ever
                        think about it?  Ever?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I never stopped thinking about
                        it.

          They both stare at each other.  Vulnerable, honest, and
          alone together - for the first time in six years.

          Sarah moves to kiss Johnny, but he recoils from her
          advance, before she can touch him.  She is bewildered.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm afraid.
                                (re: her touch)
                        Of what I'll see.

          Sarah stares at him, her impulse denied, her armor
          returning.  She reaches out, takes his hand, and softly
          presses the ring into it.  Then turns and walks away. 

          Johnny watches her go, clenching the ring, which prompts...


  4141VISION - FROM "WHEEL OF FORTUNE," SARAH IN HER CAR,
          SHAKING AS SHE TAKES OFF HER WEDDING RING.  OVER THIS WE
          HEAR...

                                        SARAH (V.O.)
                        My maiden name was Bracknell...

          Next comes a rush of images - all of Sarah's face through
          various episodes, all stolen glances at Johnny.


  4242SARAH

          Has passed into the foyer when Johnny grabs her and turns
          her around.  They look at each other, both framed in the
          doorway between the living room and the foyer.  Then Johnny
          kisses her, long and full on the lips.

          She opens her mouth and puts her arms around him, pressing
          him back into the room, devouring him.  Losing herself. 
          He gives in, letting it all go and letting it all in.

          Johnny and Sarah fall to the living room floor, desperately
          clinging to each other, everything pent-up being released. 
          Johnny, preparing to make love to Sarah, still clenching
          the plastic souvenir ring in his hand, begins to experience
          one of the strangest visions of his life - a MONTAGE
          SEQUENCE going backward in time, stitching together a
          tapestry of his evolution up to this point, the pieces of
          the puzzle that created the new Johnny Smith. 

          A) From "Shaman," the meteor hits the mountain and
            EXPLODES.  The fireball slows to a FREEZE FRAME.

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        Every event in your life has been

          The shot REVERSES, the explosion re-forms into the meteor
          which shoots back into the sky, and we WIND BACK out of


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT THREE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW  39.


    42CONTINUED:42

          the vision to show Johnny releasing grip on the SHAMAN.

          B) From "Unreasonable Doubt," Johnny's vision in the
          convenience store as he fires the murder weapon.

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                          Lessons.  To make you ready.

          And the vision REVERSES, the bullet sucked BACK into the
          gun, and we WIND BACK out of the vision to show Johnny
          holding the gun in one hand and the bullet in the other.

          C) Blood from a vision speckles Johnny's face in the police
            interrogation room in "Here There Be Monsters..."

                                        WALT FROM "SIEGE" (V.O.)
                        You trying to change fate?

                                        JOHNNY FROM "SIEGE" (V.O.)
                        It's a jigsaw puzzle, and I'm in
                        the middle of it!

          The image REVERSES, the blood leaps off his face and Johnny
          pulls the knife out of the table.  

          D) From "The Siege," Johnny sits next to Sarah, hostages.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have everything you really
                        want, right Sarah?

                                        SARAH
                        Do I?

          E)  Back in the living room: Johnny, experiencing this
          vision, and making love to Sarah, a different kind of sex
          than Greg Stillson s.  Their lovemaking is slower, more
          intense, bespeaking pained history.  As Johnny braces his
          hand over her breast...

          F)  VFX SHOT: HEART BEATING.  Thump-Thump.  Thump-Thump.

                                        VERA SMITH (V.O.)
                        Heed the still, small voice when
                        it comes.

          The vision REVERSES, and we rewind through the arteries,
          the bloodstream, out the skin and OUT OF THE VISION, where
          Johnny has just touched Todd in "Quality of Life."

                                        VERA SMITH (V.O.)
                        It came to Jeremiah and Daniel
                        and Amos and Abraham.  It will
                        come to you.  And when it does...
                        do your duty.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT THREE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW  40.

          Over this voice-over, a CLIMAX OF CASCADING IMAGES -
          visions in REVERSE from all across Season One.  Tommy
          becoming Johnny in "Enigma."  Frank Dodd becoming Johnny
          in "What it Seems."  Ramp-outs from Johnny's face.

          G) Johnny to himself in "Quality of Life."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Heed the still small voice.

          H) Johnny and Sarah making love.

          I) The FIERY CAR CRASH that sent Johnny into the coma
          rolls in reverse, stops at the point of impact, then PLAYS
          FORWARD with full sound.  The explosion sending Johnny's
          car tumbling down the embankment on fire.  It comes to
          rest at the bottom, smoldering...

          J) Johnny and Sarah in each other's arms, eyes closed. 
          Sarah's fingers intertwine with Johnny's, which makes him
          release his grasp on the plastic souvenir ring.

          The ring rolls to the floor, ending the vision.


          FADE TO BLACK:

          FADE UP:



          The boy is older, the suit is nicer, but the country music
          remains the same as Greg Stillson drives past the accident
          scene, adjusting his rear view mirror for a look-see, and
          letting out a low whistle.  Sonny Elliman sits in the
            passenger seat.    



          Greg and Sonny exit the elevator onto the 5th floor, cross
          the hallway right into Richardson's waiting room, past
          LINDA the secretary (whom Greg graces with a flirtatious
          wink) and into the office, where sits CHARLIE RICHARDSON,
          who frowns at the interruption.

                                        GREG
                        How's tricks, Charlie?

                                        RICHARDSON
                        I'm busy.  What do you want?

          Greg sits in the seat opposite Charlie.  Sonny closes the
          door, and stands off to the left behind Greg.

                                        GREG
                        I just wanted to have a chat with
                        my old buddy.  You're not too
                        busy to chat, are you?  Hell,
                        you've been chatting to the Bangor
                        Daily all week.

                                        RICHARDSON
                        What are you talking about?

                                        SONNY
                        No, it's what you're talking about.

          Sonny tosses a newspaper on his desk.

                                        SONNY
                        Dirty real estate deals. 
                        Kickbacks.  Payoffs.  One hand
                        washing the other.  You're a
                        regular Deep Throat.

                                        RICHARDSON
                        The Shady Pines article?  You
                        think I was the source on that?

                                        GREG
                        Charlie don't.  Just don't.  We
                        know.

          Charlie hesitates, then narrows his eyes at Greg. 
            Admitting it was him, and refusing to apologize for it. 
          Greg smiles, reaches into his jacket, pulls out a folder.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: DESTINY - ACT THREE - 7/02/02 - YELLOW  42.


    46CONTINUED:46

                                        GREG
                        I've found, when running for
                        office, that it's a good practice*
                        to make a list.  A list of friends,
                        and enemies.  And to make sure
                        the people who count are on one,
                        or the other.

          He slides the folder across to Richardson, who smiles as
          if to say, "is that all?"

                                        RICHARDSON
                        Think you can scare me by putting
                        my name on some list?

          Greg says nothing.  Charlie opens the file with a smirk,
          and swallows it when he sees what's inside.  Black and
          white PHOTOS of him and Linda, his secretary we just saw,
          in various sexual positions on a cheap motel bed.

          Richardson glances at the Lucite cube on his desk, which
          displays a photo of his wife and kids.

                                        GREG
                          I haven't put your name on either
                        list as yet, because up until now
                        you really haven't mattered. *

          Charlie cracks an ugly grin, spreads his hands.

                                        RICHARDSON
                        Know what, Greg?  You put me on
                          whatever list you want.  I'm not
                        the one running for re-election. 
                        So here...
                                (tosses him photos)
                        Go blackmail someone who cares.

                                        GREG
                                (smiles thinly)
                        Who said anything about blackmail?

          Sonny steps around the desk, GRABS Charlie with both hands,
          HAULS him to the window, which Greg opens wide. 

          Charlie flails, bats his arms at Sonny, as Sonny dangles
          him halfway out the window, five stories up.

                                        GREG
                        Let me tell you a story.

                                        RICHARDSON
                        Stop!

                        Story about a man who finds some
                          pictures in the mail.  Pictures
                        of him and another woman.

                                        RICHARDSON
                        LINDA!

                        That's right, Linda.  His
                        secretary.

          Linda opens the office door, sees her boss being dangled
          out the window.

                                        RICHARDSON
                        Linda!  Help!  Call the police!

                        What, they didn't tell you?  I

                        She's got a new job.

            Richardson's eyes widen in horror, fix on Greg.

                                        GREG
                        So, the man is devastated.  Sick*
                        to his stomach.  Then the phone*
                        rings, and a voice tells him his
                        wife's been sent the photos, as
                        well as her family and his family,
                          etcetera.  And then this poor
                        sap, you know what he does?
                                (sighs)*
                        Throws himself out his fifth story*

                        Body hits a parking meter, pow,
                        head snaps clean off.

                        You wanna steer clear of me,
                          Charlie.  You wanna let someone
                        else stop me.  Someone with less
                        to lose.

                        am about to enter.

          Suddenly we are in Johnny Smith's bed, at the exact moment
          that he comes out of the coma, at the exact moment that
          Greg Stillson, miles and miles away, has just ascended to
          the next rung of power.  Johnny grabs the Nurse...

          And what we thought was a preamble to his second vision
          (the girl in the burning house), is revealed to be
            something else entirely.  A calling.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          The iron poker falls on the fireplace, clanging.  Johnny
          wakes from his sleep beneath the large comforter spread
          across him.  He's still on the floor. 

          He turns to find that Sarah is no longer with him.  But
          on the sofa cushion where her head was, is the plastic
          souvenir ring.  Johnny palms it, and holds it to his chest
          as he rolls on his back, staring at the ceiling.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


          Sarah clears the breakfast table, taking egg stained dishes
          to the sink.  Robotic.

          Walt and Johnny Jr. scoot back from the table.  Johnny
          Jr. is dressed in soccer uniform.  Dad in police uniform.  

                                        WALT
                        You ready for your big day?

                                        JOHNNY JR.
                        You ready for your big day?

                                        WALT
                        Ready as I'll ever be.
                                (over his shoulder)
                        Mom knows I love crowd control. 

          Sarah forces a smile.  Walt gets up, adjusting his tie. 
          He kisses Sarah on the cheek as he passes her.

                                        WALT
                        Call me at halftime.

          Walt heads out to work.  Johnny Jr. stops, looks at Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY JR.
                        Aren't you gonna eat breakfast?

                                        SARAH
                        I had a grapefruit. 

          She keeps cleaning.  Johnny Jr. waits, then exits.  Sarah
          moves slowly, taking forever, staring into the sink steam. 
          She bends over the sink, holding her stomach.  Then darts
          for the waste basket, opens the lid and retches into it. 

          Johnny Jr. watches from down the hall, peeking around a
          corner.  Watching his Mom cry into the blue basket.
