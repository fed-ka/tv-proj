Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a
rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean
by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable.
It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which
means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
west.
She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way
forward.
Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel
smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.
Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and
professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific
Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her
true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts
and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be
considered pretty.
She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches
to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto
the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the
bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing
that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward
the tug at the other end.
DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's
name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge
(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy
coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate
Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's
first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering
red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the
north.
They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable
occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a
passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern
where the cable winds into a tow anchor.
EPPS
It's a slow leak.
She unclips and drops to the deck.
GREER
What's slow?
EPPS
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
DODGE
Where from?
EPPS
Amidships starboard at the beam.
Just under the waterline. I don't
think it's a problem.
GREER
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think
it's a problem.
DODGE
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against
the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.
DISSOLVE TO:
The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port
town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior
approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one
side as it moves into the harbor.
A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the
listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie
her up.
Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat
Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered
orange coveralls approach from the dock.
VASILI
I thought you say Tuesday.
MURPHY
Better late than never.
VASILI
(seeing the listing
barge)
What's this?
MURPHY
You got a leak in the number nine
compartment.
VASILI
No, no. You got leak.
MURPHY
You pump it out and re-seam the hull,
she'll be good as new.
VASILI
That cost me twenty grand at least.
MURPHY
Fifteen, at the most.
VASILI
Twenty. You knock off twenty and
then we see. After my guy looks at
it.
Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.
GREER
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub
half way to Russia.
MURPHY
He'll sell the scrap for three times
what he paid.
GREER
I must be in the wrong business.
MURPHY
You got that right.
GREER
(imitating Vasili)
Better than "making hamburger for
Mickey D."
Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps
approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring
in her step and a song in her heart.
EPPS
Morning everybody.
GREER
Show your tatoos to that coxswain
last night, did you Epps?
EPPS
Showed him a hell of a lot more than
that.
GREER
I bet you did.
MURPHY
Candy?
EPPS
It's my pen name.
As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising
under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward
through a steady chop and a mild swell.
The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.
The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly
illuminating the water in front of the boat.
As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight
over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.
The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera
rising above it.
MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
This is civilian tugboat Arctic
Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?
The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.
Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck
crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against
the movement of the water.
Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps
jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the
superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over,
lending a still darker ominousness to it.
Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights
as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything
seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no
apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her
light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.
Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge
meet them at the bottom.
MURPHY
(jumping down)
There's nobody on that boat.
The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull
stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of
day.
Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of
the boat under the power winch.
DODGE
Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than
usual twin cable rig this time,
consisting of a pair of number three
gauge braided wire tows.
(a beat)
We'll tie off through the anchor
alleys. And come down to the aft
port and starboard pins. Here.
Thus,
we need to get two of these...
(indicating the cable)
Up there.
He indicates the bow of the Chimera.
DODGE
Seeing as though a foot of one of
these fuckers weighs about a hundred
pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd
call easy.
(a beat)
Any questions?
EPPS
Supposing one of those cables breaks
under tow.
DODGE
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other
questions?
Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer
operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables
dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.
WITH EPPS
Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the
starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes
his face out from the other side.
DODGE
Ready?
EPPS
Bring it on, dude.
Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with
a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through
the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of
the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten
it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.
EPPS
OK.
Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable
through the anchor alleys.
DODGE (O.S.)
(finally)
Hit it!
Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow
cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's
hull with a shower of black rust.
Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot
cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor
alley.
It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks
it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism
and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable,
entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the
deck.
The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills
out of the anchor alley before Epps.
Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat
toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and
stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek
dangerously close to his face, until...
The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor
alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A
beat as she holds there.
EPPS
Dodge? You alright?
Dodge lies tangled in the winch.
DODGE
Yes!
Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down
into the water and come up again from the water to the tow
anchor on the tug's stern.
Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his
walkie.
DODGE
Alright, skipper, real easy.
The tug moves slowly away from the Chimera as Epps, Greer
and Dodge look on.
WIDE ON TUG AND CHIMERA
As the tug widens the distance, leaving the Chimera in place.
Dodge, Epps and Greer look on as the tow cables begin to
rise in their wake.
DODGE
(into radio)
Throttle back.
The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water.
DODGE
More.
The tug slows still more.
DODGE
More.
It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and
the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water,
straightening as the slack is pulled out.
Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught
in the anchor alleys of the Chimera.
As the tow cables stretch and the bow of the Chimera inches
forward.
The turbines grow louder as Greer, Epps, and Dodge look on
at the Chimera behind them, the massive tow cables bowing
under their own weight.
The giant ship CREAKS AND MOANS as it starts forward, a small
bow break forming on its hull.
The tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the Chimera
along behind it. Dodge lets out a hoot, exchanging high fives
with Epps and Greer.
Dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another LOUD THUMP
BLOWS OUT OF THE TURBINE VENTS, SHOWERING OIL OVER THE DECK.
DODGE
(shouting up to the
pilothouse)
ALL STOP! ALL STOP!
The boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing
from the turbine vents.
as the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack.
Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck.
DODGE
The number one turbine's pretty well
trashed. Number two runs, but it's
way underpowered.
MURPHY
How long to fix?
DODGE
Hard to say. I gotta get in there
and have a look. At least a couple
days. Depending.
GREER
You think the extra strain caused
it?
DODGE
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just
one of those things.
The Arctic Warrior floats tied to the side of the Chimera.
A dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug
floats under the bow of the Chimera.
Dodge works up to his elbows in turbine 1 as Greer monitors
a pressure gauge.
DODGE
How about now?
GREER
Sixty pounds.
DODGE
What? You sure?
GREER
That's what it says.
DODGE
(geting up to have a
look)
Lemme see.
Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane
hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.
Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.
MURPHY
What's this?
DODGE
Turbine rotor's shot.
MURPHY
I thought you said it was just a
blade.
DODGE
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace
the whole deal.
MURPHY
How much longer's that gonna take?
DODGE
Like I always say --
MURPHY
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
DODGE
The right way and the wrong way.
MURPHY
But how long?
DODGE
Hard to say.
MURPHY
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A
storm blows up and we're history.
DODGE
I'm telling you, you don't want to
be running that fan like it is.
MURPHY
What about running number two by
itself?
DODGE
It's a full 2500 horses down. We
couldn't drag that boat down hill on
ice with it.
MURPHY
How long, then?
DODGE
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat
everything in a new rotor -- .
MURPHY
How long?
DODGE
Three, four days.
MURPHY
Goddamit, Dodge.
DODGE
What do you want me to tell you,
that we can throw this sucker back
in and start pulling her like nothing
happened? Can't do it, skipper.
A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (O.S RADIO)
(from the pilothouse)
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic
Warrior. This is United States
Coastguard. Over.
A beat.
Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the
ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior
is tied.
Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising
from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to
the deck.
Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open
hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker,
coming to the engine room door.
Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned
leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.
DODGE
One minute I'm minding my own
business, the next thing I know the
whole place is burning up.
(taking a drag)
An oxygen tank must've blown on the
welder. Started an oil fire.
GREER
Looks like it took out the backup
genny too.
MURPHY
Terrific.
Epps arrives with a first aid kit.
MURPHY
How's that leg?
Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.
DODGE
Seen better -- Ow!
Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.
EPPS
This's gonna hurt a little.
DODGE
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.
GREER
What now?
MURPHY
We could call for help.
GREER
And get a bunch of fools sniffin'
around here?
EPPS
What other choices have we got?
DODGE
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna
be towing no ship now.
Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.
The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE
EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on
the bow.
EPPS
It's coming from inside.
They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.
DODGE
Sounds like the hull.
MURPHY
Warm water current maybe, making the
metal expand.
GREER
That shit is seriously bizarre.
The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.
The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in
halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.
Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several
shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.
She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.
Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from
the deck house.
DODGE
Pretty handy with that scatter gun,
Epps. You raised on a farm?
EPPS
(setting the safety)
Seen a lota movies.
MURPHY
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
EPPS
No cowboy shit. Right.
Greer extends a thermos to Epps.
GREER
Coffee.
EPPS
(pocketing it in her
coat)
You're a pal.
She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.
MURPHY
Got your light?
EPPS
Yup.
DODGE
Smokes?
EPPS
Oh yeah.
Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings
the shotgun on her back.
EPPS
See you boys later.
(to Greer)
Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.
She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened
ship above them.
The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic
Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.
Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.
Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is
starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house
and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly
filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a
pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.
MURPHY
What the hell happened!
DODGE
Turbine chamber on number two must've
blown! Took out part of the hull!
GREER
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
MURPHY
Alright. Everybody grab your gear!
This' is where we get off!
The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash
with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their
gear to the crane.
Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the
towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs
precariously at the bow of the Chimera.
Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.
MURPHY
Dodge!
Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind,
then Murphy.
Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug,
which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.
WITH DODGE
Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He
goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the
starboard rail.
He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker
opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to
pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up
and edges his way toward the bow.
WITH THE OTHERS
Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the
skewed deck crane.
WITH DODGE
The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane,
the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.
Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it
sinks lower and lower.
WITH THE OTHERS
They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug
pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.
Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.
WITH DODGE
As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the
other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.
Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach
as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and
fro.
Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming
close but not close enough.
The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and
Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line,
coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as
the crane sways back with the foundering boat.
The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space
by the line from the bow of the Chimera.
WITH THE OTHERS
Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water
and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.
Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls
still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea,
slipping lower and lower.
WITH DODGE
As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail
well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of
Dodge's hand.
A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables
coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the
Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.
With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against
the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.
It
starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the
cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.
Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.
A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air
escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water
forces it out of the tug below decks.
The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust,
as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.
Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their
hands barely reaching.
The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to
scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull
like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with
everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.
Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other
hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a
SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface,
slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation
of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it
slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally
disappearing altogether into the depths.
A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom
bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.
A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.
MURPHY (O.S.)
That just about says it all.
Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards
above the deck.
GREER
Rotten stem to stern. Guess you
couldn't expect much else.
Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.
GREER
We ain't exactly in what you'd call
your high traffic neighborhood either.
MURPHY
The coast guard has our last position.
They'll send somebody out soon enough.
A ship this size you can't exactly
miss.
EPPS
It's a good bet they'll be asking a
lot of questions when they get here
too.
MURPHY
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally
ours now.
DODGE
When they find out what it's carrying,
they may not be so interested in
what's legal.
GREER
Maybe you shoulda thought a that
before you scuttled our boat.
Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.
DODGE
The turbine blew.
GREER
Lemme see, was that before or after
the oil fire?
A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.
MURPHY
(grabbing Dodge)
Easy, easy.
Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.
GREER
Gettin' a little hot under the collar,
I'd say.
MURPHY
Shut up.
GREER
Must be a little too the truth, eh
Dodge?
Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.
MURPHY
I said, shut the hell up.
Murphy shoves Dodge back.
MURPHY
Both of you. I don't want to hear it
again.
A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.
MURPHY
So just stow it. You understand?
(a beat)
We don't need this right now.
A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer
sit around it in silence.
A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the
top deck.
Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding
broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.
Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.
DODGE
You'd think on a ship this size
there'd be something left to eat.
GREER
After fifty years there ain't nothin'
left but shoe leather.
MURPHY
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find
some line and tackle. Use some of
those bodies below decks for bait.
DODGE
There's a charming thought.
GREER
We can always start shooting birds.
Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.
DODGE
What say, Epps? You up for some
roasted albatross?
EPPS
(snuffing it out)
Why not?
Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall
steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as
the ship drifts into it.
WITH GREER AND MURPHY
They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright
orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as
the ship drifts by.
MURPHY
It's a Noaa buoy.
GREER
A what?
MURPHY
Government weather. It's got a
transmitter aboard.
Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer,
Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.
MURPHY
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.
ON THE BUOY
As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the
line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.
BACK TO SCENE
Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook
it on its wind gauge.
ON THE BUOY
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
BACK TO SCENE
Murphy corrects.
EPPS
Higher. You're gonna miss it.
Murphy holds the loop steady.
ON THE BUOY
The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy
drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes
down.
BACK TO SCENE
Murphy yanks on the line.
ON THE BUOY
And the loop catches on the wind gauge.
BACK TO SCENE
As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time,
the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy
heels over as it's pulled.
ON THE BUOY
It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging
the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with
a huge BOOMING CLANG.
BACK TO SCENE
The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing
bowing a little with the weight as they look on.
GREER
We're still drifting.
MURPHY
The mooring hasn't come taught.
EPPS
It's not gonna hold us.
MURPHY
Doesn't matter.
ON THE BUOY
As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side
of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.
The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its
mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the
buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.
BACK TO SCENE
The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own
mooring.
ON THE BUOY
The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it,
and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.
BACK TO SCENE
As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the
creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.
DODGE
No fucking way.
ON THE BUOY
The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free,
sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain
of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.
BACK TO SCENE
The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising
on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.
MURPHY
Damn it.
They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the
ship drifts away.
Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.
EPPS
Hey.
MURPHY
Hey.
EPPS
Couldn't sleep.
MURPHY
Wish I could say the same.
They watch the fire in silence for a moment.
EPPS
What do you think happened on this
boat?
MURPHY
I guess that's the sixty four thousand
dollar question, isn't it?
EPPS
The what?
MURPHY
Never mind. Before your time.
(a beat)
I think at least some of the crew
went a little nuts. The usual stuff
that happens when people stumble on
a fortune. Equal parts greed and
paranoia, usually resulting in
homicide. What happened after that
is anybody's guess. But, judging by
our Greek friends down below, it
doesn't look like the last time.
EPPS
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
MURPHY
I don't know, are we?
A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire,
watching it.
EPPS
When you found me yesterday, at the
pool. I'd seen... something.
Someone.
MURPHY
Not our mystery guest again.
EPPS
No. Someone else. A girl.
(hesitating, a beat)
I'm not sure she was... real.
She looks up to Murphy.
MURPHY
Not real?
A beat as she only looks back.
MURPHY
What, like some kind of ghost?
EPPS
I don't know what else you'd call
her. One second she was there, the
next she was gone.
Another beat as he looks on at her.
EPPS
And I had a kind of hallucination.
(a beat)
There were others. I saw them in the
pool. Drowning.
A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.
EPPS
Maybe hallucination is the wrong
word. It was more than that. As though
they were showing me.
MURPHY
Showing you what?
EPPS
What happened.
MURPHY
Maybe it was one of them did the
handy work on those Greeks.
EPPS
No. I think they are, were, just
passengers. Innocent victims.
MURPHY
Victims of what?
EPPS
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
MURPHY
That much I think we've already
established.
EPPS
More than just a mutiny. More than
just the gold.
A beat as he holds there.
EPPS
She said the ship was evil. That we
had to leave right away. That if we
didn't, we might never leave.
MURPHY
What's that supposed to mean?
EPPS
I don't know.
A beat as she looks back.
MURPHY
Why you? How come the rest of us
haven't seen these people?
EPPS
Just lucky I guess.
Another beat as he holds on her.
MURPHY
Well. Getting off this ship's exactly
what we're trying to do.
Short of
that, I don't know what else to tell
you.
She only looks back at him, then into the fire.
MURPHY
Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.
He's next on.
She starts to get up.
MURPHY
And Epps?
She stands, looking back at him.
MURPHY
You can tell the others about this.
But, for my money, I think it's best
you keep it to yourself.
She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.
Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches
from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of
water.
MURPHY
You're late.
DODGE
Sorry.
MURPHY
(handing him the
shotgun)
Don't fall asleep.
DODGE
(laying out his blanket)
Right.
Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC
CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy"
playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.
A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.
Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.
MURPHY
Dodge?
Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct
as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow
and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.
MURPHY
He took the shotgun and a light.
GREER
Must've heard something below deck
and went down to check it out.
A beat as they hold there.
MURPHY
Alright. We stay together. Nobody
goes any further than earshot.
A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps
and Murphy stand over it.
MURPHY
We lash a few of these together it
might get us far enough into the
shipping lanes to be rescued.
A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.
MURPHY
Hard to say which is worse, staying
here or taking our chances in open
water.
EPPS
If the weather holds it might not be
so bad.
MURPHY
It's not the weather I'm worried
about. The wrong current could drag
us as far as the Aleutians before we
come across another boat.
Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into
a single usable raft.
The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged
mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.
The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a
mine field for a drifting ship.
The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as
it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull
precariously.
As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.
MURPHY
It should be enough to get us to one
of those islands. Gimme a hand,
wouldya?
She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to
the rail.
MURPHY
Prop it here. We need to pull these
braces off. There's a hammer on the
stand. There.
Epps crosses back to the stands.
AT THE STANDS
Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle,
folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge
had when he died.
A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.
MURPHY
I'll take that.
A beat as she looks to Murphy.
EPPS
It was you.
He only looks back at her as she stands there.
EPPS
You killed them.
MURPHY
It was only a matter of time before
somebody killed somebody.
(a beat)
You saw it coming as well as I did.
Dodge had his plans, starting with
scuttling the boat. And Greer too,
except he went nuts. Couldn't take
it, I guess. Could've happened in
the middle of downtown Anchorage.
But did it make him any less
dangerous? I don't think so.
EPPS
So you killed them?
MURPHY
The way I figure it, it was them or
me. I thought putting Dodge up on
that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a
little time. Made it look like whoever
killed those Greeks was still around.
But it's just us on this ship. Us
and your... spirit friends.
EPPS
And now you're gonna kill me, is
that it?
MURPHY
I didn't want it to turn out this
way.
EPPS
Murphy, don't you see what's
happening?
MURPHY
I think I see it pretty well.
EPPS
It's the ship. The ship's making you
think this way.
MURPHY
I know a little bit about human nature
and what I've seen only confirms
that.
EPPS
It's a trap. There was no way we
were gonna get away with that gold.
Nobody ever does. It's just the bait.
This ship sucks people in and it
never lets them out.
MURPHY
I think maybe you been on this boat
a little too long, with all that
supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's
nothing supernatural about greed.
And that's what it comes down to,
pure and simple.
EPPS
I don't give a damn about the gold.
MURPHY
I wish I could believe that. Either
way, you know what I've done. I've
got no choice.
He raises the shotgun.
MURPHY
I'm sorry.
He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps
ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the
vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS
as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun
again.
WITH EPPS
Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.
The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged
rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.
Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.
MURPHY
There's no reason to make this any
more difficult than it has to be.
WITH EPPS
As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls
herself up and climbs inside.
Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.
The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious
rock promontory of a small island.
The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a
huge gash rising on its port side.
Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the
Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully
awash.
The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged
and the stern beginning to rise.
Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins
swimming toward it.
Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.
Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself
up.
Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top
deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under
as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft
portion rising above him as the bow sinks.
DAY
Epps collapses on the rocks.
As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under
momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward
smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the
current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.
DAY
Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.
As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that
pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he
is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the
smokestack's opening.
The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of
the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to,
without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke
stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing
water.
Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on
at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she
goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.
She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the
Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts
and waves her arms.
The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time
dropping a survival pack.
The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical
now, slipping further and further under.
Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.
The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the
CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water,
then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS,
MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface,
there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the
ocean.
FADE TO BLACK
