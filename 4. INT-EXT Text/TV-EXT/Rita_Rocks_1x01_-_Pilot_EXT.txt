  (RITA, PATTY)

  THE GARAGE IS FILLED WITH YEARS OF SUBURBAN RESIDUE.
  GARDEN TOOLS MIXED IN WITH SPORTS EQUIPMENT, UNFINISHED 
  HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, DISCARDED DOLLS AND TOYS.  RITA 
  ENTERS AND DUMPS CLOTHES INTO THE WASHING MACHINE.  AS SHE 
  REACHES FOR THE DETERGENT, SOMETHING CATCHES HER EYE.
  PERCHED UP IN THE RAFTERS, BEHIND A GARDEN HOSE, IS AN OLD 
  DUSTY GUITAR CASE.

  RITA CLIMBS ONTO THE WASHING MACHINE AND SWATS AT THE CASE.
  SHE MANAGES TO KNOCK IT OUT, BUT AS IT FALLS, SHE LOSES HER 
  BALANCE AND HAS TO GRAB A RAFTER FOR SUPPORT.  AS HER LEGS 
  REACH FOR THE WASHING MACHINE, HER FOOT HITS A BUTTON WHICH 
  CAUSES THE GARAGE DOOR TO OPEN.

  STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY, SORTING THROUGH HER BAG OF MAIL, 
    IS PATTYMANNIX, THE LOCAL POSTAL CARRIER.  SHE IS A 
    CHARISMATIC, AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO CAN'T SEEM TO STAY 
  OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.  SHE WEARS THE STANDARD 
  UNIFORM -- BLUE SHORTS, SHIRT AND KNEE-HIGHS.

                                  RITA

                Help.

                                  PATTY

                Uh-uh.  Can't get involved.

                                  RITA

                The ladder.  Over there.

                                  PATTY

                Sorry.  That's how I got transferred 

                to this neighborhood.  They said, 

                'Patty, you get too involved with 

                people on your route.'  I said, "that 

                is a bunch of bull -- "

                                  RITA

                Hurry.                                                                                    19.



                                  PATTY

                Okay, there was one incident.  But as 

                God is my witness, I was only trying 

                to help Mrs. G. Wilner stuff those 

                garbage bags in the can.  How was I 

                supposed to know Mr. Wilner was in 

                 em?

                                  RITA

                Please!  I'm going to fall!

                                  PATTY

                  I m gonna lose my pension.

  PATTY QUICKLY DRAGS OVER THE LADDER AND HOLDS IT STEADY 
  WHILE RITA CLIMBS DOWN.

                                  RITA

                (OUT OF BREATH) Thank God you came.

                                  PATTY

                So next Christmas you'll do better 

                than that Happy Meal gift certificate?

                                  RITA

                I was trying to get my guitar.  I used 

                to play.

                                  PATTY

                You?

                                  RITA

                What do you mean "you"?

                                  PATTY

                I mean, you don't look the type.                                                                                    20.



                                  RITA

                What about me's not the type? C mon,

                be brutal.  I can take it.

                                  PATTY

                Don t you have any friends who can do 

                this intervention?

                                  RITA

                Sure... well, not really.  Most of my 

                friends now are  Mommy friends .  And 

                my old gang?  They stopped emailing

                somewhere between potty training and 

                training bras.

  PATTY SIGHS, PUTS HER SACK OF MAIL ON JAY S TOOL TABLE, 
  THEN GIVES RITA THE ONCE OVER.

                                  PATTY

                Okay, let's start with those clog 

                slippers you ordered from Land s 

                End...

                                  RITA

                Forget it.  I can't take it.

  DEJECTED, RITA SITS ON A RUSTY AB CRUNCHER.

                                  PATTY

                Now don't get all unglued, Mrs. R. 

                Clements.

                                  RITA

                It's Rita. R-I-T-A. Why can't 

                anybody remember that?!                                                                                    21.



                                  PATTY

                Now look what I've done. (RUMMAGING 

                THROUGH HER BAG) Would a free sample 

                  of Jergens hand lotion chill you out?

  RITA SHOOTS HER A LOOK.

                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                I was being kind.  I could've offered 

                you the Nivea anti-aging serum.

  PATTY SITS DOWN NEXT TO HER ON A LAWNMOWER.

                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                You know,  Rita , just because you 

                don't look the type, doesn't mean you 

                can't be the type.  For instance, I 

                happen to play a mean musical 

                instrument myself.  Organ.  For Temple 

                  Beth Acheim.

                                  RITA

                You're Jewish?

                                  PATTY

                Oh no, I belong to First Baptist over 

                on Six Mile and Dequinder.

                                  RITA

                Why don't you play there?

                                  PATTY

                Banned from the premises.  Like it's 

                my fault I saw Reverend Campbell 

                embracing more than just the Lord.                                                                                    22.



                                  RITA

                I better check on my laundry.  Thanks 

                for the help.

  RITA RETURNS TO THE WASHER.

                                  PATTY

                Well, now that I'm off my feet, let me 

                hear you play something.

  PATTY OPENS THE JERGENS SAMPLE AND APPLIES THE LOTION TO 
  HER ELBOWS AND KNEES.

                                  RITA

                Now? Nah, I couldn't.

                                  PATTY

                Why not?  You practically killed 

                yourself getting the damn guitar.

                                  RITA

                I'm pretty rusty.  It's been a few 

                years.

  RITA PUTS THE GUITAR IN A CORNER BY THE SHOVELS AND RAKES.

                                  PATTY

                Listen, I'm not one to pry...

                                  RITA

                Yes, I can tell.

                                  PATTY

                ... but you learn a lot about folks in 

                this job, and seems to me you're on 

                the verge of a meltdown.  If I were 

                you, I'd quit feeling sorry for myself 

                and do something about it. 

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    23.


                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                (RE: HAND LOTION) Whew-ee! This stuff 

                stinks.  No wonder they have to give 

                it away.

                                  RITA

                Well, thanks again.  I'll just take my 

                mail.

                                  PATTY

                Now I know what type you are.  The 

                "all talk, no action" type.

  PATTY DROPS RITA'S MAIL ON A SOLOFLEX MACHINE AND STARTS 
  DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.

                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                (CALLING BACK) At least Mrs. G. Wilner

                had enough guts to do something about 

                her problem.

  SHE EXITS.  A BEAT.  RITA LOOKS AT THE GUITAR CASE.  SHE 
  WALKS OVER AND OPENS IT.  INSIDE, SHE FINDS HER OLD GUITAR 
  AND DECIDES TO TRY IT ON FOR SIZE. SHE STRUMS A FEW 
  CHORDS.  OVER THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S FENCE, PATTY'S HEAD 
  POPS UP.  SHE SEES RITA AND SMILES TO HERSELF.  SOMETIMES 
  IT PAYS TO GET INVOLVED.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    24.




                                      SCENE E

  (RITA, PATTY, SHANNON, OWEN, KIP, HALLIE)

  THE DRYER WHIRS.  RITA, IN JEANS AND FLANNEL SHIRT, TUNES 
  HER GUITAR.  PATTY, STILL IN HER POSTAL UNIFORM, SETS UP 
  HER KEYBOARD ON AN OVERTURNED GARBAGE CAN.

                                  RITA

                ... then Jay asked me if I was having 

                an affair.  You believe that?

                                  PATTY

                Well, are you?

                                  RITA

                What!?  That is the most ridiculous -- 

                What?!  I'm married.

                                  PATTY

                So, just 'cause you've had supper, 

                doesn't mean you don t have room for 

                dessert.

                                  RITA

                I take it you're not married.

                                  PATTY

                Twice.

                                  RITA

                And did you ever fool around?

                                  PATTY

                I'll try anything once.                                                                                    30.



                                  RITA

                Really?

                                  PATTY

                But I fooled around six times.

                                  RITA

                No, Jay and I may be in a bit of a 

                rut, but it s a really comfortable 

                rut.  I wouldn t jeopardize everything 

                for a cheap quickie.

  RITA SEARCHES FOR A PICK IN HER GUITAR CASE.

                                  RITA (CONT D)

                You know, "B.C.", before children, I 

                did what I wanted, when I wanted.

                Now, I m so busy being everything to 

                everybody, I have nothing left for 

                myself.  Well, no more.  If I want to 

                play the guitar, I'm damn well going 

                to play the guitar.

  THERE IS A "DING" FROM THE WASHING MACHINE.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                Right after I do a load of whites.

  RITA PUTS THE GUITAR DOWN.

                                  PATTY

                Hold it, Missy!

  RITA STOPS.                                                                                    31.



                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                As my people say, the whites can help 

                  themselves.  Now get back here.  We 

                only got an hour left to jam.

                                  RITA

                Jam.  Yeah, I've always wanted to jam. 

                (BEAT) How do you jam?

                                  PATTY

                Thought you said you used to play.

                                  RITA

                Well, not with other people.  Mostly 

                alone in my room.  Fantasizing I was 

                on "Saturday Night Live", performing 

                the title track from my latest hit CD.

                                  PATTY

                Uh-huh.  And what kind of songs were 

                on this hit CD?  Wait, don't tell me.

                Some angry white girl I-don't-fit-in-

                      have-a-bad-haircut-can't-get-laid

                songs?

                                  RITA

                Well, I did go through a Sinead

                O Connor period.  Which was somewhere 

                between my Stevie Nicks shawl years 

                and my Patti Smith, stop shaving my 

                armpits phase.                                                                                    32.



                                  PATTY

                No wonder you couldn't get laid.

  PATTY BEGINS TO RIFF.  RITA CAUTIOUSLY JOINS IN.  THEY TRY 
  TO GROOVE TOGETHER, BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING.  THEY STOP.

                                  RITA

                  (HOPEFULLY) Not bad.

  PATTY RAISES AN EYEBROW.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                I know what's wrong.  We didn't do the 

                countdown thing.

                                  PATTY

                Then hit it, girl.

                                  RITA

                A one, two, one-two-three-four!

  THEY START PLAYING AGAIN.  THIS TIME A LITTLE MORE RELAXED.
  YOU CAN TELL RITA KNOWS HER WAY AROUND A GUITAR.

                                  SHANNON (O.S.)

                Mom!  I got green!  I got green!

  SHANNON RUNS INTO THE GARAGE, WAVING A STRIP OF GREEN 
  FABRIC.

                                  SHANNON (CONT'D)

                See!  See!

  SHANNON SHOVES THE FABRIC IN RITA'S FACE.  RITA AND PATTY 
  STOP PLAYING AGAIN.

                                  RITA

                That's great, Shan.  So proud of you.

  SHE HUGS SHANNON.

                                  SHANNON

                Sew it on for me, 'kay?                                                                                    33.



                                  RITA

                Sure.  Later though.

                                  SHANNON

                Now.

                                  RITA

                No.

                                  SHANNON

                Why?

                                  RITA

                Because.

                                  SHANNON

                 Cause why?

  FROM DOWN THE STREET WE HEAR THE ICE CREAM TRUCK 
    APPROACHING.

                                  RITA

                  (FRUSTRATED) Here's a couple bucks, 

                sweetie.  Go get a Klondike bar.

  SHANNON GRABS THE MONEY, JUMPS ON HER BIKE AND RACES OFF.

                                  SHANNON (O.S.)

                HEY, WAIT UP!

                                  RITA

                (OFF PATTY'S LOOK)  I know, I know.

                You're thinking I'm the worst mother 

                ever.

                                  PATTY

                No, I'm thinking you're the worst 

                hostess ever.  Where's myKlondike

                bar?                                                                                    34.



                                  RITA

                Let's play some more, then we'll "take 

                five".  I always wanted to say that.

  THE WOMEN PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF, RIFFING WITH A 
  BLUESY, R&B BEAT.  THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER, WITH A LOOK 
  THAT SAYS -- "WE'RE COOL."  SUDDENLY, A PAIR OF WHITE SOCKS 
  IN BROWN SANDALS CUTS THROUGH THE BUSHES OF THE ADJOINING 
  YARD.  IT'S OWENJAKOWSKI, RITA'S GOOD NATURED, MID-
  THIRTIES NEIGHBOR.  HE'S PURE WHITE BREAD, FROM HIS MADRAS 
  SHORTS TO HIS EVER PRESENT DETROIT TIGER'S CAP.  RITA AND 
  PATTY STOP PLAYING AGAIN.  PATTY THROWS UP HER ARMS.

                                  OWEN

                Just returning Jay s mesquite 

                  briquettes.  Tell him he was spot on 

                about that rich, smokey flavor.

  HE PUTS THE BAG OF BBQ BRIQUETTES DOWN BY THE WATER HEATER.

                                  OWEN (CONT D)

                And hate to be a party pooper, but I 

                can hear you all the way from my 

                house.  You know, a guy likes to relax 

                after a hard day at work.

                                  PATTY

                Should be plenty relaxed.  You were 

                canned three months ago.

                                  OWEN

                Down sized.

                                  PATTY

                (REACHING IN MAIL BAG) Here's your 

                  unemployment check.  Save me the walk 

                over.

  OWEN GRABS THE CHECK FROM PATTY.                                                                                    35.



                                  OWEN

                Hey, it s not easy being a stay-at-

                home-Dad.  At the plant, I could knock 

                back a couple beers at lunch and still 

                run the hydraulic press.  But man,

                  Nintendo DS with the kids takes all 

                your concentration.

                                  RITA

                Sorry Owen, we'll try and keep it 

                down.  See ya.
