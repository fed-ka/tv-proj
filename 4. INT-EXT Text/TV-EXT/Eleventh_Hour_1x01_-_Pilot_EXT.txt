      Dark of night.  Pounding, relentless rain.  A forest of tall 
      trees is split by an empty ROAD.  Silence...

      An old TRUCK guns into frame and speeds FRANTICALLY forward --



      The old truck nears a CROSSROADS and speeds THROUGH the STOP 
      sign -- a COP CAR pulls out of the shadows in pursuit --



      The cop car is closing in on the old truck --                                                                                      2.





      Cop #2 THROWS a MARKER out of his window --



      The old truck TWISTS a sharp left INTO the woods --

      The cop car banks left of the Big Rig --

      The old truck is BOUNCED off trees and the sheer MOMENTUM 
      catapults it forward INTO a big oak tree -- 

      Sanders flies THROUGH the windshield like an Olympic diver 
      and his head STOPS just short of the oak.  

        A FLASHLIGHT illuminates his bloodied face and his quivering 
      lips, that murmur an incoherent prayer -- 

      Cop #1 is POISED before him, WEAPON aimed.                                                                                      3.





      Cop #2 is walking towards his marker, gun drawn, SWEEPING his 
      flashlight, which STOPS on the plastic container AND a 
      crucifix.  The container is slightly opened.  

      Cop #2 kneels down, opens it, then REELS away in SHOCK.

                A FOREST, 12 MILES FROM SEATTLE



      Drifting over the SAME woods, we are swept forward by a 
      morning breeze, to the sight of a LEXUS HYBRID SUV speeding 
      towards a large TAPED-OFF clearing. 



      Dotted across the clearing are NINETEEN MOUNDS OF EARTH, all 
      FLAGGED and NUMBERED.   

      Cops, K-9 and CAMERA-BEARING FORENSIC, swarm the area.  

      There s an EVIDENCE TENT on the crest of the mound.   

      Detective McNEIL (35) is standing over Forensic #1, who is 
      PHOTOGRAPHING a PLASTIC CONTAINER and a CRUCIFIX, laying in a 
      hole in the ground.  There s a mound of earth beside it.

      Broken and bruised, Will Sanders is standing before McNeil, 
      flanked by two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN.  He s visibly upset.  

                                  MCNEIL
                    Is this the last one?

      Sanders sheepishly nods yes.

      Detective Byrne arrives and with quiet reverence --

                                  DETECTIVE BYRNE
                    Did you authorize some government 
                    guy into the evidence tent? 

      McNeil turns sharply in the direction of the evidence tent 
      and the Lexus Hybrid SUV parked beside it.                                                                                      4.





      Rachel is standing by the Lexus.  McNeil joins her, while 
      studying Hood as he walks IN and OUT of the MOUNDS of earth. 

                                  MCNEIL
                    I wasn t ready.  I could have taken 
                    you, you know.

                                  RACHEL     
                      Undoubtedly.

                                  MCNEIL
                    Why does he need a bodyguard?

                                  RACHEL
                    Some radical group had his car 
                    bombed.  Wanna see him blush?  Ask 
                    him where the shrapnel is.  

                                  MCNEIL
                    Who s chain did he yank?

                                  RACHEL
                    He doesn t yank chains, he breaks 
                    them.  Animal rights activists.  
                      Pharmaceutical companies.  Various 
                      multinationals. 
                          (Off McNeil s stare)
                    He s got that annoying habit of 
                    telling the truth and the truth 
                    hurts a lot of people s pockets.  
                    And no - I m not free for dinner.

      She walks to Hood.  McNeil throws up his arms, exasperated.

                                  RACHEL
                    It s in the eyes, detective McNeil.



      As Will Sanders is placed into a police car, Hood is close 
      by, studying him carefully.  McNeil approaches Hood.

                                  HOOD
                    ...this guy you arrested.  He s not 
                      a microbiologist by chance, is he?

                                  MCNEIL
                    He s an unemployed security guard.  
                    No priors.  He said someone was 
                    paying him to incinerate the 
                      containers, but when he found out 
                    what they were, he couldn t bring 
                    himself to do it.  
                          (McNeil stops before Hood)
                    How come you don t know who s 
                    behind this cloning thing?  You 
                    seem to know everything else.  

                                  HOOD
                    I ll share what I have with you, 
                    cause you ve had a rough day.  
                    There s a rogue genetic scientist 
                      Interpol s been chasing for a long 
                    time.  His first attempts at human 
                    cloning were in Eastern Europe, 
                    then South America.  Both failed.  
                    And now I believe he s come here.        

                                  MCNEIL
                    So, what s next?

                                  HOOD
                    Can you recommend a good hotel?  



      Kelly is sitting on the floor of the toilet, in terrible 
      pain.  Little David is sitting in the corner watching her.  A 
      HARD knock on the door --

                                    A VOICE (O.S.)
                    Kelly. It s Mrs. Muller.  I ve come 
                    to get you.

                                    ELDERLY WOMAN (O.S.)
                    She wouldn t let us call a doctor.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

      Kelly reaches for David s hand and squeezes it.

                                    A VOICE/MULLER (O.S.)
                    I ll take care of her.  Thank you.
                          (Footsteps FADING)
                    Kelly, I m alone now.  You can come 
                    out.  It s okay.

      Kelly opens the door to reveal a dark haired woman, LEA 
      MULLER (30).  Her smile is forced and her eyes are cold.

                                  KELLY
                    I trusted you people!  

      Kelly PULLS little David to her, subduing her anger.

                                  LEA MULLER
                    That s why I m here.  Your own
                    personal nurse.  Let me help you.

      Her hand reaches down to Kelly in a sinister way...



      Ferries come and go on the water, as the sun s last rays 
      reflect the brick face of an OLD WAREHOUSE.  A car pulls up.  
      Lea Muller gets out and helps Kelly from the car, with little 
      David.  They go inside.



      Large buildings of an emerging metropolis reach for the sky. 



      Kelly is struggling to get out of a taxi.  Little David looks 
      tired.  The taxi drives off and Kelly kneels to her son.  

                                  KELLY
                          (Muffled sobs)
                    I m sorry, honey.  I m sorry I m 
                    not such a good mommy.

                                  DAVID
                    Am I getting a baby brother? 

      Kelly s heart sinks.



      Cut and bruised, Will Sanders walks out of the precinct.  
      Hood s Lexus creeps BEHIND Sanders and follows him until he 
      turns a corner --



      The car speeds forward and brakes hard BEFORE Sanders.  Hood 
      and Rachel get out quickly --

                                  HOOD
                    Will, right?

      Rachel comes up BEHIND him.  Sanders pales and recoils.

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    Do I know you?!

      Hood DRAWS a crucifix from his POCKET.  Sanders swallows --

                    We need to have a little talk.

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    Cops never charged me.  Who the 
                    hell are you?

                                  HOOD
                    By nature, a deeply sensitive 
                    person -- but she s not.

                          (Eyeing Rachel, grinning)
                    Get lost.

      Rachel KNEES Sanders in the thigh.  He folds in agony.

                                  RACHEL
                    I m sorry.  Sugar rush.

      She THROWS him in the back of the car.  Hood climbs in beside 
      Sanders.  Rachel jumps in and QUICKLY drives off.



      Hood s car pulls up in front of the old warehouse.



      Rachel draws her gun and approaches the door.  Hood and 
      Sanders behind her.  She tries the handle.  It s locked.  
      Then she STARES at Sanders a second.  He LOWERS his eyes --

                                  RACHEL
                    Give me.

      Her hand reaches out.  Sanders RELUCTANTLY pulls a KEY from 
      his pocket and hands it over.  Hood is IMPRESSED.  

                                  HOOD
                      Intuitive.  

      She UNLOCKS the door and they enter behind her.



      The sun is almost gone as a car pulls up.  It s Doctor 
      Hayward.  He s staring curiously at the Lexus.



      Hayward s scrambling to his car --



      Hayward starts the car as Rachel appears, pulls her gun and 
      takes aim.  She FIRES at the WHEEL!  Misses!  Hayward takes 
      off around the back side of the warehouse --



      Rachel stops, aims and fires, SHATTERING the car s rear 
      window, then STARES in disbelief at Hood, emerging from the 
      back door, into the PATH of Hayward s car, WAVING his arms --



      Hayward s car DRIFTS INCHES past Hood and away.  

      Hood starts to empty his pockets of curious things, until he 
      finds a pen and paper, then begins to write something --  

                                  RACHEL
                    What was that you just did?

                                  HOOD

                    You!  Stay!
                          (Back at Hood)
                    So?

      Hood waves the piece of paper, with a number scribbled on it.

                                  HOOD
                    I got the license plate!

      She rolls her eyes, holsters her weapon --

                    Why do I bother.

      of the eclectic modern, Rem Koolhaas designed library.



      Paramedics roll Kelly s gurney inside the truck. Little 
      David s lifted in beside her, then the truck takes off.

                    right now.

                                    GIFFORD
                    Oh, my God.  But we should wait!  
                    Geppetto wants to be present for 
                    the birth!

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    I ve made that call already.  If we 
                    don t do this now, they re both 
                    going to die.  

                                    GIFFORD
                    Whatever it takes.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    There s a clinic on Bainbridge 
                    Island.  It s only been closed a 
                    few months.  It s still fully 
                    equipped.  I can use it, but we ll 
                    need cash - up front.

                                    GIFFORD
                    Give them my number.

      Gifford RUSHES back to his car --

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    Gifford! 
                          (Gifford stops and looks)
                    You know we re talking viable here - 
                    nobody s promising perfect.

      Hayward gets quickly into his car and drives off, leaving 
      Gifford contemplating those words.



      Hood s car speeds by --



      Hood s car pulls up.  Hood and Rachel get out and hurry into 
      the building -- 



      Hood and Rachel are approaching Kelly s door, which is lying 
      open.  Rachel INSTINCTIVELY stops Hood from progressing and 
      at the same time, she pulls her gun and steps inside --

                                  RACHEL
                    Stay there.



      There s a swarm of Cops and Paramedics.  Hood s demeanor is 
      anxious as McNeil quickly approaches him.

                                  HOOD
                    I need you to help me save a life.  
                    But it could mean your job.

      McNeil glances at Rachel holding David in her arms.  A Social 
      Worker takes the little boy away.  McNeil grins and nods --

                                  MCNEIL
                    Would I be doing this in the name 
                    of science - or the law?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    52.

                                  HOOD
                    How about in the name of good.



      Hood s car is parked outside the precinct.



      McNeil watches them drive away, with a look of uncertainty in 
      his eyes. 



      Hood and Rachel barge inside --



      Lea Muller is standing by the entrance.  She ALERTS when a 
      car pulls into the drive and arrives before her.  She smiles 
      NERVOUSLY as the car door opens --    

                                  LEA MULLER
                    Glad you could make it.



      Hood s car SPEEDS towards remote countryside on the island --



      Hood s car pulls up.  They both get out and rush inside.   



      Hood comes out with Rachel.  He looks contemplative --

                                  RACHEL
                    They can t find Geppetto.  No trace 
                    in or out of the country.

                                  HOOD
                    One day she ll make a mistake and 
                    I ll be there.  Bet on it.
                          (His phone rings. He 
                            listens, then hangs up)
                    We have to go, there s a situation.

                                  RACHEL
                    What kind?

                                  HOOD
                      A delicate one.
