    In the near distance we see the main buildings of O Hare
      Airport, the runway clotted with waiting planes. Before it, a 
      vast construction site, fenced in. Caterpillar excavators, 
      articulated trucks and concrete mixers all lie idle between 
      piles of rubble and dirt. It s clear the place has not seen 
    any construction activity in a while. A tent offers shelter 
      from the beating sun. 

                                  GARZA (O.S.) (IN SPANISH)
                    What do you think?

      Inside the tent. Two construction workers, GARZA and ORTIZ 
    sit amongst boxes and untouched equipment. Around them, at 
      least a dozen other workers also laze, waiting...

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    If we work, we work. If not...

      Ortiz is carefully constructing himself a very elaborate 
      burrito, reaching into small containers he s laid our before 
    him for carnitas, onions, cilantro... Garza watches him.

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    It s ten AM.

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    So.

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    So what are you going to eat for 
                    lunch?

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    Lunch.                                                                                    9.


                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    What s this?

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    This... is breakfast...

      Ortiz carefully reseals all his containers first, cleans his 
      fingers then grabbing his burrito with relish, takes a big 
      bite. His eyes light up. His cheeks puffed...

                                  ORTIZ (CONT D) (IN SPANISH)
                    ... number two.

                                  FOREMAN (O.C.)
                    Alright everyone listen up.

      They spin around. Everyone in the tent hopping to attention 
    at the approaching FOREMAN.

                                  FOREMAN (CONT D)
                    Pick up your things. Salva, 
                    Miguelito, bring the 360 trackhoes
                    and the hydro. We re working 
                    today...
                          (turns, pointing)
                    ... over there.

    We see, across the way, the large tombstone-covered grassy 
      stretch of the St. JohannesCemetery, butting right into the 
      shadow of the airport. Ortiz swallows his mouthful. Looks 
      from the graveyard to his burrito...

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER (O.S.)
                    We ve got one thousand three 
                    hundred and seventy two plots to 
                    get through. And for every single 
                    one of them I want the same thing.



    The construction crew, gathered at the center of the 
      cemetery, listen to a man covered head to toe in white rubber 
      protective wear, the CHIEF EXHUMER, talking to their Foreman.

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER
                    Six inches. That s half a shovel 
                    length. Yes? Not an inch more. When 
                    your guys hit that depth they stop. 
                    Stop. And they call one of my guys 
                    over. Most of these plots are pine 
                    boxed, so you ll feel it. Like a 
                    thud, a thump. Yup?                                                                                    10.


                                  FOREMAN
                    Yup.

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER
                    I don t know who the hell cooked up 
                    this contract division bull shit, 
                    but we can t touch the top soil and 
                    you can t touch the coffins so we 
                    have to work this together.

                                  FOREMAN
                    We ll make it work.

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER
                          (showing a document)
                    Alright, you sign this...

                    I sign here... ok, let s go.

    CUT TO:The bucket head of an excavator churning up the earth 
      before a tombstone. Around it, other excavators are doing the 
      same. GARZA, ORTIZ and other workers stand by with shovels. 
      ORTIZ nods toward the sour faced EXHUMER TEAM waiting a way 
      off, all covered in their head to toe white rubber getups.

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                          (to Garza)
                    Hey, hey... check it out... 
                      Ghostbusters.

    He cracks himself up laughing. 

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    Not funny, man.

      Garza stares at the upturning grave. Ortiz quietens, crosses 
      himself.

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH) (CONT D) 
                    We re up.

      They jump in, their shovels taking to the loosened earth.



    The church stands tall in the background. Before it, a low, 
      squat anex building carries a sign:  Calvary Episcopal 
      Church. Free Clinic .We hear a phone ringing...



    Low brick buildings. An empty school playground. A sign above 
    the main entrance:  Noble Square Elementary School .

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    Not long ago, financial shortages 
                    had placed Noble Square Elementary 
                    on a list of imminent school 
                      closings...



      A TRACKHOEbacks up BEEPING to the edge of a dug out grave. 
      Down inside it, two white-coated Exhumers hook straps wrapped 
      securely around a coffin to a hook on the trackhoe scrane 
    and climb out of the grave. The crane operator throws a lever 
    and the coffin starts to lift, mud and dirt clinging to it. 

      Garza and Ortiz stand by, shovels in hand, watching as the 
      coffin rises... upwards... past their faces... Suddenly there 
    is a loud shudder. The Exhumers motion to the crane operator. 
    He stops the lift. A crack. They bend to see the underneath 
    of the coffin, rotten and wet, starting to give, the remains 
      inside seeping out. Another crack. Its about to come apart. 
      Ortiz drops his shovel, scrambles down into the grave, under 
    the coffin, and reaching up, pushes on its underside, keeping 
    it intact...

                                  ORTIZ
                          (shouting)
                    Spin it around. Place it down.

    The crane head turns, guiding the coffin slowly down to the 
      side of the grave, Ortiz pushing up, holding it intact for as 
      long as he can. It comes to a rest, relatively in one piece, 
      finally revealing Ortiz from under it, covered in mud, 
      breathing hard. He rests for a moment against the hole s 
      side. Garza crouches down to give him a hand. 

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    You OK?

      Ortiz reaches up. Their hands connect. Suddenly there s a 
      loud rumble. Ortiz slips, dropping down further into the 
      grave, disappearing from view. Garza scrambles to the edge, 
      looks down. The loosened earth is giving away fast, getting 
      swallowed into an expanding sinkhole, Ortiz sinking in it. He 
      grapples, trying to hold onto something. Garza reaches for 
      him. Shouts go up.                                                                                     21.


    As suddenly as it started, it stops. The mud and earth 
      settling into stillness. Ortiz buried waist deep but OK. His 
      eyes connect with Garza. Both breathe a sigh of relief. Then 
      something else - Garza s eyes focusing past the stuck Ortiz, 
    on something behind him. Ortiz twists as best as he can to 
      see, revealed, the facade of a wide and slanted stone wall 
      covered in heavily elaborate carvings - Native American of 
      sorts. And jutting out of the churned earth around it, bones, 
      skulls, tools... a tomahawk...

    CUT TO: Ortiz sits by a utility truck, hands and face still 
      covered in mud. Garza hands him a soft drink.

                    Here.

    He looks back toward the grave they were digging, now 
      swarming with perplexed Exhumers, then across to the front of 
    the cemetery where other white coats and a small team of 
      local law enforcement are establishing a safe perimeter... 

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH) (CONT D)
                    You know, I think that might be it 
                    for work for today...

    He takes out his cell, dials a number...



      Kane and Zajac walk along the grid-like paths that cut 
      through garden patches on the expansive roof of the classical 
      revival building. Around them sky scrapers shoot upward, 
      encasing them in. The sounds of the city beneath are loud and 
      insistent. Kitty and Stone hang back waiting at the roof top 
      door. Kane reaches for a basket of oranges, placed along the 
      path, throws one to Zajac and begins to peel his own...

                                  KANE
                    When Cermakwas mayor he d come up 
                    here almost every day. He was a 
                    Bohemian, an immigrant, working-
                    class. Like you, except he utterly 
                    lacked charisma. But he had a gift. 
                    He understood people. He was the 
                    first to force the Irish into 
                    sharing power with the other 
                    ethnicities. He called it his 
                     house for all peoples  and from 
                    here, he had an uninterrupted view 
                    of it. All fifty wards... 
                          (turns, pointing north)
                    North Side, Lincoln Square, the

    As Kane points, the sky scrapers in that section quietly 
      vanish and instead we see the old, low buildings that 
      populated the city 80 years ago. City sounds go mute leaving 
      only his voice. He points to a different section...

                    your lot, the PoloniaTriangle. As 
                    well as the Czechs, the Jews... 

    He pivots and points to different sections, and one by one 
    the sky scrapers in each disappear, leaving only the old 
      city.

                    in between, the Irish...

    ... pivoting, pointing, sky scrapers vanishing, only the old 
      city remaining... until the tallest building standing is 
      theirs. We see it, square down from above, the 11 stories of 
      City Hall at the center of the city s web of power.

                    These were tribes. Each controlling 
                    their neighborhoods like fortress 
                    enclaves. They hated each other, 
                    fought, maimed, killed and rioted 
                    against each other. 

      Close on Kane, looking out, transported as he speaks, as if 
      heis standing there on top of the roof 80 years ago...

                    forming the first truly dominant 
                    political force this country had 
                    seen. He did it because he 
                    understood something basic about 
                    all people. That they wantto be 
                    led. They want their disputes 
                    settled, their emergencies decided, 
                    their treaties negotiated, their 
                    jobs dispensed, their fears and 
                      attachments inspired, their 
                    mutinies punished, their loyalties 
                    rewarded. And in return, to those 
                    who lead them to all that they 
                    want, they give power. It s a 
                    covenant. Unspoken and elemental.

                    to be fixed.

      Zajac looks back at Kane. Beat. Then his arm slowly extends, 
      their hands grip and they shake. Kane takes him by the 
      shoulder, turning him to face out toward the re-appearing sky 
      scrapers that surround them once again.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Smile.

                          (through his smile)
                    Why?

                                  KANE
                    Sometimes it's necessary to let the 
                    other guy know you're coming.

      Wide on Kane and Zajac as they shake hands before the 
      multitudes of windows looking down on them.

      With Stone and Kitty.Spotting Kane and Zajac s handshake, 
      Stone motions to Kitty to look too. 

      Kane s Junior Aide comes rushing out the roof top door, face 
      ashen.

                                  KITTY (O.C.)
                    Sir?

      Kane turns from Zajac to see Kitty approaching in a hurry.

                    Something urgent.



      Alderman LaloMata, at the tee, prepping his swing. With him, 
    his nephew Haime, MocoRuiz and two of Mata s ASSOCIATES who 
      even in these refined surroundings, sporting understated golf 
      Tsand slacks, cannot veneer over their true thug selves.

                    come on the scene, have idiotic

                    attention, credibility, they want 
                    to grow. But as they become

                    new ethnicities take when they 
                    first come to this country. At

      Mata puts his foot on top of his own ball, barely making an 
      effort to conceal it. He looks around.

      Mata s two Associates crowd in on Ruiz and all three begin 
      toward the trees, past Mata. Mata practices his swing, 
      without looking back at them...

                                  MATA (CONT D)

                    nothing vocal...

    WE STAY ON MATA, pushing in on him calmly swinging, as deep 
      behind him Ruiz and the Associates make it to the tree line 
    and are swallowed from view. REMAIN ON MATA, swing, breath, 
      swing, breath, the silence from the woods behind him 
      unbearable... then just as we hear the very first note of a 
      scream, we go to BLACK.


    We hear TINNY SOUNDS of DOWNTOWN TRAFFIC and ACTIVITY...

      A black screen pops to life... An iPadplays back a handheld 
      shot of Kane and Zajac, captured from a distance, when they 
      were on the roof of City Hall, shaking hands and smiling... 

      Reverse angle.Close on Governor Mac Cullen watching the 
      video on the iPad...



      Cullen and his Aide at a pit stop. Behind them, a vast field 
    of wheat stretches as far as the eye can see. Cullen looks up 
      from the iPadto his Aide s grave and intent face...

                                  CULLEN
                    You and your furrowed brow. You 
                    think you unearthedthis? He s 
                    toyingwith us. 

      Cullen s Aide stays mute. Cullen looks at the iPad...

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)
                    And this fucking thing. Every time 
                    you show me something on it, it s a 
                    God damn...

      Boiling over suddenly, Cullen smashes the iPadrepeatedly 
      against the car s roof. His Aide flinches, terrified.                                                                                     42.


      Cullen makes an almighty dent in the car, but the iPad
      remains intact. Stymied, he turns, tossing it like a discus 
    as hard as he can. It goes spinning far into the wheat field.

      Beat. Cullen bent over, huffing. His Aide, just staring...

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)
                    Doesn't that thing have all kinds

    As rough a spot as you can get. Though the neighborhood 
      avoided the massive mid century housing projects that made 
      Chicago s other poor neighborhood s infamous, to say this 
      place is still untouched by prosperity would be an 
      understatement. Alice and Darius pull up in her car.

                                  DARIUS
                    This is it.

    He looks out at a row of houses, some boarded up, all 
      dilapidated. Beat.                                                                                    49.

    She looks around. People mill in groups under street lamps.

                    No. I ll come with you.

                                  DARIUS
                    Alright.

    He gets out first. She steals herself then also gets out. 
      Both head toward the houses.



      Alice rushes to her car, hurries in and drives off.



      Kane and Kitty exit the building. Kane, wearing his pressed 
      suit, makes his way to a waiting town car. Kitty to the tail 
    car waiting just behind it. 

      Inside Kane s town car, Meredith is already waiting.

                    Forty five minutes.

    She doesn t show any reaction. The car takes off.



      Flood lit soccer practice is over. KIDS aged 8 to 12, still 
    run around passing and dribbling, squeezing every available 
      minute out of their time with each other while they wait to 
    get picked up by their parents. 

    In the parking area, right before the field, Doctor Elli 
      Harris steps out of her SUV and calls out for her son...                                                                                    52.


                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                    Max!

    She motions for him to come. On the field, 8 year old MAX 
      notices her, makes a big pleading gesture for  5 more 
      minutes...  and resumes running with the others...

      Harris climbs back into the SUV, shaking her head.

      A GREY HAIRED MAN, white, collared shirt, khaki slacks, is 
      approaching her car. Before she has a chance to realize 
      what s happening, the man has hopped in on the passenger 
      side, grabbed her shoulder, planted a syringe into her arm 
    and injected her with it. Instantly she goes still. 

      Gently, he turns her head to face forward. He holds the 
      syringe up to her line of sight...

                                  GREY HAIRED MAN
                    This is a neuromuscular blocker. 
                    It s temporary. Please try to pay 
                    attention.

    As he speaks, he places her hands on the wheel, clears the 
      hair form her face so she can see out the windscreen.

                                  GREY HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
                          (dry)
                    Hippocrates, in part. "Whatever, in 
                    connection with my professional 
                    service, I see or hear in the life 
                    of men which ought not to be spoken 
                    of, I will not divulge, as 
                    reckoning that all such knowledge 
                    should be kept secret." 

      Through the windscreen, we see Max playing right there, yards 
      away. He notices his mother sitting so casually with the Grey 
      Haired Man. He s not alarmed but decides to abandon his game, 
      waves goodbye to the others and starts to approach the car... 

    In the car, Harris sees Max coming, her breathing speeds up. 

                                  GREY HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
                    I know you can t nod. I will assume 
                    you do understand the content of 
                    this message.

    Max is there. Hops in. The Grey Haired Man is gone.

                                  MAX
                    Who was that?                                                                                    53.


      Harris remains frozen, trying to still her breaths. One of 
    her hands loosens, she removes it from the steering wheel and 
      places it gently on Max  lap. A tear crawls down her face. 
    She clears her throat, it s loosening too...

                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                    Just give mommy a moment.

    We hear the sound of rapturous applause... 



      Kane and Meredith emerge and make it to their waiting car. 
      Kitty holds the door for them, shuts it and the car takes 
      off. The tail car follows.

      Kitty is on the sidewalk alone. She buttons up her coat, 
      turns and is about to leave when through the hotel s street 
      windows, she sees Zajac in the lobby holding court with a 
      group of much shorter Latino business people. They are in his 
      thrall. She takes a moment, removes her coat, lets it hang 
      over her arm and enters the hotel again. 

      Inside.Kitty slowly walks across the lobby, past Zajac, 
      never once looking at him. He notices her through the corner 
    of his eye, watches her disappear through a side door, into a 
      stairwell. A sign above it reads:  Fire Escape ...



    The place is quiet, empty. Kane waits, alone. Behind him, the 
      vast buildings of the JardineWater Purification Center, 
      ghostly lit against the black void of Lake Michigan at night. 

      Before him, his city, twinkling with life. His eyes gaze 
      across it. From Soldier field to the John Hancock Center, 311 
      South Wacker, the WrigleyBuilding, the Dan Ryan 
      Expressway... On each image we hear him whisper a name...

                                  KANE
                    Kelly... Daley... Dever... 
                      Washington...

      Close on Kane, silent.

    The sound of distant footsteps. Kane peers into the darkness. 
      A figure is approaching him... he readies himself... Just 
      then his phone rings. He scrambles to get it from his pocket. 
    The number on it is BLOCKED. He takes a chance.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Hello?

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Dad?

                                  KANE
                    Alice?

      Kane sees the approaching figure slow down... 

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE) 
                          (beat)
                    You called me?

                                  KANE
                    Yes. Yes...
                          (seeing the figure turn 
                            around)
                    How are you?                                                                                    58.


                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    What is it, Dad?

      Kane covers the receiver.

                                  KANE
                          (calling out to the 
                            figure)
                    Wait...

    The figure starts away. Kane goes after him...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Alice, I'm sorry, I... Can I call 
                    you back? 5 minutes. No more.

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                          (beat)
                    Sure.

                                  KANE
                    Can you give me a number? The only 
                    one I have is at the church. 

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    You know, I'll call you, Dad. 

                                  KANE
                    No, Alice - 

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    I ll call you.

                                  KANE
                    When?

      CLICK - the line goes dead. Kane, puts his phone away. 
      Reaches the figure. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Wait. Wait... 

                                  MAN
                          (not looking, still 
                            walking)
                    I said no phones.

                                  KANE
                    I m sorry. Please. Stop. 

    The man stops, his back still to Kane. Kane stops too.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Please. It s off. It s off.                                                                                    59.


                                  MAN
                          (beat)
                    Wait here.

    The man walks off, 20 yards or so and stops. Kane watches him 
      wait, looking around for a long beat. Nothing coming. He 
      returns, reaches into his jacket, hands Kane a paper bag... 

                                  MAN (CONT D)
                      Atamet.Exelon.Aloperidin.

                                  KANE
                          (beat)
                    Do you know who I am?

    For the first time, the man looks at him, instantly 
      recognizes him.

                                  MAN
                    No.

      Kane nods. Hands him an envelope.

                                  KANE
                    It s all in there - 

      Before he has had a chance to finish the man has taken the 
      envelope and is already fast away... leaving Kane alone.



      Service is over. Outside, people are leaving, Alice saying 
      goodbye to them. Darius waits for his turn... steps up...

                                  DARIUS
                    Missed you earlier.

                                  ALICE
                    Yes.

                                  DARIUS
                    Thank you again for what you did 
                    for my uncle.                                                                                    61.


      Alice nods. Darius extends his hand, shakes hers. We catch a 
      quick glimpse of something small wrapped in plastic he slips 
      into her hand. If it startled her, she covers it well.

                                  ALICE
                    Thank you for coming.

      Darius steps away. Alice is already onto the next goodbye...



      Kane pulls up to his grey stone, turn of the century 
      townhouse, hops out and tosses the car keys to his two 
      security men, pacing on the sidewalk. 

                                  SECURITY 1 
                    Good night, sir.

                                  KANE
                    Fellas.

    He enters the house.
