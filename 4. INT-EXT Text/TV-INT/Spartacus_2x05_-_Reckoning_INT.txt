  MOVE WITH a pair of feet as they descend the pantry stairs. 
  REVEAL MELITTA as she selects wine from the storage rack. A 
  HAND reaches in from the shadows, touching her cheek. She 
  whirls in surprise as GANNICUS emerges from the shadows.

                                          MELITTA
                                  hushed, worried)(
                        How did you get beyond the gate?

                                        GANNICUS
                      It is a weak thing, against such 
                        strong purpose...

  He gently brushes a rogue lock of hair from her eyes. Her 
  heart quickens.

                                          MELITTA
                        You risk discovery.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I would risk everything. For you.

  The air between them thickens with desire. Melitta vainly 
  attempts to resist it.

                                          MELITTA
                      We cannot do this.

                                        GANNICUS
                        No. We cannot...

  He kisses her, his actions belying his words. Melitta s 
  protest is swept away as she passionately devours him. His 
  hand slides up her dress. She gasps as he enters her.

  MELITTA SMILES,

  an expression of pure ecstasy. This is what she has wanted. 
  What she has denied herself.

  BLOOD SUDDENLY SPLATTERS

  her in the face, shattering the moment. Melitta stares in 
  horror at the BLADE OF A SWORD sticking through Gannicus  
  throat. He gurgles in surprise, collapsing to REVEAL




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  behind him. Deadly sword clutched in hand. Tears of rage and 
  hurt sting his eyes.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You fucking whore.

  Oenomaus REARS HIS SWORD BACK and with a violent wrath 
  BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN --



  Melitta slams awake. NAEVIA is at her side.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Domina summons you.

  Melitta nods, her heart pounding -- and mind racing over the 
  dream. And the betrayal of her unconscious desires. OFF HER 
  DISTRESS as she rises, WIPING US TO --



  LUCRETIA sits on the edge of the bed, Gaia s RED WIG cradled 
  in her hands. Lost and alone in her grief. A long beat, 
  finally broken by Melitta entering. Naevia follows.

                                          MELITTA
                        Apologies. I did not hear you 
                        calling.

  Lucretia stares at her for a moment, not really hearing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Collect Gaia s belongings. Titus 
                        would have them removed.

  Melitta and Naevia comply, carefully placing Gaia s things 
  into her trunks. Melitta gauges Lucretia s pain, struggles 
  to find words to ease it.

                                          MELITTA
                        I know how close you held her. It 
                        was an unfortunate accident.

  Lucretia stiffens. The word accident a sore subject. She 
  knows Gaia was murdered by Tullius (in Ep. HB4), but has 
  been ordered by Titus to cover it up.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        Yet blessed to count you as friend, 
                        while she was among us.

                        commands salt and spelt be 
                        scattered. Decision and ritual, to 
                        cleanse all trace of Gaia from 
                        beneath his roof.

  Her eyes drift to Gaia s wig in her hands.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I asked Quintus to speak to his 
                        father. To not let Gaia be so 
                        easily swept from memory. But a 
                        wife s desires do not always mirror 
                        the wishes of her husband.

  This lands with Melitta, whose recent desires are most 
  certainly at odds with those of Oenomaus.

                                          MELITTA
                                  soft)(
                        Then she must keep them hidden.

  Lucretia looks to Melitta, not understanding.

                      We will tell them ritual was 
                        performed, even in absence of the 
                        deed. Naevia and Diona to attest, 
                      if questioned.

  Lucretia is deeply touched by the gesture.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gratitude.

  OFF LUCRETIA, eyes clouding with tears...

  Gaia s BODY SLAVE is led out of the villa in chains, passing 
  DIONA as she attends to the daily cleaning. Eyes distant. 
  Being used as a sex slave draining the life from her. Naevia 
  glances over from where she toils. Searching for the words 
  to bring her friend comfort.

  Titus interrupts as he passes.

                        Leave her where she is. You may 
                        answer question. Has salt and spelt 
                        been scattered?

                                        NAEVIA

                        Yes, Dominus. We have swept it from 
                        the villa.

  Titus nods with a frown.

                                        TITUS
                        A step towards proper path.

  Titus exits. Diona grumbles bitterly.

                        Should have let the bitch tell her

  Diona turns on Naevia. Rage and hate in her eyes.

                      So now you command me? Will you 
                        decide who fucks me as well?

  Diona exits. OFF NAEVIA S DEVASTATION....



  TIGHT ON LUCRETIA, devastated.

                        I bow and scrape, eating his shit

                        And this is reward?  To be turned 
                        from my home?  My husband?

  Batiatus takes her in his arms, trying to comfort her.

    uncomfortable at having entered into an argument.

  Oenomaus stirs from sleep, awakened by the flickering of 
  candles at the altar.  Melitta is kneeling before it, 
  pouring an offering of SPICE from her hands as she prays.

                        secrets, condemning those privy to 
                        them.

  Oenomaus rises to comfort her, misunderstanding.

                        unfortunate events, removed from 
                        our hands.  Yet this is an 
                        honorable house.  One of deep 
                        history.  The gods must surely

                      My life held no meaning before I 
                        was brought here.  This house is 
                        the foundation upon which I was 
                        built.

                                          MELITTA
                        I feel nothing but the weight of 
                        its beams.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The burdens placed upon us often 
                        overwhelm.  But it remains our duty 
                      to bear them.

  Melitta looks in his eyes -- if you only knew.  Oenomaus 
  kisses her.  Gently takes her hand.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Come.  Let us pray, and together 
                        see weight lifted.

  As the two bow their heads, we PUSH IN on the candle, its 
  flame MORPHING INTO --



  TIGHT ON AN ORNATE AMPHORA OF MULSUM, carried by powerful, 
  calloused hands.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                        I recalled your fondness for 
                        mulsum.

  WIDEN TO REVEAL TULLIUS.  He takes the amphora from his 
  bodyguard THERON and hands it to Titus.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        Varus assures the vintage to be his 
                        finest.

  Titus takes the amphora with a tight smile.

                                        TITUS
                        I am plied with honeyed wine at 
                        every turn this day.

  A cough takes hold, quickly passes.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A simple gesture.  To smooth edge 
                        from jagged events.

                                        TITUS
                        Jagged?  A woman is dead, Tullius.  
                        A Roman woman, in my house.  You go 
                        too far.

  Tullius stares, ominously silent.  No one talks to him like 
  this.  A tense beat.  Then very calmly...

                                          TULLIUS
                        I have come to make amends.  With a 
                        gift.

                                        TITUS
                                  scoffs)(
                        You offer wine to wash away blood?

                                          TULLIUS
                        I offer position.  In the opening 
                        games of the new arena.

  Titus reacts in surprise.  And suspicion.

                                        TITUS
                        Why would you do this?

                                          TULLIUS
                      In honor of history.  Capua has 
                        marveled over many champions from 
                        the House of Batiatus over the 
                        years.  Hadrianus.  Magnetius.  
                        Oenomaus.  Countless others, forged 
                      by steady -- and sensible -- hand.

                                        TITUS
                        You flatter.

                      On many occasion.  But not this 
                        one.  The storied victories of your 
                        men were part of the old arena as 
                        much as its wood and its sand.  Yet 
                        its final day passed absent the 
                        House of Batiatus.  An unforgivable 
                        tragedy.  Caused by the actions of 
                        a foolish son.

                                        TITUS
                      He knows my mind towards this 
                        regard.  Yet his actions do not 
                        stand alone in deserving 
                          condemnation.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The past cannot be changed.  Let us 
                        turn eye towards horizon of glories 
                        untold.  Ones to share in together.

  Titus gauges Tullius carefully.

                                        TITUS
                        And what is it you seek in return 
                        for such generosity?

                                          TULLIUS
                        The only thing I have ever sought.  
                        Gannicus.

  A beat as Titus absorbs that.

                                        TITUS
                      My son believes the man a champion.  
                        Above all others.

  Tullius clocks Titus  reticence.  Smiles warmly.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You are a reasonable man, Titus.  
                        You always have been.
                                (the hint of a 
                                  threat)
                        All I ask is that you consider what 
                      is best for your house.  Enjoy the 
                        wine.

  Tullius exits.  OFF TITUS, considering the amphora of 
  mulsum.  And the devil s bargain that accompanies the 
  gift...                                                                                    21.



  Naevia hurries down the hallway, searching for something.  
  She spots her quarry in Gaia s bedchamber:  Diona, her back 
  to CAMERA among Gaia s packed belongings, sitting on the 
  edge of the bed.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Domina calls for food and wine.
                                  gets no reaction)(
                        Diona?

  Diona turns, wiping tears from her face as she nods.  The 
  sight of her friend in such a state is a knife in Naevia s 
  heart.

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        Pause a moment, if you need.  I 
                        will say I could not find you.

  She turns to go.

                                        DIONA
                        Naevia...?  My words.  I did not 
                        mean them.

                                        NAEVIA
                                  soft)(
                        I know.

                                        DIONA
                        Your friendship... your love...  It 
                      is constant reminder of what I have 
                        lost.

  Naevia takes a seat beside Diona.  Tender.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I am still here.  And will forever 
                        be.

  Diona loses it.  Begins to SOB.  Naevia holds her.

                                        DIONA
                        Those men... what I have done with 
                        them...

                                        NAEVIA
                        You did only as commanded.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.

                        I pray to the gods every night.  
                        That the next man I am forced to 
                        lie with takes my life...

  Naevia holds her friend tight, wanting more than anything to 
  shield her from the pain of the world.  OFF the shattered 
  life...



  Batiatus follows.  Naevia and Diona set out food in the 
  background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would have words.

                                        TITUS
                      As would I.  Accompany me to town, 
                        and let us break them.

  Titus moves off.  Batiatus glances back to Lucretia.  Holds 
  her gaze for a moment.  He nods, setting his will to the 
  deadly purpose she spoke of as he exits.  Lucretia watches 
  him go.  A beat as she considers her next move.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Melitta.  Once they have departed, 
                        there is something I would ask of 
                        you.

  OFF LUCRETIA, her eyes setting in grim determination...                                                                                    26.



  The rising moon hangs low, casting deep shadows.  FIND 
  MELITTA waiting inside the pantry at the gate.  A beat.  She 
  shifts nervously, peering out into the gloom.

                                        GANNICUS (O.S.)
                        I have felt your eyes.  Lingering.

  She starts as Gannicus emerges from the darkness on the 
  other side of the gate.  Melitta guiltily avoids his gaze.  
  Gannicus smiles sadly at the action.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Yet they always turn away when I 
                        meet them.

                                          MELITTA
                      As should yours.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Then I must tear them out.  It is 
                        the only way they will obey such 
                        command.

  Melitta looks up, unable to resist meeting his eyes.  They 
  are filled with pain and longing.

                                          MELITTA

                                          MELITTA
                        You know my thoughts now?

                                        GANNICUS
                      As if they were my own.  You move 
                      to erase the moment between us.  
                        When we embraced, and pretense fell 
                        away.

                                          MELITTA
                        You must stop this.

                        I have vowed to, a thousand times a 
                        day.  To return to drink and

  His hand touches hers through the bars.  An electric beat.

                                          MELITTA
                                (soft, filled with

                        I have never felt greater love... 
                        than when I hold my husband in my 
                        arms.

  Gannicus  heart seizes.  Melitta pulls her hand away as a 
  GUARD approaches with Crixus, unlocking  the gate.  Melitta 
  and the Guard usher Crixus upstairs.  Gannicus watches her 
  go, his heart breaking.

                                        OENOMAUS (O.S.)
                        What fucking seizes you?

  Gannicus tenses, shocked to see Oenomaus approaching.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You drop guard, allowing Barca 
                        advantage.  The man almost had you.

  Gannicus realizes this isn t about Melitta.  He takes him in 
  with guilt and regret.

                        I lost myself for a moment.  Taken

                        Wake from it.

  Gannicus smiles sadly, the pain of a love he will never know 
  a fist in his chest.

                                        GANNICUS
                      As all fools must.

  He moves off into the darkness, WIPING US TO --



  Melitta escorts Crixus in.  His eyes dart nervously to 
  Lucretia.  [NOTE: She is in her dress from scene 14.  No 
  sheer gown, no sexy sexy.]  She eyes him, equally nervous.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

                                to Melitta)(
                        Leave us.

  Melitta sees Lucretia s anxiety.  Hesitates.  Do you really 
  want to do this?  Lucretia nods.  Melitta exits.  A tense 
  beat as Lucretia steels herself.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You are a Gaul, are you not?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Yes, Domina.

  Lucretia begins to circle him.  Inspecting.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Many believe the seed of a Gaul to 
                        rival that of Jupiter himself.  
                        Tell me.  How many sons sprang from 
                        your father s cock?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Five.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And his father before him?

  Crixus starts to get a very bad feeling about this.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The same.

  Lucretia stops circling.  That was the answer she needed.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Your subligaria.  Remove it.

  Crixus hesitantly removes his subligaria.  Lucretia glances 
  down OFF SCREEN at his cock.  There is no smile.  No hint of 
  the lust from season one.  Only trepidation and revulsion.  
  She pushes it aside, locking eyes with him.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You are never to speak of this.

  Crixus just stands there.  Not sure what he s gotten himself 
  into, but knows it s trouble.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                      Do you fucking understand me, 
                        slave?

                        Yes, Domina.

  A tense beat.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would not look upon you.  The 
                        sight turns stomach.

  She turns away, bending over the bed and lifting her dress.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Enter me.  And do not cease until 
                        you have spilled seed.

  Crixus reluctantly moves to her.

  ON LUCRETIA,

  flinching as he enters her.  SLOW PUSH IN on her face, her 
  eyes filling with tears that she has been brought to this...



  SLOW PUSH IN ON Lucretia, sitting in the bath.  Alone.  No 
  slaves.  The water DRIPS as her mind processes what she s 
  done.  What it has cost her.

  BATIATUS

  appears, lost in his own troubled thoughts.  Pulling 
  Lucretia from hers.  An expectant beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        I could not do it.

  Lucretia nods.  Not in disappointment, but in understanding.

                        Sit beside me.

  Batiatus disrobes, reliving the moment.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        I had instrument in hand.  His back 
                        turned.  One simple motion, and our 
                        troubles removed forever.  But when 
                        the moment came...
                                  a beat)(
                      He spoke to me with affection.  
                        Giving voice to sentiment...

  He bites back the tears, overwhelmed as he wades into the 
  water.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I was wrong to push you to such 
                        thoughts against him.

                        Even in refraining, the ground 
                        beneath us pitches.
                                  a beat)(

                        The only one my tongue could ever 
                        speak.

  Lucretia is deeply moved.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You honor me.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  bitterly)(
                        I attempt to gain the sun, only to 
                        plunge into the depths. While 
                        Tullius rides with Apollo, bribing 
                        his way with an amphora of mulsum 
                        and promises to the air.

  Lucretia gently bathes him.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It does not matter.

  The anger drains out of him, leaving an empty shell.

  She gently kisses him, taking him into her arms.  He clings 
  to her, desperately attempting to resist being dragged under 
  by conspiring fate.  OFF THE MOMENT...



  Titus enters with Oenomaus at his side.  Titus looks tired 
  and drained.  The emotion of recent events taking its toll 
  on his health.

                                        TITUS
                        The men have fought with passion 
                        and honor.  A testament to your 
                        work as doctore.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I but carry torch lit by more 
                        deserving predecessor.

                                        TITUS
                      He would have been proud.  This 
                        house has seen many champions, 
                        Oenomaus.  Yet you stand tallest 
                        among them.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  clearly touched)(
                        I have not the words, Dominus.

  Titus laughs.  It quickly turns into a brief fit of 
  coughing.

                                        TITUS
                        Those who do tend to weave them to 
                        undeserved advantage.  Where do we 
                        stand upon the rankings?

  Oenomaus hands over a list.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

                        Eight men have yet to hold victory.  
                        And one suffers grievous injury.

                                        TITUS
                                  eyeing list)(
                      It pains to lose Dagan.  The Syrian 
                        had shown much promise.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        More so than Ashur.  Yet Dagan is 
                        now blind to attack from the right.  
                          A disadvantage in the arena.

  Melitta enters, bringing food and wine.  Pours.

                                        TITUS
                        Let us shift from the unfortunate 
                      to the blessed.  Who holds the 
                        pinnacle?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Two men own equal victory.  Crixus 
                        and Gannicus.  They are to face 
                        each other in the final --

  Titus waves that away.

                                        TITUS
                        Gannicus is removed from 
                        contention.  I have sent word to 
                        Tullius agreeing to terms of sale.

  Melitta reacts in surprise.  Oenomaus glances at her, 
  sharing the feeling.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Tullius?

                      He makes offer.  I had thoughts 
                        towards refusal, but they have 
                        dimmed.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I would speak towards reigniting 
                        them.

                                        TITUS
                        Now you find words?  Quintus has 
                        plied me with many upon the 
                        subject.  He inflates Gannicus  
                        worth, at great cost to this house.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                        Apologies, but in this your son and 
                        I are in agreement.  None stand 
                        more worthy of the title of 
                        champion.

                                        TITUS
                        You allow personal relation to 
                        cloud judgement.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        True, Gannicus is trusted friend.

  Melitta shifts uncomfortably.  Oenomaus doesn t notice.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Yet I speak from position of 
                        doctore.  One but a moment ago you 
                        sought to praise.

  Titus considers that with a sour frown, knowing he s right.

                                        TITUS
                      If I pull acceptance to Tullius, we 
                        will be excluded from future games.  
                      We would be forced to beg for 
                        matches in the lesser venues of 
                        Nola or Neapolis.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A heavy price.  As is often that of 
                        the honorable choice.

  A long beat as Titus carefully weighs Oenomaus  words.

                                        TITUS
                        Let the gods show us the way then.  
                      If Gannicus proves himself against 
                        Crixus, he shall remain.  Yet if he 
                        falls, he shall leave this house.  
                        Following the others that have 
                        failed to honor it.

  OFF TITUS  COMMAND...



  The SOUND of the CHEERING MEN echo faintly from outside.  
  Naevia appears, pulling Diona in her wake.

                                        DIONA
                                  hushed)(
                        You have lost sense.

                                  hushed)(
                        All attention is upon the match.  
                      No one  will notice your absence 
                        for many hours.

  Diona wrenches her arm away, fear flashing in her eyes.

                                        DIONA
                        They will brand me fugitivus!

                                        NAEVIA
                        They will not find you.

  She produces a small purse of coins, presses them into 
  Diona s hands.

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        Buy passage far from Capua.  And 
                        the things that have been done to 
                        you.

                                        DIONA
                        Where did you get this?

                                        NAEVIA
                        Spirited from Gaia s things.  They 
                        will not be missed.

  Diona wavers, tears welling.  Naevia barely holds it 
  together

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        You fade with each day.  Do not 
                        make me bear witness to your 
                        passing.

                                        DIONA
                        Come with me.

                        I attend domina.  My absence would 
                      be noticed.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

  The MEN CHEER in the distance.  Time is running out.

                        Go.  Before contest is ended.

  Diona embraces Naevia, hot tears wetting her cheeks.

                                        DIONA
                        I will see you again, one day.  I 
                        swear to you.

                        Go.

  Diona gives Naevia one last smile, then turns and hurries 
  out.  Naevia watches her go, heartbroken at losing her but 
  welling with hope that Diona will find a better life.  OFF 
  THE MOMENT...



  Gannicus and Melitta forced to make love (Ep. 2, Sc. 27 - 
  already shot).  Both of them unexpectedly swept away in the 
  moment.



  Gannicus is bloodied and beaten from his  exhibition  match 
  with Tullius (Ep. 4, Sc. 18 - already shot).  He pulls 
  Melitta into a kiss.  The world stops.



  From scene 15 of this episode.  Gannicus  hand is on 
  Melitta s through the gate.  She pulls away, turning away 
  from him.



  Titus rests in bed.  Sweating.  Barely conscious.  ADJUST TO 
  FIND the MEDICUS outside in the peristyle, delivering the 
  news to Batiatus and Lucretia.  Oenomaus looms a few paces 
  behind, concern etching his face.  Melitta beside him.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Your father burns high fever.  A 
                        worrisome condition, for a man of 
                        his years.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Is there nothing to be done?

                                          MEDICUS
                        I have not the herbs.  And the hour 
                      is late for us to procure them.

  Batiatus shares a pained look with Lucretia.  Despite 
  everything, the man is still his father.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I would aid in the effort.

                        little wine, if seized by fit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Come!

  Medicus hustles out with Batiatus and Oenomaus.  OFF 
  LUCRETIA, considering her options....



  CLOSE on a CUP as it s filled with honeyed wine.  WIDEN TO 
  REVEAL Lucretia pouring it from the ORNATE AMPHORA given to 
  Titus by Tullius.  Titus COUGHS, pale and barely conscious.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Drink.

  She moves it to his lips.  He waves it away.

                                  raspy voice)(
                        Move Tullius  wine from sight.

  Lucretia forces a smile.  She sets the cup down and hands 
  the amphora to Melitta.  Melitta takes it, her own concerns 
  for Gannicus bubbling to the surface.

                                          MELITTA

                        permission to see Gannicus.

  Lucretia eyes her in perturbed surprise.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        I know he is to be sold tomorrow.  
                        I would have final words, before he 
                        departs.

  OFF MELITTA, her eyes pleading with Lucretia...



  CANDLELIGHT dances across Gannicus  battered face.  He sits 
  on the floor, lost in thought of what has been lost.  The 
  door opens behind him.

  MELITTA APPEARS,

  the amphora of mulsum from Tullius still clutched in her 
  hands.  Gannicus stares at her silently for a beat.  He has 
  no words.  Melitta struggles to find a few of her own.

                                          MELITTA
                                  soft)(
                        I would share drink.  With an old 
                        friend.

  She finds two cups, pours.  Gannicus watches her with 
  mounting sadness.

                                        GANNICUS
                      Is that all that I am?  A friend?

                        I do not care for honey in my wine.  
                      It serves only to mask bitter 
                        taste.

  She knows he s not talking just about wine.

                                          MELITTA
                        A blessing, in such moments.

  She takes a deep drink of her own cup to steel her nerves 
  for what she has to tell him.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I know.  Your husband warned of it, 
                        should I fall to Crixus.

  She stares in disbelief, seeing the truth etched into 
  Gannicus  face.

                                          MELITTA
                        You let Crixus win.  Why would you 
                      do such a thing?

                                  a whisper)(
                        Because I cannot stay within these 
                        walls.  To gaze upon you every 
                        day... and be denied your touch...
                                  a beat)(

                        Yet I am without strength to face 
                        this one.

  She takes him in for a heavy beat.

                                          MELITTA
                        Then it is for the best.

  She sets down her cup.  Goes to him.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        Because despite my words... I stand 
                      as weak...

  She kisses him, her hands trembling.  Gannicus looks into 
  her eyes and finally sees what he has been searching for.  
  As he takes her into his arms...



  CLOSE ON TITUS, wracked by a fit of COUGHING.  WIDEN as 
  Lucretia presses the cup of mulsum she poured from Tullius  
  amphora to his lips.

                                        TITUS

                        Medicus gave order.  Drink.

  Titus reluctantly complies.  His fit passes.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

                      My son... gives up everything for

  Titus COUGHS.  He s weak.  And very honest here.

                                        TITUS
                      He is never happier, than when he 
                      is by your side.
                                (wanting it to be

                        Tell me I have been mistaken about 
                        you.  Tell me you are not the 
                        serpent I have thought you to be.

  Tears shine in Lucretia s eyes as she responds with equal 
  honesty.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I am not.

  Titus sees the sincerity of that.  The smile of impending 
  truce bends his lips.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I am far worse.

  Titus COUGHS, his smile fading.

                        I never cared what you thought of 
                        me.  My lack of breeding.  The 
                        absence of family or a name of 
                        worth.  These things I cannot deny.  
                        Yet how low you considered your 
                        son... a man I love more than life 
                        itself...  That could not be 
                        tolerated.  So I began to poison 
                        your beloved honeyed wine.

                        Then you returned.  To torture him, 
                      as you did all those years.  So I 
                        began bringing you your honeyed 
                        wine again.  To force you back to 
                        Sicilia.  Yet it was not enough.  
                        You were not moved, despite ailing 
                        health.  No.  A more permanent 
                        solution was required between us 
                        this time.  One that I have added 
                      to Tullius  gift.

  Titus  eyes fall on the wine cup.  The fatal dose.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Quintus will not forgive Tullius 
                        for this.  He will strike in your 
                        name.  And Gaia s death will be 
                        avenged.

  Titus goes into a seizure, coughing blood.  INTERCUT WITH:



  Gannicus and Melitta are lost in each other s embrace, 
  mouths and hands desperately exploring... Gannicus starts to 
  remove her dress.  She stops him, her eyes widening with 
  sudden fear as she begins COUGHING.

                                          MELITTA
                        Gannicus....



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  She coughs BLOOD, going into the same kind of seizure as 
  Titus.  Gannicus doesn t know what to do.  RACK TO TULLIUS  
  AMPHORA siting behind them.  The poison claiming an 
    unsuspecting victim.



  Titus claws at Lucretia s gown, spitting out his final 
    blood-soaked words.

                                        TITUS
                        You curse this house.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  with tenderness)(
                        No, father.  I elevate it.

  Titus  breathing slows.  Stops.  His hand releases her, his 
  eyes dead.  Lucretia looks on, resplendent in her wig.  A 
  red serpent made flesh.  A slight smile of victory bends her 
  lips as she rises from Titus  bedside and drifts out into --



  Lucretia s smile shatters, her eyes falling on Melitta 
  carried in Gannicus  arms.  A stricken Naevia and Two Guards 
  accompany him.  Naevia holds the poisoned amphora of honeyed 
  wine.

  MELITTA S EYES ARE OPEN,

  yet staring lifelessly.  She is dead, blood staining her 
  lips and dress.  Lucretia s eyes widen in horror.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  destroyed)(
                        The wine... it was the wine...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Return to the ludus.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Domina --

  She motions for the Guard to take Melitta.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Oenomaus must not know she came to 
                        your cell.  She was never with you.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.
  CONTINUED:

  The Guard takes Melitta s body.  Gannicus reluctantly 
  releases her.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Go.

  The other Guard escorts him out.  Gannicus looks back at 
  Melitta, devastated.  MUSIC SWELLS, propelling us into a 
  MONTAGE OF SLOW MOTION GRIEF --



  Batiatus and Oenomaus rush through the atrium as they 
  return, faces stricken with the news delivered by Naevia.  
  Medicus is left in their wake.



  Oenomaus sees the Guard holding Melitta s body.  He takes 
  it, sinking to his knees as he cradles her, devastated.

  BATIATUS

  looks to Lucretia, stunned and shocked.  What the fuck has 
  happened?  Lucretia s eyes move to the bedchamber in 
  response.  Batiatus reacts, his own eyes widening in fear as 
  he rushes into the bedchamber.



  Batiatus freezes in horror.  Tears spill down his cheeks as 
  he kneels beside his dead father, clutching his hand. 
  Lucretia looms in the background.  Drained by what she has 
  had to do.  And deeply troubled for the price it has cost.  
  The CAMERA SINKS down, TRANSITIONING US TO --
