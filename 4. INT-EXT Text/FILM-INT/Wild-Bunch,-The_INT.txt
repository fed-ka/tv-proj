PAYMASTER
What -you meant to do does not interest
me What you did --
Then, seeing:
24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window,
smiling with the thought that their visit means. military
business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw
their\guns and Pike steps towards him.
PAYMASTER
(reaching for air)
What is it?...What do you want?
25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the
counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to:
26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just
enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions
were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour,

If they move, kill them.

roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look
in his. direction, then freeze as:
31 'VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,. SEES NOTHING, leans back
against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers.
After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he
remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's
shoulders.

FROM THE PARADE GROWS LOUDER. He looks out Behind hi::

Son of a bitch
He turns and crosses quickly to the back door. Dutch
follows. Pike opens it a little, looks ou.t at.
The following scenes will be superimposed over 101 and 102.
The suite consists of three adjoining rooms and is very
plush indeed,
TWO VERY BEAUTIFUL-YOUNG WOMEN in revealing night dress are
hindering more than helping, a somewhat loaded Pike Bishop
as he attempts to get into his clothes. The ladies are
giggling. and there is a great deal of grab-ass between the
three. -
101-B THORNTON, fully dressed and looking very sharp in his big
city clothes, enters from one of. the adjoining rooms.
ELIZABETH, a tall, lovely near-naked,.dark-haired girl,
follows him and takes his arm possessively. For a moment
both watch:
101-C PIKE'S girls'effectively stop his half-hearted attempts and
begin disrobing him.
THORNTON
(SHARPLY)
Come on pardner, let's get out
of here. -
PIKE
(Grinning at him)-
You.sound like you're all caught

There is a knock at the door and. Thornton whirls. Elizabeth
throws the bolt.
THORNTON

Hold it!
PIKE

101-D ELIZABETH. STICKS. OUT HER TONGUE AT THORNTON AND OPENS THE.
DOOR and gunfire fills the room as:
101-E A DEPUTY SHERIFF STEPS INTO THE DOORWAY-AND SHOOTS THORNTON
high on the shoulder. Thornton. is knocked sprawling... The
Deputy moves into the room (followed by three other men)
and fires at Pike but misses, as.
101-F PIKE SLIPS PAST the screaming women into an adjoining room.
The other men pursue.P.ike as the Deputy bends down and
snaps Thornton's wrists together with handcuffs. The sound:
of gunfire is heard from the street outside, then two of
the men re-enter the room. The Deputy looks up..
DEPUTY
Get him?
The man shakes his head.
101-G THORNTON, HIS FACE TWISTED WITH PAIN AND BITTERNESS, makes
no attempt to struggle as he .is pulled to his feet and
moved out the door.

he is trapped. Finally, he nods and moves away, then stops
and turns back, his anger almost beyond any control.
THORNTON

(as Harrigan looks at him)
Getting paid for it?

bad. The bare walls are decorated with pin-ups from the
Police Gazette.
The men sit attentively on the bunks. and.foot lockers.,
Harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger
book. After making a 'notation, he looks up..

193 THE CANTINA IS A LARGE MANY LEVELED ROOM IN A HALF DESTROYED
HACIENDA FILLED WITH MEXICANS wearing the uniforms of
Huerta,' s counter-revolutionary army and their ladies,,
A small mariachi band wanders among the. tables. playing folk.
songs of the era. In certain areas horses are stabled.--
a blacksmith shop is working, guns are being repaired, knives
and bayonets sharpened..,and food is being cooked for the
troops by their women. Kids, as .always,. are very evident.
19L. MAPACHE AND HIS GROUP ARE SEATED AT A TABLE which is in' a
covered area raised above the others. It is obvious from.
his position and respect accorded him that he is the local
.boss of the area.' The German officer, Mohr, and Ernst, are
'sitting on one side of him. Lieutenant Zamorra is seated
on the other side. Herrera is close by.
1.95. PIKE AND THE OTHERS MOVE TOWARDS A CORNER of the cantina
eyeing the Mexicans with the kind of caution that men who
are vastly outnumbered generally show.. They sit quietly
at a table, ignoring the suspicious looks of the soldiers.
196 AT MAPACHE'S LONG TABLE, the General and the Germans watch
them with pointed interest. Mohr nudges Mapache and asks
who they are. Mapache shr ugs -- he doesn't know,
197 EMMA, A PRETTY WAITRESS, CROSSES TO PIKE'S table to take

198 MAPACHE IS LAUGHING AND DRINKING. The German. leans close
to Zamorra and speaks in Spanish.
MOHR
Do you know these Americans?
ZAMORRA
No.
The German settles back in his.chair and. begins placing
a cigarette in a holder.
1.99 TECTOR AND LYLE LOOK SUSPICIOUSLY AROUND AT THE MEXICANS
in the cantina. The other men tired from the trail only
half listen to them as the girl serves beer.
TECTOR
Probably talking about us behind our
backs.
200 DUTCH TURNS TO PIKE WHO IS QUAFFING a large beer.
DUTCH
I'm down to about twenty in silver...
PIKE
The G3neralisimo has cleaned this part
a of the country ...He ought to have it

201 ANGEL SITTING QUIETLY WITH HIS GLASS OF BEER WATCHES
MAPACHE, his eyes burning with hatred.

Then suddenly, he reacts to the sound of a girl's voice off
scene.
TERESA
Vamos:...te va. gustar el Alenman:
Angel. spins around in his chair watching as:
202 TWO PRETTY MEXICAN GIRLS, TERESA AND RASA, laughing and
giggling, pass-the table.

Teresa recognizes him,: then pulls away,

Angel watches, his rage growing, then stands -- Pike goes

In a split second he draws and fires.
205 TERESA HAS JUST'S.TARTED TO SIT ON THE BIG MAN'S LAP WHEN
THE BULLET FROM THE FORTY-FIVE CATCHES. HER IN THE STOMACH

for cover, their guns coming out.
206 ANGEL IS STARING AT THE GIRL AS PIKE T"EROWS A PUNCH DIRECTLY
into the side of his head dropping him onto the floor, knock-
ing him out. The others stand, hands an -theirguns,

207 THE ENTIRE AREA IS COMPLETELY SILENT. SEVERAL SOLDIERS
ARE STANDING WITH THEIR GUNS COVERING PIKE AND THE OTHERS.
Mapache and the'others slowly rise, look at Angel, now
realizing who shot the girl.
208 MAPACHE STARTS TOWARDS THEM. He pushes over chairs and shoves
people aside as he approaches the group. Zamorra9 the Germans
and other members of his retinue are close on his heels.
209 PIKE AND THE OTHERS ARE SILENT AND UNMOVING AS MAPACHE STEPS
up to the'table and quickly scans the group.. Angel gets to
his knees9 Mapache kicks him in the.head and when Angel. falls
back, stamps him several times with his boot,, steps away.
One of Mapache's men starts to bash Angel's head with a rifle`
butt,. Mapache stops the man with a gesture,. then turns to
the others.
MAPACHE
Qua basura es este?
Mapache again. kicks Angel..
ZAMORRA
Why did he try to kill His Excellency...?
PIKE
He didn't, he was. after the girl...
Mapache is having difficulty understanding. He looks at
Z'amorra with a puzzled expression.
ZAMORRA
La.muchacha,..
DUTCH
Era su novia;
The Mexicans immediately respond to Dutch's explanation.
Both Z.amorra and Mapache smile.
O MAP ACHE
(PLEASED)
His fiancee??...
PIKE
He went a little crazy when he saw
her with you.
Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he
had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly
in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina.
MA PA CHE
Mato su vieja porque salio con El Mapache;
The soldiers in the cantina laugh and ad lib their response..

211 MOHR IGNORES them, looking with interest at the U.S..Army
.45 pistols that the men are wearing.
MOHR

Are you men in Agua Verde for business?
PIKE.
Thought we might sell a few horses.
MOHR
You must have been associated with
the American Army, is that riot so?
Tector and Lyle snicker slightly at the remark. Mapache and
Zamorra turn, listening carefully to the conversation.
The cantina is silent.
DUTCH
-No -- were not associated with anyone...
MOHR
I see,..1 was curious because of.the
equipment which you are carrying.
(as they look at him)
That pistol is restricted for use'by
army personnel. It can't be purchased
or even owned... legally.
-PIKE
(GUARDEDLY)
Is that so? - -
MOHR
You're surprised at my interest?

Weapons are a specialty of mine.
Mohr bows his head slightly and clicks his heels barely audib3y,

Imperial German. Army. For the last six-
months I have been in Mexico helping

about the problem.
ANGEL
Would you give someone a gun to
kill your mother, or your father,
or your brother?
231, DUTCH LOOKS AT PIKE. Pike thinks it over. Both have.
another pull on the bottle.
PIKE

ANGEL
No -- you gringos are no different.

ANGEL (CONT' D )
My people don't have guns so Mapache
takes the food out of their mouths
and clothes off their backs. With
guns my village could fight, If I
could take guns to my people I would
go with you -- but not just for
gold,
232 THE MEN ARE MOMENTARILY SILENT. Angel lifts a bucket
of water, spills part of it on his head, passes it to Sykes
who drinks a little of the water, spits it out, puts the
bucket down, pours two bottles of tequilla into it,
drinks. again -- smiles, passes it to Angel, who drinks
and passes it on.
DUTCH
(DRINKING)
.Al]. we'd need is for El Mapache to
find out we armed some village...
SYKES

(as P ke looks
a t\ him )
You know as well as I there ain't no
way of collecting from Mapache 'cept
off a lot of dead bodies -- mostly
ours, the way he thinks.
Pike considers this -- looks at the old man, finally
nods .
ANGEL
I would take guns ...if Mapache found
out, you would say I stole them,
DUTCH
How many cases of rifles did Zamorra
say were in that shipment?

He picks up a pan with a hot handle, drops it, spilling hot
stew or soup on his foot, hops around cursing looking at
the shambles on the stove and on the floor.'

crosses to the side-board and pours him a drink. He takes
it, suddenly both are laughing.

Suddenly Pike embraces her and pulls her to the bed. They
begin to make love, then:
THE DOOR SMASHES OUN AND LUKE, a skinny bad mouthed Texan
steps into the room, a_double barreled shot gun in his
hands ready to fire.
AURORA SCREAMS and throws herself in front of Pike. Luke
fires, the charge killing her as Pike dives out of bed --
jumping for his gun on a nearby table.

214.2 AT THE REAR OF THE CAR, A DOZEN VERY YOUNG ARMY RECRUITS
are sprawled across the seats near their beefy first
sergeant, FRANK MC HALE who is snoring loudly.
214.3. THE CATTLE CAR IS LOADED WITH THE HORSES OF THE SOLDIERS
AND THE BOUNTY HUNTERS.
The soldiers' horses are roach-maned and unsaddled. I
At one end of the car, the railroad livestock man is asleep
on a pile of straw, an empty jug at his side. The animals
of the bounty hunters are standing saddled, with the cinches
loosened.
244 THE TRAIN SLOWS AND A FEW OF THE SOLDIERS. lift their heads
and look out the windows.
Seeing nothing but the vast empty plain, they quickly resume
their slumber.

214.6. A RICKETY WATER TOWER AND TINY maintenance shack -- no horses,
wagons, nothing.
214.7 THORNTON TURNS back to his seat.
263:: THORNTON- FROWNS AS THE CAR moves slightly. He stands, and
walks toward the front of the car. Through the window on
the. door, he sees:
262 ANGEL SCRAMBLING OVER THE CRATES TOWARDS THE TENDER.
263 THORNTON DUCKS BACK AND STARTS TO DRAW HIS . gun,..: pauses and
turns back into the car.' Silently he gestures to the
bounty hunters.
The soldiers in the back of the car continue to sleep as
Thornton and his men move past them toward the horse car.
REACHING THE SERGEANT, still snqring loudly, Thornton hesi-
tates, then decides against it and enters the horse car.
265 IN THE CAB, PIKE EASES THE THROTTLE FORWARD.
266 THE ENGINE AND. TENDER AND FLAT CAR PULL" SLOWLY away from
the passenger and cattle car.
267 THE GAP IS BECOMING LARGER BETWEEN THE PASSENGER-CAR AND
THE FLAT CAR WHEN DUTCH SEES:
268 A 'MAN JUMPING A HORSE OUT OF THE CATTLE CAR. It is one of
the bounty hunters. Another horse quickly follows. Dutch
turns and yells.
DUTCH
They're coming;
269 GORCH ON FRONT OF THE. LOCOMOTIVE WHIRLS AROUND and looks
back for an instant as Dutch yells. The two guards jump
for their weapons. Lyle turns back,'watches them, then
kills both as they pick up their rifles.
270 IN THE CAB, PIKE POURS ON THE COAL.
271 STEAM POURS OUT OF THE. CYLINDERS AND THE WHEELS SPIN ON
THE RAILS...
272 AS THE WHEELS GAIN TRACTION AND TEIE TRAIN LURCHES FORWARD,
DUTCH PITCHES FORWARD, FALLING OVER THE EDGE BETWEEN THE
TENDER AND THE FLAT CAR, turning in the air, catching the
tender with his hands and his feet precariously balanced
on the coupling.
273 OVER THE RAILS, DUTCH HANGS ONTO THE IRON HAND GRIP ON THE
BACK OF THE TENDER. His feet are bracing him on the bounc-
- ing coupling. He is inches above the rail.

27I, ON THE FLAT CAR THE TWO GUARDS SCRAMBLE OVER THE CASES
AND GRAB THEIR GUNS. They start .forward.
275 DUTCH LETS GO and, hanging on with one hand, manages to get
his gun out of the holster. He fires blindly over the edge,
IN TAE .CAB, PIKE .AND ANGEL WHIRL at the sound of the shot.
Pike instantly kicks the engineer and fireman out of the
cab, then turns toc'limb onto the tender..
ANGEL

Yo V07;
Pike hesitates, then turns back to the throttle.
27.6 DUTCH DUCKS AS SHOTS FROM THE GUARD splinter wood nearh=s
face.. He is barely able to hang on. and. is slipping down
closer to' the rails.
279 A3,. THEY REMOVE THEIR HORSES, SOME TRYING to resaddle in
the car.
342 A TELEGRAPH'OPERATOR SNAPS AWAKE as a message comes over the
wire..-. As the machine clicks, he diligently writes the mes-
sage. When he is, finished he hands it to JUAN, a' small.: boy .
who` is dressed in a poorly fitting uniform. -
OPERATOR
Porel generalisimo: Andale!
The boy runs out of the building and into the street.
458 PIKE IS SPRAWLED OVER A NATIVE HAMMOCK, drunk.. He lifts a
bottle of mescale and takes a drink.
459 ON THE FLOOR OF THE HUT A SAD BUT NOT UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN is
sitting looking at a handful of silver in her hand. In one
corner a baby whines as the flies bother it.
Through an open door leading to another room,.the drunken
voices of the Gorch brothers can be heard as they bargain
with DELORES, a very reluctant prostitute.
LYLE (OS)
You said dos for two.
TECTOR (O.S )
And here's.your dos and one'to grow on
'cause y ou did real well, honey.
DELORES (OS)
Doce -- es mas que dos dace para cada

460 PIKE WATCHES THE WOMAN AND THE BABY FOR A MOMENT LONGER THEN
SUDDENLY SWINGS OUT OF THE HAMMOCK and steps into the ad-
joining room.
461. LYLE GORCH LOOKS UP AT HIM BLEARILY FROM A HAMMOCK. Tector is
on the floor embracing the disheveled woman.
Pike watches them, weaving a little:
PIKE

their officers and a handful of women are seated-at a long
center table.. Food and liquor bottles are spilled every-
where, the mariachi band plays for:
466A CHITA, A SCARED, NOT UNATTRACTIVE GIRL who is trying to
please the general by dancing on the table.
At other tables are more officers and perhaps thirty or so

ZAMORRA.
You are very stupid...very stupid!
464 SUDDENLY MAPACHE LURCHES UP FROM THE TABLE, CROSSES TO ANGEL
AND LIFTS HIM TO HIS FEET. Half dragging him, he steps in
front' of the Americans. Around him many of the soldiers are
rising. -

474 ZAMORRA, STILL SEATED at the table pours himself a drink,
the clink of the glass against the bottle loud in the
silence. Beside him the.Germans rise slowly.
Mapache, still holding Angel from behind, leans over his
shoulder and whispers in his ear:
MAPACHE

477 ANGEL'S FACE BEGINS to brighten with hope and he takes
another step,. then:
478 MAPACHE GRABS HIM.BY THE HAIR and his other hand flashes
across the boy's throat as he shoves Angel-into the Americans,
the blood splattering them from his severed throat.
