      Mitchell. He s wearing the uniform of a first world war 
      captain. He stumbles out of a forest into a clearing. His 
      uniform is torn, his face streaked with blood. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    Or in a war.

      Something up ahead makes him stop. A group of men, dressed     
    in the clean crisp uniforms of officers. They look    
      strangely out of place in the carnage and mud. 

      They are gathered around a body, a wounded soldier. They 
      turn. One of them we will later recognise as Herrick. They 
      spot Mitchell. They grin. And their eyes scorch black.




      Mitchell stands at the foot of the war memorial.

      Mitchell turns away and walks down to his car. And we see 
    the world has moved on a long way from that Flanders field. 
      People. Cars. Neon. Life.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    We ve driven off the edge of the 
                    map but we re still travelling.

    He climbs in and drives off.

                    No one told me death sometimes 
                    cheats.




      We re looking down at George, on his back, on the ground. 
      He s in shock. Struggling to move, eyes rolling. His coat 
    is shredded at the shoulder and red with blood. 

    We pull back. Lying next to him is another figure. His neck 
    and chest are gone. Just gone. Torn away.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    But there are those that cheat 
                    death.

      There are sharp flashes of light, and more figures run into 
      frame. One has a shotgun, blasting at something off screen. 
      Another attends to George, writhing on the ground. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Battered and bloody, they walk

                    big bad wolf.      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 4.



      Flat, barren, unforgiving land. George climbs out of his 
    car and starts to walk. It s as if he s in a trance. Or 
      drawn inexorably on by an invisible thread. And as he walks 
    he starts to undress. With difficulty he pulls his jacket 
    and shirt off. His shoulder is still wrapped in bandages. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    They re scarred.




    The transformation is horrific. Every bone in George s body 
      breaks as it stretches, contracts and reforms. The pain and 
    the brutality of it tears him apart, eviscerates him.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    They re transformed.

    The flesh on his face stretches as his jaw distends into a 
      snout. His back arches as his spine and shoulder blades 
      stretch and bow. George screams. Over and over.




      A pizza delivery guy, 17 maybe, climbs off his moped, 
      trudges to a door and rings the bell. It flies open. 
      There s Annie. Beaming. 

                                    ANNIE

      Mitchell appears, scoops the pizza out of his hands, stuffs 
      some money into his fist and disappears again.

    The Pizza Guy turns to go. But Annie isn t letting him get 
      away that easily.

      Mitchell looks up. George has scurried into the canteen, 
    his eyes searching frantically for Mitchell. Mitchell 
      stands, excuses himself from Becca and trots over.

      Mitchell s car splashes along the country road and comes to 
    an abrupt stop. George scrambles out. 




      George crashes through the bushes and branches, already 
      tugging at his clothes.     "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 18.



      George stumbles into the clearing. Stops dead. There s a 
      family there. Parents and two kids. Camping. A tent and 
      stove. They stare at George.

                                      GEORGE
                    Hi, how are you?

    He turns, crashes back into the woods.




      George scrambles down a bank to a dried up river bed. This 
      will do. He turns. Two men, locked in an embrace, are 
      staring at him.

                                      GEORGE
                    Oh for fu- Sorry, sorry.

    He turns and flees.




      A man doing TaiChi. Behind him, George sprints past from 
    one side of the frame to the other.

                                      GEORGE
                    Haven t you people got homes...!

    The man turns. No one there.




      Another clearing. This time, mercifully deserted. George 
      tries to catch his breath. He starts to pull his shirt off.

                    George Sands.

      George spins around. All he can see in the fading daylight 
    is the silhouette of a man, maybe 20 yards away. A thick 
      dark shape in the gathering gloom.

                                    VOICE (CONT D)
                    Cutting it a bit fine, aren t 
                    you, George?

      George is speechless. Frozen with shock. The figure takes a 
      step towards George. It breaks the spell and George 
      scrambles back into the woods.

      George stumbles through the undergrowth. It s like he s 
      running for his life.




      Mitchell steps outside. Music starts thumping dully through 
    the walls. At least the soundproofing is pretty good. 
      Mitchell locks the front door.




      Mitchell is sat ion the doorstep. Now, just audible under 
    the throb of the music, are George s screams. It makes 
      Mitchell wince and shudder.




      Mitchell flinches at the roar from inside. He turns and 
      Annie is sitting on the step next to him. She looks 
      distressed and pale. Even more than usual. 

                                    ANNIE
                    He s gone.

      Mitchell says nothing. He settles back against the door, 
      getting comfy for the long night ahead of them. Annie sits, 
      hunched and shaken. Through the walls, the dull pulse of 
    the music and, if you listen really hard, the roars and 
      howls of a monster.




    The sun peeps over the rooftops. The world stirs and wakes.




      Establishing shot. The entrance to the hospital. Dribsand 
      drabs of people going in and out of the hospital. Late 
      visitors and the night shift arriving.




      A little square in the hospital grounds. A smattering of 
      nurses and doctors. A hole has been dug, a tree planted. A 
      caretaker is shovelling in the last of the earth. A middle 
      aged couple that must be Lauren s parents watch the 
      proceedings, still in wide-eyed shock. George hunches up 
      against the wind.




      Establishing shot. Night is falling over the city. Lights 
    are flickering on inside the hospital.




      George tearing through the streets. He stumbles to a halt, 
      turns one way, then another. Christ, where does he start?




    The city is swamped with drinkers and revellers. George 
      pushes through crowds, diving into bars and pubs. There s 
      still no sign of Mitchell and Becca.




      Mitchell drags Lauren outside. She snatches her arm away 
      from him. Takes out a pack of cigarettes, lights one.

      Mitchell stares at Lauren, as if seeing her for the first 
      time.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Thank you.

                                      LAUREN
                    ... What for?

    He turns, walks away.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    You can t dothis, Mitchell, you 
                    can t choose them over us. You ll 
                    lose everything. Whatever it 
                    takes, we will Drag You Back!

    But he s gone.




      George is hurrying towards the bar where Mitchell and Becca 
      are. As he passes the mouth to the alley next to it, he 
      notices a figure in the shadows. The figure has her back to 
      George, barely discernible in the darkness. But something 
      about it, the way she s standing, makes George skid to a 
      halt. He takes a few tentative steps into the alley. Slowly 
    the figure turns and looks at him. It s Lauren.




                                      GEORGE
                    Lauren? It s me, it s George.

    She starts moving towards George, out of the darkness. Her 
      hand flashes out and she has George pinned by the throat 
      against the wall, his feet kicking in the air. She leans 
    in, almost nose to nose. All cruel smiles. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Bad dog.

    She drops him to the ground and stalks off. 

      George is flat on his back, winded. He turns his head and 
      comes face to face with... Becca. 

    She looks at George, her eyes wide with shock and terror. 
    Her hands are clamped to her throat. And the blood floods 
    and pumps through her fingers.     "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 55.



      There's George. He's cradling Becca in his arms. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Oh Jesus Christ...

      A couple of people poke their heads out through the door. 
    One of them screams when they see Becca and the blood.

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    Call an ambulance!

    The women stumble back inside. Mitchell scrambles down onto 
    the ground next to Becca and George. George has his hand 
      clamped over the cut in Becca s throat, but the blood is 
      still coursing through his fingers. Becca blinks up at 
      Mitchell, bewildered and terrified.

                                    BECCA
                    What s... there s water...

                                    MITCHELL
                    Becca, it s Ok, it s Ok, it s 
                    Mitchell. Come on, baby, that s 
                    it, stay looking at me.

                                    BECCA
                    I m covered... with water...

    And then Lauren emerges out of the darkness. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Now isn t this a touching scene.

                                    MITCHELL
                    What did you do to her?!

                                      LAUREN
                    Easy, tiger. What s the problem? 
                    You just need to let her drink 
                    from you.

                    Becca, Becca, look at me.

      Becca s eyes are rolling in her head. But they find Lauren, 
    and she makes a sound; a childish, frightened sound. 

                                      LAUREN
                    It s Ok, honey, he ll save you. 
                    He ll make this all go away. 

      With what little strength Becca has left, she tries to claw 
      back away from Lauren, terrified of her.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    He just needed to be shown, you 
                    see, that this whole thing is 
                      ridiculous.

                                      GEORGE
                    Mitchell? Canyou save her?

                                    MITCHELL
                    I can t... I can t...

                                      GEORGE
                    She s losing consciousness...

                                      LAUREN
                    Yeah, you should get a move on. 
                    She s about two pints away from 
                    being an organ donor.

                                      GEORGE
                    Mitchell, DO something.

      Mitchell is weeping. He shakes his head.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Not another one... I can t... 

      Even Lauren is a little surprised. She looks at Becca, 
      lifeless and bloody. At George, sick and shocked. And at 
      Mitchell, weeping and cradling Becca in his arms.

                                      LAUREN
                    You did this. 

      Lauren steps away, melting back into the shadows.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    You made me this, Mitchell. This 
                    is all your fault.

    And she s gone. In the distance, the wail of sirens. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 57.

      People have spilled out from the bar now, crowded around 
    the fire exit, watching in shock. George looks on, as 
      Mitchell holds the dying Becca. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    I m sorry... I m so sorry...




    The kitchen window, seen from the street outside.

      A figure is watching the house. His face lost in shadows. 
    He steps forward, and the beam of the street lamp 
      illuminates his face. He's handsome, unshaven, with sharp 
      intelligent eyes. He watches George, standing at the sink, 
      oblivious. A predator watching its quarry.
