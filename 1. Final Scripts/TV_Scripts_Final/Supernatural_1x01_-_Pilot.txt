                                      TEASER

    OVER BLACK--

    LAWRENCE, KANSAS.  1982. 

    EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

    A small town American HOME on a small town American street.  

  We DRIFT UP towards a warm, lighted yellow WINDOW, on the 
    second floor.  As we float closer, we spy inside... a WOMAN.  
    Standing beside a crib.  She holds a TODDLER.  

    When, suddenly... the window GLASS SHIMMERS.  RIPPLES, as if 
  it were liquid.  Just for a moment.  Blink and you miss it.

    INT. HOUSE - NURSERY - NIGHT

    INSIDE THE CRIB.  An INFANT BOY, a few months old.  SAM.    

    MARY HARRISON, late 20 s, gently beautiful in a genuine, 
    maternal way.  She leans her 3-year-old son DEAN over the 
    crib s edge.  Dean kisses the baby s forehead.

                                YOUNG DEAN
                   Night, Sammy.  

  Now Mary leans over, kisses Sam.  

                                MARY
                  Goodnight, love.

    Mary carries Dean to the doorway, where her husband JACK 
    HARRISON, 30, waits.  Jack flips off the lights. 

                                JACK
                  Sam.  You sleep through the night, 
                  and you can have Dean s room.  

    Jack leaves the door open a crack.  

  On Sam.  Beat.

    Then... the FISHER-PRICE MOBILE, above his crib, begins to 
    spin, silent, of its own accord.  

  On the dresser.  A TEDDY BEAR CLOCK TICKS, soothing.  But 
    then it abruptly stops.  Frozen.

    A Casper the Friendly Ghost NIGHTLIGHT flickers...                                                                                  2.



    INT. HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

    A BABY MONITOR, on a nightstand.  (We also see Jack and 
    Mary s WEDDING PHOTO-- he s wearing naval whites.)  The 
    baby s PIERCING CRIES, through the monitor receiver.  

    Mary groans awake.  Looks over.  Jack isn t in bed.  Still 
  the baby bawls.

    INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

    Mary shuffles down the hall.  Opens the nursery door, peers 
  in.  Pitch-black inside.  But Mary discerns a FIGURE hunched 
    over the crib.

                                MARY
                  Jack?  Is he hungry?

                                FIGURE
                  Shhhhh.  

    Mary holds up her hands-- okay, sorry.  She turns away.  

  But when she reaches her bedroom door, she stops.  Noticing--  

  At the other end of the hall... the stairwell.  A pale, 
    dancing, ghostly light.  Coming from downstairs.  Mary 
    frowns.  What the hell?  

  She moves toward the shimmering glow.  Cautious.  

  At the stairs now.  Bare feet padding down the steps.  

    Until, finally, Mary reaches the bottom, to see--

    INT. HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

    Jack.  Asleep in his La-Z-Boy.  An old movie on the muted TV.  

                                MARY
                  Oh my God.

    Mary spins, BOLTS up the steps! 

    INT. HOUSE - NURSERY - NIGHT 

    Mary BURSTS into the nursery, flips on the light.  And 
    whatever she sees O.S., it causes the color to drain from her 
    face; her breath to come in short, panicked bursts.

                                MARY
                      (a whisper)
                  ...get away from him...                                                                                  3.



    INT. HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 

    Coming from upstairs, Mary s terrible, ragged SCREAMING!  
    Jack LUNGES out of his chair--

                                JACK
                  Mary?!

  As Jack takes the steps two at a time, Mary s screaming 
    abruptly snuffs out.

    INT. HOUSE - NURSERY - NIGHT 

    Jack explodes into the nursery.  Mary s not there.  He moves 
  up to the crib.  The baby s okay, thank God, though he s 
    bawling, inconsolable.  Jack holds Sam, confounded--

                                JACK
                  Mary...?

    Jack is about to exit the room, to search for his wife, when 
  he stops.  Sensing something.  He turns back, noticing--

    INSIDE THE CRIB.  Plink.  A dime of crimson red appears on 
  the Sesame Street mattress.  Plink.  Then another.  Another.

    They re drops.  Drops coming from above.  

    Jack looks up at the ceiling.  His face twists into equal 
    parts anguish and terror.  

                                JACK
                  ...no...oh my God no...

  ON THE CEILING.  MARY.  Impossibly splayed out, as if it were 
  the floor.  Eyes wide open, glassy.  Dead.

    Jack barely has time to react, before...

    Sizzling.  BLACK LINES, BURNING THEMSELVES into the wall.  
    Spiderwebbing.  Some horizontal, some vertical.  At first, we 
    don t realize what it is.  But then it takes shape.

    A message.  Branded into the wall, in charcoal black letters 
    four feet high--

    COMING FOR YOU

  The message smolders and IGNITES.  Flames curl the wallpaper.  
    Spreading fast.  A smoke alarm BLARES, piercing.

    Outside, in the hallway, Dean begins to push open the nursery 
    door, crying, terrified.                                                                                  4.



                                YOUNG DEAN
                  Mommy?!  Daddy?!

    Snapping to lucidity, Jack carries baby Sam out of the room. 
    Snatches up Dean with his other arm, before the boy enters.

                                JACK
                  No, Dean.  Don t look, okay?  We 
                  gotta go.

    Jack darts quickly for the stairs.  

  Out the front door.

                                                                          CUT TO:

    EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - FEW MINUTES LATER

  An angry BLAZE.  Firetrucks.  In a few hours, when they 
    finally extinguish the flames, there won t be much left.

    Jack.  Across the street.  Holding, comforting his two sons.

    TIGHTER.  Jack.  Watching the house burn.  Fire illuminating 
  his expression, reflecting in his eyes. 

  His jaw sets in pain and FURY--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.

    OVER BLACK--

    STANFORD UNIVERSITY.  PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA.  PRESENT DAY.

    EXT. STANFORD CAMPUS - NIGHT 

    A BLOODY CORPSE walks, casual, across the quad.  

  It takes a drag off a Marlboro.  And shakes its head at-- SAM 
    HARRISON, 23, clad in a gray T-shirt and jeans.  Sam walks 
    beside his girlfriend JESSICA, dressed as a sexy nurse.    

                                LUIS
                        (the zombie)
                  ...I gotta tell you, Sam, if your 
                  sorry ass was trick or treating my 
                  house, there d be no popcorn balls 
                  for you.

                                SAM
                        (gross)
                  You gave out popcorn balls?  

                                LUIS
                  Don t change the subject.  You 
                  could ve at least gone as the 
                  slutty version of something.  
                  Slutty Dorothy, slutty Alice, 
                  slutty nurse--

                                JESSICA
                  Hey!

                                LUIS
                  I didn t mean you.  

                                SAM
                  Sorry, man, what can I say?  Just 
                  never been a big fan of the whole 
                  thing.

                                LUIS
                  What are you, a communist?  Who 
                  doesn t like Halloween?        

  Sam doesn t respond... but something flits across his 
    expression, that the others don t notice.

    INT. THE 901 CLUB - NIGHT

    Scruffy hang-out.  Halloween party.  George W. Bush throws 
    back shots with Bill Clinton and Dracula.                                                                                    6.



    Jessica sits at a tall, round table.  Watching Sam and Luis 
    play darts.  Sam THROWS--

                                JESSICA
                  ...but Sam, I think it s crazy.  
                  Luis, tell him he s crazy.

                                LUIS
                  You re crazy. 

    Thwak.  Thwak.  Thwak.  THREE DARTS pierce a DART BOARD.  
    Dead bulls-eyes, crowding the tiny center. 

                                LUIS
                        (dismay at the game)
                  Dude...

                                SAM
                  I don t see what the big deal is.  

                                JESSICA
                  It s Thanksgiving.  I mean, is 
                  there any holiday you don t have a 
                  problem with?  Why would you work 
                  through Thanksgiving?

                                SAM
                        (playful)
                  Hmm.  Let s see.  Oh yeah-- my 
                  crushing loan debt.  

                                JESSICA
                  Ha, ha. 

    Luis throws his darts.  Shitty. 

                                LUIS
                  Dammit!

                                SAM
                  Seriously, if I don t catch up and 
                  clerk my ass off, Judge Carlton s 
                  gonna slaughter me.  And there s 
                  about twenty other students just 
                  dying to take my place.  

                                JESSICA
                  Even he takes off Thanksgiving...

                                SAM
                  It s not like I have any big plans 
                  or anything.                                                                                    7.



                                JESSICA
                        (gingerly)
                  You could always... go home.   

                                SAM
                  Yeah, no, that would be a tiny 
                  bit... excruciating.  

    Sam s turn again.  Another three bulls-eyes.  Luis GROANS.  

                                JESSICA
                  Why?  What is so terrible about 
                  your family?

    There s ground here that Sam doesn t care to tread.  So, as 
    usual, he turns it into a joke.

                                SAM
                  Nothing.  We were just like the 
                  Huxtables.  Only with a lot more 
                  shouting and browbeating.

                                LUIS
                  You know, I hear that in real life, 
                  Bill Cosby s a totally harsh guy.

                                SAM
                  See?  There you go.

                                JESSICA
                  Okay, I get it, you never talk 
                  about  em, no reason to start now.

                                LUIS
                  Must be some serious skeletons in 
                  that family closet.

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  Throw your darts.

                                JESSICA
                  It s just... you work so hard, I 
                  mean, even getting you out 
                  tonight... and now you re gonna 
                  spend Thanksgiving, alone, wading 
                  through bench memos?  It makes me 
                  kinda sad. 

  Sam moves close to her.  Puts his arms on her shoulders.  
    Sincere and sweet.                                                                                    8.



                                SAM
                  Don t be.  Jess, I m happy.  The 
                  happiest I ve been since... well, 
                  forever.  Trust me on this.

    Sam s turn at the dart board again.  He begins to throw.  
    Jessica takes a beat, and then--  

                                JESSICA
                  Well.  There is another option, of 
                  course.

                                SAM
                  What s that?

                                JESSICA
                  You could... come home.  With me.

  Sam turns to Jessica, surprised and pleased.  Meanwhile, Sam 
    just threw yet another triple bulls-eye.

                                LUIS
                  Dude!  You re like Rain Man!

                                SAM
                        (moving back to Jessica)
                  Really?  You sure I m ready for 
                  family consumption?  

                                JESSICA
                  You ll have to watch the 
                  spontaneous drooling... but yeah, I 
                  think so.  What do you think?

                                SAM
                  Can we have that awkward  where do 
                  I sleep  moment with your Dad?

                                JESSICA
                  Definitely.

                                SAM
                  Then I m in.

  Sam and Jessica smile at each other.  A deeply romantic 
    moment, all in the eyes, all without kissing.  Until--

                                LUIS (O.S.)
                  CRAP!

  Sam and Jessica start laughing.                                                                                  9.



    INT. SAM S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

  We PAN OFF Sam s bedside table (an OLD FRAMED PHOTO-- Mary 
    Harrison, cradling infant Sam) to find... 

    Sam, sleeping.  Jessica, peaceful and dreaming, beside him.  
    Then-- a soft SHATTER, tinkling like a bell.  Sam jolts 
    awake.  He clearly sleeps with one eye open.  Silent, he 
    slides out of bed.

    INT. SAM S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

  Sam emerges from the bedroom, into the hallway.  He peers 
    into the BATHROOM.

    POV-- INSIDE BATHROOM.  Sure enough... the window is broken.  

    Sam s expression tightens.  He pivots to the hall closet.  In 
  the back... a battered, VINYL-SHELL SUITCASE.  As silent as 
  he can, eyes and ears peeled for any coming threats, Sam 
    opens the case.

    INSIDE.  Guns.  Knives.  Multiples of each.  Damn.

  Sam snatches a BOWIE KNIFE.  He doesn t hold it in that 
      Psycho-stabbing, amateur way; no, he grips it tight and low.  
    Like a professional.  He prowls into the main room.

    INT. SAM S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - LATE NIGHT

  The room s black.  Gloomy.  Sam searches.  Wary, vigilant.  
    Under furniture.  Behind curtains.  He finds nothing.  Until 
  his razor-sharp eyes discern--

    Beneath the SWINGING DOOR, leading to the kitchen.  A pale, 
    ghostly light flits across the linoleum.  (It may even remind 
  us of the shimmering glow from the teaser).   

  Sam backs up, against the wall, beside the kitchen door.  
    Clutching the knife.  

    Sure enough... the swinging door CREAKS, slow, as someone 
    (something?) inside attempts to open it quietly--

    When Sam ATTACKS!  

  And surprisingly, the MAN from the kitchen dodges, just as 
    expertly.  Efficiently TWISTING the knife out of Sam s hand.  
  We get a good look at the man.  DEAN HARRISON, 26.  

                                DEAN
                  Easy, tiger.  Just looking for a 
                  beer.                                                                                    10.



                                SAM
                        (beyond shocked)
                  Dean...?  

                                DEAN
                          (inappropriately casual)
                  Hey Sammy.  How s things?  How s 
                  law school treating you?  

                                SAM
                  You scared the crap outta me.

                                DEAN
                  Well.  That s because you re out of 
                  practice.

                                SAM
                  What are you doing here?

                                DEAN
                  What, I can t pop in for a visit?
                        (off Sam s skeptical look)
                  Okay, okay.  We gotta talk.

                                SAM
                  Um.  The phone...?

                                DEAN
                  Would you have picked up?

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  Yeah, okay, fair point.

                                JESSICA
                  Sam...?

    Jessica appears on the other side of the room.  With a  
     Smurf  T-shirt and long, bare legs.  Dean casually reaches 
    inside the kitchen, deposits the Bowie knife on the counter, 
  out of sight.  Then he grins, mischievous.

                                DEAN
                  I love the Smurfs.

                                SAM
                  Jess, hey, sorry to wake you.  This 
                  is... this is Dean.

                                JESSICA
                  Your brother Dean?                                                                                  11.



                                DEAN
                  I gotta tell you, you are 
                  completely out of Sam s league.

  Sam rolls his eyes.  Dean s regularly like this with women.  
    Jessica can t help but blush a little.

                                JESSICA
                  That s what I m always saying. 
                        (then)
                  Just let me put something on--

                                DEAN
                  No, I wouldn t dream of it.  
                  Besides, I gotta chat with your 
                  boyfriend in private.

                                JESSICA
                  Oh.  Alright.

                                SAM
                  No, whatever you wanna say, you can 
                  say it in front of her.

                                DEAN
                  Um.  Okay.  Dad hasn t been home in 
                  a week.

                                JESSICA
                  Oh my God.

                                SAM
                  So he s working overtime on a 
                  Miller Time shift.  He ll stumble 
                  back sooner or later.

                                DEAN
                  Dad s on a hunting trip, and he 
                  hasn t been home in a week.

                                SAM
                        (after a long beat)
                  Jess.  Excuse us.  We re gonna go 
                  talk outside.

    EXT. SAM S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

  In Sam s lighted, ground floor BEDROOM WINDOW.  Jessica peeks 
  out from behind curtains.  Curious and concerned.  But then 
  she recedes back-- she doesn t want to pry...

  Sam and Dean walk to Dean s curb-parked car.  A 1965 CHEVY 
    IMPALA.  Black, dented, a Rottweiler of a muscle car.                                                                                    12.


    Kansas plates.  Dean pops the trunk, and we catch a glimpse 
    inside-- like Sam s suitcase, only much more so.  Shotguns.  
    Crucifixes.  Chainsaws.  God knows what else.  

    Dean roots around, before coming up with a faded LEATHER 
    JOURNAL.  Sam s both surprised and displeased to see it.

                                SAM
                  He left the book behind?

    Dean nods, grim.  We can tell-- this is a bad sign.  

                                SAM
                  So tell me everything. 

    EXT. STANFORD UNIVERSITY - MAIN QUAD - NIGHT

    CLOSE ON THE JOURNAL.  The book is jammed with dense writing, 
    yellowed obituaries.  We see the FINAL entry-- a taped 
    newspaper article, from the SANGER HERALD: 

    CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY: 4th DRIVER DISAPPEARANCE

                                DEAN
                  ...it s this stretch of two-lane 
                  blacktop, just outside Sanger, 
                  California... few hours from here, 
                  actually.  Anyway, these drivers.  
                  They just vanish.  No bodies, no 
                  cars, nothing.  It s like 
                  Interstate Bermuda Triangle.  

  Sam reads from the journal.  As the two brothers walk through 
    Stanford s main quad.  Dark.  Empty.  Atmospheric stone 
    arches, ornate libraries.  

                                DEAN
                  Dad went to check it out last 
                  Monday, haven t heard from him 
                  since. 

                                SAM
                  Why didn t you go with him?  

                                DEAN
                  I was working my own trip.  This 
                  voodoo thing, in New Orleans.

                                SAM
                  Dad let you go on a hunting trip by 
                  yourself?

                                DEAN
                  I am 26, dude.                                                                                  13.



                                SAM
                  Not emotionally.  
                        (anyway--)
                  It s only been a week.  Maybe he s 
                  on radio silence.  

                                DEAN
                  You know him.  Not for this long. 

                                SAM
                  So.  What s your plan?

                                DEAN
                        (taken aback)
                  Our plan is that we shag ass to 
                  Sanger, California and find Dad.

    Sam s emotions bubble and roil beneath the surface.  But for 
    now, he keeps them to himself.

                                SAM
                  Look, whatever s going on here, Dad 
                  can handle it.  He eats this kind 
                  of thing with his Wheaties.  

                                DEAN
                  Um.  What don t you understand?  We 
                  have to find him. You have to help. 

                                SAM
                  ...why do you need my help?   

                                DEAN
                  He s your father.  You re his son.  
                  What more do you need?  We re 
                  supposed to be family here-- 

                                SAM
                  News to me--

                                DEAN
                  No way you re bringing that up now.

                                SAM
                  He tossed me out on my ass.  And 
                  you practically locked the door 
                  behind me--

                                DEAN
                  I seem to remember a few choice 
                  phrases coming out of your mouth 
                  that night--                                                                                  14.



                                SAM
                  --and I haven t heard word one from 
                  you guys in, what, a year?  That 
                  sound like family to you?   

    Dean lays his cards out.  

                                DEAN
                  You know.  You re even more of a 
                  selfish, stuck-up, hair-gelled punk 
                  than I remember. 

                                SAM
                  Oh.  Am I?  

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  I mean, I know things have 
                  been rocky lately, but still... 
                  he s Dad.  And after everything 
                  he s done for you...

                                SAM
                  Everything he s done for me?!

                                DEAN
                  Yes--

                                SAM
                  All he s done for me, us, is set 
                  the land speed record for f d up 
                  childhoods!  

                                DEAN
                  Don t be overdramatic--

                                SAM
                  Dean.  When I told him I was scared 
                  of the thing in my closet, he gave 
                  me a .45!

                                DEAN
                  Well, what was he supposed to do?

                                SAM
                  He was supposed to say-- ghost 
                  stories are just stories!  He was 
                  supposed to say-- don t be afraid 
                  of the dark!

                                DEAN
                  But... you should be.  You know 
                  what s out there in the dark.  You 
                  should be friggin  terrified.                                                                                  15.



                                SAM
                  I know.  But still...

                                DEAN
                  Sammy, should I be prepping for a 
                  point here anytime soon?  

                                SAM
                  The point is... I never asked for 
                  it.  The occult homework.  And 
                  melting the silver into bullets.  
                  And the family roadtrips-- hunting 
                  down all those freaky-ass things.  
                  I never wanted any of it...   

                                DEAN
                  You can t pick your family. 

                                SAM
                  No, but I can live my own life.  
                  And all our gory dysfunction-- I 
                  buried it, man, I swore I was done 
                  with it.  For good. 

                                DEAN
                  You know as well as I do.  Nothing 
                  stays buried.  

    Beat.  Sam wills himself to believe--

                                SAM 
                  Look.  Dad ll be okay.  He ll be 
                  home in a few days.  You ll see.

                                DEAN
                  He s in real trouble, if he s not 
                  dead already.  I can feel it, and I 
                  know you can too.  
                        (then)
                  So the only question is: you coming 
                  with me or not?  

  OFF Sam, torn and conflicted--

    INT. SAM S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

    Jessica sits on the bed.  Waiting for Sam.  When he enters.  
  And begins to throw clothes into a backpack.

                                JESSICA
                  Everything alright?                                                                                  16.



                                SAM
                  Yeah.  So, Jess, listen.  Stay here 
                  as long as you want, okay?  Fridge 
                  should be reasonably stocked.

                                JESSICA
                  You re leaving?

                                SAM
                  Just for a few days.  

                                JESSICA
                  A few days?  Is this about your 
                  Dad?  Is he alright?  

    From the hall closet, Sam snags a second bag.  The VINYL-
    SHELL, WEAPON-PACKED SUITCASE.

                                SAM
                  Yeah.  You know.  Just a little... 
                  family drama. 

                                JESSICA
                  Your brother said he was on some 
                  kind of hunting trip...?

                                SAM
                  What?  Yeah, he s up at the... 
                  cabin, probably got Jim, Jack, and 
                  Jose with him.  We re gonna bring 
                  him back.

                                JESSICA
                  Now?  It s three in the morning.  
                  Sam, you sure you re okay?  

    Lugging both bags, Sam gives a bewildered Jessica a kiss. 

                                SAM
                  I m okay, everybody s okay, don t 
                  worry.  I ll call you later.  
                  Promise.  

                                JESSICA
                        (calling after him)
                  At least tell me where you re 
                  going...?

    EXT. FARM HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

  An isolated farm house.  A solitary beacon of light in a sea 
  of darkness.                                                                                   17.



    SUPER:  SANGER, CALIFORNIA.  

    Someone is having an illicit, parents-out-of-town, Halloween 
    kegger.  Various cars parked at every angle, various costumed 
    HIGH SCHOOL KIDS loitering outside.

    TROY SQUIRE, 18, shy, bespectacled, dressed as Harry Potter.  
  He waves goodbye to his friends, climbs into his hand-me-down 
    Toyota.  Rumbles off into the night.

    EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

  The Toyota WHIZZES past a road sign.  CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY.

    INT. TOYOTA - MOVING

    Troy drives home.  It s pitch black; he can t see further 
    than his hi-beams.  Suddenly, his RADIO MUSIC decomposes into 
    STATIC.  He glances at it-- weird-- begins to fiddle with the 
    dial, when--  

    Appearing in the perimeter of his headlights-- a figure, by 
  the roadside.  A GIRL, 18 or 19.  

    EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

  The girl s thin, white cotton dress FLUTTERS in the gusting 
    breeze.  She waits beside a MILE MARKER POST-- MILE 33.  

    Troy stops.  Opens the passenger door.  We TRAIL the girl as 
  she approaches.

                                TROY
                  Car trouble or something?

    INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT 

  We see her face, as she sits in Troy s car.  CONSTANCE WELD.  
    Beautiful.  Piercing gray eyes.  A hushed, melodic voice-- 
    like distant wind chimes.

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home?

                                TROY
                  Where do you live?

                                CONSTANCE
                  4636 Breckenridge.

    Troy accelerates.  Surreptitiously, he wipes the Harry Potter 
     lightning  birthmark from his forehead; he doesn t want to 
    look like a geek.  Then, trying to make conversation--                                                                                  18.



                                TROY
                  It s cold.  You must be freezing.

  She doesn t respond.  Only gazes out her window.  Sweetly 
    pathetic, Troy probes further--

                                TROY
                  So breakdown, huh?  Scary.  I bet 
                  your, uh, boyfriend s worried... 

    Still no response.  It s disquieting.  

    EXT. OLD HOUSE - NIGHT - FEW MINUTES LATER

    Troy s Toyota pulls off the road, onto a dirt driveway.

    INT. TOYOTA - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

                                TROY
                        (looking off screen)
                  You don t live here.

  THE HOUSE.  Abandoned.  Rotting.  A decayed husk.  

    Constance gazes at the house.  With melancholy--

                                CONSTANCE
                  I can never go home.

  In ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT, Troy turns from her, glancing at the 
    house again--

                                TROY
                  So where do you really live?

    --and when he turns back, she s GONE.  VANISHED completely.  
  At first, Troy s startled.  But then his rational mind takes 
    over.  He steps out of the car.  

    HOLD ON the passenger side window.  As a FAINT HANDPRINT 
    MATERIALIZES onto the glass.  Seemingly from nowhere...

    EXT. OLD HOUSE - NIGHT 

                                TROY
                  That was good.  But joke s over, 
                  okay?  

    Then Troy squints.  Noticing something.  Through the front 
    doorway (lacking a door), Troy glimpses-- a corner of 
    Constance s fluttering dress.  Then it s gone.                                                                                  19.



                                TROY
                  Come on.  I can see you in there.

  No response.  Troy SIGHS, frustrated.  Steps toward the 
    house.  Moving closer.  Closer.  

                                TROY
                  You want me to leave you?

  He steps onto the porch.  No sound but the groaning wood, the 
    whispering wind.  Finally, he enters the house, revealing...

    INT. OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

    Troy was mistaken; it wasn t her dress.  It s a tattered, 
    billowing CURTAIN.  Constance isn t inside this house.  
    Nobody is... nothing here but jagged, dim shadows.  

                                TROY
                  ...hello...?

    Troy can t help it.  He s spooked. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    EXT. OLD HOUSE - NIGHT 

    Troy punches the gas.  The car tears onto the road.  

    INT. TOYOTA - MOVING - NIGHT

    Troy.  Agitated.  He takes a deep, deep breath.  Shakes his 
    head.  He s being silly.  As we PULL BACK.  REVEALING--

    CONSTANCE.  Sitting, mute, in the darkness of the back seat.  
  He doesn t notice her.  

    ANGLE ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR

    Finally, Troy glances into the mirror.  Eyes widen.  GASPS--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.

                                      ACT TWO

    EXT. I-5 FREEWAY - DAWN

    BLUR of RUSHING ASPHALT, as we ROCKET down the Interstate.

  CUE MUSIC.  And you can take your anemic alternative pop and 
    shove it up your ass.  We re playing Dean s music-- 
    adrenaline pumping METAL-- and we re playing it loud.

  The Impala.  Pouncing down the I-5 like a panther.  The 
    engine THUNDERS.  The exhaust belches oily, black smoke.  
    Defiantly un-P.C.  

    INT. IMPALA - MOVING - I-5 FREEWAY - DAWN

    Open window.  Wind.  Loud music.  Dean grins.  Enjoying the 
    simple, visceral pleasures of movement.  Sam rides shotgun.  
    Filing through a messy cardboard box of CASSETTE TAPES.  He 
    glances up, noticing--

  ON THE DASH.  Several rows of sturdy SWITCHES.  (Nothing too 
    fancy; they look like Dean installed them.)

                                SAM
                  See you made a few modifications.

    Dean turns down the BLASTING music.

                                DEAN
                  What?

                                SAM
                  I see you made a few modifications.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  Couple tricks.  Couple 
                  treats.

                                SAM
                        (returning to the box)
                  I swear, man.  You gotta update 
                  your cassette tape collection.

                                DEAN
                  What s wrong with  em?

                                SAM
                  Well, for one, they re cassette 
                  tapes.  And two--
                        (reading labels)
                  Black Sabbath.  Motorhead.  
                  Metallica.  It s the Greatest Hits 
                  of Mullet Rock.                                                                                    21.



                                DEAN
                  Maybe I should put on some  Spin 
                  Doctors.   

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  I was eleven.  You re never gonna 
                  let me live that down, are you?

                                DEAN
                  Hey, you bought the album, Little 
                  Miss Can t Be Wrong.

                                SAM
                  Well, how  bout the radio?  Maybe 
                  there s something from this 
                  century.

                                DEAN
                  House rules, Sammy.  Driver picks 
                  music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.  

                                SAM
                  You know.   Sammy  is a chubby 12 
                  year old.  I m Sam, okay?

                                DEAN
                        (turns music WAY UP)
                  What?  Music s too loud.

    EXT. I-5 FREEWAY - DAWN

  The muscle car accelerates, ROARING off into the rising sun.

    EXT. SANGER, CALIFORNIA - MORNING

    A SIGN:  Welcome to Sanger, California, U.S.A.  America s 
    Christmas Tree City.   But below, taped to the SIGNPOST-- 
    MISSING POSTERS.  Four different faces stare out from 
    oblivion.  Haunting.  

  The Impala motors down Main Street.  Past red-brick 
    storefronts (many of them closed, or boarded up).  A white 
    church.  And everywhere-- MISSING POSTERS.  There s a vaguely 
    ominous, almost otherworldly feeling here.  A pall has fallen 
    over this small town like a shroud.  

    INT. IMPALA - MOVING - SANGER, CALIFORNIA - MORNING 

                                SAM
                      (on his cell)
                  ...okay, thank you.
                        (clicks it shut)
                                (MORE)                                                                                  22.

                                SAM (CONT'D)
                  So that s it.  Sanger Hospital, the 
                  morgue, every listed hotel and 
                  motel.  About every bar, too--

    Dean shoots Sam a harsh look at that last one.

                                SAM
                  No one even close to fitting Dad s 
                  description.  So what do you think?

  The car slows at the only stoplight.  The boys see-- a WOMAN, 
    LITTLE GIRL in hand.  Taping up a fresh batch of missing 
    posters, emblazoned with her husband s photo.  The LITTLE 
    GIRL stares at Sam and Dean.  It s unsettling.

                                DEAN
                  I think if we wanna find Dad, we 
                  gotta find out what the hell s 
                  happening around here.

    EXT. COUNTY SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - DAY

    A small, modest brick structure.  Currently, the lot is 
    OVERWHELMED with news trucks, REPORTERS, FBI Sedans, etc.  
  The Impala parks beside the circus.

    INT. IMPALA - SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - DAY

  As Dean shuffles through a THICK STACK of I.D. cards--

                                SAM
                  No.  Forget it.  We can t.

                                DEAN
                  Why not?

                                SAM
                  Well, mostly because impersonating 
                  a Federal agent is illegal.  

                                DEAN
                  And...?

                                SAM
                  Hello?  Trying to be a lawyer here.

                                DEAN
                  Would you chill?  You ve gotten 
                  very type-A, this past year...

    Dean picks the correct I.D. card.  Grins.

                                DEAN
                  Here it is.                                                                                  23.



    INT. COUNTY SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - BULLPEN - DAY

    CLOSE ON THE I.D.  Now in a slim leather wallet.  As a 
    forgery, it s flawless.  Dean s photo, beneath the SILVER 
    STAR SEAL of the United States Marshals Service.

    DEPUTY JAFFE, 40, mostly harmless, holds it.  He looks over 
    these two young men in their street clothes.  Sam hangs back, 
    tense and tight-lipped. 

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  ...aren t you two a little young 
                  for Federal Marshals?

                                DEAN
                  Deputy Marshals, actually, and 
                  thanks, that s kind of you to say.

    Meanwhile, the inside of the department is just as chaotic as 
  the outside.  Crowded with tired, overworked staff.  

    INSIDE A GLASS OFFICE.  SHERIFF PIERCE, 50 s, severe and 
    strict-looking, converses with two dark-suited FBI AGENTS.

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Well, take a number, boys.  FBI s 
                  already muscling for rank.  You can 
                  talk to Sheriff Pierce when he s 
                  done with  em, but it ll be a few 
                  hours at least.

                                DEAN
                  Few hours?  Look, our boss wants a 
                  status report, and he wants it 
                  yesterday.  How  bout you just give 
                  us a lay of the land?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  And what makes you think I got the 
                  time?

                                DEAN
                        (irritated)
                  Listen, Barney--

    When Sam intervenes.  Surprisingly collected--

                                SAM
                  Hey.  We re all Deputies here, and 
                  we re all under the gun.  So can 
                  you help us out?  Please, just a 
                  few minutes?  Then I promise, we ll 
                  blow right outta here.                                                                                  24.



  OFF Deputy Jaffe.  Considering--

    INT. SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

  Sam and Dean follow Deputy Jaffe into the room.  Dean is 
    reading from a clipboard.

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  ...so here s all the evidence we 
                  collected off Centennial Highway.  
                  And by that, I mean a whole lotta 
                  nothin .

  The EVIDENCE TABLE is covered in typical roadside debris-- 
    soda cans, crumpled fast food wrappers.  Sam looks it over.

                                DEAN
                  Any eyewitnesses?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Not at the time of disappearance.  
                  It s always the same.  Victims are 
                  last seen turning onto Centennial, 
                  or heading towards it.  But 
                  somewhere along that road... poof, 
                  they re gone.  And I mean gone, not 
                  even tire treads, it s... weird.

  Sam spots something amid the junk.  He lifts it with a pen.  
  An OLD SILVER NECKLACE, with a tarnished (and MEMORABLE) ROSE 
    PENDANT.  Discarded long ago.  Still, it seems out of place.

                                DEAN
                  So what s the popular theory?  

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  That it s some kinda stolen car 
                  ring.  We ve been shaking down chop 
                  shops.  

                                DEAN
                        (reading the clipboard)
                  Yeah, I see that.  Ford Taurus, 
                  Mercury Topaz, Honda Civic.  These 
                  are hot rides.  

                                SAM
                  All four victims were male?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Five victims, and yes.

  Sam and Dean both stop.  Look up.                                                                                  25.



                                SAM
                  There s been another?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Just last night.

                                DEAN
                        (with some worry)
                  Middle-aged man?

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                        (with a tinge)
                  High school kid.  Name s Troy 
                  Squire.  He was coming home from a 
                  Halloween party. 

                                SAM
                  You know him.

                                DEPUTY JAFFE
                  Everybody knows everybody here.  
                  Dog dying s a city-wide tragedy.  
                  So... five people missing...

  Sam looks at the Deputy with sympathy.  

    INT. SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT - BULLPEN - DAY

  Sam and Dean head for the front entrance.  When they pass 
    Sheriff Pierce and the two FBI Agents.

                                SHERIFF PIERCE
                        (brusque; suspicious)
                  Can I help you with something?

                                DEAN
                  No, sir, we were just leaving.
                        (nodding to the FBI)
                  Agent Mulder.  Agent Scully.

  As the boys walk on--

                                SAM
                  So... no eyewitnesses...

                                DEAN
                  No.  But, we put our ears to the 
                  ground, we ll probably pick up some 
                  whisper or rumor about this thing.  
                  And you know the best place for 
                  that--                                                                                  26.



    EXT. SANGER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

    Home of the Fighting Cougars.  On the detachable-letter SIGN: 
  WE MISS YOU, TROY.  

    INT. SANGER HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

    A LIBRARIAN pokes her head into an aisle.  Glowering at Dean 
  and Sam.  Dean pulls a 2004 Sanger Yearbook from the shelf.  
    Looks up  Troy Squire  in the index.  Turns to a photo--

    A candid of Troy.  Carefree smile.  Arms around two friends, 
    BILL COAKLEY and AMY BROWN.  

                                DEAN (PRE-LAP)
                  You must be Amy.  And Bill.

    EXT. SANGER HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

    Dean stands before AMY and BILL, both 17.  They lean against 
    Bill s car, smoking.  Few FRIENDS loiter around, too.  

                                DEAN
                  Troy told us all about you.  We re 
                  his uncles. I m Dean, that s Sammy.

  Sam does a slow burn.  He hates being called Sammy.

                                AMY
                  We re so sorry.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  Thanks.

                                SAM
                  So... we re kinda asking around, as 
                  a favor to Troy s Mom.  Was he 
                  acting... weird to you at all?

                                AMY
                  What do you mean?

                                SAM
                  I mean... at the party, before he 
                  left?  Did he say anything strange?  
                  Maybe he was nervous... scared 
                  about something?  

                                BILL
                        (irritated)
                  What, you think he was driving 
                  high?                                                                                    27.



                                DEAN
                        (stepping in)
                  No, we think the cops got their 
                  heads up their ass.  I mean, a 
                  carjacking?  Gimme a break.  But 
                  something happened out there.  So 
                  if you guys know anything at all... 

  Amy and RACHEL, 17, exchange looks.  Dean catches this--

                                DEAN
                  What?

                                BILL
                        (also spots their looks)
                  Guys.  Please.  It s just a story. 

                                DEAN
                  What story?
                        (the girls are hesitant)
                  It s okay.  We wanna know.  

                                RACHEL
                  ...there was this girl, she got 
                  murdered, hitchhiking on 
                  Centennial.  Supposedly, she s 
                  still out there, still hitchhiking.  
                  And whoever picks her up... well, 
                  they just... disappear...

    Teasing, ghostly OOHS from Bill.

                                RACHEL
                  Hey, my Aunt saw her once, okay?

                                BILL
                  Then why didn t she disappear...?  

  The students CHATTER-- some teasing, others defending the 
    story.  As Sam and Dean exchange silent looks.

    EXT. SANGER HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER

    Heading back to the Impala--

                                SAM
                  I don t know.  Hitchhiking girl, 
                  pretty classic urban legend.  Gotta 
                  be a hundred different versions of 
                  that same story.                                                                                    28.



                                DEAN
                        (shrugs)
                  Stories have to spring from 
                  somewhere... sometimes they spring 
                  from the truth.  God, remember that 
                  whole Bloody Mary, mirror thing?  
                  That was supposed to be an urban 
                  legend, too...

                                SAM
                  Yeah.  I guess you re right.

                                DEAN
                  We ll at least scope out the girls  
                  story, see what shakes loose.
                        (they reach the car)
                  Hey.  So those girls-- how old do 
                  you think they were?

                                SAM
                  Not old enough.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.  You re right.

  Sam climbs into the car--

                                SAM
                  Get in the car, Dean.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah.

    Dean climbs in after.

    EXT. SANGER PUBLIC LIBRARY - AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING

  The wind rattles the dead leaves.  

    INT. SANGER PUBLIC LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

    A COMPUTER SCREEN.  A website-- The Sanger Herald.  Words are 
    typed into a keyword search field.   Murder.  Centennial 
    Highway.   The response:  No Articles Found. 

    Dean.  At the computer.  Lit, ghostly, by the phosphorescent 
    screen.  Sam stands behind him.  Dean tries again.  This 
    time:  Murder.  Hitchhiking.   No Articles Found.

                                SAM
                  Let me try.                                                                                  29.



                                DEAN
                  I got it.  

    Dean tries again.   Death.  Hitchhiking.   No Articles Found.  

                                SAM
                  Really.  It s like watching a 
                  monkey type--

    Annoyed, Dean slides back, offering the chair.

                                DEAN
                  Fine.  Be my guest, control freak.

  Sam takes his place.  Thinking.  Beat.  Then... Sam 
    highlights the word  Death,  changes it to  Missing.   (So it 
  now reads:  Missing.  Hitchhiking. )  

  And an ARTICLE APPEARS.  SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING GIRL.   

  Sam smirks, gloating, at an unamused Dean.

                                DEAN
                  So you re a net jockey.  Congrats.   

                                SAM
                   ...Constance Weld, last seen by 
                  passing motorists, hitchhiking on 
                  Centennial Highway, at mile marker 
                  33..   This was about 10 years ago.

  ON THE SCREEN--  A PHOTO.  CONSTANCE.  We recognize her-- 
    it s the girl in Troy Squire s car.  Beside her, a smiling, 
    heavy set WOMAN.  We see a fragment of caption:  ...seen here 
    with mother Marjorie Brunson... 

  Sam taps in a new keyword search.   Constance Weld.   

  And a SERIES of ARTICLES come up.  Sam clicks through them, 
    rapidly, one after another.  The headlines tell the story--

    MOTHER PLEADS FOR DAUGHTER S SAFE RETURN. 
    CANDLELIGHT VIGIL HELD.
    SEARCH ENTERS 6th MONTH. 
    Until, finally-- MULTIPLE REMAINS FOUND.  

  Sam holds on this one.  A photo accompanies the article-- a 
    wretched looking MAN.  JOSEPH BURROUGHS.  Reading--  

                                SAM
                  Jesus.  They finally found her in 
                  this guy Burrough s trailer.  And 
                  six bodies in the backyard.                                                                                  30.



    When something occurs to Sam.  Dean notices his expression--

                                DEAN
                  What is it?  

    Then... Sam clicks back a few articles.  To the CANDLELIGHT 
    VIGIL story.  There s a school portrait of Constance here.  
    She s wearing the ROSE PENDANT NECKLACE.  

                                SAM
                  I knew I saw that necklace before.  
                  It was at the police station...

                                DEAN
                        (leans in)
                  Where d it say she was hitchhiking 
                  again?

    EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

    MILE MARKER 33.  The post quivers in the stiff wind.

  The two-lane cuts between an ocean of DARK, ENDLESS CORN 
    FIELDS.  The road is abandoned-- except for the Impala.  
    Parked on the shoulder, across from the mile marker.

    INT. IMPALA - CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

  Sam and Dean sit.  Radio playing softly.  Their version of a 
    stake-out.

                                SAM
                  ...so what do we do if Casper shows 
                  up?  We can t exactly shoot it in 
                  the face.

                                DEAN
                  We don t do anything.  We hang 
                  back, watch and learn.  You know 
                  the drill.  First, we figure out 
                  what we re dealing with--

                                SAM
                  --then we figure out how to kill 
                  it, I know.  
                        (then)
                  You know, sometimes you sound so 
                  much like Dad, it s creepy.

                                DEAN
                  I take that as a compliment.  

    Long beat.  Sam s got something on his mind--                                                                                  31.



                                SAM
                  So.  Um.  How s he been, anyway?

                                DEAN
                  Okay.  You know.  He s Dad.

                                SAM
                  Is he... still pissed?

                                DEAN
                  You know.  He s Dad.  He s a 
                  stubborn bastard and you--

                                SAM
                  What?

                                DEAN
                  ...you hurt him pretty bad...

    Sam, defensive, frustrated, feels the sting of old wounds.

                                SAM
                I hurt...?  He threw me out--   

                                DEAN
                  I don t wanna talk about it--

                                SAM
                  All I did, was tell him I was going 
                  to law school--

                                DEAN
                  That s not all you did--

                                SAM
                  Know what normal Dads are when they 
                  hear that?  Proud.  But him?
                        (affecting a stern voice)
                   You wasted enough time at college 
                  already, boy.  Time to come home 
                  and join the business. 

                                DEAN
                  You told him you hated him...

                                SAM
                  After he called me a coward.  Dean.  
                  He said if I was gonna go, I should 
                  stay gone.  And I hurt him?                                                                                    32.



                                DEAN
                  You know what you said!  You said 
                  his whole life, the whole reason he 
                  did what he did, was pointless-- 

  Sam grows quiet at Dean s flash of anger... 

                                DEAN
                  You remember that?  That no matter 
                  how many things we hunted, we d 
                  never find the thing that killed 
                  Mom!  No matter how many people we 
                  saved, Mom was dead and we were 
                  never gonna bring her back!  

                                SAM
                  ...I remember...

                                DEAN
                        (quiets now, too)
                  That s what did it, you know.  He 
                  was so angry... we both were.  
                  Mostly, cause we knew it was true.

                                SAM
                        (with intense regret)
                  I m sorry.  I wish I could take it 
                  back.  You have no idea...
                        (then)
                  But you gotta understand-- I... 
                  just had to get outta there.  For 
                  once, I wanted to be...

                                DEAN
                  Normal?  Cause... you re pretty 
                  much a freak.

                                SAM
                  Not normal.  Happy.  You know.  
                  Just... have friends.  I think I 
                  wanna marry Jess-- I mean, not now, 
                  but one day.  Raise kids-- kids who 
                  won t be terrified all the time.

    Dean takes this in.  Sentimental beat.  But then, abruptly--

                                DEAN
                  What a total load of crap--

                                SAM
                  Wow.  Thanks.                                                                                  33.



                                DEAN
                  I mean, pretending to be all fuzzy 
                  and safe, when you know nobody is, 
                  not with what s out there.  But 
                  you d rather jam your head in the 
                  sand?  Be some ulcered-up lawyer?

                                SAM
                  It s not that simple...

    Meanwhile-- the RADIO.  Playing softly throughout.  Now 
    decomposes into STATIC.  OUTSIDE, the wind picks up.  The 
    guys don t notice.

                                DEAN
                  Yeah, it is.  Can t run forever, 
                  Sammy.  Sooner or later, you gotta 
                  face up to who you are--

                                SAM
                  Yeah?  And who s that?

                                DEAN
                  You re one of us.  We may put the 
                  fun in dysfunctional, but we re the 
                  only family you got.  And this 
                  stuff is in your blood.  

  Sam contemplates this.  A long beat.  Then, mock solemn--

                                SAM
                  Thank you, Obi Wan.

                                DEAN
                  Bite me.  I swear, man--

    When Dean suddenly stops.  He leans forward, hunching over 
  the wheel.  Squinting into the black night.

                                SAM
                  ...what?

    Abruptly, Dean flips the HEADLIGHTS, ILLUMINATING-- A PALE 
    FORM.  CONSTANCE.  Scuttling between the CORN STALKS.  We 
    barely catch a glimpse before she vanishes again.

                                DEAN
                  Come on!  

    Dean LEAPS out of the car.  Plunges into the field.                                                                                  34.



                                SAM
                  Wait!  I thought we were hanging 
                  back--
                        (Dean s already gone)
                  Dammit.

  And Sam scrambles after his brother.

    EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT

  We INTERCUT between the brothers.  As Dean SPRINTS, hard and 
    fast, deep into the cornfield, stalks WHIZZING past.  As Sam 
    chases, trying (and failing) to catch up.

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH DEAN - NIGHT

    Until Dean slows.  Panting.  Catching his breath.  He looks 
  up, realizing-- he s alone.  Lost in the middle of a mangled, 
    foreboding maze of corn.  The stalks obscure everything; he 
    can t see more than a foot or so in front of him.

                                SAM (O.S.)
                  Dean?!

                                DEAN
                  Over here!

                                                                INTERCUT WITH:

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH SAM - NIGHT

    Sam.  Alone.  Panting.  Also realizing he s totally screwed.

                                DEAN
                  This wasn t such a hot idea.

                                SAM
                  You think?  

                                DEAN
                  Well, maybe if you could keep up--

                                SAM
                  Just keep calling out, okay?  I ll 
                  come to you.  

                                DEAN (O.S.)
                  Marco!

  Sam rolls his eyes.  Begins hacking his way through the corn.                                                                                  35.



    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH DEAN - NIGHT

    When... over Dean s shoulder... a white FIGURE BOLTS between 
  the corn.  Dean SPINS.  Nobody there.

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH SAM - NIGHT

                                SAM
                  Dean...?

  No answer.  Only the wind WHISTLING through the field.

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH DEAN - NIGHT

    Dean.  Vigilant.  Eyes everywhere at once.  She s close; he 
  can feel it.  Where is she?  When is she going to lunge out?    

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH SAM - NIGHT

                                SAM
                  Dean?!

    When, out of the corner of Sam s eye-- Constance DARTS 
    between the stalks!  He pivots.  Nothing. 

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH DEAN - NIGHT

    Dean moves, slow and cautious.  Long, languid, suspense-beat.  
    Then he turns... and suddenly spots something O.S.  Something 
    horrifying, judging by his expression.

    EXT. CORNFIELD - WITH SAM - NIGHT

                                DEAN (O.S.)
                        (with great alarm)
                  Sam!  Sam!

  Sam takes off like a shot.  Scrambling to his brother, with 
    urgency.  Stalks scratching his face and arms.  Sprinting.

    Until he slows... because he spots... 

    Materializing from the corn stalks... a CAR GRILL.  In fact, 
  an ENTIRE TOYOTA, sitting incongruously in the middle of the 
    field.  Troy Squire s Toyota.

  Sam steps closer.  Flinches, as he notices--

    ANGLE INSIDE TOYOTA.  We re looking out at Sam, through the 
    windshield.  There s a FIGURE slumped behind the wheel, out 
  of focus in the foreground.  But we can tell the figure is 
    mutilated.  Wet with crimson.                                                                                    36.



    SAM.  Upset.  Disturbed.  When a HAND CLUTCHES his shoulder!  
  Sam shouts, whirls-- it s Dean.  Wearing a grim visage.

                                DEAN
                  They re all here.  All the victims.  
                        (beat)
                  But not Dad.

    EXT. CORNFIELD - CRANE SHOT - NIGHT

  In a wide OVERHEAD SHOT, we see-- Sam and Dean.  

  And FIVE CARS, sitting in the cornfield.  Perfectly arranged, 
    like the spokes of a wheel--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.


                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                  37.


                                    ACT THREE

    EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

    A garish, 50 s style NEON SIGN-- THE STAGECOACH INN.  A 
    single-story, cinderblock motel.  

    INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

  Sam sits on one of the beds, studying a puzzle of NEWSPAPER 
    CLIPPINGS spread before him.  When his CELL PHONE CHIRPS.  

  On the cell phone display screen-- JESSICA CALLING.  
    ANSWER... or IGNORE.  

  Sam wants to pick up.  But what the hell s he gonna say?  He 
    punches IGNORE.  Then, Dean enters--

                                SAM
                  You call 911?

                                DEAN
                  Yep.

                                SAM
                        (rolls his eyes)
                  You tell  em your name was Ted 
                  Nugent?  

                                DEAN
                  You know I did.
                        (then)
                  What ve you got there?

                                SAM
                  Bad news.  I ve been looking at the 
                  dates of the disappearances.  First 
                  one was a Wednesday.  Then the 
                  following Tuesday.  Then a Sunday.  
                  Goes on like this.

                                DEAN
                  I don t follow.

                                SAM
                  It s a pattern.  The days between 
                  victims.  5 days.  Then 4, 3, 2.  
                  Next is one.  It ll be tonight.

    Meanwhile, Dean is scooping up his keys and wallet, pulling 
  on his jacket, etc.  Not really listening.

                                DEAN
                  Nice work there, Matlock.                                                                                  38.



                                SAM
                  Um.  What are you doing?

                                DEAN
                  I m packing up my toothbrush, 
                  what s it look like?  

                                SAM
                  Wait, you wanna take off?

                                DEAN
                  Get on the ball, son.  Our grumpy 
                  little hitcher s stowing her 
                  victims in the cornfield.  Dad, 
                  Dad s pick-up-- not in the 
                  cornfield.  So sing along with me--

                                SAM
                        (dry)
                  He s probably not one of her 
                  victims, I know.

                                DEAN
                  He s probably not even in Sanger.  
                  Who knows if he ever came, in the 
                  first place?  Anyway, doesn t 
                  matter, we ll find him.

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  We re not leaving.  Not until we 
                  deal with Constance.

                                DEAN
                  What?  Sammy.  We don t have time.  
                  We got more pressing matters here.

                                SAM
                  We ll make the time.

                                DEAN
                  Where s this coming from?  I 
                  thought you d wanna ditch.     

                                SAM
                  I do, believe me.  But people are 
                  getting hurt...

                                DEAN
                  You know, last couple of years, a 
                  lot of people were getting hurt, 
                  and where the hell were you?                                                                                    39.



                                SAM
                        (simply)
                  Well.  I m here.  Now.  And I m not 
                  gonna walk away, and let more 
                  people die.  So I m hunting this 
                  thing.  With or without you.

                                DEAN
                  You re a stubborn bastard.

                                SAM
                  Runs in the family, I guess.  
                        (then)
                  Dean... he d want us to stay.  
                  Hell.  Think of what he d do to us 
                  if we left.

    A long beat.  Dean thinks.  Then, he SIGHS--  

                                DEAN
                  Do to us?  Man, you know I d blame 
                  everything on you.
                        (Sam smiles)
                  So... what are you thinking?  

                                SAM
                  Well... just to mix things up a 
                  bit, I was thinking this time, we 
                  should actually have a plan.  

                                DEAN
                  And what s that, smart ass?  

    EXT. MARJORIE BRUNSON S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY  

    MARJORIE BRUNSON, 50 s, is a hardscrabble woman; her life 
    hasn t been easy.  She stands with Sam and Dean, as she hangs 
    BEDSHEETS on a clothesline, billowing in the stiff breeze. 

                                MARJORIE
                  ...Constance, she was shy.  Kind.  
                  But sad-- I think that s what I 
                  remember most.  Ever since the day 
                  she moved in.

                                SAM
                  I m sorry.  Moved in?

                                MARJORIE
                  Well, yes.  I adopted her.
                        (disapproving)
                                (MORE)                                                                                  40.

                                MARJORIE (CONT'D)
                  Young man, I ve had reporters 
                  around before.  Most of  em get 
                  their facts straight.  

                                DEAN
                  I apologize, ma am.  He s just a 
                  cub reporter, pretty green. 
                        (Sam shoots a dirty look)
                  So Constance was an orphan?

                                MARJORIE
                  Not at first.  Her parents, good 
                  people, they died in a car 
                  accident.  Constance was 11 at the 
                  time, poor thing. 
                        (beat)
                  ...I use her room for storage now.  
                  But I can show you boys a few 
                  things.  Come on. 

  Sam and Dean follow Marjorie into the house.  We HOLD ON the 
    backyard, on the clothesline-- as the BEDSHEET seems to take 
  on a WHIRLING FORM.  A silhouette.  Of a WOMAN.  Then, just 
  as quickly, it s gone.

    INT. CONSTANCE S OLD BEDROOM - DAY

    A HIGH SCHOOL PORTRAIT of CONSTANCE.  Enigmatic expression.

  Sam holds the photo.  Lifting it from a cardboard crate of 
    teenage-girl belongings.

    Meanwhile, Dean stands with Marjorie, amidst the room s 
    stacked boxes and sheet-covered furniture.  This is difficult 
  for Marjorie to discuss--

                                MARJORIE
                  When she got a little older, she 
                  started acting out.  Drinking, God 
                  knows what else.  But even then, 
                  you could see this... hurt in her 
                  eyes.  But she kept it to herself.  
                  Like a secret.

  Now Sam digs a DIARY from the crate.  Inside, the usual 
    girlish bubble-cursive.  But also... a phrase, on almost 
    every page, often multiple times:  I can never go home.   

  Sam looks up.  Thinking.  What does that mean?                                                                                   41.



                                MARJORIE 
                  Then... that day in June.  She was 
                  hitchhiking-- which I always begged 
                  her not to do-- and that was it.  I 
                  never saw her again.

                                DEAN
                  Joseph Burroughs, he picked her up?    

                                MARJORIE
                  Police say he kept her locked up in 
                  his trailer, outside of town.  
                  Almost a year, before he shot her.  
                  And they didn t even fry the 
                  sonofabitch, he s up at Folsom.  
                  Put that in your article. 

                                DEAN
                  Which cemetery is Constance buried 
                  at? 

                                MARJORIE
                  Well.  Her headstone s at Hughes 
                  Creek.  But she s not buried 
                  anywhere.  Least, nowhere I know.

                                SAM
                        (reacting to this)
                  I thought they found her.

                                MARJORIE
                        (pained)
                  Some of her.

                                DEAN
                  Ms. Brunson.  This is important.  
                  What, exactly, did they find?  

    EXT. MARJORIE BRUNSON S HOUSE - OUT FRONT - DAY

  Sam and Dean walk down the sidewalk... a parade of small 
    town, all-American homes.  Moving to the Impala--

                                SAM
                  ...if all they found were blood and 
                  skull fragments, that means her 
                  corpse might still be out there--

                                DEAN
                  And if her body s not at rest,  
                  then neither is she--                                                                                    42.



                                SAM
                  So that s it.  We find the remains.  
                  Give  em a proper burial.

                                DEAN
                  Actually, I was thinking more  burn 
                   em into dust,  but yeah, we had a 
                  good groove going up until then.

                                SAM
                  So how do we find them?  

                                DEAN
                  From the one guy who knows.

                                SAM
                  Joseph Burroughs?  You want us to 
                  stroll into prison and have a 
                  little chat?   

                                DEAN
                  No.  I want you to.
                        (Sam stops)
                  What?  You re the lawyer... geek.  

                                SAM
                  Dean.  It s impossible.  

                                DEAN
                  Folsom s over 200 miles away.  We d 
                  never make it there and back before 
                  nightfall.  You gotta go, make him 
                  tell you where she s planted.  Then 
                  call me, I ll be here waiting.
                        (beat)
                  You re not scared of a tiny wittle 
                  serial killer, are you?  

                                SAM
                  No, I mean, it s impossible.  You 
                  can t walk into a prison without 72 
                  hour notice and visit anyone, much 
                  less a serial killer.  

                                DEAN
                  Fine.  I ll go.  And you can dig up 
                  the corpse.  

                                SAM
                        (stops; looks at Dean)
                  ...I ll figure something out...                                                                                  43.



                                DEAN
                  Quid pro quo, Clarice.

                                SAM
                  Shut up.  

                                DEAN
                  Come on.  You re gonna need wheels.  
                  Let s go hot-wire you some.

                                SAM
                  No.  You re not stealing me a car.  

                                DEAN
                  What do you wanna do?  Rent one?

    EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - DAY

  Sam putters up to Folsom, in a rented GEO.  Not nearly as bad-
  ass as the Impala.  

    INT. SAM S RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY

    Sam, on his cell phone.  Looks like he s having a root canal.

                                SAM
                  ...Judge Carlton, hi, it s Sam 
                  Harrison.  Yes, sir, I do know I ve 
                  been missing some work.  I had kind 
                  of a family emergency.  Sir, I was 
                  hoping I could ask you for a favor.
                        (wincing)
                  Yes, sir, I know... yes, very thin 
                  ice...

    EXT. FOLSOM STATE PENITENTIARY - AFTERNOON  

    Sam s GEO pulls up to Folsom s main gate-- a single gap 
    between formidable stone walls.  

    Sam.  Staring up at the prison.  The place is a fortress, a 
    medieval castle.  OVER the next few shots, we HEAR--

                                FOLSOM OFFICER (V.O.)
                  ...I just spoke to your Judge 
                  Carlton.  This is a hell of an 
                  exception we re making.

                                SAM (V.O.)
                  I appreciate that.                                                                                   44.



    INT. FOLSOM STATE PENITENTIARY - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 

    Sam.  Getting patted down at the Registration Station.  
    Dumping the contents of his pockets into plastic trays.  
    Walking through a series of BARRED DOORS, that open and CLANK 
    shut, as he passes through.  OVER which--

                                FOLSOM OFFICER (V.O.)
                  You will not be allowed personal 
                  items in the visiting area.  You 
                  are not to give anything to, or 
                  receive anything from, the inmate.  
                  You are to maintain a safe distance 
                  from the inmate at all times.  You 
                  understand?  

    INT. VISITING ROOM - AFTERNOON

  Sam sits at a mounted steel table.  When JOSEPH BURROUGHS, 
  40, enters the room.  Bland face, glasses; the  quiet 
    neighbor  type.  He s cuffed.  GUARDS, stationed at the 
    walls, keep a close eye, as Burroughs sits. 

                                SAM
                  Thank you for seeing me.

                                BURROUGHS
                  I don t get many visitors.  You a 
                  law student or something...?

                                SAM
                  I m writing a paper, I was hoping 
                  for some information.

                                BURROUGHS
                  About what?

                                SAM
                  Constance Weld.

    Burroughs TENSES.  His face hardens into granite.

                                SAM
                  I just need to know--

                                BURROUGHS
                  I m not talking about her. 

                                SAM
                  I need to know where she s buried.                                                                                   45.



                                BURROUGHS
                        (through gritted teeth)
                  In a cemetery.  

                                SAM
                  No.  Where you buried her.

                                BURROUGHS
                  We re finished here.

    INT. MOTEL ROOM - SANGER - LATE AFTERNOON

  The motel phone.  Dean waits for it to ring.  He glances out 
  the window.  The sun is setting.  Portentous storm clouds 
    gather on the horizon.  Distant lightning.

                                DEAN
                  Come on, Sam.

    INT. VISITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                SAM
                  You have to tell me--

                                BURROUGHS
                  Guard--

                                SAM
                  Someone s going to die tonight, if 
                  you don t tell me...

                                BURROUGHS
                        (stops; a beat)
                  What?

                                SAM
                  Constance.  She s out there.  
                  Killing people.   

                                BURROUGHS
                        (waving off the guard)
                  Sorry.  We re okay.
                      (to Sam)
                  Constance is dead.

                                SAM
                  Look, normally at this point, I d 
                  bust out my  truth is out there  
                  speech, but we really don t have 
                  time.  She s dead, yes-- and she s 
                  still hitchhiking.  Men are picking 
                  her up, and she s slashing them.                                                                                  46.



    Burroughs reacts to this-- but for now, he keeps his cards 
    close to his chest.

                                BURROUGHS
                  You re insane.

                                SAM
                  You re not the first person to say 
                  so.  I know how this sounds, I 
                  do... but if I can give you some 
                  proof, will you help me?   

                                BURROUGHS
                  And how you gonna do that?  

                                SAM
                        (beat)
                  Well.  For one.  I think I know 
                  what happened 10 years ago today.

                                BURROUGHS
                        (goes white as a sheet)
                  How...?  I never...

                                SAM
                  There s fewer and fewer days 
                  between her victims.  It s a 
                  pattern, a countdown.  To tonight.
                        (beat)
                  This was the night you murdered 
                  her, wasn t it?  

                                BURROUGHS
                  This is a sick joke.  Constance 
                  isn t killing people.  It s 
                  impossible.

                                SAM
                  Whether you believe me or not... 
                  she is.  Because of you.  Because 
                  of what you did to her.

  And Burroughs SHATTERS like GLASS--

                                BURROUGHS
                I stopped her.  She can t be doing 
                  it again.  Because I stopped her.  

                                SAM
                  ...what do you mean?                                                                                  47.



                                BURROUGHS
                  What difference does it make?  No 
                  one ever believes me anyway.

                                SAM
                  Tell me what you mean--

                                BURROUGHS
                  I loved Constance.

                                SAM
                  You kept her locked up--

                                BURROUGHS
                  No.  She lived with me, that s all.  
                  But she liked to hitchhike.  Guys 
                  would pick her up.  She d take the 
                  men to her parents  house, the old 
                  one. And she slashed their throats.    

                                SAM
                  Why would she do that...?  

                                BURROUGHS
                  When she was little, her parents 
                  beat her.  Forced her to fast.  So 
                  she could  atone for her sins.   
                  Until she stabbed  em both.  Put 
                   em in a car, drove it in a ditch, 
                  set it on fire.  She was 11 at the 
                  time. 
                        (then)
                  So when she grew up, she liked to 
                  cut her boyfriends in front of the 
                  house.  In front of Mommy and 
                  Daddy, you know, like  look at your 
                  little girl now.      

                                SAM
                  Why didn't you call the police?

                                BURROUGHS
                  ...wouldn t matter.  Even if they 
                  locked her up, she d just keep 
                  killing.  No matter what they did 
                  to her, she d find a way to keep 
                  killing.  No.  There was only one 
                  way to stop her.
                        (wretched)
                  But I did it.  I stopped her.

                                SAM
                  Where is she buried?                                                                                  48.



                                BURROUGHS
                  She was sleeping.  And I put a gun 
                  to her head.  God forgive me--

                                SAM
                  I need to know where she s buried--

    INT./EXT. IMPALA - MOVING - NIGHT 

  The storm has begun.  Lightning cleaves the night sky.  And 
  the Impala s engine sounds like the THUNDER.  It charges 
    through the pouring rain.

                                BURROUGHS (V.O.)
                  ...an oak tree... she s beneath an 
                  oak tree... off Breckenridge Road.

    Dean, driving.  Focused, determined.  Passing Constance s 
    ancient HOUSE, on his way to--

    EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 

    Black.  Then lightning-- which illuminates a COLOSSAL OAK 
    TREE.  The Impala, off-roading, parks beside it.  Dean leaps 
    out.  Pops the TRUNK.  From the stockpile of weaponry, Dean 
    finds a shovel and a crowbar.

    Then, using the Impala s hi-beams as worklights... Dean 
    begins to dig.

    EXT. FIELD - AN HOUR LATER - NIGHT 

    Three holes already shoveled.  No luck, not yet.  

    INSIDE THE FOURTH PIT.  Dean digs.  Muddy.  Soaking.  

  The wind RISES-- the oak s branches begin to shudder.  

    INSIDE THE IMPALA.  The RADIO CLICKS ON.  Hissing static.

    Still, Dean digs.  One man against the howling storm.  THUNK.  
  His shovel hits dull wood.  He clears mud away, revealing... 
    a glimpse of a decomposing PINE BOX.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

    OUTSIDE THE PIT.  The SHOVEL is tossed out, onto the grass.  
    Dean s arm emerges, snagging the CROWBAR.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

    INSIDE THE PIT.  Dean s excavated the entire top half of the 
    make-shift coffin.  He begins to PRY the lid.                                                                                      49.



  The wind.  The rain.  The radio static.  They re all building 
  to a crescendo--

    Dean STRAINS.  Finally, nails SNAP.  He grips the lid.  
    Steels himself.  And opens it.  Looking inside.  HORRIFIED.

                                DEAN
                  ...no...

  The box is EMPTY.  No corpse, no bones, NOTHING--

    INT./EXT. SAM S RENTAL CAR - NIGHT 

    Sam.  Driving back to Sanger.

    CONSTANCE appears in the headlights!  Sam drives right 
    THROUGH her--  

  He GASPS, brakes hard!  Spinning, wild, on the slick roads.  
  He barely manages to control the swerving car.  Thankfully, 
  it comes to a stop.   

    Sam.  Panting.  Catching his breath.  But he doesn t notice--

    Constance.  Now sitting in Sam s back seat. 

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home.  

  Sam looks up, icy with fear-- 

                                                                        BLACKOUT.


                                END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  50.


                                    ACT FOUR

    INT. SAM S RENTAL CAR - NIGHT 

    Sam, behind the wheel.  Constance, in the back.  No sound, 
    except the muffled patter of rain on steel.  No light, except 
  for the occasional flare of lightning.  Once again--

                                CONSTANCE
                  Take me home.

                                SAM
                  ...no...

  The doors LOCK, by themselves.  The RADIO clicks on, 
    squealing white noise.  The gas pedal depresses.

    EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

  And the car begins to drive, of its own accord.  Without 
    headlights.  Through the storming darkness.

    INT. SAM S RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

  The untouched steering wheel turns, correcting course.  

    Sam.  Breath coming in short bursts.  Mind racing.  Trying to 
    figure out a way to save his own life.  

    Constance.  Behind him.  Mute.  And there s something in her 
    expression.  Something malevolent.

    EXT. OLD HOUSE - NIGHT 

    Sam s rental pulls up the muddy dirt driveway.  Stops before 
  the decrepit house.  As if on cue, the ENGINE CUTS OUT.

    INT. SAM S RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                SAM
                  ...don t do this...

    Once again, Constance gazes at her house--

                                CONSTANCE
                  I can never go home.

  But Sam watches her in the rearview, as she says this.  And 
  he perceives something, that no one s noticed before...

                                SAM
                  ...you re scared.  You re scared to 
                  go home.                                                                                    51.



    Then... in ONE SHOT... Sam pivots from the rearview (where 
    Constance is still visible)... to look at her directly... 

  But she s VANISHED.  

    Frantic, Sam whirls for the car door.  Trying to unlock it, 
  but it s jammed.   He throws his shoulder into it-- no good.  
  He pounds on the glass, about to SMASH it with his elbow--

    Lightning.  And in the STROBING FLASH--

    Constance.  Now in the passenger seat, beside Sam.  (He s 
    turned toward his window, doesn t see her).  She s a rotting 
    WRAITH.  Mouth twisted into a rawboned rictus.  

  But it s only for a subliminal split second.  When the 
    lightning snuffs out-- she again DISAPPEARS.  Though now we 
    know... she s still inside the car.

    Suddenly, Sam JOLTS.  Shards of excruciating PAIN shoot 
    through his body.  He falls back in his seat.  And we see-- 
  his chest.  His shoulders.  His neck.  Everywhere, SLASHING 
    CLAW MARKS APPEAR (several ripping right through his shirt).

    Lightning-- and for a flash, there s Constance, straddling 
    Sam, savagely TEARING at him.  Then... the lightning 
    vanishes, and so does she. 

    Sam s hands.  Fumbling for the ignition.  Trying to turn the 
    engine.  But his hands are WRENCHED away, by invisible 
    forces.  CUTS criss-cross his wrists, his arms.  Sam 
    struggles, SHOUTS in agony.  He s a goner for sure... when--

    SMASH!  The driver s side window SHATTERS-- a hailstorm of 
    safety glass beads.  

    DEAN.  Standing outside the car.  Pointing a COLT SIX-SHOOTER 
  at the seemingly thin air in front of Sam.

                                DEAN
                  Let him go, you bitch.

    Dean FIRES!  And in the rapid succession of GUNFIRE FLARES-- 
    Constance is VISIBLE, as if in STROBING LIGHT.  

  She turns to Dean.  Unharmed, of course.  She grins at him, 
    vicious.  But she s let go of Sam.  And so--

                                SAM
                  ...I m taking you home...

  And Sam is now able to TURN the ignition.  He SLAMS the gas!                                                                                  52.



    EXT. OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

  And the rental car BURSTS forward.  SMASHING through the 
    termite-ridden wall of the old house.  ENTERING the house.

    INT. OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

  The car SNAPS a support beam, second story lumber RAINS down.

    INT. SAM S RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 

  Sam cracks his head, sharp, against the steering wheel, as 
  the car comes to an abrupt, dust-settling stop.

    INT. OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 

                                DEAN
                  Sam!  Sam!

    Dean scrambles through the newly-created opening, up to the 
    car.  It s wedged between a wall and a heavy fallen beam.  
    Inside the car, Sam is weak.  Forehead bleeding.  But alive.

                                SAM
                  I m okay.

                                DEAN
                        (extremely relieved)
                  Where is she?  

                                SAM
                  I don t know.

    Dean looks over the room.  The storm has abated, the wind has 
    died down, the radio s quiet.  All seems benign.

    Dean tries to open the car door.  No chance.  

                                DEAN
                  Can you move?
                        (Sam nods, yes)
                  Come on, I ll help you.

  Sam GROANS, pained and sore.  He begins to crawl through the 
    window.  Dean helping him.  When-- the wind.  It picks up.  
    Tattered curtains flutter.  The RADIO.  Clicks on.  Faint 
    music buried beneath static.

                                DEAN
                  Hurry. 

    Something SKITTERS just outside their field of vision.  Dean 
    spins, vigilant... but nothing s there.                                                                                  53.



    Quick as he can, Sam evacuates the car.  Dean gets him to his 
    feet.  Sam s arm around Dean s neck, they hobble for the 
    entrance, but it s slow going-- 

    Another SCUFFLING sound, this one over their shoulders.  They 
    both look back, scanning, cautious... and that s why they 
    don t see... IN FRONT OF THEM-- the CURTAINS (beside their 
    exit) BILLOW UP, unveiling--

    CONSTANCE.  Blocking the way.  Putrid.  Wrathful.  Her image 
    FLICKERS rapidly, appearing and disappearing.  

  Sam and Dean turn forward.  Spot her--  

  She DRIFTS towards the brothers, the tips of her yellowed 
    toes lightly scraping the floor planks.    

  Sam and Dean back away.  Dean FIRES his Colt again.  No use.

  She grows closer.  Closer.  Eyes aflame.  Suddenly--

    There s TWO FIGURES BEHIND HER!  A decayed MAN and WOMAN, 
    40 s, the fronts of their shirts BLOODY from STAB WOUNDS.  
    Constance s PARENTS.  

                                WHISPERED ON THE WIND
                  ...you ve come home...

    They seem to envelop her.  Merging with her.  There s a 
    horrible, otherworldly ANIMAL SHRIEKING-- and they ALL MELT 
    AWAY.  Gone completely.  Still.  Silence.

  Sam and Dean.  As they (and we) catch our collective breaths--

                                DEAN
                  ...hey.  Sam?  

                                SAM
                  Yeah? 

                                DEAN
                        (long solemn beat; then)
                  Good luck getting the deposit back 
                  on that rental.

    Dean cracks a smile.  Sam smiles back. 

    EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

    A SIGN.   You Are Leaving Sanger, California, U.S.A.  
    America s Christmas Tree City.  Come Again Soon! 

  The Impala BLOWS past it.                                                                                   54.



    INT. IMPALA - MOVING - NIGHT

  The brothers LAUGH.  Enjoying a rare moment of victory. 

                                DEAN
                  ...so how d you know that would 
                  work, anyway?  

                                SAM
                  What?

                                DEAN
                  Taking her home.

                                SAM
                  I didn t.  

                                DEAN
                  Wow.  Thoughtful plan.

                                SAM
                  Well, I can t believe you actually 
                  shot Casper in the face.  

                                DEAN
                  Hey, saved your ass--

    EXT. FREEWAY ON-RAMP - NIGHT

  The I-5 FREEWAY on-ramp.  North.  Dean cruises right past.

    INT. IMPALA - MOVING - NIGHT

                                SAM
                  Where are you going?

                                DEAN
                  East.  Figured we d check out the 
                  house next.

                                SAM
                  The house?

                                DEAN
                  Our house, Chachi.  Maybe there s 
                  something I missed.  Some bread 
                  crumb Dad left behind...

    When Dean glances at Sam, sees his expression.  Dean s smile 
    fades, as he puts it together.                                                                                  55.



                                DEAN
                  ...but you re not going East, are 
                  you?  You re going back to school.  

  Sam nods, a little sad and a little guilty.

                                SAM
                  ...I m sorry.  

                                DEAN
                        (after a beat)
                  I ll take you back.  

                                SAM
                  No, man, I can catch a--

                                DEAN
                  I ll take you back, Sam.  It s the 
                  least I can do.

    Dean SWINGS the car around.  Pulling a U-turn.

    EXT. I-5 FREEWAY - NIGHT - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

  The Impala heads back to Stanford.

    INT. IMPALA - I-5 FREEWAY - MOVING - NIGHT

    Clearly, Sam s conscience is getting the best of him--

                                SAM
                  ...look, I m gonna call the cops, 
                  the FBI, first thing.  File a 
                  Missing Persons.

                                DEAN
                  Good.  It s a good idea.

                                SAM
                  I mean, he could be anywhere.  We 
                  can t just cruise the whole 
                  country, hoping we bump into him. 
                  But I m gonna help, okay?  I m 
                  gonna do everything I can.

    Dean nods.  More silence.  Sam can t take it anymore.

                                SAM
                  You know.   Passive aggressive  
                  isn t really your gig--  

                                DEAN
                  What?  Did I say anything?                                                                                  56.



                                SAM
                  That s just the point.  If you re 
                  pissed, then be pissed. 

                                DEAN
                  I m not pissed.

                                SAM
                  Convincing delivery.

                                DEAN
                  Really.  I m serious.

                                SAM
                  Well, you re something.

                                DEAN
                  I m done.  Okay?

                                SAM
                  What s that supposed to mean?  Done 
                  with what?

                                DEAN
                  This.  These sparkling little 
                  arguments of ours.  Trying to drag 
                  you into something you just don t 
                  want any part of.  
                        (beat)
                  I can t ask you to throw everything 
                  away and hit the road.  To trade in 
                  your girl and your school for bad 
                  food and mangy motels--

                                SAM
                  Dean--

                                DEAN
                  So go live your life, Sam.  I mean 
                  it, be happy.  I m not gonna fight 
                  you.  I m tired, and...

                                SAM
                  And what?

                                DEAN
                  And I just don t care anymore...

                                SAM
                        (after a beat)
                  I think I d rather you were pissed.                                                                                  57.



                                DEAN
                  What do you want me to say?

  Sam doesn t answer.  The brothers ride in silence.  

    INT./EXT. IMPALA - STANFORD UNIVERSITY - LATE NIGHT 

  The Impala motors past libraries.  Classrooms.  The various 
    signs and landmarks of the august university.  Sam watches 
  the familiar scenery pass.  Clouded with doubt.  Is he doing 
  the right thing?

    EXT. SAM S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 

  The Impala parks before Sam s apartment, engine idling.  Sam 
    climbs out.  Snags his bags from the back.  Then--

                                SAM
                  You ll call me if there s any news? 
                        (Dean nods, yes)
                  ...I ll see you soon, okay?

                                DEAN
                  Sure.  Okay.

  Sam heads for the apartment.  Dean, behind the wheel, watches 
  him go.  They won t see each other anytime soon, and they 
    know it.  Both want to say something.  But neither do.

  At the front door (a security entrance, which leads to the 
      college-apartment lobby).  Sam turns.  Gives one final, 
    awkward wave.  And disappears from sight.

    Dean.  Thinking.  A swirl of emotions.  But then... he shifts 
  the car into drive... begins to motor away.  He throws one 
    last look back at the apartment... and that s when he sees--

  IN SAM S DARKENED BEDROOM WINDOW.  The glass SHIMMERS.  
    RIPPLES, as if it were liquid.  Just for a moment.  Blink and 
  you miss it.

                                DEAN
                  ...Sam...

    INT. SAM S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - LATE NIGHT

  Sam enters.  Lugging his bags.  He flips on a lamp.  Walks 
    toward his bedroom.  He s too exhausted to realize... 

    BEHIND HIM.  The lamp FLICKERS.  On the wall-- his clock, 
    gently ticking, abruptly STOPS.  Frozen.                                                                                    58.



    EXT. SAM S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 

    Dean POUNDS on the lobby entrance, alarmed--

                                DEAN
                  SAM!

  He THROWS his shoulder into the door, CRACKING it open--

    INT. SAM S APARTMENT - HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 

    Sam s hand.  Turning the bedroom doorknob.  He swings open 
  the door, just as--

    Across the room, Dean FORCES OPEN the front door.  It all 
    happens at once.  Sam turns to his brother, confused.  And 
    Dean s expression washes into FEAR--

                                DEAN
                  Sam!  Behind you!

    Sure enough, in the shadowed bedroom over Sam s shoulder... a 
    MENACING, TWISTED DARK FIGURE waits...

  Sam pivots to the figure.  Turns back to Dean, confused.  
    Then... Sam flips on the bedroom light, revealing--

    It s not a dark figure.  It s a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, draped 
    over a CHAIR.  Sam looks at his brother-- are you okay?

                                SAM
                  Dude.  What s the problem?

                                DEAN
                  I... I swore I saw...

                                SAM
                  What?

    Dean approaches, out of sorts.  The brothers enter the 
    bedroom.  Dean scans-- the room is empty.  Quiet.  Normal.

                                DEAN
                  Nothing.  Nothing, I guess...

  Sam walks over to the chair.  Dry--

                                SAM
                  Well.  Don t worry.  My IKEA chair 
                  never hurt anybody.                                                                                  59.



  Sam tugs the sweatshirt off the chair back.  But then... Sam 
    frowns... taking a closer look at the chair... and that s 
    when he notices--

  ON THE SEAT.  Plink.  A dime of red crimson appears.  Plink.  
    Then another.  Another.  They re drops.  Coming from above.  

    Dean sees them, too.  With dread, the brothers looks up--

  ON THE CEILING.  JESSICA.  Impossibly splayed out, as if it 
    were the floor.  Eyes wide open, glassy.  Dead.

                                SAM
                  JESS!  NO!

  And before they can even react-- SIZZLING.  BLACK LINES, 
    BURNING THEMSELVES into the wall.  Spiderwebbing.  Some 
    horizontal, some vertical.  Once again, a charred warning--

    COMING FOR YOU

  The words IGNITE.  The room blazes rapidly, a tinderbox. 

    Anguished, Sam leaps up on the chair.  Struggling to pull 
    Jessica down.  But he can t reach.  And the flames are 
    spreading.  Dean yanks Sam away, hard--

                                DEAN
                  Sam!  We have to go!

    Dean practically drags Sam out of the apartment...

    EXT. SAM S APARTMENT - LATER

    Firetrucks.  Firemen extinguish the blaze.  Across the 
    street... pajama-clad APARTMENT OCCUPANTS.  Various other 
    BYSTANDERS.  And--

  Sam and Dean.  Leaning against the Impala.  Watching the 
    structure burn.  

  Sam can t return to a simple, happy life, and he knows it.  
    It s time to face up to who he is.  To assume his place in 
  the family.  No more running.  

  The brothers.  Standing together.  Fire illuminating their 
    expressions, reflecting in their eyes--

                                                                        BLACKOUT.
