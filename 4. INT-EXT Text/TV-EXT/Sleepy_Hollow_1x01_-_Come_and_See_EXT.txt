 
      CRUNCH: RUSTED NAILS uproot as the planks PRY OPEN. Crane 
      EMERGES to find himself on a small FOOTBRIDGE; a forgotten  
      landmark deep in the forest. He shields his eyes -- hasn t 
      seen light for what feels like years. 
 
      JUMPCUT: CRANE S HANDS sweep into a RIVER, he drinks 
        VORACIOUSLY. The water clears away some MUD on his face -- 
 
      JUMPCUT: CRANE S BARE FEET walk over dirt, twigs SNAPPING 
      underfoot. And then... the texture of the ground CHANGES... 

      His feet STOP.  Because it isn t forest floor anymore... 

      IT S ASPHALT. Dumbstruck, Crane looks down like he s just 
      found himself walking on the moon. AND SUDDENLY SOMETHING 
      MASSIVE EXPLODES THROUGH THE FOG: 
 
        HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!!! AN EIGHTEEN-WHEEL MACK TRUCK 
      RIPS PAST CRANE AS HE LURCHES BACK IN SHOCK! He s stumbled 
      into the MIDDLE OF A BLACKTOP HIGHWAY, a very MODERN highway 
      -- and then SCREEEEECHHOOONK! ANOTHER CAR SWERVES TO AVOID 
      HIM AND BARRELS OFF THE ROAD, CRASHES THROUGH THE GUARD RAIL 
      AND SLAMS HARD INTO A TREE! 
 
      Then... SILENCE. SMOKE pours from the hood. Crane s 18th 
      century brain tries to process this insane turn of events. 
      Terrified, he comes around the car to find A WOMAN slumped 
      against the airbag, half-conscious. A VOICE from the GPS: 
 
                                  VOICE 
                    This is OnStar Emergency Response, 
                    we have your location and we re 
                    sending help -- 
 
      And Crane is suddenly confronted by the existence... OF  
      ONSTAR. He STUMBLES back -- TERRIFIED -- CONFUSED -- past a 
      ROAD SIGN that reads:  6. 
 
 

                       WELCOME TO SLEEPY HOLLOW, POP. 210,060  
 
                                                                AND WE SMASH TO: 
 
 
 
    A BREATHLESS, HANDHELD FOOT CHASE: we re in a TRAIN YARD as a 
      GUY in a HOODIE comes tearing around a corner, followed by 
      DETECTIVE ABBIE ARCHER -- early 30 s, smart, tough, and 
      beautiful -- but there s something she carries, a history she 
      wishes belonged to someone else. We ll get to that later: 
      for now, she RUNS between train cars as a POLICE CRUISER 
      tears in, SIRENS screaming -- cuts off Hoodie Guy -- he 
      vanishes behind a train -- clears an opening when.... HE S 
      TACKLED BY ABBIE, they go down hard. She climbs onto the 
      perp s back, digs her knee in, HANDCUFFS him: 
 
                                  HOODIE GUY 
                    OWWW! GET OFF ME! 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Sorry, that s what happens when you 
                    steal from the Kwikee-Mart: a woman 
                    with a gun sits on you -- 
 
      She searches the guy s pockets, pulls out... a bottle of 
      STRAWBERRY YOO-HOO: 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Are you kidding me? 

      And turns him over revealing... a pimply 17 YEAR OLD KID: 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    KYLE?  
 
                                  KYLE 
                    ... hi, Officer Archer... 
 
      The cruiser SKIDS IN and out comes SHERIFF AUGUST GREY, 60 s, 
      kind but tough. Levels his GUN but she signals: it s okay. 
      Hauls KYLE to his feet, SLAMS him against a train car: 
 
                                  KYLE (CONT D) 
                    I m sorry! My friends dared me! 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    You need to get some new friends, 
                    Kyle. You used to be that cute kid 
                    who picked his nose in church. How 
                    old re you now?  7. 
 
 

                                  KYLE 
                      S-seventeen -- My mom s gonna kill 
                    me -- 
 
      Abbie s eyes dart to Grey and an unspoken understanding  
      passes between them. This moment, this kid, seems to have a 
      resonance that mirrors something in their relationship: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I don t know, Sheriff, what do you 
                    think? Seventeen, theft... 
 
                                  GREY 
                    Hm. Tough call. He ll probably be 
                    tried like an adult -- that s state 
                    prison. 

      Despairing, Kyle starts to CRY -- 

                                  ABBIE 
                    ... Kyle. Kyle. Look at me: 
                    I know this town seems small, but 
                    trust me -- you can be whoever you 
                    wanna be. Astronaut? Cowboy? 
                      President?  I m offering you a 
                    chance at rebirth. We all dream of 
                    it -- I know I do. Fact, in a 
                    week, I m outta here too. So in 
                    the spirit of fresh starts... I m 
                    letting you go. 
                          (off Kyle's SHOCK) 
                    Run, Dummy! 
 
      With a grateful grin, he RUNS OFF. Abbie looks to Grey, 
      smiles: 
 

                                  GREY 
                    Sure you really wanna leave all 
                    this excitement? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Told you, Quantico takes 240 people 
                    a year, only 20 get picked for 
                    Profile Management. It s the FBI s 
                    only feeder program. 
 
                                  GREY 
                    I m not asking if you re qualified. 

      As they reach the door, he stops over the hood of the car: 

                                  GREY (CONT D) 
                    I m asking if you re running away.  8. 
 
 

      She looks off, the TOWN OF SLEEPY HOLLOW in the valley below: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I m thirty-two years old. If I 
                    don t leave now... I never will. 
 
                                  GREY 
                    If you re hoping to find answers 
                    out there you won t find here... 
                    Honey, that s not gonna happen. 
                    Trust me. You ll just keep on 
                    running. 
 
      Something CHANGES in her face. Whatever he s referring to, 
      it s her deepest mark, one he knows better than anyone. Then 
      -- TSSHT: they re interrupted by a VOICE on his walkie -- 
 
                                  DISPATCHER VOICE 
                    Charlie 101 to COM. 
 
                                  GREY 
                          (answers) 
                    Go ahead Charlie 101. 
 
                                  DISPATCHER VOICE Got a 
                    call from the Fox Hill Stables, 
                    horses are spooked by something.
                     Probably coyotes again. 
 
                                  GREY 
                      Alright... we ll be right over. 
                          (as they get in) 
                    This is why I got into police work. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Maybe I should drive. You drive 
                    like you re pushing a damn 
                    stroller. 
 
      He GRINS and GUNS the engine, they LEAVE FRAME and we BOOM 
      DOWN over the valley peak, INTO THE TOWN OF SLEEPY HOLLOW: 
 
 
 
      Big enough to be called a  city,  small enough to still be 
      called  intimate.  We come to MAIN STREET, onto which CRANE 
      appears, walking along, shirtless and shoeless. People see 
      him and move aside.  The normal flow of life here is 
      ABNORMAL, DISORIENTING, and FRIGHTENING to him -- as he takes 
      in strange sights and sounds, his orientation of the PRESENT  
      is INVADED by sporadic flashes of SLEEPY HOLLOW S PAST:  9. 
 
 

    A group of KIDS exit a Starbucks on CELL PHONES, hop on 
      skateboards and -- FLASH: the Starbucks suddenly becomes an 
      18TH CENTURY BLACK SMITH S SHOP, four horses tied beside it -- 
 
      HONK! Back to PRESENT, Crane WHIPS AROUND to see TRAFFIC 
      crossing the TAPPAN-ZEE BRIDGE, a LIGHTHOUSE in BG as -- 
      FLASH: SAME VIEW in the 1700 s: the Hudson s alive with 
      SAILING VESSELS but NO BRIDGE YET -- 
 
      THE SOUND OF ROTOR BLADES draws Crane s attention up to a 
      NEWS CHOPPER overhead. He stops, stunned. The sound of 
      CHURCH BELLS shifts his focus to something ELSE reflected 
      behind him and we RACK TO... 
 
    A CHURCH. The sign out front:  GOD WELCOMES ALL.  
 
 
 
      Abbie s FLASHLIGHT sweeps the empty pickup. She steps back 
      and CLUNK, her foot hits something METAL: a SHOTGUN left 
      fallen in the mud. Shit. She draws her gun, keys her RADIO: 
 
                                  ABBIE (INTO WALKIE) 
                    We got a weapon on the ground -- 
 
 
 
      Abbie HEARS that... and then, ROCKS to a sudden HALT as her 
      flashlight beam catches a TERRIFYING SIGHT: the BODY of the  
      STABLE OWNER limply arched over a barbed-wire fence. She 
      approaches what should be his HEAD, but sees something THAT 
      WE DO NOT -- STAMMERS, AGHAST: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... oh my God... 
                          (into walkie) 
                    Grey, I found Oglevie -- 
 
 
 
      As Abbie rushes up to the barn double doors -- SHHHHHTING! 
      The axe blade comes PIERCING THROUGH from the other side, 
      INCHES FROM HER FACE. As she FLINCHES back, we HEAR the 
        unmistakable sound of a HEAD THUMPING to the ground inside -- 
 
      ON ABBIE -- SHOCK -- HORROR -- the blade DISAPPEARS as it s 
      YANKED out of the door, RETRIEVED -- then WHAM: the doors FLY 
      open as a HUGE WHITE STALLION EXPLODES FROM THE BARN, 
      knocking her BACK -- her gun skips across the mud -- 
 
      Headless steers the horse back around, AXE still in hand. 
      Stops and  stares  down at her... and from ABBIE S POV, WE  
      BEHOLD HEADLESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FULL, TERRIFYING GLORY.  12. 
 
 

      Same military uniform he wore in 1776, now decrepit and 
      tattered. Like he was buried in it. That LION/SWORD MEDAL 
      prominent on his chest. He assesses if Abbie s a threat, 
      quickly determines not, SPINS the axe and SHEATHES it in a 
      back scabbard, and gallops into the mist. Gone. 
 
      MIND IMPLODING, Abbie races to GREY S BODY. Drops to her 
      knees, breaking down, snapping out her walkie: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    OFFICER DOWN... OH GOD... OFFICER  
                    DOWN... FOX HILL STABLES... 
 
 
 
      Price exits to a waiting Mendez. Abbie on the periphery, 
      looking for her moment to intervene: 
 
                                  PRICE 
                    Not one spike. He s either 
                      delusional or has some kind of 
                    amnesia -- could be setting the 
                    table for an insanity defense.  20. 
 
 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Hold him for 72 hours at the psych 
                    unit, I want a full e-val. 
 
      In a RUSH, Mendez begins to walk away, Abbie quickly FOLLOWS 
      him down the corridor -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Sir? Sir? I m Abbie Archer, I 
                    was Sheriff Grey s partner. 

      He registers that, but continues on into THE BULLPEN: 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Yes, I m very sorry for your loss. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Thank you, Sir, but if I could ask: 
                    before we send that man to the 
                    psych unit, may I have a chance to 
                      interrogate him myself? 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                      Absolutely not -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Sir, prelim forensics found no 
                    trace evidence connecting him to 
                    the farm, and he described the 
                      appearance of the man I saw in 
                    perfect detail. He could be 
                    helpful. 
 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    -- or he could be the killer, we 
                    both know the polygraph s trickable 
                    and he just admitted to beheading 
                    someone. He needs professional 
                      attention, which you re not 
                    qualified to give after the trauma 
                    you ve just suffered, for which, as 
                    I said, I am very sorry. But the 
                    answer s no. Go home and get some 
                    sleep. 
 
      He moves on. Instantly she calculates options -- smart as 
      hell -- shifts gears into  appeasing  and pursues tactfully: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    May I at least be the one to 
                    transport him, Sir? My 
                      questions ll be limited to the 20 
                    minutes it takes to get there. 
                    What can that hurt? 
                                  (MORE)  21. 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT'D) 
                          (then, the kicker) 
                    If nothing else, maybe it ll help 
                    give me some closure... please. 

      He pauses, looks at her, debating -- an AIDE approaches: 

                                  AIDE 
                    Sir, the Command Center s ready -- 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                          (nods; then, to Abbie) 
                    You wanna be this guy s chauffeur? 
                    Be my guest. 
 
      And off he GOES, as we PUSH IN ON ABBIE, with another agenda  
      in mind -- bridling like a horse at the starting gate -- 
 
 
 
      SOARING over the majestic Hudson, we find a POLICE CRUISER: 
 
 
 
      Abbie drives; Crane s mind races, processing his first car 
      ride: POLICE CHATTER on the radio, GPS, scenery racing by. 
      Hands cuffed, he keeps toggling the door lock button. Up. 
      Down. Abbie glances over, mildly irritated but mostly 
      fascinated by the consistency of his act. Now he tries the 
      window. Up. Down. Finally, she hits the CHILD LOCK. 
      Thwarted, he looks over. TENSION between them... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    So you were asleep for about 250 
                    years. Civil War didn t wake you? 
                    Noisy neighbors to the south? 
                          (he just stares) 
                    You get up to pee? I don t know 
                    about you, but I m gettin  up to 
                    pee every 75, 80 years, that s just 
                    me. 
 

                                  CRANE 
                          (beat, deadpan) 
                    Are you done? Or does it not 
                    concern you that most of what you 
                    say is unintelligible gibberish to 
                    me? Like watching a chicken cluck. 
                    And when did women start wearing 
                    pants? 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Hey, it s a free country thanks to 
                    you -- women wear pants, men wear 
                    dresses, it s a whole new day in 
                    America, so live it up. 
                          (beat; off his stare) 
                    You re just... not gonna break 
                      character, huh?  24. 
 
 

      He turns away. Cold shoulder. She sighs: 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Okay. Let s say I did believe you. 
                    You said you woke up in a cave? 
                    Show me. 
 
      He turns back. Eyes narrow. An OPENING here... 
 
 
 
      THE  WELCOME TO SLEEPY HOLLOW  SIGN. Abbie s cruiser pulls 
      up. Beside the sign is a SMALL DIRT ROAD leading deeper into 
      the forest. He NODS: there. As she turns off the main road, 
      Crane senses this was, in fact, her plan all along: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    You re violating orders. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    The convenient part for me is if 
                    you tell anyone, no one ll believe 
                    you. 
 
      He looks ahead, sort of SMIRKS. Sort of. She drives on: 
 
 

      They get out. Eerie woods. She pulls out her KEYS -- 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Gimme your hands. 

      He does. As she unlocks his wrists, his eyes go to her gun: 

                                  CRANE 
                    I take it the weapon on your belt 
                    is a distant cousin to the 
                    revolver. And if I were to attempt 
                    escape, you d fire on me. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Wow, you learn quick. Which way? 
 
      He looks around -- orients -- points toward the bridge. 
      Abbie opens the trunk, filled with POLICE GEAR. Grabs a 
      camera, pulls out her iPhone, hits  talk,  starts walking: 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Siri, open  dictation  app.  25. 
 
 

                                  SIRI (V.O.) 
                    Okay, Abbie, what would you like to 
                    call the file? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Case number 2013-1. 
 
      Off Crane s look: 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    It s a phone. You can talk to 
                    people, even if they re far away. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    And... where is Siri? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    No, no, it s not a real person -- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    That s what they say about slaves -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Not anymore, slavery was abolished 
                    a hundred and fifty years ago. 
 
                          CRANE (reacts, a 
                                  SMILE) 
                    I m pleased to hear it. 
 
      She moves on. Confused as hell, he follows: 
 
 
 
      BOOTS step across rickety planks into: 
 
 
 
      WHITE HOOVES RIP ACROSS THE UNDERBRUSH, POUNDING HELL-FOR- 
      LEATHER THROUGH THE FOREST. CLOSE ON THE HORSE S EYES: RED  
      AS HELL. The steed, we now see, is RIDERLESS. As we CUT TO: 
 
    A BODY OF WATER. The FULL MOON reflected in glassy water... 
      it RIPPLES AWAY as BUBBLES surface. Something s RISING up 
      from below. The horse emerges through the fog and STOPS at 
      the muddy banks. Waiting. As... SHOULDERS EMERGE FIRST FROM 
      THE WATER, WITHOUT A HEAD.  HEADLESS rises from the depths. 
      The steed REARS and SCREECHES and we SMASH TO BLACK. 
 
                                        END ACT TWO  31. 
 
 

                                          ACT THREE 
 
 
 
      FLASH! A crime scene photographer snaps pictures of KNAPP S 
      CORPSE.  Abbie and Crane pull up. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I need you to wait here. 
 
    A MOMENT between them. Growing CONNECTION. She gets out. 
      He watches her go as she falls in-step with Mendez: 
 

                ABBIE (CONT D) MENDEZ 
      Sir, if I could have a word -- -- not now -- 
 

      -- because up ahead, here comes DUNN and a cadre of cops; 
      Abbie holds her tongue as they intersect to walk the scene: 
 
                                    OFFICER DUNN 
                    Looks like someone tried to make 
                    entry through the window, then came 
                    around and shattered the door -- 
 
      As they head toward the CHURCH, we go back to... CRANE IN THE 
      CAR. Looking out at ANCIENT GRAVESTONES beside the church. He 
      debates, knows he s been told to stay put, but his curiosity 
      is piqued -- stay/go/stay/go? 
 
 
 
      WHOOSH: Abbie s cruiser RUSHES through the verdant valley:  42. 
 
 

 
      The cruiser pulls up to an old Dutch Vernacular building with 
      adjacent New England edifices. ON CRANE, as he RECOGNIZES: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    This is Union College. I was a 
                    professor here... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Well now it s Tarrytown Museum. 
                    They have a replica of the painting 
                    I saw online, which I didn t trust 
                    not to be photo-shopped. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                      Photo-shopped? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                      Nevermind. I just have to see this 
                    thing with my own eyes... 
                          (beat) 
                    ... and yours. 
 
 
 
    A Ford F-150 pulls INTO LENS, through the windshield is ANDY 
      DUNN, just off his shift, tired, on the phone with Abbie: 
 

                  ABBIE (V.O.) Look, DUNN 
    I just need you to trust me  
      and call an  all units  to  
      140 Virginia Road, the -- whoa whoa: and you know 
      Elijah Miller House with air the killer s on his way there 
      support -- now... how? From that whack 
                                                  job? 
 
 

 
      SOARING over a dark forest below, we pick up the headlights 
      of Abbie s cruiser racing up a desolate road that winds its 
      way towards a LARGE ABANDONED HOUSE tucked deep in the trees. 
 
 
 
      Abbie approaches Dunn s cruiser through the fog, flashlight 
      held against her levelled shotgun. He s NOWHERE to be found: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Andy? 
 
      Silence. What s happening? She pans the shotgun/flashlight 
      around the dark forest -- NOTHING. Tense as hell -- 
 
 
 
      Abbie, shotgun still level, hears Crane s VOICE, keys back: 
 

                      ABBIE CRANE 
      Standby, Crane -- There s something I didn t 
          (beat) tell you. I think I saw 
      -- saw who? Katrina -- 
 

      SUDDENLY -- A FIGURE BEHIND ABBIE -- BEFORE SHE CAN TURN, 
      WHACK: the BUTT OF A GUN cracks her skull -- she DROPS out of 
      frame, revealing... DUNN!  50. 
 
 

 
      POV, BLURRY, UPSIDE DOWN -- Abbie coming back to 
      consciousness as she s being CARRIED somewhere by DUNN... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... And--dy.... What re you... 
 
      THUD! She s dropped in his TRUNK -- HARD. Tries to move but 
      she s too weak. He looks down at her, quietly demented: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    I tried to get you to leave, I 
                    triiied, but YOU. DIDN T.  LISTEN. 
                    You just... had to be you.  Don t 
                    you understand what s about to 
                    happen here? What s coming? 
 
      And now we begin to CROSSCUT: 
 
      ON CRANE, the puzzle taking shape: 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    I searched the world for a way to 
                    sever your bloodlines... so I could 
                    wake you, without awakening him... 
                    but I failed. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Then you didn t bring me back? 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    It s The Horseman who was 
                      resurrected... 
 
      FLASH: NIGHT: against the full moon, HEADLESS suddenly  
      explodes from beneath the water s surface: 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT'D) 
                    ...and you along with him. 
 
      ON KATRINA. Real fear: 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    Even if you defeat The Horseman 
                    tonight, this is only the 
                      beginning... 

      CUT TO DUNN, looking down at Abbie in the trunk: 

                                  DUNN 
                      Come and see.  And I looked, and 
                    behold a pale horse: and his name 
                    that sat on it was Death...   53. 
 
 

      ON ABBIE, hearing the words  Come And See.  Her worst fears: 
 
                                  DUNN (CONT D) 
                    That s why I always believed you -- 
                    I heard the voice too. We were 
                    chosen to be its servants, Abbie -- 
                    to prepare the way. A war is  
                    coming... 
 
      CUT BACK TO KATRINA AND CRANE: 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    I m sorry, Ichabod... but you ve 
                    traded one war for another. Except 
                    this time, its soldiers are hidden 
                    among the faces of this town. 
                    Knapp isn t the only soldier in 
                    this war who remains from long ago. 
                    There are many on the other side. 
                    Sleepy Hollow takes its name from 
                    the hallowed ground on which it 
                    lies, a long-dormant sanctum of 
                    good and evil... and it s been 
                    rudely awakened. 
 
      BACK TO DUNN, as the CRY OF AN INCOMING HORSE echoes through 
      the forest. He grins: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    Once he s whole again, he ll join 
                    the others. There ll be no turning 
                    back -- events will unfold that 
                    none of you can stop... 
 
      He reaches up and SHUTS her in the trunk, but... CLACK: 
      oddly, it doesn't close all the way. Lifts the trunk to see 
      what's blocking it: A TIRE IRON held upright by Abbie! She 
      CLOBBERS him in the head, his GUN falling free. Dazed, she 
      tumbles out, blood covering her ear and neck. Dunn on the 
      ground, barely stirring. She swipes his gun and cuffs, makes 
      her way to the driver door... weak, dizzy... grabs the RADIO: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Metro, Officer needs help, request 
                    SWAT team and air support, 140 
                    Virginia Road... use extreme  
                      caution... 
 
      BACK TO KATRINA AND CRANE: 
 
      ON CRANE, taking in the weight of that -- the mantle of epic 
      responsibility --  54. 
 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    And what of our family? What 
                    happened to Thomas? What happened 
                    to our son?! 
 
      Her eyes WELL. This may be the very worst part of all... 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                      Ichabod... I think our son is the  
                    one who resurrected The Horseman. 
 
      Before we can understand what that MEANS, the POUNDING HOOVES 
      BUILDING -- Katrina TURNS -- 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    He s here. 
 
 CRANE 
                    Abbie... 
 
 

 
      SLAM: Abbie shoves a half-conscious Dunn in the backseat of 
      his cruiser, LOCKS the door, CAGING HIM. Then -- the sound 
      of HOOFBEATS snaps her around -- she sees THE HORSEMAN RIDING 
      toward the vault. As she readies her gun, a SUDDEN THUD and 
      GLASS CRACK whips her back -- DUNN has SMASHED his bloody 
      head against the window causing it to SPIDERWEB, like a 
      mental patient in a cell -- GRINNING at her: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    You can t kill him... he is death. 
 
 
 
      The HORSEMAN S BOOTS DROP from the saddle and march up to the 
      house -- 
 
 

      Abbie SPINS at the SOUND of the blast, keys her walkie: 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Crane?! Crane, do you read me? 
 
      Nothing. Wounded, she makes a run for her squad car -- 
 
 
 
      Abbie, in pain, arrives at her car to see the other WALKIE on 
      Crane s empty seat. Turns to the house... oh no. A POLICE 
      CHOPPER roars in overhead, SEARCHLIGHT sweeping across a 
      swarm of POLICE CRUISERS and SWAT racing in. She WAVES down 
    a police car as others ZOOM past -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I VE GOT A CIVILIAN INSIDE, TELL 
                    THEM TO HOLD THEIR APPROACH! DO 
                    NOT FIRE! 
 
 
 
      The CHOPPER SEARCHLIGHT bleeds through the window shutters, 
        backlighting the VICIOUS FIGHT as Crane PUSHES Headless into 
      the wall, dropping him in a heap and sending the shotgun 
      skidding across the floor. Headless, ADVANCES toward the 
      shotgun, cocks it expertly, and FIRES, just missing Crane as 
      he SWOOPS out the door DISAPPEARING into the OPEN GROUNDS, 
      skull in hand. 
 
 
 
      Crane comes RUNNING out of the house as, suddenly, DOZENS OF 
      GUN-MOUNT LIGHTS converge on him, one of which is Abbie s: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    DON T SHOOT, HE S OKAY! HE S OURS! 

      Crane, amped and out of breath, delivers a call to action: 

                                  CRANE 
                    We ve got to slow him down! 
                    CHARGE!!  57. 
 
 

      A failed beat follows... then Abbie translates: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    FIRE!! 
 
      And the police line UNLEASHES HELL on the house: 
 
 
 
      Windows SHATTER, shutters SPLINTER OPEN, walls ERUPT -- 
      Headless is peppered with bullets, but only mildly deterred 
      as he recovers his shotgun, takes aim, FIRING back: 
 
      Police take cover behind vehicles -- metal and glass explode! 
      Headless RELOADS from his AMMO BELT when a back door BANGS 
      OPEN -- three SWAT TROOPS OPEN UP, shredding Headless  back -- 
 
      Headless turns. Irritated. Then, WHOOSH, he FLIPS the shotgun 
      like a BAT and comes at them SWINGING. Hard. Brutal. Quickly 
      dispatching the three troops. Looks at their fallen machine 
      rifles. Picks one up. LIKES it. 

      Picks up the OTHER ONE. Two-fisting them. When suddenly -- 

      His arm begins to SMOKE. A faint hint of SUNLIGHT has found 
      him. He WHIRLS, SEES two things outside: DAWN! And: CRANE has  
      the skull. Headless holds a  look  on Crane, debating between 
      him and the horizon s glow... fuck! Turns and RACES out the 
      back, using the twin auto rifles to CUT A SWATH through 
      police -- his HORSE arrives and he MOUNTS UP: 
 
 
 
      BAM! THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN COMES FLYING OUT OF THE HOUSE, 
      QUICKLY DISAPPEARING INTO THE MIST BEFORE ANYONE HAS A CHANCE  
      TO SEE HIM IN FULL-- Crane SHOUTS to Abbie: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    We must keep him from reaching the 
                    waters. We need to ride! Now. 
 
 
 
      HEADLESS rides like hell, dawn threatening to overtake the 
      darkness. As the horse s HOOVES thunder past us, ABBIE'S 
      POLICE CAR SKIDS INTO FRAME in violent pursuit. HEADLESS 
      makes it clear of the forest -- arrives at the RIVERBANK, 
      uniform SMOLDERING under the rising sun. BAILS off the horse, 
      hitting gravel in full tumble. We feel his PANIC as he 
      staggers INTO the river and WHIP BACK TO THE SHORE WHERE: 
      SCREEEECH -- Abbie's patrol car skids in, nose to the water --  58. 
 
 

 
    A last glimpse of Headless as he disappears below the 
      surface... Crane HITS the dash, ENRAGED -- leaps out: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Open the rear hatch -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    The trunk?  
 
                                  CRANE 
                    YES, the trunk! 
 
      HARD CUT TO: THUNK! Abbie POPS it, Crane digs urgently 
      through gear for NYLON ROPE. Hands one end to Abbie -- 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    Tie this -- 
                          (her BUMPER HITCH) 
                    -- to that. 
 
      Before she can ask a question, SPLASH: he DIVES into the 
      Hudson, the rope coiling out behind him. GONE. Stunned, 
      Abbie quickly realizes his play here -- she TIES her end to 
      the hitch -- hops in, THROWS the gear in REVERSE, engine 
      REVVING -- turns and looks back: 
 
      PUSH IN ON THE WATER... nothing... Abbie s WORRIED, this is  
      taking TOO LONG... then: PUUUUHHHH! Crane SURFACES shouting: 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                      NOW!!!!!!!! 
 
      She PINS the pedal and the cruiser SURGES BACKWARD, the rope 
      goes TAUT -- wheels CHURN in the mud but win the fight... and 
      we now SEE what's tied to the other end as AN ANCIENT COFFIN 
      drags out of the lake! 
 
      Abbie stops the car, flies out, joining Crane as he rushes 
      from the water and TEARS open the coffin to reveal... 
      HEADLESS CONVULSING INSIDE AS HE S HIT BY FULL SUN! Tries to 
      LEAP OUT, his body SMOKING MADLY, but Crane SLAMS him back 
      down, PINNING him until... HEADLESS GOES UP IN FLAMES! Crane 
      recoils as The Horseman BURNS and MELTS into a blackened 
      SKELETON before finally giving up in a death rictus... 
 
      And it all ENDS. Abbie and Crane COLLAPSE, exhausted. Out 
      of breath. They MEET EYES, having just run this impossible 
      gauntlet together. Despite it all, he manages a weak smile: 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    Did you see the look on his face? 
                    I think we surprised him.  59. 
 
  

      And Abbie GRINS...  
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    We re gonna have to have a real 
                    long talk about staying in the car. 
 
      As POLICE VEHICLES rush in behind them, we RISE UP above the 
      scene... over which, MENDEZ S VOICE: 
 
                                  MENDEZ (V.O.) 
                    I went over the report you filed 
                    after Grey s death. To say there 
                    are egregious gaps would be an 
                      understatement... 
 
 
 
      Aftermath: SLOW-MOTION, Abbie and Crane are being treated by 
      EMT s, wrapping his broken thumb. She sees DUNN, in the back 
      of the police car, as it s driven away. He looks at her 
      through the spiderwebbed glass and does the CREEPIEST THING: 
      reaches up and points to his EYE. As in  Come And See...  
 
      ANOTHER ANGLE: MENDEZ, on the scene, watches a Forensics Team 
      carry the open coffin filled with the HORSEMAN S BONES right 
      past him, toward an SUV marked  S.I.D  (Scientific 
      Investigation Division ): 
 
                                  MENDEZ (V.O.) 
                    ... and now I m staring at a 
                    charred headless corpse in a casket 
                    you just pulled out of the Hudson 
                    River. Not one damn thing about 
                    any of this makes sense. So my 
                    question to you, Detective, is 
                    this: 

      And now we CATCH UP TO MENDEZ AND ABBIE, mid-moment: 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    What aren t you telling me? 
 
      Abbie looks at him, playing the cipher: too smart to get 
      trapped into an answer that might be used against her. So: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    It doesn t matter, Sir. The truth 
                    has a way of coming out... 
                          (then, meaningfully) 
                    ... whether we accept it or not. 
 
      He considers her. With newfound respect.  60. 
 
 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Well then, this is interesting 
                    timing... I m told you re leaving 
                    for Quantico next week. 
 
      PUSH IN ON ABBIE. In this moment, after an incredible first 
      step on a long road to come, her purpose is finally CLEAR... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... not anymore. 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                          (beat; then, a nod) 
                    Good. 
 
      Last look, and Mendez WALKS OFF. Abbie watches him go, then 
      joins Crane with the EMT s. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    We have to find a good hiding place 
                    for that little souvenir of yours. 
 
      Crane gives her a coy and knowing look. She smiles. Both 
      turn to see the rising sun over The Hudson. So much 
      unresolved, so many questions... 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Dunn said a war is coming. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (beat, a nod) 
                     A war with many faces.  Far worse 
                    than his, I fear. 
                          (beat) 
                    And my son... may be responsible 
                    for starting it. 
                          (all the feeling rises to 
                          his throat) 
                    I have to find him. No matter how 
                    long it takes. 
                          (beat) 
                    Maybe... that s the reason I am 
                    here now. 

      She looks at him. In it together: 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Maybe it s the reason we both are. 

      And those words break through. He smiles: 

                                  CRANE 
                    Thank you, Abbie.  61. 
 
 
 ABBIE 
                    For what?  
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (a beat) 
                      Believing. 
 
      The look between them HOLDS. Intimate connection, promising 
      more to come. And this is where we leave our heroes, 
      standing together by the water, watching the sunrise... and 
      just when we think our pilot s OVER... 
 
      We CUT TO the Forensics Techs loading, using a rope to pull 
      The Horseman s coffin into the back of the S.I.D. vehicle... 
 
 
 
      WE CRANE UP and away from the scene, music SWELLING as we hit 
      an aerial WIDE SHOT, a gloriously traditional ending when, 
      suddenly -- 
 
      The SOUND of an ANGRY HORSE S SCREAM overtakes our sound  
      track, followed shortly by SCREEECH as we SLAM TO: 
 
 
 
      THE FORENSIC VEHICLE CARRYING THE COFFIN, TIRES SKIDDING TO A 
      DEAD STOP on pavement as our CAMERA sails past the FORENSIC 
      VEHICLE to witness THE HORSEMAN S PALE HORSE galloping right  
      toward it at full canter: 
 
      INSIDE THE VEHICLE: The DRIVER braces himself as the horse  
      TRAMPLES UP and over the car, HOOVES shattering the  
      windshield!  The man snaps around in terror to see the horse 
      landing behind the vehicle -- 
 
      RACK FOCUS FROM THE DRIVER TO HIS SIDE WINDOW -- barely a 
        split-second to glimpse a fast approaching HOODED FIGURE (the 
      same cloaked figure we saw in 1776 overlooking the 
        battlefield) -- SMASH! The window EXPLODES as the intruder 
      CLAMPS its INHUMAN HAND around the driver s face -- TWIST- 
      CRACK, and he s DEAD. 
 
      ANOTHER ANGLE: the back door PULLS OPEN to reveal the WET 
      COFFIN in back. The cloaked figure SNATCHES the COILED ROPE 
      still tied to the coffin s edge, MOUNTS the pale horse, KICKS 
      OFF -- and the coffin s YANKED from the back of the SUV: 
 
      CAMERA stays in back of the empty vehicle as the mysterious 
      rider DRAGS the coffin away, down the highway, past SWERVING 
      CARS, disappearing into the mist while we HEAR the scratchy 
      SOUND TRACK of JOHNNY CASH S VOICE once again:  62. 
 
 

                                  CASH 
                    And I heard a voice in the midst of 
                    the four beasts... 
 
 
 
      Where the horse-pulled coffin comes to rest... at the feet, 
      or rather, hooves, of THREE MOUNTED HORSEMEN. 
 
                                  CASH (CONT D) 
                    ...and I looked and behold a pale 
                    horse, and it s name that sat on 
                    him, was Death... 
 
      With a conspiratorial bow, the cloaked figure stalks off into 
      the blackness of the woods. 
 
                                  CASH (CONT D) 
                    ...and Hell followed with him. 
 
      MUSIC KICKS IN HARD and CREDITS ROLL. 
 
                                        END OF PILOT
