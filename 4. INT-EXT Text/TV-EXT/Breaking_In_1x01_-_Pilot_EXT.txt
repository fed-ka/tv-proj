      FLICK!  Melanie picks the lock of a newspaper machine.  She grabs 
      one and sits on a bench with a hot dog, Cameron beside her.

                                    MELANIE
                    So, tell me.  How exactly did Oz rope 
                    you into working in our office?

                                    CAMERON
                    No, I m totally here by choice. 

                                    MELANIE
                    Wow.  You lie worse than you dress. 

                                    CAMERON
                    I like this shirt.  I got it at 
                    Ross.  I dress for less.                                                                                    16.


                                    MELANIE
                    Listen, there s something you 
                    should know about me.  I m retarded 
                    smart.  Just tell me -- what does 
                    Oz have on you?  

                                    CAMERON
                    Me?  Nothing.  I m here by choice.  
                    Best choice ever.

                                    MELANIE
                    Uch, who d you hack?  NORAD?  NSA?   
                    White House?  DMV?

                                    CAMERON
                    Wow.  You are smart.  University of 
                    Chicago.  When I was 16, I broke 
                    into their mainframe.  Wrote myself 
                    an admissions letter.  Full 
                      scholarship.  Faculty parking.  I 
                    also signed up  Bo Bice  as my 
                    roommate so I had my own suite.

                                    MELANIE
                    Why d you have to cheat your way 
                    into college?  You re a genius.

                                    CAMERON
                    I... was kinda distracted in high 
                    school.  

      QUICK POPS: 

      -GYM CLASS.  Cameron ducks dodge balls.  WHAM!  He gets 
      pants d as the girls  PE class jogs by.

                                    CAMERON
                    Ladies.

      -CHRISTMAS CONCERT.  Cameron croons in the alto section.

                                    CAMERON
                    Rudolph the red nosed reindeer!  
                    Had a very shiny --

      WHAM!  He s pants d by a dude standing behind him.

      -HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.  Cameron approaches a geeky band girl.

                                    CAMERON
                    Hi, I sit next to you in AP calc?  
                    Um... I was wondering if you d like 
                    to go to prom with --                                                                                    17.


      WHAM!  This time, the geeky girl is the one to pants him.  
      BACK TO SCENE: As Cameron covers poorly.

                                    CAMERON
                    You know how it goes.  Back in the 
                    day, I could barely keep my pants on.

                                    MELANIE
                    Gotta admit, I didn t peg you for a 
                    law breaker.  It s kinda hot.

      Cameron s heart skips a beat.  He s never been called hot 
      before.  All he can say is:

                                    CAMERON
                    Pffft.  That s -- yeah.  You know.

                                    MELANIE
                    So how d you get caught?

                                    CAMERON
                    That s the irony.  Titan Team. The 
                    college hired Oz to patch their web 
                    security.  He s the one who nailed 
                    me -- one week before graduation.

      QUICK POPS -- NEWS FOOTAGE of Cameron s arrest.  He s in a  
      Drudge report article named  Hack To School .  Even Glen Beck 
      mocks him with one of his mis-spelled word charts.

                                    CAMERON
                    Lucky enough, Oz talked to the 
                    school.  No jail time if I pay back 
                    all four years of tuition.  One 
                    hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  

                                    MELANIE
                    That explains the shirt.  

                                    CAMERON
                    Yep.  Oz actually saved me from 
                    prison... then put me in this one.  
                    Figure it ll take a few years to 
                    pay him back.  Then I can move on 
                    with my life.

                                    MELANIE
                    Well... Oz must really see 
                    something in you.

                                    CAMERON
                    He said... he thinks I can be the 
                    best.  That s why he hired me.                                                                                    18.


                                    MELANIE
                    What?  No, he hired you  cause our 
                    last computer hacker jumped off the 
                    Sears tower.
                          (off Cameron s look)
                    But I m sure you re the best.

      Melanie smiles.  So does Cameron.  This girl is AWESOME.  
        EEEEEEERRRT!  The moment is interrupted as yellow Saturn with 
      a racing stripe SKIDS out.  Inside sits DUTCH (30), a slick 
      bad boy in skinny jeans, tat sleeves and a trucker hat.

                                  DUTCH
                    Melly bean!  Come give Papa Smurf 
                    some sugggarrr! 

      Dutch leaps out of the car.  He s wearing Uggs.  Ugh.  He 
      unleashes a sloppy kiss on Melanie.  Cameron s heart sinks.

                                    MELANIE
                    Cam, this is my boyfriend Dutch.

                                  DUTCH
                     Sup.  You look smart.  Can I have 
                    some urine?

                                    CAMERON
                    Ex...cuse me?

                                    MELANIE
                    Dutch sells clean urine on ebay so 
                    people can pass their drug tests.  

                                    CAMERON
                    Sounds... illegal.

                                  DUTCH
                    It s a moral gray area.  But it s 
                    totally paid for my sweet junior 
                    one bedroom condo.  City views, 
                    holmes.  Cit-tay views.

                                    CAMERON
                    Well... we do technically live in 
                    the city, so really every view is a--

                                  DUTCH
                    I ll call you about that nerd pee, 
                    my man.
                          (then, to Melanie)
                    Sorry to pop in, but I was getting 
                    a tan n  wax down the street.  I m 
                    smooth and bronze as a baby.                                                                                    19.


      Cameron shakes his head in disbelief.  What does she see in 
      this guy?  Dutch then hands over a wrapped gift.

                                    MELANIE
                    Dutch.  You already gave me 
                    breakfast in bed and the book of 
                    homemade love coupons --

                                  DUTCH
                    Open it.

      Melanie opens the present.  It s a beautiful piece of framed 
      art, a majestic house intricately formed from matchbooks.

                                  DUTCH
                    I ve taken a matchbook from every 
                      restaurant we ve ever gone to.  I 
                    know you moved around alot as a 
                    kid, so I want you to feel like you 
                    always have a permanent home -- in 
                    my arms.
                          (beat)
                    It s highly flammable.

      Melanie hugs him.  Dutch hugs her back hard, declaring:

                                  DUTCH
                    I love the shit out of this woman!

      Cameron can t believe it.  Dutch is an AWESOME boyfriend.  

                                    MELANIE
                    This is it, okay?  No more gifts.

                                  DUTCH
                    Well, I got one more for you to 
                    unwrap when you get home.
                          (whispers to Cameron)
                    It s my penis.  Fully manscaped.  

      He gives a click-wink.  Dutch hops in his ride and peels off.

                                    CAMERON
                    He... seems nice.

                                    MELANIE
                    Usually my boyfriends are such a-
                    holes.  He s been so great.  It s 
                    been the best birthday ever. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Wait -- it s your birthday?  I m on 
                    cake duty.                                                                                    20.


                                    MELANIE
                    Anything but a Cookiepuss.  I m 
                    lactose intolerant.

                                    CAMERON
                          (in love)
                    Me too.  Me too.


      Oz leads Cameron onto the rooftop which surprisingly has a 
      Japanese Zen garden filled with bonsai trees.  Oz grabs a 
      pair of CLIPPERS, then offers another pair to Cameron.

                                  OZ
                    Try it.  It s very soothing.

                                    CAMERON
                    Yeah, I know.  Mr. Miyagi and 
                    Danielsan go into the bonsai tree 
                    business in Karate Kid III. 

      Oz stares at Cameron.  He sheepishly takes the clippers.

                                    CAMERON
                    But... you may have missed that 
                      installment.  Go on.  I m sorry.

                                  OZ
                    Don t be.  You know, the old Oz 
                    would ve crane kicked you right off 
                    this rooftop...

      Oz looks Cameron in the eyes.  For the first time -- human.

                                  OZ
                    But I ve got too much on the line 
                    now.  So I need you to fix this.  
                    On your own.  I can t be involved.  

                                    CAMERON
                    Because you think I can be the 
                    best, I just don t know it yet?

                                  OZ
                    No.  Because I m on parole.

      Cameron s eyes go wide.  He wasn t expecting that.

                                  OZ
                    In my youth, I was a bit of a 
                    thief.  Old school kind.  B&E.  
                    Running numbers.  Train robbing.  
                    Stock market manipulation.  Art 
                    forgery.  I don t want to bore you.                                                                                    26.


                                    CAMERON
                    Please do.

                                  OZ
                    I served five years in county.  
                    Five years I ll never get back.

                                    CAMERON
                    So that s why they call you Oz? 
                    After that TV show about prison 
                    rape and whatnot?

                                  OZ
                    Or.  My last name is Osbourne.  
                    Point is, if I m caught anywhere 
                    near a hot car it s over for me.  
                    For this company.  

      Cameron takes in the severity of the situation.

                                    CAMERON
                    I ll fix this, okay?  I ll figure 
                    out a way to put the stolen Porsche 
                    back and steal the right one. 

                                  OZ
                    Also, get the goddamn cake.  
                    Maybe a giant novelty card.  
                    They re funny  cause they re big. 

      Cameron nods, his head swimming.

                                    CAMERON
                    I just... don t know how I messed 
                    up so bad.  Josh was right.  You 
                    bet on the wrong horse.   

                                  OZ
                    And that s another thing.  You 
                    can t let that guy get in your head 
                    or it ll be the end of you. 

    A beat.  Cameron s jaw drops -- a stunning realization.

                                    CAMERON
                    THAT FAT SON OF A BITCH.


      Cameron POUNDS on the door.  A bananas hot woman in a silk 
      robe answers.  This is BREE (25), not who Cam was expecting.                                                                                      27.


                                    CAMERON
                    Hi.  I m... looking for a guy I 
                    work with.  I must have the wrong --

      Josh steps into the doorway in only tighty whities and a 
      spaceman helmet.  He flips up the visor. 

                                  JOSH
                    Give us a minute, babe.  He s from 
                    NASA.  Probably another asteroid 
                    heading to earth that I gotta blow up.

      Bree heads back into the bedroom.  Josh grins proudly.

                                    CAMERON
                    My God, you really are pure evil.

                                  JOSH
                    Hey, she s not just here  cause I 
                    convinced her I m a space explorer.
                    I also got a huge dong.

      Cameron just gives him a glare that burns Napalm.

                                    CAMERON
                    I know, Josh.  I know it was you.  
                    You got in my head and made me 
                    think it was Bayport Porsche.  

                                  JOSH
                    How.  DARE.  YOU.  I ve done 
                    nothing wrong.  Nothing!

      QUICK POPS of Josh following Cameron around the office.

      -Josh and Cameron are at the Xerox machine (from earlier).

                                  JOSH
                    I m top dog around this office!  
                    The Bayport Porsche job was mine! 

      -Josh storms out of the conference room (from earlier).

                                  JOSH
                    I know what you meant!  Good luck 
                    robbing Bayport Porsche without me!

      -Cameron is snoozing in his cubicle.  Josh s head rises over 
      the cubicle wall and he says subliminally:

                                  JOSH
                    Bayport Porsche Bayport Porsche 
                    Bayport Bayport Bayport Porsche.                                                                                    28.


      BACK TO SCENE: As Josh and Cameron are face to face.

                                  JOSH
                    Well, well, you figured it all out.  
                    Too bad, you don t have any proof.

      Now Oz steps into view.

                                  OZ
                    Yeah, but I just heard you say that.

                                  JOSH
                    Still.  I didn t admit anything.

      Oz glares black death at him.  Josh instantly crumbles.

                                  JOSH
                    Please don t be angry.  I don t 
                    like you when you re angry.

                                  OZ
                    Then move your asteroid back to the 
                    office.  We ve got work to do.  
                    Also, close your robe.  I can see 
                    your abnormally huge dong.


      DING DONG!  The drunken dude from  Facebook, EDDIE CUMMINGS 
      (21, slick, shaggy haircut), answers the door.  

                                  EDDIE
                    You re not my weed dealer.

      REVEAL JOSH -- now dressed in Fratboy disguise.  White Sox 
      cap askew, double popped collar, pooka shell necklace.

                                  JOSH
                     Sup, frat daddy!  Name s Weezer.  
                    I m a Sigma Pi over at Kansas U.  
                    I m on a little frat-cation and had 
                    a total frat-tastrophe.  Van broke 
                    down.  Thought I could crash here 
                    in a safe frat-moshpere.

                                    CAMERON (OVER HEADSET)
                    Stop saying frat!

                                  JOSH
                    Anyrape, I know brothers gotta look 
                    out for each other so I thought I 
                    could hang here for the night.

                                  EDDIE
                    Depends.  If you really are a Sigma 
                    what s the secret handshake?                                                                                    30.



      We see Josh and Eddie in the midst of secret handshake now.

                                    CAMERON (OVER HEADSET)
                    Patty cake, ass smack, cabbage 
                    patch to high five.

      Josh and Eddie cabbage patch and high five.  A tense moment.

                                  EDDIE
                      BROOOOOOOO!

                                  JOSH
                      BROOOOOOOO!

                                  EDDIE
                    Get your Sigma ass in here and play 
                    some beer pong!

                                  JOSH
                    I was thinking more -- 
                          (grins; holds up:)
                    Tequila pong.


      Josh and Cameron now PUSH the Porsche down a long driveway.  
      We REVEAL Eddie PASSED out in the driver s seat.

                                    CAMERON
                    Gotta admit, I didn t think we d 
                    ever be able to work together.

                                  JOSH
                    Let s get one thing straight -- I m 
                    just doing what Oz told me to.  None 
                    of this makes us square.  We ll 
                    never be square.  In fact, we re so 
                    not square we re a rhombus.  

                                    CAMERON
                      Technically, a square is a rhombus.                                                                                     31.


                                  JOSH
                    Not always!  Little piece of 
                    advice, Hot Shot.  Watch your back 
                     cause the game s just begun.  

                                    CAMERON
                    What is this game you keep referring 
                    to?  I m not playing a game!

                                  JOSH
                    And that s the game.  

                                    CAMERON
                    Just forget it.  I give up. 

                                  JOSH
                    Oh, that s what you d like me to 
                    believe.  But before you were 
                    around, I was Oz s golden boy.  I 
                    bought Melanie the hot dogs.  Cash 
                    destroyed my life with his epic 
                    pranks. I was his Chewie!  

      Josh goes silent.  He actually looks... hurt.  Cameron 
      doesn t know how to respond.  And he doesn t have to.  
      Drunken Eddie cranes his head out the window.  

                                  EDDIE
                    Uh... someone just booted in your 
                    car.  Really bad.

      Josh and Cameron exchange a glance.  Time to finish this.

                                  JOSH
                    Actually, it s your car.

                                  EDDIE
                    My car?

                                  JOSH
                    You drove it right off your Dad s 
                    showroom floor.  

                                  EDDIE
                          (crazy slurred)
                    I stole this car?

                                  JOSH
                    You stole this car.

                                  EDDIE
                          (excited)
                    I stole this car!                                                                                    32.


      Cameron gives Josh an impressed look.  Josh leans on the car 
      horn.  BEEEEEEEEEP!  They run into the night.  ARNOLD 
      CUMMINGS comes to the door in a bathrobe, sleep in his eyes.

                                  ARNOLD CUMMINGS
                    Edward? 

                                  EDDIE
                    Hey, Dad!  I stole this car!  All 
                    me!  
                          (then)
                    You wanna get tacos?


      Cameron and Josh now stand outside of the CORRECT dealership.   
      Just through the glass gleams a Porsche 911.

                                  JOSH
                    Give it up, man.  We don t have the 
                    gear, the specs or the time to 
                    break in there.  You re boned.

      Cameron thinks long and hard.  He notices something on the 
      ground.  A BRICK.  He simply picks it up and CHUCKS IT 
      through the window.  CRRRRAASSSSSSSSSH!  Alarms BLARE!  

                                    CAMERON
                    They should really have a gate here.  

      They hustle inside to the key box.  Cameron obliterates it 
      with the brick. 

                                    CAMERON
                    And they should really have a 
                    better lock on their safe.

                                  JOSH
                    You should really shut up and drive!

      Cameron and Josh leap into the Porsche.  A beat.  PANIC.  

                                    CAMERON
                    Can t drive stick!  

                                  JOSH
                    Gah!  MOVE!


      Cameron exits Oz s office.  He stares at MELANIE and can t 
      help but smile.  Maybe there are some reasons to stay put... 
      WHAM!  Cameron is suddenly pants d!  Josh looms behind him.

                                  JOSH
                    Watch your back, Hot Shot.

      The whole office GAWKS at Cameron.  He just sighs.

                                    CAMERON
                    And... you got the underpants on 
                    that one.

      SMASH TO BLACK.

                              END OF ACT THREE.                                                                                    36.
