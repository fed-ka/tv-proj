MAN'S VOICE (over scene)
Oh, excuse Me!
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two
parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport
shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes
with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always
had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking
but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is
GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well
dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely,
acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the
gesture implying he wants privacy.
BRUNO
(smiling with sudden
recognition)
I beg your pardon, but aren't you
Guy Haines.
Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known
tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience
before.
BRUNO
(snapping his finger)
Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right
off the court in South Orange last
season. What a backhand! Made the
semi-finals, didn't you?
Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his
magazine rolled up in is fist.
BRUNO
(with open admiration)
I certainly admire people who do
things.
(smiling and
introducing himself)
I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy
looks up. Bruno indicates his gold
tie pin which bears his name in cut-
out letters. Guy looks at it with
the faintest expression of disdain.
I suppose you think it's corny. But
my mother gave it to me so of course
I wear it to please her.

How do you do.
BRUNO

I don't usually talk so much.
Go
Ahead and read.
GUY
(wryly)
Thanks.
Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open
appraisal.
BRUNO
It must be pretty exciting to be so
important.
GUY
(fidgeting slightly)
A tennis player isn't so important.
BRUNO
People who do things are important.
I never seem to do anything.
Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little
embarrassed.
BRUNO
(still insistent on
being friendly)
I suppose you're going to Southampton --
for the doubles.
GUY
(politely)
You are a tennis fan.
Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.
BRUNO
Wish I could see you play. But I've
got to be back in Washington tomorrow.

At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.
GUY
That's all right. Forget it.
I

Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.
BRUNO
There's a new cure for that.

Only kind of doubles I play.
GUY
You'll have to drink both of them.

The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter
into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he
gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a
glass to Guy. Guy takes it.
GUY
(as if he needs it)
I guess I will.
BRUNO

This is wonderful -- having your

As a matter of fact, I'm not going

It's my home town.

Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking
and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor
bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with
gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted
cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table.
Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights
his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.
BRUNO
Sure, I went to college. Three of
them. Every time they kicked me out
my father threw me back in.
(bitterly)
He finally gave up. He thinks I'm
awfully small fry, not worth the
bait.
(wistfully)
You my friend, Guy?
GUY
Sure.
I'm your friend, Bruno.
BRUNO
(a little woozy)
No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm
anything special. Only my mother.
(empties the bottle
into his glass)
My father hates me.
Guy smiles this off as nonsense.
GUY
You must be imagining things.
BRUNO
(hitting the bottom
of the bottle for
the last drop)
And I hate him. He thinks
I ought
to catch the eight-five bus

I want to do everything. I got a

everything before you die. Have you
ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a
hundred and fifty miles an hour?
GUY
Not lately.
BRUNO
I did. I flew in a jet plans too.
(his hand traces a
swift streak through
the air, and he adds
sound effects)
Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill!
Almost blow the sawdust out of my
head. I'm going to make a reservation

GUY

What are you trying prove?
BRUNO
I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky.
You're smart. Marrying the boss's
daughter is a nice short cut to a
career, isn't it?
GUY

Marrying the senator's daughter has
nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow
look past a tennis not without being

Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one
of my ideas for murdering my father?
GUY
(indicating the
detective novels)
You've been reading too many of these.
BRUNO
(going right on)
You want to hear about the busted
light socket in the bathroom, or the
carbon monoxide in the garage?
GUY
No. I may be old fashioned, but I
thought murder was against the law.
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org

BRUNO
But not against the law of nature.
My theory is that everybody is a
potential murderer. Didn't you ever
want to kill somebody? Say one of
those useless fellows Miriam was
running around with?
GUY
You can't go around killing people
just because you think they're
useless.
BRUNO
Oh, what's a life or two? Some people
are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your --
wife and my father, for instance.
It reminds me of a wonderful idea
had once. I used to put myself to
sleep at night -- figuring it out.
Now, let's say you want to get rid
of your wife.
GUY
Why?
BRUNO
Let's say she refuses to give you a
divorce --
(raises a finger and
stops Guy's protest)
Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill
her because you'd get caught. And
what would trip you up? Motive.
Now here's the plan...
GUY
I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.
BRUNO
(ignoring the remark)
It's so simple, too. A couple of
fellows meet accidentally, like you
and me. No connection between them
at all. Never saw each other before.
Each of them has somebody he'd like
to get rid of, but he can't murder
the person he wants to get rid of.
He'll get caught. So they swap
murders.
GUY
Swap murders?

BRUNO
Each fellow does the other fellow's
murder. Then there is nothing to
connect them. The one who had the
motive isn't there. Each fellow
murders a total stranger. Like you
do my murder and I do yours.
GUY
(with relief)
We're coming into my station.
BRUNO
For example, your wife, my father.
Criss-cross.
GUY

We do talk the same language -- don't

Sure, we talk the same language.
Thanks for the lunch.

Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.

at the shelves. Another girl clerk is serving a customer.
In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a
customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle
another customer is listening to a record of popular music.
A third cubicle is empty. Activity of the street is seen

Even change. Thank you, Madam.

Well -- hello, Guy.

Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is

They enter.
Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts

Now this is cosier. Sort of like

instant, then replaces the receiver. Bruno listens to his
father off scene and his expression becomes more enigmatic.
MR. ANTHONY'S VOICE
I tell you, Eunice, I'm going to
have that boy put away if it's the
last thing I do!
Bruno looks off in direction of his farther's voice with an
expression which says, "Crow while you can, you haven't
much time." He reaches into his pocket, brings out Guy's
cigarette lighter and as he flicks it on and off.

up and down, then
suddenly, without warning, bursts into
song, to the tune
of the Barber Shop Chord.
COLLINS
There was a man, now please take
note. There was a man who had a
goat. He loved that goat, Indeed he
did. He loved that goat, just like
a kid.

abruptly and addresses
Guy)
What is your opinion?
GUY
(amused)
You'll never make the Metropolitan.

Guy's hand)
Name's Collins. On sabbatical -

As Guy is about to enter the front door and we see his name

hears a soft call from across the street.

You don't seem very pleased to see

He is horrified. He looks swiftly down at the glasses in
his hand, then back to Bruno.
BRUNO'S VOICE
(bragging)
I know you'd be surprised. Nothing
for us to worry about. Nobody saw
me, only Miriam.
TWO SHOT
Guy can hardly believe what he is hearing.
BRUNO
I was very careful. Even when I
dropped your lighter there, I went

BRUNO
Where are you going?
GUY
Where do you think I'm going? I'm
going to call the police, of course.
BRUNO
But you can't, Guy. We'd both be
arrested for murder.
Guy turns back slowly and faces him.
GUY
We'd both be arrested for murder?
BRUNO
You're is much in it as I am. We
planned it together. Criss-cross.
I do your murder --
GUY
(suddenly angry)
You crazy fool! You think you can
get away with that?
BRUNO
(a little hurt)
Oh, come now, Guy. Why should I go
to Metcalf and kill a total stranger,
unless it was part of the plan and
you were in on it? You're the one
that benefits, Guy. You're a free
man. I didn't even know the girl.

You've got me acting, like a criminal,

Bruno for a moment looks menacingly at Guy.

Don't you call me that.
Bruno's flare of anger dies.

Guy opens his door, turns on Bruno.
GUY

I don't know you. I never saw you

again.
He goes in and slams the door in Bruno's face.

But we have to --
He realizes there is no use in trying to talk to Guy any
further. He turns and faces the CAMERA IN CLOSE UP as he
moves away, looking sad almost to the point of tears.
Guy is standing at the telephone which is still ringing. He
has Miriam's glasses in his hand. He looks down at them for
a moment, then picks up the receiver. He hesitates, then
speaks into the phone.

Guy comes into the corridor from the street and approaches
two policemen who are standing nearby.
GUY
Captain Turley's office?
One of the policemen gestures to a door at the right.
Guy
crosses and enters.
At one side of the room is a young police sergeant seated at
a typewriter. A group of people are seated in chairs lined
against the opposite wall.

sees:

Seated behind Guy, apart from the others who are waiting, is
Professor Collins, Guy's drunken companion on the train of
the night before. The professor is completely sober now,
dignified and erect. He has removed his glasses to polish
them and does not react to Guy's presence.
CLOSEUP GUY
Guy starts with a smile of recognition to say, "How do you
do?" but at that moment he hears the door open and his name
called:
SERGEANT'S VOICE

and goes through the door to Captain Turley's office, followed
by the eyes of the waiting people.

CAPTAIN TURLEY is conscientious, methodical and always polite.
He puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind
his desk as Guy comes in. A detective lieutenant, CAMPBELL,
is attending a coffee maker. Their expressions are grave by
contrast with Guy's confident attitude after seeing the
professor in the waiting room.
CAPTAIN TURLEY
Good of you to be so prompt, Mr.
Haines. This is Lieutenant Campbell.
(the two nod to each
other)
Won't you sit down?
GUY
Thank you, sir.

CAPTAIN TURLEY
I know you're a busy man, so
we won't
detain you any longer than
necessary...Now you already been
good enough to tell us where you
were last evening, and we've managed
to locate the gentleman you spoke
with on the train.

celebration --

GUY
But we were sitting opposite each
other in the observation car! You
were singing a song about a goat --

And calculus. You were going over a

Momentarily Guy is frustrated, then he turns quietly to
Turley.
GUY
(calmly, logically)
Captain, is it so important whether
or not Professor Collins remember
me? Surely, the important thing is
that I've been able to name a man
who was on the train with me. You've
been able to find him. Isn't that
proof of where I was at nine-thirty
last night?
Guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he
has clearly established his alibi.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Burtons are having coffee. Barbara has been glancing
through a new murder mystery with a lurid cover. As Guy
enters, Anne rises to greet him.
ANNE
Hello, darling. Have you had your
dinner?
GUY
On the train.
ANNE
You weren't in Metcalf all this time?
We expected you hours ago.

Completely.
He didn't remember me.

But, you knew he was on the train!
Wasn't that enough to prove you were

Apparently not at the right time.
They suggested I could have caught
the train at Baltimore after Miriam
was murdered. They had it all worked
out --

That's ridiculous. They're acting

turns back to the others.

The group move to look out the window, the senator with
reluctance.
Through the window we see the figure of a man across the
street. He is lighting a cigarette and strolling up and
down.

You're being tailed!

That's Leslie Hennessy. He works
sixteen hours a day. Somebody else
takes over for the next eight.
(drops the curtain,
turns back into room)
As a matter of fact, Hennessy's a
very nice fellow.
BARBARA
Shouldn't we ask him in for Coffee --

Is he likely to -- picket my office?
GUY
Very likely.
The Senator's cup is suddenly back on its saucer and he is
on his feet, pacing nervously.
SENATOR
I would suggest, Guy, for your own
peace of mind, of course, that you
work here at the house for a few
days.
(a pause)
It would be less embarrassing for
you.
Guy has been looking at Anne and is concerned at the worry
on her face. He nods in assent to the Senator's suggestion,
but puts his hand over Anne's.
GUY
(hopelessly)
Then what about practicing? Perhaps
I'd better forget Forest Hills?
SENATOR
My dear boy, wouldn't it look rather --
awkward -- if you suddenly canceled
all your plans.

Why, Guy, this is Bruno!
Guy hangs up the telephone quickly.

at it, mystified)
Yes, if I can get a court at the

As Guy's hands unfold the paper and hold it for moment, we
see that it is a diagrammed plan of the grounds and the
Interior of the Anthony house. There are dotted lines along
the upper hall, with an arrow which points to one room and
where Bruno has indicated in his handwriting, "My father's

at him.

He is still watching Bruno talk to the French couple. Guy
is unaware of Anne's looks. Suddenly his attention is
arrested by the sound of Barbara's voice calling him.

standing a few steps from the table beckoning to him.
BARBARA

I've just been talking to your shadow.
(very impressed)
Guy, did you know Mr. Hennessy helped
crack that axe murder I was reading
about? You know, the one where the
body was cut up and hidden in the
butcher shop? He was locked in the
ice box with the left leg for six
hours!

He pulls those yarns right out of
his hat, Babs.

He gives a sharp look back toward Bruno. There is more
laughter coming from the French couple at the table.

I hope you aren't forgetting our

From Bruno's viewpoint, as Barbara speaks,CAMERA MOVES IN

head. Her glasses seem to glint until her eyes are
obliterated by the glare.

INSERT: LETTER
Dear Guy --
Just two more days left. We must

He stares down at the note.
At this moment there is a knock
at the door.

That's too bad. Hammond takes over

see him earn his salary.
Guy turns to the dresser drawer in which he has put the note
and the gun, maneuvering his body between the dresser and
Hennessy's view. He takes out a handkerchief, closes the
drawer, sticks the handkerchief in his pocket, speaking as
he does so.
GUY
Doesn't that bloodhound over relax?
He sticks so close he's beginning to
grow on me -- like a fungus.
HENNESSY
(mildly)
He thinks you're a very suspicious
character. He doesn't trust anybody!
Not even himself.
Guy is eager to get out of the room, and Hennessy is
maddeningly slow in his movements.
GUY
Come on.

Don't forget your sleeping bag.

We see Guy excuse himself from Barbara, cross to Bruno and
speak to him angrily, obviously asking, "What are you doing
here?" Bruno, however, greets Guy with a smile then turns
from him, unperturbed and bland. He sees Anne and moves
toward her, smiling.
CLOSEUP ANNE
As Bruno comes in her direction, Anne's expression shows her
mystification and concern about Bruno's presence and about
Guy's attitude toward him.
MED. SHOT
Bruno comes up to Anne and the Senator. He gives a slight
bow to the Senator; then puts his hand out to Anne.
BRUNO
Good evening, Miss Burton.
The Senator looks inquiringly.
Anne makes the introduction.
ANNE
This is Mr. Antony, father.
SENATOR
How do you do, sir.
BRUNO
I'd like to talk to you sometime,
Senator, about my idea of harnessing
the life force. It will make atomic
power look like the horse and buggy.
(the Senator and Anne
are beginning to
look at him in
amazement)
I'm already developing my faculty
for seeing millions of miles. And,
Senator, can you imagine being able
to smell a flower on the planet of
Mars? I'd like to lunch with you
some day soon and tell you more about
it.
Interrupted by new arrivals, Bruno moves away out of the
picture, with a charming smile to Anne.

shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the
departing Bruno.

Bruno talking to an elderly, dignified gentlemen.
BRUNO
But tell me, Judge, after you've
sentenced a man to the chair, isn't
it difficult to go and eat your dinner
after that?
JUDGE
Young man, when a murderer is caught,
he must be tried. When he is
convicted, he must be sentenced.
When he is sentenced to death, he
must be executed.
BRUNO
Quite impersonal, isn't it, sir?
JUDGE
So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen
every day.
At this moment, Anne comes into the scene.
She hesitates as
she hears Bruno's answer.
BRUNO
So few murderers are caught.
The Judge moves out of the way. Bruno smiles blandly at the
ladies. One of them speaks to him.
MRS. CUNNINGHAM
Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very
interested in the subject of murder.
Anne looks more troubled, then moves on out of the scene.
BRUNO
No more than anyone else.
No more
than you, for instance.
MRS. CUNNINGHAM
Me?
I'm not interested in murder.
Bruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee,
sits down, straddling the seat, to look at them over the
back of the chair and settle down for a nice conversation.

you wanted to dispose of someone.
Your husband, for instance.

what did you say?
MRS. CUNNINGHAM
(squirms, giggling)
Well...
BRUNO
There you are, you see! There you
are! All right, now you're going --
to do a murder. How are you going
to do it? This is the fascinating
part -- how are you going to do it...I

him out in the car and when I get to
a lonely spot, knock him on the head
with a hammer, pour gasoline over
him and over the car and start the
whole thing ablaze.

deprecatingly)
And then have to walk all that way
home?
Mrs. Anderson laughs.

him away from Mrs. Cunningham. His eyes begin to close, and
slowly he falls away from the picture in a dead faint on the
floor.

breathing frantically, her eyes opening and closing. A couple
of women are feebly slapping her hands, someone else is

to his feet; then turns her attention to Mrs. Cunningham,
who has now somewhat recovered. Mrs. Cunningham is helped
to the settee. There is a babble of women's voices trying
to explain what has happened.
ANNE
(thru the babble)
Bring her upstairs.
As the two groups pass off in different directions, the few
people who ran into the scene late are asking the others
what the disturbance is. "What's wrong?" "Did she faint?"
"I didn't see anything." "What happened to him?" "Somebody
hurt?" But one small figure stands in the clear. It is
Barbara, She is still transfixed by what she has seen. Her
hands are trembling. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON HER. We see
that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened
tears are welling. Her breath is heavy.
Bruno is stretched out on a settee. He is completely out.
His collar and tie are open. Two or three of the male guests
are just leaving the room. The Senator remains behind for a
moment with Guy.
SENATOR
I thought he was a bit weird when he
arrived. Who is he?
GUY
I hardly know him, sir.
SENATOR

Guy advances, and with a sharp thrust, pushes Bruno back on
the settee.
Bruno looks and sees Guy clearly for the first time.
BRUNO
What happened? I was on a merry-go-
round somewhere. It made me dizzy.
Guy moves forward, and thrusting his hand in Bruno's open
shirt, pulls him to his feet. Bruno ignores Guy's violence
and remain puzzled.
GUY
(disgusted)
You're a mad, crazy maniac, and you
ought to be locked-up! Now will you
get out of here and let me alone?
BRUNO
But, Guy --
Guy smashes Bruno in the jaw, in utter disgust, and knocks
him back onto the settee. Bruno looks up from his sprawled
position, a dull look in his eye.
BRUNO
You shouldn't have done that, Guy.

Come on -- pull yourself together.
Do your tie up.
Bruno staggers to his feet. He fumbles at his collar.

I was about to tell you that over
the phone. But you came to such a
sudden decision. I wondered why.
GUY
(recovering quickly)
Since you sent me a key to your house,
I decided to use it -- to make a
little social call on your father.
I thought he'd be Interested to know
he his a lunatic son.
The faintest flicker of Bruno's eyes indicates the intensity
of his reaction. He stares hard at Guy.

BRUNO
Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in
assuming that you have no intention
of going ahead with our arrangement?
GUY
No intention whatsoever.
I never
had.
BRUNO
I see. You won't have any further
use for the key, then, Mr. Haines.
(he holds out his
hand and Guy gives
him the key)
Thank you very such.
As Bruno continues to stare at him, Guy takes out the Luger.
For a moment a look of fear comes into Bruno's face as he
thinks Guy will probably shoot him. After a pause, Guy tosses
the gun on the bed.
GUY
Or this.
Bruno's relief turns again to menace.
He picks up the gun
and fingers it nervously.
GUY
(kindly)
Look, Bruno. You're terribly sick.
(haltingly)
I don't know whether it's possible
for you to realize it or not. I
don't know much about these things,
Bruno. But why don't you go someplace
where you can get some treatment?
Not only for your own sake, Bruno,
but you can't go on causing more and
more destruction to anyone you happen
to meet.
Bruno pays no attention.
He rises.
TWO SHOT
Guy's arguments have made no impression on Bruno whatsoever.
He fingers the gun.
BRUNO
I don't like to be doublecrossed.

BRUNO (CONT'D)
I have a murder on my conscience,
but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines --
it's yours. And as you're the one
to profit, I think you should be the
one to pay for it.
For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with
the urge to kill Guy.
GUY
(gives up)
Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno.
We sees to have nothing further to
discuss.
Bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it
for Guy to pass through.
Guy walks toward the stairs, tense and apprehensive. Bruno
is following him, still holding the gun. When the Great
Dane sees Bruno it gets to its feet, as if waiting for a
command.
Guy starts down the stairs but Bruno stays where he is, the
dog beside him. Gay turns and looks back it this tableaux
of menace.
BRUNO
Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot
you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb
mother.
(with a feeling of
power)
I'm a very clever follow. I'll think
of something better than that. Much
better.

Bruno remains in the foreground of the scene as Guy proceeds
on down the stairs. We see him open the front door and pass

Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I

scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous
as a murder.
(she gives a short
little laugh)
ANNE
(desperately)
But, Mrs. Antony, you've got to make
him do something about this. Don't
you see that just one word from him
would extricate Guy from this dreadful
situation?
MRS. ANTONY
(lightly)
Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this
thing must be some practical joke.
You know, Bruno sometimes goes too
far.
(girl to girl)
Of course I shouldn't be saying this
to an outsider, but sometimes he's
terribly irresponsible and gets into
all kinds of escapades.

You must come again sometime.
She goes out. Anne is left helpless, standing in the middle
of the room. She picks up her purse and is about to go when
she hears a voice:
BRUNO'S VOICE
Oh, Miss Burton!
Anne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA

BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding
from behind
a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously
heard the
entire conversation between Anne and his mother.
Bruno rises.
He is in dressing gown and pajamas.
BRUNO
I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful,
was she?
(he strolls toward
Anne)
You know she hasn't been well for a
long time. She's a little -- how
shall I say -- confused.

commiseratingly)
Poor mother.
Anne is too stunned to speak.
BRUNO
You know, I'm very upset with Guy.
He shouldn't have sent you on an
errand like this.
ANNE
Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony.
BRUNO
He's been leading you up the garden

takes something out of the
pocket of his dressing gown and
looks down at it in his hand.
It is Guy's lighter.
Suddenly
he stuffs it back his pocket
and turn back to Anne.
BRUNO
Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he
tried to get me to go back to the
island one night after dark and pick
up his lighter so the police wouldn't
find it? He dropped it there, you
know, when -- well, that night.
Anne's horror is growing.
BRUNO
The whole thing's been worrying me
so much. But of course I couldn't
do it, Miss Burton. It would have
been too risky. And besides, it
would have made me an accessory.
Anne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee.
She
starts to cry in sheer frustration. Bruno goes to her
sympathetically.
BRUNO
Miss Burton, I know how you feel.
He puts his hand on her shoulder. Anne flings it off. There
is an awkward pause as Bruno looks down at her. Then he
begins to look around restlessly.
BRUNO
Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I
have an urgent appointment.

falling. They get right underneath one horse.

CLOSEUP FROM HIS VIEWPOINT
We see the big horse's head above and its hoofs coming down
toward the CAMERA and filling the screen. We get a faint
impression of the screaming mother hugging her child to her
breast, above.
BIG CLOSEUP THE HORSE'S HOOFS
striking Guy's head.
CLOSE SHOT
Guy wrenches himself out of this position. He rolls away
from the CAMERA right to the edge of the merry-go-round. He
manages to grab a rail.
MED. SHOT
Guy's body is flung out horizontally. We see the crowd behind
back-up for fear of being knocked over. The screw of tension
increase. Over this comes the sound of an approaching
ambulance siren.
CLOSE SHOT
Bruno edges himself toward Guy. He is hanging on to the
reins of a horse. His feet manage to roach Guy's knuckles.

CLOSEUP
Machinery and the lever that was pulled on too fast. The
Boatman's hand comes up into the picture and pulls the lever
over.
LONG SHOT
The sudden braking causes the whole merry-go-round to topple
over with a grinding roar.
LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ANGLE
The merry-go-round his keeled over. For a moment we don't
know who has survived. There is a surge of people milling
and shouting. Those who have jumped back out of the way
when the merry-go-round toppled, now rush forward again as
the cloud of dust settles. From the midway in the background
others are running forward.
MED. LONG SHOT
Distraught parents try to force their way to their children
who were on the merry-go-round, but are hold back from the
wreckage by police.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
Guy is somewhat stunned from his fall. He is helped to his
feet by some men in the crowd. His knuckles are bleeding.
In the background people are rushing about. The crowd is in
uproar as women and children are helped from the wreckage.
Officials and uniformed policemen pushing back the surge of
the crowd.
AD LIBS
Get back. Get back there.
Give us
room here.
Turley and Campbell rush in to Guy.
TURLEY
Are you all right, Haines?
GUY
Yes, I think so.

Guy is surrounded by police and Campbell stands at his elbow.
At this moment the boatman runs in. One of the detectives
is with him.
DETECTIVE
Mr. Turley! Mr. Turley!
(indicating boatman)
He says this isn't the man we want.
(with a nod in Guy's
direction)
It's the other one -- the one he was
fighting with.
TURLEY
(stops to give his
full attention to
this unexpected bit
of information)
What
do you mean, this isn't the --
(turns to Guy, not
quite taking it in)
Not
Haines?
(back to boatman)
But
you said he was. You pointed
him
out.
BOATMAN
No, I didn't, sir. I've never seen
this man before in my life. I meant
the other one.
The detective who was holding Guy instinctively relax his
hold on Guy's arm. Turley turns to Guy, puzzled.
TURLEY
What is this all about, Haines?
Did
you know he killed your wife?
GUY
(nods)
He has my cigarette
lighter and wanted
to plant it there on
the island to
pin the whole thing
on me.
(urgently)
Let me talk to him.
Let me show
you. Where is he?
ANOTHER DETECTIVE
Over here.
He leads the way.
They follow.

MED. CLOSE SHOT
as Guy and Turley enter to the
spot where Bruno is pinned
under the overturned machine.
He is caught between two of
the horses, the head of one of
them across his chest. Bruno's
head sags back somewhat, but is
resting on pieces of debris.
A uniformed policeman looks up
from Bruno to Turley:
POLICEMAN
This one's in a pretty bad way, Mr.
Turley.
Guy is shocked at the sight of Bruno.
GUY
(looking down at Bruno)
Can't you get that stuff off him?
POLICEMAN
No, they've done everything they can
until the crane comes.
Bruno opens his eyes and sees Guy.
BRUNO
Hello, Guy.
Turley has leaned forward to look at the helpless Bruno.
BRUNO
(weakly nodding at
Turley)
Who's that?
GUY
This is Mr. Turley, Chief of Police.
BRUNO
(with a half smile)
So they got you at last, eh, Guy?
Guy looks around desperately, frustrated for a moment as
Turley eyes him stonily. Then he turns again to Bruno.
GUY
(rather gently)
Can you talk a little? Can you tell
the chief you have my lighter?

BRUNO
(with a faint,
quizzical smile)
I haven't got it. It's still on the
island where you left it.
Guy looks around helplessly to Turley, who looks back at him
suspiciously.
DETECTIVE
(looking down at Bruno)
I think he's going.
Turley leans over to look.
CLOSE SHOT BRUNO'S FIST FROM TURLEY'S VIEWPOINT
As Bruno is dying, his closed fist slowly starts to open.
DETECTIVE'S VOICE
He's finished.
Guy's lighter is now revealed in Bruno's open hand.
MED. SHOT GROUP
Turley takes the lighter from the dead Bruno's hand. Guy is
watching him. Turley straightens up and holds the lighter
out to him.
TURLEY
Is this your lighter, Haines?
Guy nods without speaking, and with a half look in Bruno's
direction.
TURLEY
Well, you were right.
(sticks the lighter
into his own pocket)
I'd better keep this for the time
being.
(in a friendly tone)
We can clear the whole thing out the
morning. How about staying in town
over night, Haines? I imagine you
have a lot to tell me. Nine o'clock,
all right?

GUY
(nods)
Okay, Mr. Turley.
Thanks.
Turley turns back to the group around Bruno. Guy looks down
for a moment at Bruno, then speaks to the boatman, who is
standing nearby.
GUY
Can you tell me where there's a
telephone?
BOATMAN
(indicating)
There's one up near the entrance.
(with a look back to
the dead Bruno)
Who was he, Bud?
Guy looks back sympathetically in Bruno's direction, speaks
without looking at the boatman.
GUY
Bruno. Bruno Antony.
(reminiscently and a
little
compassionately,
remembering what
Bruno had said of
himself)
A very clever fellow.
He moves off through the crowd.
DISSOLVE TO:
Anne, Barbara and the Senator are sitting silently in the
attitudes of waiting. The telephone rings. Anne is instantly
on her feet. Barbara and the Senator watch her anxiously as
she goes to answer it.
ANNE
(into phone)
Hello...
(impatiently)
Yes, operator, yes!
(waits a moment, then
eagerly:)
Guy?

ANNE (CONT'D)
(a pause, then she
closes her eyes with
heartfelt relief.
Another pause, then:)
Yes, darling, yes. Of course I'll
be there...Goodbye.
She hangs up, turns slowly, to face Barbara and her father.
Her expression is one of intense relief.
ANNE
Guy'll be back tomorrow.
(overcome with emotion
she has difficulty
in speaking)
He wants me to take him some things.
With a sob, Barbara flings herself into Anne's arms. As she
cries, Anne strokes her head comfortingly. Then with a half-
choked sobs Anne, too, begins to cry. She speaks through
her tears, looking over Barbara's shoulder at her father.
ANNE
He says he looks silly in his tennis
clothes.
The Senator eyes them a moment, then speaks a little wryly:
SENATOR
I presume from all those tears that
you have had good news.
DISSOLVE TO:
Anne and Guy are sitting quietly together. Opposite them is
a man in a clerical collar who is reading a sports magazine.
On the cover is a picture of a tennis player in action. The
man looks over the top of his magazine at Guy, with
recognition. He leans forward.
CLERIC
I beg your pardon, but aren't you
Guy Haines?
GUY
(uncomfortably)
Yes.

Guy and Anne exchange a
brief look, rise hurriedly and start
to walk away before the
conversation can go any farther.
The cleric looks after
them with a frown and a puzzled shrug
of his shoulders, as if
to say, "Did I
say something wrong?"
FADE OUT.
