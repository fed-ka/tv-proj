      The Sun setting on humanity.  

      We SOAR over an endless sea of gray concrete HIGH RISES that 
      stretch out to the horizon under a blackened sky.

      We hear a cross-fade of media voices, reporting in all 
      languages of the world; Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, and finally 
      English.  An Ed Bradley-esque, anchor emeritus type voice. 

                                  NATIONAL ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    ...And we are approaching the hour, 
                    once again, when the eyes of the 
                    world are fixed on one place:  Hope 
                    Plaza, at the base of the Ozarks 
                    here in southern Missouri...

      Our aerial view centers on an expansive plateau completely 
      cleared of buildings, except for ONE.  It sits at the 
        intersection of two massive ovals of blinking light - twin 
      particle accelerator rings measuring 40 miles in length.


      A coordinated ROLLING BLACKOUT snuffs out the lights of 
        civilization all the way out to the horizon.

      The only light is Hope Plaza, the twin particle accelerator 
      loops form the symbol for infinity.


      And suddenly Jim is running through a wide-open field, still 
      pumping adrenaline but disoriented from the sensory overload 
      of SUNLIGHT!  TREES!  GRASS!  BLUE SKY!  WHAM!  A Rifle butt 
      to the gut knocks his wind out and Jim goes down hard.

      Jim gasps for air.  A man with a GRIZZLY beard looms over him 
      in a faded Marine uniform. 

                                    GRIZZLY MARINE
                    Where you runnin  to?

      Jim, trying to breathe, rolls on his side, and takes in a 
      puzzling sight: SETTLERS having their packs taken by SOLDIERS 
      with unkempt uniforms and hair nowhere near regulation.

                                  MARINE 2
                    All packs open for inspection!  
                    Your items will be returned!

      Most people hand over their supplies, though with confusion, 
      as this was not what they were prepared for. 

      A few people resist. One beautiful WOMAN (MYRA) in particular 
      struggles with a Marine.

                                  MYRA
                    Careful! That s delicate equipment!

      He shoves her away, tears open the pack.  Myra grabs him and 
      KNEES him in the groin. Another Marine grabs her from behind 
      and throws her to the ground, puts his rifle to her head.  
      SCIENTIFIC GEAR spills out of her pack and onto the turf. 

      Jim suddenly becomes aware of the Grizzly Marine behind him 
      about to SLICE OPEN his pack with a HUNTING KNIFE.  Before he 
      knows it Jim s GUN is at Grizzly s throat.

                                  JIM
                    Don t.

      Grizzly freezes.  Four more Marines SWARM, aiming rifles at 
      Jim, yelling for him to DROP IT.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    NO!

      Liz screams as she runs over, Josh and Maddy behind her.                                                                                    10.


                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Please!  My baby s in there!

                                  MARINE 2
                    What?

      Elizabeth kneels and opens the pack... And a ten year old 
      girl, CLEMENTINE, crawls out!  Spits a breathing tube from 
      her mouth and crawls into her Mother s arms, crying.  

      The Marines are stunned.  Jim surrenders his gun to Grizzly.

                                  JIM
                    I m sorry.  Here.

      Grizzly snatches it, stands back with the Marines.  Elizabeth 
      tries to calm her daughter.  

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Mommy...

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Shh, we made  it.  We made it.

      All eyes, and four assault rifles, are on the Shannon family 
      huddled together as we...

      FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    11.


                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

      CLOSE ON CLEMENTINE SHANNON

      Being carried by her Dad.  Her face turned to the sky.

        CLEMENTINE S P.O.V. - THE SKY

      Gigantic and blue, filled with a breathtaking cloudscape.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                          (whispering in Jim s ear)
                    Look, Daddy.  Clouds.

                                  JIM
                    Yeah.

      Jim glances up.  Then straight ahead.  The sky may as well be 
      a dream, because he s here, on the ground, forced to march 
      along with his family and the other NEW ARRIVALS into...


      Imagine a border town in the Old West but with modern 
      thinking applied.  Solar panels and wind turbines powering 
      technology, integrated with primitive construction.

      The New Arrivals are directed to sit on the ground in a 
      grassy clearing in front of a COMMAND COMPOUND, a two-story 
      building that looks like a forest ranger headquarters.

      The Shannon family is being escorted by four Marines who box 
      them in.  Grizzly Marine stops them from sitting.

                                    GRIZZLY MARINE
                    Not you.  You stand.

      He beckons over a BALD MAN with glasses. 

                                    GRIZZLY MARINE (CONT D)
                    Tell Frank we got a problem with 
                    the count.  He s gonna want to see 
                    this one for himself.

      The Bald Man nods and heads off.  

      As the new arrivals sit, Jim takes in the CITIZENS of Taylor 
      standing behind them, ringing the plaza.  They have been  in-
      country  for a while, their clothes faded and sometimes mis-
      matched as evidence of bartering.  Some hold flowers and 
      baskets of goods.                                                                                      12.


      Jim spots a homemade textile banner reading,  WELCOME 2149!   
      Their heads are craning, curious to check our the newcomers, 
      whereas everyone new seems anxious and concerned.

      The Shannon s feel eyes from both groups, as they stick out 
      with their armed escort.  Jim notices three other people 
      (including Myra) being forced to stand just like them.

      Suddenly, a burst of GUNFIRE snaps everyone s attention to 
      the building.  A MAN walks out onto the veranda.  Piercing 
      blue eyes and rugged good looks, wearing a military uniform 
      and some kind of giant tooth hanging from his neck.  The 
      veteran citizens CHEER like he s some kind of rock star.  

                                  JOSH
                          (in awe)
                    No way.  Lieutenant Taylor?

                                    GRIZZLY MARINE
                    Commander Taylor.  Shut your mouth.

      COMMANDER FRANK TAYLOR quiets the crowd, smiling.

                                  FRANK
                    Citizens of 2149, welcome to 
                    Taylor.  Apologies for the rough 
                    landing, all will become clear 
                    shortly.  My name is Commander 
                    Frank Taylor.  This town is named 
                    after me, as I was the first to set 
                    foot here.

      A buzz spreads through the assembled arrivals.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Yes, I know.  Reports of my death 
                    out in the wilderness have been 
                    greatly exaggerated.  It s not the 
                    only truth that s been stretched 
                    over the tightbeam.  Here is the 
                    truth on the ground: One, I am in 
                    charge.  Two, as long as I am in 
                    charge, you are safe.

      On Jim, who doesn t feel safe.  Frank gestures to GENERAL 
      HYATT, who stands rigid but worn down, humiliated, off to the 
      side of the veranda near more of Frank s men.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    I assumed control from General 
                    Hyatt one year ago.  It was a 
                    necessary action, taken to save 
                    lives, because too many good people 
                    were dying.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    13.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    They were dying because they had 
                    been lied to.  They were told that 
                    peaceful coexistence with this 
                      environment was possible.  It is 
                    not.  They were told they had to 
                    work and live in Taylor for a year, 
                    and then caravan to the outer 
                      settlements, to make room for the 
                    next wave of folks to come through 
                    that portal.  The outer settlements 
                    are gone. Destroyed.

      The New Arrivals are audibly shocked.  Frank is grim.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    I was at Triple Junction when it 
                    was overrun by Allosaurs.  On that 
                    day, my mission became clear.  
                    Under my protection, none of you 
                    will be forced to walk senselessly 
                    into death.  You are safe within 
                    these walls!  And you are free 
                    within these walls, as long as you 
                    obey the law.

      He glances at the Shannons, and other standing lawbreakers. 
      Then gestures at a fat man, BEN DUIRWYN, to his right.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    We value hard work and free trade.  
                    Ben Duirwyn runs the barter 
                    exchange.  Register with him, 
                    establish a line of credit, and 
                    receive points for your supplies.  

      Frank gestures to the crowd standing behind the arrivals.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    The good people of Taylor have been 
                    as eager to meet you as I have.  
                    They ve planned a welcome week to 
                    help get you started.  Let me be 
                    the first of them to say, Citizens 
                    of Terra Nova - welcome home! 

      The Citizens sweep in among the New Arrivals, helping them to 
      their feet, greeting them with warm smiles and welcoming 
      hugs.  The New Arrivals smile back, dazed but relieved as 
      they are brought into the fold. 

      The Shannon family is prodded to move.  

                                    GRIZZLY MARINE
                    No hugs for you.  Get movin .                                                                                    14.


      The Shannon s are escorted up to the Command Compound.


      Jim is escorted by Grizzly into the  suburbs  of Taylor, a 
      campground of quick-build tent houses like the ones in New 
      Orleans.  Individually decorated and lamp-lit.  

                                    GRIZZLY MARINE
                    344.  Tenth down on the left.

      Grizzly drops Jim off at a row.  Jim makes his way down.


      Jim leads his family outside.  They are immediately struck by 
      the sight of an incredible NIGHT SKY, glittering with stars.                                                                                      21.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    Oh my God...

                                  JOSH
                    Were there more stars in the sky 
                    back then?  I mean, now?

                                  MADDY
                    Think we can just finally see  em, 
                    past the smog.

      Clem, in her Father s arms, presses a finger to her temple.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    I am going to remember this.

      Jim looks at her, amused.

                                  JIM
                    You re deciding to remember this 
                    moment?

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Yeah.

                                  JIM
                    Me too.

      Off the Shannon s, feeling nothing is impossible...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Night becomes day.  An armed SENTRY patrols a catwalk above 
      the fifteen foot high MAIN GATE, just down the way from 
      Central Plaza.

      Below, the WARDEN, a mean Scottish bastard, hands a duffle 
      bag filled with MINES to Jim.

                                  WARDEN
                    Shannon.  Babymaker.  You get the 
                    mine bag.

      Warden hands TWO SHOVELS to a nervous looking guy, FRASER.

                                  WARDEN (CONT D)
                    Fraser. Veggie Thief. You get the 
                    shovels.

                                  JIM
                    What do you get?                                                                                    22.


                                  WARDEN
                    I get the shotgun, to watch you 
                    lot.  Also, the disarmer.
                          (to Bardo)
                    Where s our last scrub?

      BARDO, an aboriginal MAORI guide, shrugs.  He wears camo 
      pants, no shirt, and has thermal goggles.  Jim hefts the mine 
      bag, approaches his family, kneels in front of Clem.

                                  JIM
                    Stay near Mommy, okay?

      She nods.  Jim stands, looks Josh in the eye.

                  JIM (CONT D)JOSH
      Find work.Get a job.

      Jim turns to Maddy.  Nods to Central Plaza behind her.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    You, too.  And stay out of the 
                    politics.
                          (to family)
                    We keep our heads down, we don t 
                    give anyone trouble, we don t give 
                    anyone a reason to give us trouble.
                          (to Liz)
                    I ll see you at sundown.

                                  LIZ
                    Bet your ass.

      They kiss, hard.  The kids don t look away.

                                  WARDEN
                    Finally, we re all here.  Let s go!

      Jim turns to see the beautiful MYRA reporting for duty.

                                  FRASER
                    Whoah.  Wonder what she did?

      The MAIN GATE opens, moaning, and Jim steps out with the 
      motley crew into TERRA NOVA.  He turns, a last lingering look 
      back at his family as the gate SHUTS.


      Directly outside the main gate, they pass through a NO-MAN S 
      LAND of cleared ground - the forest has been cut here, the 
      mines removed.  SENTRIES on top the wall provide armed cover.

      Jim passes marking for new homes laid out in rope.                                                                                    23.


      They soon reach the FOREST WALL.  Jim glances at Myra.  She 
      is trying to remain stoic, but even she can t help but be 
      awed by the beauty of this place.  

                                  WARDEN
                          (points to Jim and Myra)
                    Alright, you two are team one.  
                    Bardo, you dig with the vegetable 
                    thief.  We re walking into a live 
                    field here, scrubs.  Follow our 
                    footsteps unless you wanna go BOOM.

      Warden and Bardo slip on THERMAL GOGGLES.  Jim, Myra, and 
      Fraser huddle behind them as they head into the JUNGLE.


      A different kind of jungle.  A bustling hive of activity, 
      half Farmers Market, half Black Market/bazaar.  Citizens mix 
      with New Arrivals, who marvel at the sight of animal hides 
      and real food - meat smoking on a grill, fruit in baskets.   
      Someone is doing an impressive set on a primitive drum.   

      Find the Shannon family in a long line leading up to an open 
      tent - the barter exchange.  A woman, JAN, walks along the 
      line with a basket full of yellow-orange WILD TOMATOES.  

                                  JAN
                    Welcome Week Special!  Free 
                    tomatoes!  One per person, please!

      The Shannons take the tomatoes.  Josh and Maddy hand theirs 
      to Liz, who quickly pockets them along with her own (save 
      them for later).  But Clem is already BITING into hers - her 
      eyes light up as juice runs down her chin.  Jan smiles.

                                  JAN (CONT D)
                          (to Liz)
                    My favorite part.  The look on 
                    their faces.
                          (to Clem)
                    First taste of real food, eh?

      Clem nods, stunned.

                                  MADDY
                    Is it really that good?

      Clem nods, stunned.  Maddy and Josh look to Liz, who sighs, 
      hands them back their tomatoes.  They bite, unaccustomed to 
      the skin and juice of non-synthetic fruit.                                                                                    24.


      Josh, his senses alive, notices TWO GIRLS HIS AGE (veteran 
      citizens), walking the market and sizing up the new boys.

                                  JOSH
                    I m gonna do some networking.  See 
                    if I can find a line on some work.

      Liz nods, uneasy as he walks off into the crowd.

                                  MADDY
                    Me, too.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Not yet.  Stay by me.

                                  MADDY
                    You just let Josh go.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN (O.S.)
                    Next!

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Josh is twenty.

                                  MADDY
                    And I m eighteen.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN (O.S.)
                    NEXT!

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (squeezing Maddy s hand)
                    Just stay by me, okay?

      Elizabeth steps up to BEN DUIRWYN, the Barter Master.  A one 
      man craigslist meets Jabba the Hutt, but less moral.  He 
      stares down over his laptop, impatient.

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Shannon.

      Ben scrolls through his files.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    Shannon.  Shannon... oh, the 
                      lawbreakers.  

      Liz feels eyes on her.  She pulls Clementine close.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We were cleared by Commander 
                    Taylor...                                                                                    25.


                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Don t trade with  em!

      Liz speaks to Ben, but loud enough for everyone to hear.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    And we re prepared to work harder 
                    to pull our weight.  My husband is 
                    on perimeter duty, right now.
                          (lower)
                    We want our supplies like everyone 
                    else.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    You don t get your supplies.  You 
                    get points to buy  em back, and I 
                    assign the points.  Based on the 
                    value of your items and what you 
                    have to contribute.
                          (regards laptop)
                    Now, it says here you re-trained in 
                    medicine, specializing in botanical 
                    and herbal remedies.
                          (looks at her)
                    What was your job before that?  
                    Lemme guess.  Dancer?

                                  ELIZABETH
                      Librarian.  How many points do I 
                    get?

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    Well, that depends on what you re 
                    willing to trade, and like you 
                    said, how hard you re willing to 
                    work...

      He looks her up and down.  Liz nods, she understands.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    You know what, it s too bad.  In 
                    your condition, you could ve used 
                    my help.  Come on, Clem.

      She takes Clem s hand to leave.  Ben sits up straight.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    What?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We get it, you don t want to deal 
                    with  criminals.                                                                                     26.


                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                      Condition.  What condition?

      Liz stops, slowly turns back.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    That sore.  On your hand.
                          (he looks down at it)
                    How long s it been like that?

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    This?  I don t know, a week?  It s 
                    not really a sore...

                                  ELIZABETH
                    There s a quick way to tell.  Show 
                    me your gums.
                          (Ben grins, it s gross)
                    Open up.
                          (Ben opens his mouth)
                    Are you urinating more frequently 
                    this week?

      Ben closes his mouth.  She just nailed him.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    Like a race horse...

                                  ELIZABETH
                    It s alright, it s not serious yet.  
                    Though you should come see me 
                    sooner this week than later.  We ll 
                    clear it up for you.

                                  BEN DUIRWYN
                    I have some time tomorrow...

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Fine.
                          (walks away, turns back)
                    Oh, and I don t accept credit, so 
                    bring our stuff, okay?

      She and Clem get a few steps away.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    That was good, Mom.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Thanks.

      Liz s smile drops as she realizes Maddy has SLIPPED AWAY.                                                                                    27.


                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Where s your sister?


      CLOSE ON A MINE, as Myra plants it in the ground.  A thick 
      MILLIPEDE crawls nearby as she arms it, sweating.

      Jim stands by with a shovel.  He alternates from focusing on 
      the mine, to scanning the primeval forest around him.  He's 
      never been surrounded by so much life.  A giant DRAGONFLY the 
      size of a turkey buzzes right by him. 

      Jim ducks, almost whacks Myra with the shovel.

                                  MYRA
                    You mind?  Trying not to die here.

      Bardo the Maori looks up from planting his mine.

                                  BARDO
                          (re: Dragonfly)
                    No danger.  He s harmless.

                                  JIM
                    Whatever you say.

      Jim shovels dirt on top of the mine.  Myra pulls a new one.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    You don t seem too phased by all 
                    this.  My guess is you weren t on 
                    the lottery, like me.
                          (beat, no reply)
                      Paleobotanist?

                                  MYRA
                      Seismologist.

                                  JIM
                      Earthquakes, right.  Figured you 
                    were a specialist.  What s your 
                    name?

                                  MYRA
                          (cold)
                    How about we get this done and 
                    flirt on the way back.

                                  JIM
                    Okay.  I mean, I just asked your 
                    name.  I wasn t flirting.                                                                                    28.


                                  MYRA
                    Myra.  Happy now?

                                  JIM
                    I m Jim.  James.  I m married.

                                  MYRA
                      Congratulations, Jim-James.

                                  WARDEN
                    Less talking, more planting!

      Jim grips the shovel, stares at Warden, who dead-eyes him 
      back, hand on shotgun.  Jim keeps his head down, and digs.


      Josh is chatting up the two girls, JESSICA and KIM.  They are 
      flirting, hungry to talk to new guys, and Josh is cute.

                                    JESSICA
                    Miami, originally.

                                  KIM
                    London.  Jess was on the fifth 
                      pilgrimage, I was on the seventh.

                                  JOSH
                    Yeah, I think I remember you from 
                    TV.  Were you on  Travelers? 

                                  KIM
                    I was.  Is that still on?

                                  JOSH
                    Yeah, they follow a new group of 
                    kids every year, in the months 
                    leading up to the jump.

                                    JESSICA
                    What about you, Josh?  What s your 
                    story?

                                  JOSH
                    Well, that s what I m here to 
                    figure out, right?  You guys are 
                    the experts, I was hoping maybe you 
                    could show me around, point me in 
                    the direction of some Hunters.

                                  KIM
                    Are you a hunter, Josh?                                                                                    29.


                                    JESSICA
                    We love our hunters.

                                  JOSH
                    It s what I trained in.  I want to 
                    apply to the Raptors Clan.

      Kim and Jessica exchange a grin.  

                                  KIM
                    We know where they hang.  Come on.

      Josh smiles and takes her hand.


      In the center of the bustling plaza, Maddy has wormed her way 
      into a democratic circle of concerned citizens, both new and 
      old, who are asking many of the same questions as she is.

                                  NEW ARRIVAL
                    I just don t understand why were 
                    weren t told.

                                  MADDY
                    Isn t it obvious?  They don t know.  
                    They only know what they re told 
                    over the tightbeam.

                                    VETERAN CITIZEN
                      Government lied to us, Taylor s 
                    just returning the favor.

                                  PARISIAN
                          (accented English)
                    To me, it seems he s doing 
                      everything wrong. Overpopulation...

                                  MADDY
                    Over-use of resources.  I agree.

                                    VETERAN CITIZEN
                    Guys.  Guys.  I m telling you, 
                    Taylor saved our asses.  My family 
                    was set to caravan out to Triple 
                    Junction one week before he came 
                    back.  We would ve been wiped out.

                                  WALTER
                    Triple Junction still stands.

      Everyone turns to look at WALTER, 55, gnarled and bitter.                                                                                    30.


                                    VETERAN CITIZEN
                    Oh, give it a rest, Walter.

                                  WALTER
                    So do the other outposts.  They re 
                    alive and well, they just been cut 
                    off by our glorious protector.

                                  MADDY
                    Why?

                                  ROBBIE
                    You guys need to keep your voices 
                    down.

      ROBBIE, a young, intense man, looks directly at Maddy.

                                  ROBBIE (CONT D)
                    People who ask the wrong questions, 
                    or ask them too loud, tend to 
                      disappear.

                                    VETERAN CITIZEN
                    Oh, come on.

      Veteran Citizen leaves the circle.  Robbie looks at Maddy.

                                  ROBBIE
                    And to answer your question - no 
                    one knows.  Just like no one knows 
                    what really happened to Frank 
                    Taylor while he was out there for 
                    two years.  

                                  WALTER
                    Robbie here is right.  Taylor is 
                    hiding something, I m not sure 
                    what.  All I know is those land-
                    mines are meant to keep the sheep 
                    in, more than the wolves out.
                          (leans in, whispers)
                    Don t be fooled by the fear 
                      mongering.  The real threat ain t 
                    out there.  It s right-

      SCREEKAWWW!!!  A DARK LEATHERY BLUR wipes frame, RIPPING 
      Walter into the sky and knocking Maddy, Robbie, and the rest 
      of the circle to the ground.   

      Maddy, dazed, looks up to see Walter is GONE.  Someone 
      SCREAMS.  Then an ALARM BELL SOUNDS across the square.

      Everyone in the Central Plaza SCATTERS in every direction, 
      running for cover, ducking under carts, into buildings.                                                                                    31.


      Maddy rises to her feet in the middle of the chaos, finds 
      herself unable to move, paralyzed by fear.

                                  MADDY
                    MOM!

                                  ELIZABETH
                    RUN!

      Maddy sees her Mom barreling toward her with Clem.  Liz grabs 
      Maddy and they run together, across the square.  

                                  JOSH
                    Mom!  Under here!  Under here!

      They turn to see Josh, hiding under a TEXTILE CART with Kim 
      and Jessica, and a few other Citizens.  The Shannon women 
      duck under with them.  

      The sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE draws everyone s gaze up to a 
      SENTRY TOWER, where a Marine fires bursts into the sky.

      High above, we can see the shapes of three PTERODONS 
      circling, riding the thermals.  The gunfire scares them off, 
      and they fly away, having grabbed one treat.  

      Josh can t help but be awe-struck by the creatures.

                                  JOSH (CONT D)
                      Unbelievable...

      Clementine cries into Elizabeth s shoulder.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    I wanna go home!

      Elizabeth holds her tight as we...

      FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    32.


                                      ACT THREE


      Jim stops digging for a moment, listening.  He can barely 
      hear the Alarm in the distance.

                                  MYRA
                    Come on.  Hurry up.

                                  JIM
                    Shh.  Do you hear that?

      The Warden listens to a report on his radio.

                                  WARDEN
                          (to radio)
                    Copy.
                          (to mine party)
                    Alright, listen up.  I just got a 
                    report there was a critter attack 
                    in town.  Finish your next mine, 
                    and we ll pack it up.  

                                  MYRA
                    Now will you hurry?

                                  JIM
                    What attack?  Did it come from the 
                    south?  What kind of  critter  gets 
                    past the minefield?

      Bardo points to the sky.  Everyone s head cranes up.  Shit.  
      Jim starts to dig faster.


      Jim finishes putting dirt over the last mine.

                                  WARDEN
                    Alright, that s it.  Fall in line 
                    behind Bardo and me, go slow and 
                    we ll make it back in one piece.

      Myra catches Jim smiling.

                                  MYRA
                    What?                                                                                    35.


                                  JIM
                    My Terra Nova training was in 
                    farming.  Planting crops.

      He nods to the minefield.  She smiles a little.

                                  FRASER
                    Yeah, well my re-training was in 
                      carpentry.  So much for three years 
                    of law school, right?

      Jim gives Myra a deadpan look.  She smiles a little more.  A 
      deep BOOM sounds in the distance.  Five heads turn.

                                  JIM
                          (to Myra)
                      Earthquake?

                                  WARDEN
                    Oh, no...

      BOOM.  Deep in the forest they see an EXPLOSION.  Then an 
      INHUMAN WAIL echoes, like an exotic bird but MUCH BIGGER.  

      Then Boom BOOM BOOM!  Everyone ducks.  Three distant mines 
      detonate, rocking the perimeter.  Things are coming this way.  

                                  BARDO
                    They re not stopping.

                                  WARDEN
                    Quickly now!

      Warden, Bardo, and Fraser take off running.  Jim has dropped 
      his shovel.  He finds it, picks it up, starts to run.

                                  MYRA
                    WAIT!

      Jim turns.  Myra is standing there, frozen with fear.        
      Jim looks around.  Nothing is here.

                                  JIM
                    What?  Run!

                                  MYRA
                    I think I armed it.

      REVEAL she has stepped on a mine.  One they just planted.

      Jim turns.  The others are fleeing further into the forest.

                                  JIM
                    HEY!  STOP!                                                                                    36.


      They don t.  Either they can t hear, or don t care.  Jim 
      turns back, locks eyes with Myra, caught in a dilemma.  A 
      pure human moment of truth.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Okay okay.  Don t move.

                                  MYRA
                    You think?

                                  JIM
                    I m gonna get them.  The Warden.

                                  MYRA
                    No.

                                  JIM
                    Yes!  He has a disarmer.

                                  MYRA
                    No, Jim, NO!

                                  JIM
                    If you move, you re dead!

                                  MYRA
                    I m already dead!

      Boom.  Another mine explodes in another part of the forest.

                                  MYRA (CONT D)
                    Damn it, I can t BELIEVE this.  You 
                    have to listen to me, okay?  
                    There s something I have to tell 
                    you.  Something very important.

                                  JIM
                    You don t have to-

                                  MYRA
                    I m not a seismologist!

      That wasn t what he expected to hear.

                                  JIM
                    What?

                                  MYRA
                    I work for the government, do you 
                      understand?  That was my cover, I m 
                    not a god damn seismologist, I m 
                    here for a mission.  That mission 
                    has an objective.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    37.

                                  MYRA (CONT'D)
                    The objective must be achieved, and 
                    I can t let my death get in the way 
                    of that.

                                  JIM
                          (head is spinning)
                    We don t... we don t have time for 
                    this.

                                  MYRA
                    You re right.  So you need to 
                    listen up.  Because in a minute, 
                    you are going to leave me.  You ll 
                    have to, to survive.  And you must 
                    survive.

      Off Jim...


      Myra and Jim, still in their mine-stalemate.

                                  MYRA
                    They sent me here to find out, and 
                    report back.

                                  JIM
                    Report back how?

                                  MYRA
                    Portable Transmitter, broken down 
                    and concealed in my pack.  The 
                    antennae is inside the tripod...

                                  JIM
                    Oh, man...

                                  MYRA
                    Listen.  The tightbeam synchronizer 
                    is hidden in the seismograph.  And 
                    the third piece, the Encoder Beacon-

      She removes a small white component the size of a pillbox 
      from her belt.  The ENCODER BEACON.

                                  MYRA (CONT D)
                    You can take with you right now.

                                  JIM
                    No.

                                  MYRA
                    You have to do this, Jim.  You have 
                    to warn the future, so they can 
                    send a damn battalion through that 
                    portal.  I can t do it.                                                                                      40.


                                  JIM
                    Wrong.  You re gonna do it.  I m 
                    gonna save your life, and then you 
                    can go save the day.  Just stay 
                    alive till I get back.

      Jim turns and heads off after the Warden.

                                  MYRA
                    Jim!

      He looks back.  She throws him the Encoder Beacon.  He 
      catches it.

                                  MYRA (CONT D)
                    Just in case.

      And we follow Jim running through the forest, leaving Myra 
      standing there, alone, vulnerable.  The sun is setting...

      FADE OUT.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    41.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Liz, Maddy, and Clementine wait for Jim at the main gate.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    The sun is almost down.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Don t worry, he ll be here.

      Liz squeezes Clementine s hand.  Maddy notices all kinds of 
      Citizens heading past them down the way to Central Plaza.  We 
      can see people gathering down there, not too far away.

                                  MADDY
                    Where are all these people going?

                                  ROBBIE (O.S.)
                    There s a welcome concert tonight. 

      Robbie, the guy Maddy was talking with before, approaches.

                                  ROBBIE (CONT D)
                    Sort of a town mixer.  Part of rush 
                    week.  That s where they re going.

                                  MADDY
                    Hey.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Hey. Lost track of you before, just 
                    wanted to make sure you re okay.

                                  MADDY
                    Yeah, yeah , I m good.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Also, I didn t get your name.

      Maddy blushes.  Liz looks at her.

                                  MADDY
                    Madison.  Maddy.  This is my Mom, 
                    my sister Clementine.  Mom, this is 
                    Robbie.

      Liz smiles, shakes his hand.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    She remembers your name.  Hi.

      Maddy is appropriately mortified.  Robbie nods to her.                                                                                    42.


                                  ROBBIE
                    So, I was hoping we could finish 
                    that conversation we started.

      Maddy wants to, but...

                                  MADDY
                    We re waiting for my Dad.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Why don t you go, Maddy.  
                      Everyone s right over there.  When 
                    Dad comes in, we ll join you guys. 

      Maddy looks at her Mom, grateful.

                                  MADDY
                    Okay, I ll check back in.

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (to Robbie)
                    Nice meeting you.

      Robbie smiles, and Liz watches them head off toward Central 
      along with everyone else.  Liz looks worried.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Don t worry, Mom.  He ll be here.

      Clem squeezes Liz s hand.  Liz tries to smile for her.


      Jim emerges from the forest wall into the cleared area of No-
      Man s land.  He hollers for the rest of the group.

                                  JIM
                    WAIT!

      WIDE ANGLE OF NO MAN S LAND

      Jim is a small figure, running across the field toward the 
      three figures of the mine party, who stop.  His figure joins 
      them, and we watch all four together for a beat, bathed in 
      the glow of the setting sun.

      ANGLE - BACK ON THE GROUP

      Jim has just breathlessly finished telling them about Myra.  
      The group takes it in for a beat, grim.

                                  WARDEN
                    Well, she s dead, then.  Nothing we 
                    can do about it.                                                                                    43.


                                  JIM
                    She s not.  We can go back, you can 
                    disarm it-

                                  WARDEN
                    Are you daft?  That s suicide.

                                  JIM
                      I promised her I d get help.

                                  WARDEN
                    Then you lied.  She was a sweet 
                    piece, I ll give you that, but get 
                    your head on, man.  Situation was 
                    reversed, she d probably be here 
                    saying,
                          (high-pitched voice)
                      Oh he didn t make it. 

      Warden laughs, starts to walk away.  Fraser and Bardo follow.  
      Jim looks back to the forest, back to them.

                                  JIM
                    Look, I ll go by myself.  Just give 
                    me the disarmer. 

      Warden chuckles as he walks, doesn t even turn back.  Jim 
      heads for him, intense.  

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    I said-

      Warden turns and comes at Jim, bringing up his shotgun.

                                  WARDEN
                    You want to die, I can arrange it-

      Jim closes the distance, traps the shotgun, and CRACKS Warden 
      in the face with it, then jams him in the gut and kicks his 
      knees out from under him.  Warden goes down.  Jim stands over 
      him, shotgun in the man s face.

                                  JIM
                    Give me the damn box.

      Warden, cowering, moves to give him the disarmer.  Jim grabs 
      it, backs away, turns for the Forest.

                                  BARDO
                    Hoi, Mate.

      Jim turns back.  Bardo tosses him his Thermal Goggles.                                                                                     44.


                                  JIM
                    Thanks.

      Jim slides them around his neck, heads for the Forest.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                          (to himself)
                    What the hell are you doing?

      As he runs...


      Liz and Clementine wait at the gate.  Suddenly, there is a 
      strange horn sound, like a Shofar blast, and the Gate begins 
      to open.  Liz and Clem step back, anxious.

      The Warden stalks through the opening, glowering and holding 
      a rag to his bloody mouth.  He walks right past them.

      Bardo and Fraser follow after.  The Gate begins to close. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (to Fraser)
                    Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, 
                    where s Jim?  Jim Shannon.  Where s 
                    my husband?

                                  FRASER
                    He s still out there..

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What?  What do you mean?

      She grabs Fraser s arm.  He pulls it free.

                                  FRASER
                    It was his choice!

      Bardo lays his hand on her shoulder.

                                  BARDO
                    Your husband s very brave.  The 
                    spirits have him in their hands.  
                    They will return him.

      Elizabeth stares at him.  Clem, overwhelmed, RUNS AWAY.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Clem!

      Elizabeth runs after her daughter.

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Stop!

      She chases Clem down, stops her.  Has to kneel to the ground 
      to restrain her as Clem resists, crying.                                                                                    46.


                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Stop.  It s okay.  Daddy s okay.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    No, he s not, he s dead!  Because 
                    he s there!  Because of me!

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Listen to me.  Look at me.  You 
                    never say that.  You never say 
                    that.  
                          (beat)
                    And your father is coming back, do 
                    you hear me?  He is coming back, 
                    and when he does, we are going to 
                    be waiting for him at that gate.

      Elizabeth makes Clem looks into her eyes.

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Where are we going to be waiting 
                    for him?

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    At the gate.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Come on.

      She lifts Clem into her arms, willing it to be true.


      Jim runs through the forest which is ALIVE with chirps and 
      clicks of strange nocturnal animals and insects.

      JIM S P.O.V. - THROUGH THERMAL GOGGLES 

      The forest is a cool blue world, dotted with red patches that 
      signify land mines.  Jim avoids them.  Up ahead, he sees the 
      thermal signature of Myra.  Still standing.  Still warm.  
      Still alive.

                                  JIM
                    Myra?

                                  MYRA
                    You. Dumb. Bastard.

      Jim flips up his thermal goggles.

                                  JIM
                    Good to see you, too.                                                                                    47.


                                  MYRA
                    You still have the encoder beacon 
                    with you?

      He takes out the disarmer.  Instructions on the side.

                                  JIM
                    What?  Oh, your thing.  Just relax, 
                    you ll get it back in a second.

                                  MYRA
                    You need to turn around, you need 
                    to go back.  You need to find my 
                    gear and assemble the transmitter.  
                    The mission depends on it.

                                  JIM
                    Your mission.  Now shut up, I m 
                    trying to figure this out.
                          (reading instructions)
                    Insert into soil near mine, no more 
                    than ten inches from the...

      KLIK KLIK KLIK KLIK.

      Jim looks up as hears that sound.  Something is there, in the 
      dark, past Myra, behind that tree.  Jim slowly lowers the 
      thermal goggles back over his eyes.

      A heat signature blooms.  The unmistakable silhouette of a 
      VELOCIRAPTOR.   Myra clocks Jim s body language.

                                  MYRA
                    Jim?

      Jim takes an involuntary step back.

                                  MYRA (CONT D)
                    Jim?

      Jim reaches for the shotgun.  The Velociraptor CHARGES, a 
      thermal blur.  Myra SCREAMS as it POUNCES ON HER.

      The landmine DETONATES.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    48.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Silence.  Smoke.  The first thing we see is Jim, rising to a 
      crawling position.  His clothes torn, his head buzzing.

      There is blood on him.  His?  He checks himself.  He s whole.                                                                                    49.


      He struggles to his feet, takes a few shaky steps, trips over 
      something and goes down.

      It s the smoking body of the Velociraptor - having taken the 
      brunt of the explosion.  Jim stares at it.  Its skin covered 
      in feathers, not scales.

      Jim hears a groan.  He turns to see Myra lying in the tall 
      grass nearby.  He crawls over to her.  She is alive.  Barely.

                                  MYRA
                      Did...you... see that?

      Her right arm has been blown off.  It is her blood on him.

                                  JIM
                    Oh, God.  Myra.  Your arm...

                                  MYRA
                    Wha...?

                                  JIM
                    It s okay.  It knocked you out of 
                    the way.  You re gonna... I m gonna 
                    get you out of here.

      Jim looks around for how he s going to do that.

                                  MYRA
                    The encoder...

                                  JIM
                    Shh.  Save your strength.

      A sound of grass being crunched.  Something is coming.  Jim 
      looks around frantically for the shotgun.

      A TORCH appears, and with it BARDO.  Two more MAORI RANGERS, 
      his sons, are with him.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    Bardo!  She s hurt.

      Bardo motions his sons toward the Velociraptor.  He kneels 
      down next to Jim and Myra.   Examines her wound.

                                  BARDO
                    Have to cauterize that.

      Jim leans back, alarmed, as Bardo lowers the TORCH to her.  
      Myra s mouth opens WIDE in shock, and then she passes out.  
      Jim feels for her pulse.  It s there.  He exhales.                                                                                    50.


                                  BARDO (CONT D)
                    Your wife wants to see you.

      Jim blinks at the matter-of-fact Maori for a beat.

                                  JIM
                    Let s not keep her waiting.

      They heft Myra up between them, carrying her off.

      TILT DOWN to the grass, to show the little white pillbox 
      component, Myra s ENCODER BEACON, has fallen out of Jim s 
      pocket to the forest floor, left behind...


      TWO MARINES and the Warden walk up to Elizabeth and 
      Clementine.  

                                  MARINE 2
                    Ladies, I m gonna have to ask you 
                    to leave this area.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    My Dad is coming back.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We re waiting for Jim Shannon.

                                  WARDEN
                    So are we.  We re gonna arrest him, 
                    the second he comes in those gates, 
                    if he ever does.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Why?  I heard he went to rescue 
                    someone-

                                  WARDEN
                    He s a security risk.  He took my 
                    gun.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    He has a gun?

                                  WARDEN
                    He has my gun.

                                  MARINE 2
                    We ll let you know when he arrives.

      Elizabeth picks up Clementine, carries her away.                                                                                    51.


                                  ELIZABETH
                          (hopeful)
                    He has a gun.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Is that good?


      The Welcome Concert is in full swing.                                                                                    53.


      On the veranda of the Command Compound, a few musically 
      inclined citizens are playing an acoustic version of an 
      ancient oldie by Fleetwood Mac.

      The strange effect of pop music in Pangaea doing wonders to 
      bring together the New Arrivals and veteran Citizens, who 
      mingle together on the grassy plaza, under torchlight, 
      breathing in the clean, tropical air.

      Find Maddy and Robbie off to the side.  Maddy is enjoying the 
      music, and Robbie s company, though she is still wary of what 
      is going on here beneath the surface.  So is Robbie. 

                                  MADDY
                    Look at him up there.

      She nods to Frank Taylor, who is holding court on the veranda 
      of his compound, sitting in a chair almost like a throne, 
      surrounded by women.  He is spraying CHAMPAGNE into the 
      crowd, someone s luxury item they had brought over.  

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Here we are, back at the beginning, 
                    before the beginning... and we re 
                    already screwing it up again.  
                      Meanwhile, everyone s dancing.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Not everyone.

      She looks at him, picking up on a more serious tone.

                                  ROBBIE (CONT D)
                    There s a group of us who see the 
                    truth.  We ve been getting 
                    together, and we ve been talking.

                                  MADDY
                    About what?

                                  ROBBIE
                    About a plan to do something about 
                    it.

                                  MADDY
                    How many of there are you?

                                  ROBBIE
                    More than you think.  I can 
                    introduce you.

      Beat.  Maddy remembers what her Dad said.  Then ignores it.                                                                                    54.


                                  MADDY
                    Yeah.  Okay.

      She sees Josh approaching.

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Here comes my brother.  Don t 
                    mention this to him.

      Josh is in a somber daze.  He hardly notices Robbie.

                                  JOSH
                    Hey.

                                  MADDY
                    Hey - God, what happened to you?  
                    You smell terrible.  Is that blood?

                                  JOSH
                          (flat, empty)
                    I joined the Raptors.  Hunting 
                    Clan.  Should give us some barter 
                    power.  

      Robbie leans in.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Well done.  Haysbert doesn t 
                    usually take on new guys.  You 
                    must ve done something right.

      Josh looks to the stage.

      JOSH S P.O.V. - HAYSBERT

      Haysbert approaches Frank Taylor on the veranda.  He whispers 
      into Frank s ear, while pressing something into his palm.  
      Frank looks down at it - Josh is sure it s that mysterious 
      cross.  Frank s smile fades and he whispers something short 
      back to Haysbert, who heads off, grim.

                                  MADDY (O.S.)
                    Mom!

      Josh snaps out of his intrigue, turns to see Liz coming 
      toward them, holding Clementine.  Maddy goes to them.

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Mom, what s wrong?

      Liz looks at them, not wanting to answer.  Before she can...

      We hear that strange HORN sound that signals the Main Gate is 
      about to open.  A buzz starts at the back of the crowd.                                                                                    55.


      Suddenly, people begin funneling out of the plaza and down 
      toward the Main Gate.   The Shannon s go with them.

      On the veranda, Frank stands to see what s going on.


      Liz, Maddy, Josh, and Clem move fast as they can to the gate.  

      PEOPLE part like the Red Sea to reveal an exhausted Jim 
      Shannon carrying an unconscious Myra in his arms.  Behind 
      him, Bardo and his sons drag the shredded body of the 
        Velociraptor on a net.  

      Two Doctors take Myra from Jim s arms, transfer her to a 
      primitive stretcher made out of bamboo.

      Jim sees his family.  They see him.  He makes his way to 
      them, bloodied, dirty.  They push through to him.

      Then someone grabs his arm.  The Warden.  With the Marines.

                                  WARDEN
                    Remember me, hero?

                                  FRANK (O.S.)
                    Let him go!

      People make way for Frank as he walks up to Jim.  The Warden 
      steps back, cowed.  Frank looks at Jim, looks at the Raptor.

      He nods, impressed.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Nice work.

      He extends his hand.  Jim doesn t want to shake it, but he 
      does.  Frank suddenly lifts Jim s hand into the air, turns to 
      the crowd.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Citizens of Terra Nova!  Listen up!  
                    I want to introduce you to James 
                    Shannon, from Boulder, Colorado.  
                    He just got here yesterday, and 
                    he s already defended our town, and 
                    bagged a  Raptor.

      CHEERS erupt all around Jim, who grimaces.                                                                                    56.


                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    If this is the kind of grit we can 
                    expect from our new arrivals, then 
                    the future of Terra Nova just got a 
                    whole lot brighter!

      Another CHEER.  Jim pulls his hand free of Frank.  Frank s 
      grin falters, but only for a moment.  He applauds with the 
      rest of the crowd as Jim wastes no more time in walking up to 
      his family.   

      And hugging the hell out of them.


      P.O.V. FROM ON TOP OF THE HILL

      And we are looking down on the settlement of Taylor from 
      about a mile away.  From this vantage point, it is a small 
      cluster of light in a vast dark valley.  

      We can faintly hear the music from the concert, drifting 
      across the prehistoric wilderness.

      A tiny explosion (at this distance) pops up on the outermost 
      perimeter, about a half-mile from the town.  Something 
      wandering into a land-mine.  A pained BELLOW sounds and 
      something HUGE limps away, shaking the trees as it does.  

      Nobody in the town probably heard or noticed.                                                                                    59.


      Suddenly another SHAPE bounds up the hill toward us, moving 
      quickly off to the side, and stopping just out of camera 
      view.  But we can hear it right there to our right, 
      breathing, rustling.

      Then a quieter THUMP of something landing on the ground, or& 
        dismounting?  We hear footsteps, lighter, bipedal, human, 
      walking up to us, and then something is tossed and caught by 
      a HUMAN HAND, belonging to the P.O.V. of whoever we are.  

      Our P.O.V. tilts down to inspect the object - a small white 
      component the size of a pillbox.  The Encoder Beacon.

      Our hand rotates it, curious, and on the back of our wrist is 
      a tattoo of a cross.  We pocket the device.

      Then our view swings left to take in the first light of dawn 
      breaking over a BREATHTAKING NATURAL LANDSCAPE that stretches 
      out as far as the eye can see, the sun RISING on Terra Nova.

      FADE TO BLACK
