A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm,
rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck
towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.
He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows,
turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.
The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight
into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off
his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,
stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.
TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in
the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and
continues after the truck.
TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a
used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.
TJ arrives at the car lot as the TOW TRUCK DRIVER is lowering
the car onto the drive. TJ dumps his bike, out of breath.
TJ
This car has to go back.
TOW TRUCK DRIVER
Huh?
TJ
This car has to go back to where it
came from. Put it back on the truck.
TOW TRUCK DRIVER
What are you talking about, kid?
The driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck.
TJ
Stop unhooking it. There's been a
mistake.
TOW TRUCK DRIVER
I was told to bring it here. That's
what it says on my work order. Talk to
that guy if you've got a problem.
The driver nods in the direction of LARRY TOWERS, who is
approaching with 17 year-old DUSTIN HOWARD and another man,
TONY, in dirty overalls.
(CONTINUED)
2.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
(to tow truck driver)
Hey, Bill.
Larry shakes the tow truck driver's hand.
TJ
This car has to go back where it came
from.
LARRY
I beg your pardon?
TJ
It was brought here by mistake.
Larry smiles at the little out-of-breath kid.
LARRY
And where was it supposed to go?
TJ
It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It
needs to go back where it came from.
The guy who sold it to you made a
mistake.
LARRY
(TO TONY)
What's the deal with this car again,
Tony?
Tony flips through a stack of papers he's holding.
TONY
Ah let's see, we bought this car
yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney-
TJ
That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell.
LARRY
Well, it's his name on the pink slip,
son. And that means it's his to sell
if he wants.
TJ
Yeah, but I'm just telling you it was
a mistake, OK, so it needs to go back
where it came from.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED: (2)
The car has now been lowered off the back of the tow truck.
Larry moves away from TJ and approaches the driver.
LARRY
Thanks, Bill.
(TO TONY)
You got that work order there?
Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't
like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the
wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs
behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.
LARRY (CONT'D)
Get out of the car, son.
TJ ignores him. Larry doesn't have time for this.
LARRY (CONT'D)
Dustin, get him outta there, will ya?
Dustin moves around to the open driver's side window.
DUSTIN
Come on dude, get out of the car.
TJ turns the key and begins winding the window up. Dustin
reaches in trying to unlock the door.
DUSTIN (CONT'D)
C'mon. Open it.
The window is rising. Dustin grabs at TJ. TJ keeps winding the
window. It gets to the top, trapping Dustin's arm.
DUSTIN (CONT'D)
Ow, fuck. What the fuck you doing?
Open it.
Dustin is stuck. Larry, Bill and Tony laugh. Dustin yells at TJ.
TJ ignores him, staring straight ahead.
The men laugh some more. Dustin's humiliation sets in.
DUSTIN (CONT'D)
Put down the fuckin' window. I'm
serious.
Larry goes around to the passenger's side broken window and
opens the door. He leans in and easily drags TJ out of the car.
(CONTINUED)
4.
CONTINUED: (3)
LARRY
I'd get out of here kid, before he
works himself loose.
TJ's not getting the car back. The men continue laughing at the
trapped Dustin. TJ picks up his bike and rides away defeated.
TJ on his BMX pedals down the drive and out onto the street.
TJ pedals in the middle of a suburban street. He steers his bike
with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with
the other. He glides down a hill. It's a long hill. He travels
fast.
Despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and
looks depressed.
TJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing
development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide
streets.
Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big
patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He
passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto
the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road
and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto
the road.
He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at
it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock
lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He
hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.
A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens
and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy
black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front
tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.
HESHER
The fuck you think you're doing!?
Before TJ can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his T-
shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house.
7.
TJ darts for his bike. He picks it up and rides off quickly.
Outside a public high school, kids mill around before class.
Lots of noise.
TJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the
car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny
2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ
quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack.
COACH
McDonald? Mohajer? Nanden? Paonessa?
Saunders? Sumner?
TJ is in gym class, another roll call. TJ looks up.
He notices a guy high up in the bleachers smoking a cigarette
and staring at him through long hair.
TJ looks concerned. Is this Hesher, the guy with the garden
shears?
It's after school. TJ walks out to his bike. It's the last one
left on the rack. Only a couple of other kids are still on
campus. TJ looks around. He jumps on his bike and quickly rides
off.
It's after school. Kids are leaving campus. TJ wheels his bike
across the school yard.
TJ rides his bike down the street. Dustin's YELLOW MUSTANG
appears beside him. Dustin is boiling.
DUSTIN
You're fuckin' dead.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude
picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis.
The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so
his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in
perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the
naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK'
have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car
toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super
market parking lot, attempting to get away.
Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front
of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and
falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him.
Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle
of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself,
cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to
wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him.
He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.
And then a WOMAN'S VOICE -
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey!
Dustin ignores the voice. He continues beating TJ.
VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Hey! Leave him alone!
Dustin ignores again.
VOICE (CONT'D)
Hey! I said stop it!
Dustin ignores one last time - a beat passes, then the woman,
NICOLE (mid-20s), appears behind Dustin and jumps onto his back,
bear hugging his face.
NICOLE
Leave him alone!
Dustin shakes erratically, Nicole has a tight grip on him, but
eventually Dustin manages to throw her onto the ground.
DUSTIN
What the fuck are you doing lady?
Nicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists
like she's ready to fight. She doesn't look very tough.
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED: (2)
NICOLE
What are you doing?!
Nicole stands defiantly between Dustin and TJ. Dustin looks
around at the scene he's created in the street. A man steps out
of his car. Dustin realizes it's time to go.
DUSTIN
(TO TJ)
I'm not finished, you fuck.
He gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off.
Nicole watches him go, then helps TJ up. TJ is shirtless,
scrawny, dirty and traumatized.
NICOLE
Are you alright?
TJ
I don't know.
(BEAT)
Am I bleeding?
NICOLE
I don't think so. Am I?
TJ
I don't know.
TJ grabs his T-shirt and pulls it back on. He picks his bike up
off the ground and hops on. He goes to peddle, but the chain is
busted. His peddling goes nowhere.
Nicole's car pulls up. TJ gets out and notices a dirty black van
creeping slowly around the corner toward them. This makes him
very nervous.
TJ
OK, thanks for the ride. I really
appreciate it.
He hurries to the door.
NICOLE
Hey!
TJ turns.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
You want your bike?
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
TJ notices his bike still in Nicole's back seat.
TJ
Shit.
TJ rushes back. He drags it out of her car.
TJ (CONT'D)
Thanks.
He wheels it back towards the house. TJ goes around the side of
the house to the back door. He knocks on the back door. Grandma
appears at the door.
GRANDMA
Hi, TJ. What you doing around the
back?
Grandma lets TJ in. TJ is nervous.
Hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear.
TJ and Dad step out the door and watch him.
Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a
monkey. At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and
wrenching at the cable box.
He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent. Only a
couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls,
crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole.
HESHER
Motherfucker.
TJ and Dad stand staring frozen.
Hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off
and heads back to the house.
He walks right past them and back inside.
The lunch yard is busy. The crowd clears a moment and we find TJ
sitting on a bench in the shade, alone and depressed, hidden
away from the other kids.
He drinks from a can of soda.
TJ rides his bike into the car lot.
TJ stands staring at the crashed red Volvo (from the opening
scene) that is parked on the lot. He takes a few deep breaths.
33.
TJ walks out of Larry's office, forlorn. He walks across the
showroom, head down, mumbling angrily to himself.
He is stopped by a hand on his chest. It's Dustin.
DUSTIN
You're lucky I'm at work right now.
TJ sits on his bike staring at a Ralph's supermarket.
TJ sits alone in the busy yard, nibbling halfheartedly on
crackers from his lunch bag.
Kid 1 from the locker scene earlier appears beside him.
KID 1
Hey, Teej. What are you doing? Come
sit with us, we're in our spot.
TJ
What? Uh, Ok.
TJ gets up reluctantly, then notices Hesher walking across the
yard towards the bathroom followed by an EMO KID with a
skateboard.
TJ (CONT'D)
I'll meet you there in a second.
TJ walks off, following Hesher. Kid 1 watches TJ walk off toward
the bathroom.
TJ waits with his bike in the street outside the school. He's
beat up, wet and dirty. School's out. Most kids have already
left. Dad pulls up in Grandma's maroon Buick. He gets out and
opens the back door for TJ's bike.
DAD
You ready?
TJ
I don't wanna go.
DAD
It'll be good for us, Teej. C'mon.
We'll be late.
Dad takes TJ's bike and starts trying to fit it in the backseat.
TJ
I really don't want to go.
DAD
I don't think anyone ever 'wants to
go' to these things. It's supposed to
be good for us. That's the whole
point.
TJ stands watching his Dad struggle with the bike.
DAD (CONT'D)
C'mon. Give me a hand here.
41.
Dad and TJ pull into the driveway of the Forney house. Hesher's
van is parked haphazardly on the lawn. TJ looks at it with venom
- a reminder of the afternoon.
TJ
What are we doing?
Hesher gets out of the van and slams the door shut. He goes
around the back of the van and opens the back doors. He pulls
something out and shuts the doors again.
Through the side-view mirror, TJ can see Hesher filling up a big
beat-up plastic gas container. He continues to smoke.
Hesher opens the van's back doors and grabs the container of
gasoline. TJ appears beside him, still panicked.
TJ
Hey, seriously. What are you doing?
Hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the
yellow Mustang.
He pours gasoline all over the car. He does this with confidence
- he's clearly had some practice.
TJ (CONT'D)
(loud whisper - too loud)
Come on. This is insane. Let's get out
of here.
Hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas.
The porch light comes on. Someone peels open the front window
curtains and looks out. TJ and Hesher drop to the ground behind
the Mustang. TJ is terrified. He looks over to Hesher who is
smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him.
The curtains close but the porch light stays on. Unfazed, Hesher
hops back up and empties the gas can onto the Mustang.
Hesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent
goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from
his pocket.
He straightens it, then lights it with a match.
TJ (CONT'D)
(QUIETLY FRANTIC)
C'mon, man. Let's just go.
Hesher takes one long drag on the cigarette, then calmly flicks
the still lit match onto the Mustang.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
Instantly, it erupts in flames.
Hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van. TJ
follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house.
Hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back.
TJ goes to the passenger door.
It's locked. He wrestles the handle, panicking.
TJ (CONT'D)
Open the door! It's locked!
Hesher starts the van and pulls away, leaving TJ stranded in the
street.
The front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the
porch. Discovering the car in flames, she screams.
TJ takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's
yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on
the porch screaming at him.
WOMAN
Hey, get back here!
TJ runs. He jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses.
He's running fast and breathing hard.
He finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street.
He stops. He has no idea where he is or where to go.
Then - HEADLIGHTS appear at the end of the street. They bear
down on him slowly. TJ stands immobile. He can now see it is
Hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing.
The van stops about 10 feet from TJ. A moment's stand off.
Then Hesher sticks his head out the window.
HESHER
Get in.
TJ
You fucking ditched me.
HESHER
Get in the van, dude.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
TJ doesn't move. He stares. Hesher REVS the engine.
Hesher revs the engine some more. TJ still doesn't move.
Hesher FLOORS THE VAN.
ON TJ - the headlights of the van bear down on him.
Hesher slams on the brakes and the van screeches to a halt
inches from TJ's nose. TJ doesn't flinch.
He and Hesher stare at each other through the windshield.
Hesher smiles. He's impressed.
TJ walks around to the passenger door.
TJ unlocks his bike from a pole.
HESHER
Where you going?
TJ
Home.
HESHER
I'll give you a ride.
TJ
No thanks.
HESHER
OK, but if you come with me it'll take
5 minutes and if you ride it will take
you about 15.
TJ gets onto his bike.
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
HESHER (CONT'D)
Come on dude, don't be silly, let's
just car pool.
TJ clearly doesn't want to ride his bike home, but his is
reluctant to go with Hesher.
TJ
Fine, just don't talk to me.
HESHER
I won't say shit.
TJ and Hesher load TJ's bike into the back of Hesher's van.
Hesher closes the back doors and they get in.
Nicole is flustered and begins to cry. The driver is inspecting
the smashed rear end of his car.
NICOLE
I'm sorry. I didn't -
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
DRIVER
You just messed up the back of my car
you stupid idiot. You need to pay
attention when you're driving a
fucking car -
HESHER (O.S.)
I think I can help here.
Hesher is out of the van approaching on foot, smoking.
HESHER (CONT'D)
I saw the whole thing. The chick here
was stopped and you reversed right
into her.
DRIVER
What?
HESHER
I don't know what your fucking problem
is, dude. Why would you just reverse
into her? That's fuckin' retarded.
DRIVER
What are you talking about?
Hesher and the driver face off. The driver is simultaneously
bewildered and angry.
DRIVER
Are you out of your mind?
HESHER
You better start making like you're
gonna pay her for the damage.
DRIVER
I didn't back into her. I don't know
what you're talking about.
Hesher rips his shirt off, aggressively.
HESHER
You calling me a fucking liar, dude!?
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
The guy immediately begins backing down.
DRIVER
No, I, I, I'm just saying I don't know
what's going on here.
HESHER
You're calling me a fucking liar is
what's going on here.
Hesher pushes the guy hard.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Let's go.
DRIVER
Look, I don't want any trouble, sir.
HESHER
Fight me cocksucker!
Hesher is seriously amping up the street agro. The guy doesn't
know what to do. He starts heading back to his car.
DRIVER
This is ridiculous -
HESHER
Come back here and find out how
ridiculous it is!
The guy gets in his car and speeds away, leaving Hesher
(shirtless) and Nicole in the street. Hesher stubs his
cigarette, now totally relaxed again.
HESHER (CONT'D)
OK. See you later.
Hesher heads back to the van. Nicole watches him not exactly
sure what to say. Hesher climbs back into his van.
TJ and Hesher push Nicole's car off to the side of the road.
The black van pulls up curb-side outside a neat suburban home.
Hesher gets out and walks, covered in dirt, to the front door of
the house. He looks in through the window, knocks, waits. An old
man opens the door. They exchange a few words. Hesher heads back
to the van and they drive off. Nicole and TJ seem confused.
NICOLE
Who's that guy?
Hesher says nothing. They drive three houses down the street and
stop again. Hesher gets out. Again he peers in the window,
knocks on the door. This time no answer. He heads back to the
van. Nicole and TJ watch him approach from inside. He sticks his
head in.
HESHER
We're here. Come on, let's go.
NICOLE
We're where?
HESHER
My uncle's house.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
Hesher walks off toward the side gate of the house. Nicole and
TJ climb out of the van and follow Hesher. Nicole seems
cautious. TJ knows he's on an adventure.
Hesher jumps the SIDE GATE, then opens it for the others.
NICOLE
What was that back there?
HESHER
What was what?
NICOLE
That other house?
HESHER
Wrong house.
In the backyard is a swimming pool.
Nicole and TJ stand looking in the pool. It's a nice pool with a
diving board.
Hesher walks up behind them and pushes them in.
Nicole comes up for air.
NICOLE
What the fuck!?
HESHER
What? You're dirty.
NICOLE
Yeah, and now I'm wet.
Hesher smiles wide.
HESHER
You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in...
He throws his T-shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Now I'm dirty and wet too.
He splashes water at her. He dives under the water. Suddenly TJ
is pulled under. Nicole can't see them under all the motion.
Then TJ and Hesher come bursting up for air.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
NICOLE
Cut it out.
HESHER
R2! Shut down all the fucken' trash
compactors on the detention level!
Hesher dives under the water again. Nicole squirms. Hesher has
her leg. He doesn't drag her under. He just tugs her leg. She
slaps at the water. He tugs her leg again. Pretty soon she's
laughing. Hesher's head appears above water momentarily.
HESHER (CONT'D)
...All the fucking trash compactors...
(underwater, then up again)
...on the detention level!...
He dives again. He pulls her leg. She laughs hard. TJ watches
feeling a little left out. Hesher jumps up and climbs out of the
pool. He goes to a garden table nearby.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Oh, shit. More trash coming in!
He heaves the table over and into the pool. He grabs a banana
lounge.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Oh shit!
He throws it in the pool. Nicole and TJ have to dive out of the
way. They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing,
while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and
anything else in reach into the water.
TJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs
dangling in the water. They're fully clothed and soaking wet.
He walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more
things to break.
There is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole. TJ
looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the
side of the pool. He manages to get one to crawl onto the his
finger.
NICOLE
So, how do you know this guy?
TJ
I don't know, he's sort of moved into
my grandma's house with us.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED: (2)
NICOLE
What, like he's renting a room or
something?
TJ
No, not really, I don't know, it's
kinda a long story.
TJ flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's
climbing up his arm.
NICOLE
Do you realize that the equivalent to
you flicking that ant would be like
one of us getting hit in the face by a
giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an
hour and getting thrown into the next
yard?
TJ stops mid ant flicking.
TJ
Sorry, I...
NICOLE
Do you think the other ants are gonna
wonder where that ant's gone? Do you
think their gonna miss her?
TJ doesn't know how to answer.
Hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to
the diving board. He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid
through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool.
Hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it
with his lighter. The diving board erupts into flames.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ.
HESHER
(SINGING)
Jump in the fi-re.
Hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board. He
springs through the flames into the air. He does a messy
sideways flip.
HESHER (CONT'D)
FUCK YOU BITCHES!!!
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED: (3)
He lands in the pool splashing TJ and Nicole. He pulls himself
out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog. He looks over at
the flaming diving board.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Shit, look at that.
Hesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence. He doesn't
look back.
HESHER (CONT'D)
I got a doctor's appointment.
TJ
What?
Hesher hops over the fence.
HESHER (O.S.)
(YELLS)
It burns when I urinate...
Hesher disappears over the fence. We hear his van start and peel
away.
The flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as
it crumbles into the pool.
NICOLE
Did he just leave us? I think we
should get out of here.
Nicole stands and heads for the gate, TJ tags behind. They jump
the side fence and head out into the street, dripping wet.
TJ & Nicole walk over the crest of a small hill on a tree-lined
street eating ice-cream cones. They walk in the middle of the
road, still damp. The sun is setting. The light is magical.
TJ
My shoes are so squishy.
TJ steps hard, squirting water out the sides of his wet shoes.
Nicole smiles.
NICOLE
So, what's his name?
TJ
Hesher.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
NICOLE
Hesher?... Is that a name?
TJ
I don't know. I guess?
NICOLE
Does he have a last name?
TJ
I don't know.
NICOLE
How old is he?
TJ
I don't know.
NICOLE
Do you know anything about him?
TJ
Not really.
Beat.
NICOLE
That was so lucky you guys were behind
me when that guy got all mad about his
car. I was freaking out. I don't
really have any insurance right now. I
just can't afford it. There's no way I
could afford to fix that guy's car.
How do people do this stuff? I mean, I
have a job. It's kind of a joke
though. I've been there for like a
year and I'm still only doing like
five hours a week. Why aren't they
giving me any more hours? Do you think
it's because they think I suck? Did
you think I sucked when I served you
at the checkout?
TJ
(UNSURE)
No?
NICOLE
I don't even get paid enough to really
cover my rent. I'm gonna have to start
selling shit pretty soon.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED: (2)
TJ licks his ice cream, then reaches into his pocket.
TJ
Here, I got two bucks.
NICOLE
The sad thing is I could actually use
it.
A parking ticket sits under the wiper on Nicole's windshield. TJ
and Nicole approach the car, smiling - and then Nicole sees the
ticket. Her face sinks immediately.
NICOLE
Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a
ticket...
She runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from
under the wiper. She reads it quick.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Fuck, fuck, fuck it.
She paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the car's
tire. It hurts her foot. She yelps.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Ah, shit. Fuck it.
In a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens
the car door. She gets in and slams the door behind her. She
sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated.
TJ stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do.
He goes to the car and gets in beside her. He sits, still not
knowing what to say. She tries to settle herself, but she's
still very emotional.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
What have I done to deserve this chain
reaction of shit all the time?
Sometimes I wonder if I were to die
right now, if anyone would care, or
even notice.
TJ
I would.
She lets out a small disbelieving laugh.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
NICOLE
That's nice of you to say, but I doubt
it.
TJ
I would. If you died right now.
(BEAT)
I'd notice.
TJ thinks a moment. It's a sweet and sour moment. He wants to
cheer Nicole up, but he's remembering his Mom at the same time.
TJ (CONT'D)
Mainly because I'd be sitting in a car
with a dead lady.
Nicole sniffs, smiling through her tears.
NICOLE
Please don't call me lady.
She smiles warmly at TJ.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Let's get out of here.
She puts the key in the ignition and turns it. Nothing. Nicole
takes a breath - not wanting to get upset again. She turns to TJ
and smiles sadly.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
You wanna steer or push?
Close on an ATM card, sliding into the slot. Fingers type
numbers. A small stack of twenty dollar bills pours out.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
TJ puts the money in a dirty envelope, pockets it and rides off
on his bike.
TJ angrily winds his way toward the back of the lot. He stops at
the spot where his mom's car once was - now just an empty space.
Gray clouds fill the sky. We hear distant thunder. On his bike,
TJ coasts down the hill of a tree-lined street. He's upset and
trying hard to hold it back.
TJ drops his bike and enters the house.
TJ walks out the front door. Dad is quietly sitting on the front
steps wearing a T-shirt in the light rain. TJ goes to his bike.
TJ
What are you doing?
DAD
(SNAPPING TO)
I don't know. Getting some fresh air,
I guess.
TJ
It's starting to rain.
Dad reaches out his hand and catches a few drops.
DAD
Yeah.
TJ picks up his bike and rides. We stay with Dad as TJ
disappears down the wet street.
TJ rides his bike. He rounds a corner onto Nicole's street.
He jumps off his bike outside her building and wheels it inside
the front fence.
85.
TJ climbs the stairs of Nicole's building. As he approaches her
apartment door, he hears loud, but muffled music.
He knocks on the door. No answer. The music is really loud.
He knocks again. No answer. He tries the door handle. It gives.
He pushes the door open tentatively.
TJ charges down the stairs. He grabs his bike and heads out into
the street. Light rain falls. We see Hesher appear behind him,
barefoot and topless, buttoning his jeans.
TJ notices Hesher's van parked out the front, he drops his bike
and grabs a rusty pipe from a pile of garbage on the sidewalk
and heads straight toward the van.
HESHER
Hey, hey... wait.
TJ takes a hard swing into the van, smashing the tail light.
Nicole runs out into the street, concerned, wearing an oversized
sweatshirt and underpants.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Hey! The fuck are you doing?
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
TJ ignores him and takes another swing at the van. Hesher
approaches TJ. TJ takes a swing at him with the pipe.
Hesher steps back. Nicole gasps, her hand to her mouth. She
doesn't know what to say or do.
TJ
Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you.
HESHER
Stop hitting my van.
TJ
Fuck you.
(TO NICOLE)
And you're a fucking whore. I hope you
die. And when you do, no one's gonna
fuckin' notice.
(BREATHES)
Cuz you're a fat fucking prostitute.
Hesher steps toward TJ.
HESHER
Dude, chill out for a second.
TJ swings the pipe at Hesher again.
TJ
Get the fuck away from me! I'll smash
you in the face, I swear to God. Back
the fuck up.
TJ swings again. He's so angry, he's practically foaming at the
mouth.
TJ (CONT'D)
I never want to see you or your ugly
fucking face again. That goes for both
of you fucking assholes.
TJ throws the pipe at Hesher. It hits the road with a loud
clang. TJ grabs his bike and rides away furiously. Hesher and
Nicole watch TJ ride away. It begins to rain hard.
TJ glides his bike down a long hill in the pouring rain, in
tears.
87.
TJ rides up the front porch. A funeral home truck is parked out
the front - HAPPY EVER AFTER is written on the side. TJ drops
his bike and enters the house.
It's raining hard. TJ storms out, just as Hesher is making his
way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him. Hesher
reaches out his arm to slow TJ.
HESHER
I wanna talk to you.
TJ pushes Hesher's arm out of the way.
TJ
Get your fucking hands away from me! I
told you, I never want to see you
again.
Hesher, at a loss, watches TJ grab a brick from the muddy garden
and throw it through the passenger side window of his van.
Hesher charges TJ. He throws him into the muddy garden and
kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded
sweatshirt.
HESHER
I fuckin' told you, leave my van out
of this!
Hesher lifts TJ up and slams him back down on the ground,
knocking the wind out of him. TJ struggles to get away.
TJ
Let go of me! Fuckin' let go of me.
Dad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off TJ by the back
of his shirt.
DAD
What in God's name -
Hesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the
nose. Dad goes down hard.
HESHER
Don't fuckin' touch m-
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
Without hesitation, TJ jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his
face. They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw TJ
off. He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll.
HESHER (CONT'D)
Fuck you both! Motherfuckers!
Hesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists
clenched.
He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels
away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and
rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his
bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left
confused and bleeding in the pouring rain.
It's raining cats and dogs. TJ stands outside Dustin's house,
soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden
shears in his hand.
He walks around the side of the house and looks in the window.
TJ walks around the back of the house. He tries the handle to
the back door. It's locked. TJ sees the dog door. He climbs
through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. The TV is
loud inside.
TJ rides his bike over a rickety red bridge. He pulls his bike
up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard -
D&S; Auto-Wreckers. It's still raining very hard. TJ is soaking
wet. He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars
inside.
TJ hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster. He gets up
on the dumpster and climbs the wrecking yard's fence.
TJ roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car. He looks
distraught. All around sit stacks of wrecked cars. A vicious dog
on a chain barks and snarls nearby.
TJ stops. He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. He
looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do. He moves to the
base of the stack and begins to climb.
He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. It's awkward and
difficult and more than a little dangerous.
Finally he reaches the top. He wrenches open the car door and
squeezes behind the wheel.
A crane is lifting the car with a huge wrecking yard magnet. As
it rises off the stack, it dangles at a precarious angle.
TJ is hanging dangerously out of the car, swinging his legs and
screaming at the top of his lungs. His voice can barely be heard
over the sound of machinery.
A guy on the ground, MARIO, looks up and spots TJ. He
frantically looks to get the crane operator's attention.
MARIO
Ricky!
(YELLS LOUDER)
Ricky! Kill it, man.
Ricky sticks his head out of the crane cab, like he can't hear.
RICKY
What?
MARIO
Kill it! There's someone in the car!
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
Mario points. Ricky looks up. Both men can see TJ dangling.
As the car is lowered TJ jumps the last few feet to the ground.
Mario leads him away from the car and the crane.
MARIO
What the hell are you doing?
TJ
I don't know.
MARIO
What were you doing in there?
TJ
I don't know. I'm sorry.
MARIO
This car's about to get crushed. If I
didn't see you, you would be dead.
TJ
I know.
MARIO
What were you thinking, man?
TJ doesn't respond, he backs away.
Mario watches him walk away, still disbelieving. He turns back
to Ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again.
TJ walks to the entrance gate while behind him his mom's car is
hoisted high in the air.
TJ stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate. He pulls coins
from his pocket and slots them in. It spits out a chocolate bar.
Moments later TJ stands with his half-eaten chocolate bar while
watching his Mom's car get fed into a giant crushing machine and
compacted into scrap. Tears well in his eyes. He feels helpless.
Dad and TJ drive into the funeral home parking lot in Grandma's
car. A few people are milling around.
Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with TJ
and Dad beside him. They seem solemn and strangely dignified in
a dishevelled way.
Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street.
Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop.
Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of
the street and the three continue their silent walk with
Grandma.
In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's
shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.
And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside
watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.
The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and
Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs
out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks
to them from the open window.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
OFFICER
(SMILING)
You'll get him to bed now, won't you?
DAD
That's the plan.
Hesher squirms and slurs.
HESHER
Get your hands off me, pig.
DAD
That's the plan.
The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and
Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door. We hold on
the house for a beat.
Close on scissors to beard.
Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard. Golden
sunlight pours in through the windows.
A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream.
The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and
no sign of Hesher.
TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the
garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something
seriously unusual outside.
'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD.
A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the
center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They
stand and stare at it, almost in awe.
Then from the across the street, we see the object in the
driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it.
We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the
front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad.
Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders.
On the beat we CUT TO:
HESHER MOMENTS:
Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up;
Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher
pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting
him back.
Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and
making a direct line for the setting sun.
A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a
peanut. He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the
setting sun.
CUT TO BLACK:
THE END
Hesher
