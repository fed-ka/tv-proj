      as the CAB DRIVER turns nervously to his fare.

                                    CAB DRIVER
                    Like I told you, lady -- there's
                    no bar here. Ain't nothin' here
                    but nightmares.

      REVEAL CATHY sitting in the back, dressed down, dark colors,
      nothing flashy. She takes in the ominous gloom outside her
      window, anxious and uncertain.

                                    CATHY
                    Are you sure this is the right
                      address?

                                    CAB DRIVER
                      Let's get outta here, whaddya say?
                    I'll buy ya a drink with the extra
                      twenty ya laid on me to bring ya down
                    to this hellhole.

                                    CATHY
                      There's another twenty in it for
                    you if you'll wait.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                                        2.

                        Forget about it!

          Cathy's hand trembles as she reaches for the door; she doesn't
        want to leave the safety of the cab. But she sucks in a deep
          breath, opens the door. STAY WITH THE DRIVER as  she climbs OUT
        into the threatening night...

                                      CAB DRIVER
                                (continuing)

    the large room... illuminated by flickering LAMPS... tables and
    chairs, a pool table, posters and graffiti on the walls...
    cigarette smoke hangs in the air. Obviously a clubhouse of some
    sort, but none of the members seem to be here...


    CATHY

    moves further into the room, walks along the bar. The
    broken backbar mirror is spray-painted with the legend:
    SAVAGEES.

    She hears the floor CREAK behind her, whirls to SEE

    A RAGTAG GANG OF YOUNG HOODS

    that have stepped from a door at the end of the bar. Young, with
    eyes that mirror a hundred lifetimes of anger and misery. FIVE in
    all. Cathy fights the urge to bolt and run...

                                  CATHY
                  Which one of you is Shake?

    A thick, stocky blonde kid in a denim vest smiles, rolls his
    toothpick with his tongue, looking her up and down like a
    butcher appraising beef. This is SHAKE, leader of the Savages.
    (Mirrored sunglasses)

                                  SHAKE
                  That'd be me. You're the lawyer'lady.

                                  CATHY
                  I'm from the D.A.'s office, yes.

                      I can't make any promises. He'll do
                      some time, but if you help me, I
                      think we can get the charges
                        reduced. He'll do a year, two at the
                        outside.

                      That's cool. He can handle that.

        He and the others peel off to tables, take chairs. Shake
        kicks one out for Cathy.

                      Willie says you saw that convenience
                      owner beaten to death outside his
                      market, that you can identify the
                      man that did it. Is that true?

                              (starts for the door)
                      Fine. You can feel your way into
                      Attica to visit your buddy Willie.

                    I'd like you to tell me exactly

      The room EXPLODES IN GUNFIRE... The boards over the windows are
      splintered; the door is nearly blown off its hinges.

      Cathy dives to the floor as the gang scrambles for cover.
      Shake is hit, goes down... Two more Savages, DICE and SCO
      make it OUT the back door...

                      I'm all right...

      He hustles her toward the back door. The other gang members
      have fled and Do NOT SEE Vincent.

    Vincent and Cathy are going out when Cathy looks back, SEES
    Shake on the floor, unconscious. He moans softly. Cathy
    starts forward.

    He sweeps Cathy out. GO WITH HIM as he hurries back to the
    fallen Shake. The remnant of a window suddenly breaks... the lit
    PIPE BOMB lands on the floor in front of Vincent. '

      WIDER ANGLE

      We're in the Silks' clubhouse, an old abandoned garage on the
      lower East Side. Tables and chairs, an old sofa,
        refrigerator, etc. We see now that Vincent is chained to some
      overhead steam pipes. He tries to move forward, but is
      securely chained. The gang is grouped around him, keeping
      back a safe distance, watching him with a mixture of awe and
      fear. ROCK MUSIC THROBS from a ghetto blaster.

      A dark, sensuous young WOMAN steps forward. Her name is
      COZY. Barely out of her teens. Cruel and sadistic.

                                    COZY
                      Nothin' ugly about him. He's

                      different...

      Now another young woman pulls Cozy roughly aside, asserting her
      authority as Chris' lady. This is MISS PATRICIA. She's tall,
      busty, punkish hairstyle, tight leather from head to spike
      heeled shoes.

      trying to break free.

                    Bet he even talks.

      Chris draws a heavy-blade hunting knife from a sheath on his
      belt and kneels before Vincent, waves it slowly back and forth
        threateningly...

      He reaches to jab Vincent on the chest with the knife; Vincent
      GROWLS. The others laugh as Chris jerks away.
      Chris is embarrassed, pissed off; he moves menacingly toward
      Vincent with the knife, but Tony restrains him.

    FADE IN:



    Cathy's alone in the deserted, dank tunnel. Her attitude
    is anxious as she bangs a message on the pipes with a loose
      brick. No response. She beats out the same message again, with
      increasing desperation. We should sense that she's been trying
    for a long time, getting nowhere.

                                    ELLIE'S VOICE
                    Catherine...


      Cathy spins to SEE

      ELLIE standing behind her. The little girl has emerged from
      a secret panel, which is still ajar.

                                  ELLIE
                    Sorry it took me so long, but it's a
                    long way..

                                  CATHY
                            (urgently)
                    Ellie, is Vincent all right?

                            (puzzled)
                    He went above tonight. Be hasn't
                    come back yet.
                            (as Cathy reacts)
                    Is there something wrong? Is
                    Vincent in trouble?

                                    CATBY
                            (deeply concerned, but
                            she doesn't want to
                              alarm the little girl)
                    I just wanted to see him,
                    Ellie.

                                    ELLIE
                              (sensing that Cathy's
                              holding back)
                    He's... okay, isn't he?

      Cathy goes to one knee to hug the little girl, gives her a
      brave smile.



                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                          ;

                      I'm sure he is, but I need to
                      speak with Father.

        FOLLOW, as Ellie leads Cathy down into the world below...



      Cathy enters. Father is at his reading table. He rises,
      concern in his eyes. There is an atmosphere of great
      tension between them.

                                      FATHER
                              (urgently)
                      What's happened?

                                      CATHY
                              (beside herself)
                      It's Vincent -- I'm afraid he's
                      been hurt.

                                      FATHER
                              (takes her shoulders)
                      Tell me!

                                          CATHY
                          (she can hardly get it out)
                      There was an explosion... A man
                      Was killed...Vincent was trying
                      To save him when the bomb went
                      Off.


                                      FATHER

                      My god...

                                      CATHY
                   The firemen searched the rubble.
                   They found the man s body&
:           (on Father s look)
                   ...But no sign of Vincent.

        Father turns away from her, numb with shock and concern.
        He suddenly seems older, more frail and vulnerable.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)      Rev. 8/21/8716A.

      He sways, overcome with grief. Cathy makes a tentative move to
      reach out, to comfort him, but holds herself back...

                                    FATHER
                                (continuing)
                      Where did this happen?

                    The lower East Side.

                    The most dangerous part of the
                    city for us! He knows that!
                    What was he doing there?

      He gives her a look that cuts to her soul; he knows what
      Vincent was doing there. Cathy can't hold his challenging,
      demanding eyes, looks away...

                                    CATHY
                              (softly)
                    He was with me.

      Father turns away in disgust.

                                    FATHER
                    I've warned him, pleaded with
                      him... Now this! If he's caught
                      above...

      Cathy is stunned, wounded by his fury, but her concern for
        Vincent's safety pushes aside any thought of defending
        herself. A long beat of silence...

                                    CATHY
                      I care for him more than anyone in
                    my life.

                      Your... relationship with Vincent
                    is a tragic mistake... for both of
                    you.

                      Our access to that part of the
                      city is limited. Only two
                      entrances to our tunnels exist
                      there... they're rarely used...

        Father goes to a high bookshelf, pulls down some dusty old
        hand-drawn maps and brings them to the table. Cathy comes
      to look over his shoulder as he spreads the maps and bends
        over them, his finger tracing the ancient yellowed
        parchment...

                                      FATHER
                      Here... and here...

                                      CATHY
                      Vincent must know of these places...

                                      FATHER
                              (nods sadly)
                      If he can reach them.

        They share a long look, each aware of the unavoidable bond
        between them...

                                                                  CUT TO:



        The place is quiet. Chris and Miss patricia are off somewhere
        together, and Cozy and Python have been sent on
        a beer run. Bowie has been left to stand guard over Vincent.
        He's kneeling, studying Vincent with child-like fascination.
        Vincent's head is lowered, his eyes closed... now he looks up,
        blinks, tries to focus. Bowie shrinks back in fear, then finds
        the courage to come closer. Be looks around, makes sure no one's
        watching. There is a gentle, caring quality to this giant with
        the mind of a little boy.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)      Rev. 8/13/8716B.

                      crazy sometimes, him and Python...

      Howie feels for Vincent, and his concern inches past his
      fear. He rises, looks around furtively, then reaches to fool
      with the chains binding Vincent's hands...

      come in from another room, arms around each other, Tony

      Tony has sprayed Vincent with his bottle of beer. He laughs,
      steps back as Chris lights a small BUTANE TORCH and moves
      toward Vincent...

      Python hits Vincent hard on the shoulder with a tire iron;.
      Vincent endures it silently. Howie winces, looks away...

      He's raising the iron when Howie grabs his wrist, squeezes.*
      Python struggles, grunting with pain; the iron slips from his
      hand.

                                    HOWIE
                      Why you wanta hurt him for,
                      Python?

      The giant is still squeezing Python's wrist, almost as if he's
        forgotten he has hold of it. Python struggles, beats at him with
      his free hand.

                                    PYTHON
                              (shrill; in agony)

                      Let him go, Howie... Let him GO!

      Howie smiles, releases his grip. Python sags back against the
      wall, doubled over with pain, holding his wrist. Now he
        reaches under his jacket with his good hand, pulls his
      .357 and cocks it, aiming it Howie.

      Chris brings the flame in close to Vincent's face...
        closer... The flame touches his skin. And with the pain comes
      The Beast... Vincent roars in pain and rage, pulling against
      the chains that bind him... Suddenly, the pipes rupture:
      scalding STEAM belches in clouds, driving Chris and the other
      gang members back... Chris drops the torch: it rolls across the

      Vincent is resting inside a warehouse, his head on his knees,
      trying to regain his strength. He's in bad shape. The long hours
      on the run are taking their toll on him.

      WIDER ANGLE

      A night Watchman on patrol, a stocky ex-pug named RED, has

        chance...

        Red helps him to his feet, gets out a half-pint bottle and

      We catch just a glimpse of VINCENT as he slips OUT of SHOT.

      The Cabbie reacts to what he's seen. Cathy and Isaac are in
      the back.

      Cathy peers out the window hopefully... then sinks back into her

        The small street Vincent has been following intersects here with
        a broader avenue; along the the block we see various closed
        shops, most pretty seedy (pawnshops, used clothing stores, a
        greasy spoon, etc.), with apartments above them. Most are shut
        for the evening, but a half-block down a strip joint called
        SQUEAKY'S is open, its neon lights reflecting off the wet
        pavement. There's a cluster of activity down by the strip joint,
        and PARKED CARS all along the block. A couple of CABS and a car
        or two whiz by the intersection, until the TRAFFIC LIGHT at the
        corner turns red.

          VINCENT

          emerges from the side street, crouching low, wrapped in his
        cape. He SCRAMBLES quickly across the sidewalk, and crouches
        low between two parked cars near the corner. But there's no
        real cover here, and he's painfully exposed, and he knows it...
        but his escape is somewhere in the middle of this street.


          VINCENT'S POV

        We PAN as he scans the intersection, trying to makesome
          sense of these twisted shadows and blobs of coloredlights.
        The street is a distorted blur. Be can see motion,shadow,
        the headlights of passing cars, but everything is
          indistinct. The neon of the strip joint flickers on and off,
        but so blurred that he cannot discern what it is. But he does
          recognize the steady RED eye of the traffic light. We HOLD on
        it as Vincent stares, waiting for it to change.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)      Rev. 8/12/8729.

      as it pulls up to the intersection and stops for the light.
      Chris drums his fingers against the wheel impatiently.

                    can't get too far.

      His cold eyes flick around restlessly. We INTERCUT between
      Chris and Vincent, crouching by the cars, waiting for his
      chance.

                                  COZY
                            (she leans over the

                    Know what...?

      The light TURNS, and Chris floors the accelerator. The El
      Dorado roars out of the intersection, throwing Cozy back in
      the rear seat. Miss patricia LAUGHS.

      VINCENT POV


      The blur of the traffic light goes from red to green.

      THE INTERSECTION
      With a speed born of desperation, Vincent darts across the the
      street, crouched low. He STOPS in the middle of the
        intersection, drops to his knees.

      VINCENT

      A drainage grate is clearly visible a few feet to his right --
      his sanctuary, the road that will take him underground and
      home. But he can't see it, black metal against the rain-slick
      black asphalt. Be feels for it with his hands, slowly widening
      his search.

      c) Vincent's FINGERS brush against the edge of the iron
        drainage grate.

      d) Chris floors the gas pedal; the E1 Dorado leaps forward
      with a squeal of rubber, picking up speed fast....

      e) Vincent grasps the edge of the heavy drainage grate,
      his fingers trying to find purchase on its slick edges.
      He HEARS the SOUND of the El Dorado, looks up, SEES the
        oncoming LIGHTS briefly...

      f) Chris grins and TURNS OUT HIS LIGHTS.

      g) From VINCENT'S POV, the on-coming car is gone. He turns his
        attention back to the drainage grate, pulls the edge of it up,
      gets his hands underneath it and begins to shift it to one
        aide...

      against a parked car. The big car then goes out of control,
      jumps the curb on the opposite side of the street, blowing both
      front tires.

      VINCENT

    is on his back on the sidewalk, trying to turn over, to get to
    his feet... WE HEAR shouting, screams, running feet. Vincent
      hears it too, knows he must get to cover. He lurches to his
      feet, feels his way along the wall, limps into an alley...

      Lots of commotion. Various patrons emerge from Runway Lounge.

      Chris has banged his head on the wheel: Cozy and Miss Patricia
      are hovering over him. The crash has shaken them all.


      Python's on the floor of the car, searching for his gun;
      Howie rolls his head, rubbing his neck and wincing.

      car.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Some of the patrons from the Runway Lounge are moving to
      surround the car when Chris tries to back away. Both front
      tires are ruined; they flop loudly.

      Chris jumps out, wild with fury, looks at the damage and kicks

                                                                  CUT TO:



        Very small, cheaply furnished and cluttered, but homey. Lucy
        KICKS the door shut behind her, shows him to her couch.

                                    LUCY
                      You just rest there for a minute,
                      I'll be right back.

      We FOLLOW her into the bathroom, where she flicks on a
        light, opens her medicine chest. She gets out disinfectafit, a
        couple bottles of pills, then turns to a closet and gets some
        towels. She carries it all back to the darkened living room.
        Vincent remains on the couch, hidden in shadow.

                                    LUCY
                      Don't be scared. I used to be a
                      nurse.
                              (beat, abashed)
                      Well, no... my old lady wanted me
                      to be a nurse, though... you must
                      be hurtin' bad. You want some
                      pills? I got all kinds...

        Vincent shakes his head no.

                                      LUCY
                      You need something, mister...
                      for the pain, you know? Just for
                      the pain... I got aspirin even,
                      and penicillin and stuff, one of
                      my regular fellas works down the
                        hospital and he gets me whatever
                        I want... Lemme get a look...

        She reaches for a lamp, but Vincent's hand shoots out
          quickly and blocks her hand. Lucy GASPS.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        36.

                                        VINCENT
                        No light... please...

                                      LUCY

                        I'm tryin' to help you.What's...
                        your problem?

                                      VINCENT
                        My appearance may... frighten you.

                                      LUCY
                        Honey, you don't know what it takes
                        to frighten me. I've seen all
                        kinds...

        She laughs lightly, nervously, but Vincent does not.

                                      LUCY
                                (beat, more softly)
                        You got to trust somebody,
                        sometimes...

          CLOSE ON LUCY'S HAND

          Lucy's hand moVes to the lamp, turns it on.

        ANGLE PAST LUCY ON VINCENT

        He turns his face away from her as bright light floods the
          basement apartment. .

          CLOSE ON LUCY

        as she gets a good look at Vincent for the first time, and
          RECOILS IN SHOCK and HORROR.

                                                                    FADE OUT

          FADE IN:


            VINCENT'S POV OF LUCY

          as she backs away from Vincent, her eyes wide...

                                        LUCY
                                  (stunned)
                        Oh God... What are you?

                                        VINCENT
                          I won't hurt you...

                                        LUCY
                                    (yelling)
                          Don't come near me!

          VINCENT tries to pull his cape around him, but when he moves his
          arm, the pain in his shoulder makes him wince...

                                        VINCENT
                                  (rising)
                          I'm sorry... I'll go...

          LUCY sees his obvious agony... guilt and shame replaces the
          fear on her face.

                                        LUCY
                        No wait... you can't... I'm sorry...
                          here... Don't go...

          She gives him a towel to cover his wound.
          She helps him with it.

                                        LUCY
                          You gotta get to a doctor...

                                          VINCENT.
                                (with grave urgency,
                                  he looks at her)
                          My father is a doctor. I need to
                          get to him. I can't see...

                                                                        (CONTINUED)      Rev. 8/12/8738.

      Lucy REACTS strongly, stricken and horrified. For the first
      time since turning on the light, she looks Vincent in the face,
      and then away again quickly...

                                    LUCY
                      I'll help you...

                                    VINCENT
                      Somewhere near here is an old
                      building... the Beaumont...

                                    LUCY
                      Sure, used to be a ritzy private
                      club, but it's all boarded up now.
                      It's about six blocks from here.

                                    VINCENT
                      Tell me the way.

                                    LUCY
                      I'll take you there...

                                    VINCENT
                              (a beat)
                      Will you tell me your name?

                                    LUCY
                              (strangely shy)
                      ... Lucy.

                                    VINCENT
                      Thank you, Lucy...

                                                                  CUT TO:



      We're CLOSE ON CATHY; PULL BACK to reveal her staring down
      bleakly at the open drainage grate, the grate lying several
      feet away, the street littered with broken glass.

      In b.g. Isaac is talking to some people (detectives, a stripper
      or two, etc) at the scene of the accident. The police have
      cordoned off the site with sawhorses. Floodlights illuminate
      the wrecked cars. Cathy's eyes are full of fear and concern...


                                    CATHY
                    So close...

      Isaac breaks off his conversation, walks over to join her. He
      looks down at the open drainage grate.

                                    ISAAC
                    Near as anyone can figure, it all
                    began with a guy trying to climb
                    down that drainage grate...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)      Rev. 8/12/8740.

      Cathy nods slowly, obviously afraid to hear what he'll say
      next, but knowing she has to.

                                    CATHY
                      He's not dead... I'd know it if he
                      were dead...

                                    ISAAC
                      Judging from the skid marks, they
                    were doing at least fifty... and
                    he still gets up and runs off.

      Cathy breathes a tremendous sigh of relief and throws her
      arms around Isaac.

                                    CATHY
                      Oh, god... he's out there
                        somewhere... somewhere close.

                                    ISAAC
                              (grimly)
                      Yeah... and so are the Silks.

                                                                  CUT TO:



      Vincent comes down the arched corridor toward CAMERA, limping,
      dragging himself, feeling his way... SHOUTING from the gang
      outside...

The gang comes down a long corridor, searching...

        We gotta spread out.

        You stay here. I don't want no

        your gun.

                        HOWIE
        Aw Chris, that's mine...

But he gives Miss Patricia the shotgun anyway.
The three men move out.



He's feeling his way down a narrow flight of stairs when a
SHOT RINGS OUT; plaster chips near his head. Be ducks, rolls
down the stairs as more SHOTS are fired...

                        PYTHON'S VOICE
        Down here!



They react to the sound of shots, run forward down the
corridor and into

COZY AND MISS PATRICIA

Miss P covers them with the shotgun...

                        MISS PATRICIA
        Back off. Private party.

Isaac and Cathy trade looks, raise their hands...

      Howie starts to work on the bars while Vincent watches warily,
        uncertain of the giant's intentions. But he's got to trust him.
      Be sets to work; the two of them attack the bars together,
        finally pull them free. They both sieze the heavy oaken door,
      begin pulling...

                      Look, Chris. I'll trade you this if

                      I knew... you were close by...

                                    CATHY
