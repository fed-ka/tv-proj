BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting
at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex-
girlfriend.
MAN (O.S.)
Billy Boy!
J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
the office.
J.D.
Get your ass ready! It's almost five
o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
drink on!
J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.
J.D.
Oh God. Give me that.
I'm burning it
once and for all.
J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.
BILLY
Don't!
J.D.
Dude, it's been six months.
You have to
move on.
BILLY nods knowingly.
J.D.
You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot
chick riding your jock all night long.
BILLY
You're such a romantic, J.D.
J.D.
It would help get your mind off of Sarah.
BILLY ponders this for a moment.
BILLY
Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
I've been out of the game so long.
J.D.
Billy, you come out with me tonight, and
I promise you'll get laid.

BILLY
Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson
needs me to update the financial models
for his meeting with the foreign
investors.
J.D.
So what? It's Friday!
You have all
weekend to do that.
BILLY
No I don't. The Germans are taking an
earlier flight back, so the meeting's
been moved to tomorrow.
J.D. thinks for a moment.
J.D.
Well, why don't you just get somebody
else to do your work then?
BILLY
Who?
J.D. gets a big smile on his face.
He has an idea.

HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American
workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up
his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day.
BILLY and J.D. approach...
BILLY
Harold, listen, I need you to update
these models for me.
HAROLD
(confused)
But aren't you supposed to...
BILLY
I know, but something came up. I have to
meet with some clients tonight, so I
won't be able to get to it. It's your
responsibility now. Okay?
Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
protest, J.D. steps forward...
J.D.
And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine
o'clock sharp.

With all the downsizing going on around

just dying to figure out who he should
fire next.
HAROLD
Uh...okay...no problem...
BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.

Billy and J.D. enter the car.
J.D.

song kicks in.

Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through
the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick
in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it.
When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his
car zooms out of the parking lot.

standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off.

KUMAR PATEL (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions
from his NYU Medical School interviewer, DR. Woodruff (middle
aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT.
He's American.
KUMAR
Mononucleosis or mono is an infection
caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
headaches, white patches on the back of
your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
and loss of appetite.
DR. WOODRUFF
Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're
one of the best applicants I've ever
interviewed. Not that it's a surprise.
Your father is very respected in his
field. You know he and I had some pretty
wild times when we were in med school.
KUMAR
Really?
DR. WOODRUFF
Yeah. We started our own basketball team--
the Hemoglobin Trotters...
(cracking up)
Yeah, we were crazy.
Kumar nods and smiles.
Woodruff finally stops laughing...
DR. WOODRUFF
Anyway-- just one more question.
(reading from a clipboard)
What are some potential symptoms of
pancreatitis?
KUMAR
Let's see. There might be epigastric
tenderness, diffuse abdominal
tenderness...
Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls
out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.

I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?
Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.
KUMAR

Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking.
(listening)
Oh, hey.
(listening)
Nothing important. I can talk. What's up?
Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of
coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office.
Intercut:
Harold is talking on his office phone...
HAROLD
I'm not gonna be able to partake in our
usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta
stay late at the office.
KUMAR
(into the phone)
Fuck that shit! We had plans!
Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.
HAROLD
I know, but I gotta get this work done.
KUMAR
Oh come on! When has getting high ever
prevented you from finishing your work?
Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt.
Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.
HAROLD (O.S.)
Listen, I'd love to go home, but...
KUMAR
No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter
of the finest herb in New York City, and
I'm not smoking it alone.

blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay
good. See you later.
Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down.
Dr. Woodruff is
stunned.
KUMAR
(to Dr. Woodruff)
Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More
symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased
bowel sounds, possibly fever,
dehydration, and sometimes even shock.
DR. WOODRUFF
(livid)
Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a
proper interview. Do you actually believe
after the way you've behaved that I would
ever even consider recommending you for
admission?
KUMAR
No.
I'd actually be pretty surprised.
Dr. Woodruff is flustered.
He doesn't know how to react.
KUMAR
Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad
will keep paying for my apartment. I'm
not really planning on going to med
school.
DR. WOODRUFF
(confused)
But...you have perfect MCAT scores!
KUMAR
Well, I'm not an idiot.
Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words.
Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr.
Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.
KUMAR
Wow!
Is this your daughter?
A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's

HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes
up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak...
HAROLD
So Maria, what's been going on?
MARIA
Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week.
How about you?
HAROLD
My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I
caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy
who works next to me decided to bathe for
a change.
MARIA
Really?
HAROLD

He's cooking me a really nice dinner.
HAROLD

Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place
is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a
poster of "BILLY MADISON."
HAROLD
Kumar?
KUMAR (O.C.)
Yeah, I'm in here!
Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's
Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the
floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap
posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a
Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar
is not in the room, however.
HAROLD
Kumar?
KUMAR (O.C.)
In here...
Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA
furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN
FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a "clipping sound"
coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked
and appalled. Harold walks inside...
HAROLD
Kumar, what the hell are you doing!
KUMAR
I'm trimming my pubes.
Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple
more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.
HAROLD
Why aren't you doing this in your room!
KUMAR
The mirror's in here.

Are those my scissors? Oh my God!
I

KUMAR
Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with

One of the senior analysts asked me to do
a bunch of his work for him tonight.
Kumar walks back into Harold's room...

I assume you gave him the appropriate "go
fuck yourself."

loud and clear.

Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...

Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds
AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover--
inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana.
Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy.
The phone next to the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn't
care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up.

Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your
interview today was good. I'm calling to
remind you that you have another one
tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from

Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T.
book and starts rolling a fat blunt...

So what? It's not like there's a

dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor.
Just because everyone in my family went
to med school, doesn't mean I have to.

HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently
bumps chests with his teammates.
HAROLD
Turn the car around.
KUMAR
Why? Are cars not allowed to go through
when a game's going on? When we were
kids, we used to move to the side when we
were playing in the street.
The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.
HAROLD
For some reason, I don't think this is
the same thing.
KUMAR
I'm going through.
KUMAR begins inching forward.
HAROLD
Don't!
The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.
KUMAR
Look.
They're moving.
I told you.
Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,
they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all
times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball.
HAROLD
Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.
KUMAR

HAROLD and KUMAR are looking for the White Castle...
HAROLD
Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like
twenty of those burgers.
KUMAR
I'll see your twenty and raise you five
orders of fries.
HAROLD
God, where the hell is this place?
KUMAR
Don't worry, we'll find it.
HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead...
HAROLD
There's the multiplex!
KUMAR
That means the White Castle should be
just around the corner...
HAROLD AND KUMAR'S MOUTHS DROP! INSTEAD OF WHITE CASTLE,
THEY SEE A BURGER SHACK. THEY'RE IN TOTAL SHOCK.
HAROLD
What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That
doesn't look like a White Castle to me!
KUMAR
We gotta get to the bottom of this!

KUMAR is driving with determination in his eyes.
KUMAR
White Castle, here we come. I just wish
we had some more pot. I'm almost
completely sober right now.
HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP--
trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign
on for the PRINCETON EXIT.
KUMAR
Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here.
Kumar takes the exit.
HAROLD
Why?
KUMAR
We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into
finding us some weed.
HAROLD
Oh no.
I'm not seeing Cindy.
KUMAR
Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the
phone all the time.
HAROLD
She calls me. Then she rambles on about
her East Asian Students club or whatever.

KUMAR
A twinkie?
HAROLD
You know, yellow on the outside, white on
the inside.
KUMAR
Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our
weed out the window, so now it's your
duty to make sure we're high as shit by
the time we're eating those burgers.
HAROLD
Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy
doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.
KUMAR
As long as she buzzes us into a dorm,
we're set. Give me ten minutes in there
and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy.
HAROLD
No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim.

HAROLD is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute,
prim and proper, Korean girl). Sitting on the floor are A
DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy
clothes, etc). Harold is kind of creeped out by them.
CINDY
I'm so glad you showed up, Harold!
HAROLD
(unenthusiastic)
Yeah. Me too.
CINDY
Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued
to the envelope I sent you?
HAROLD
Uh, yeah.
They were...nice.
Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises
his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to
Cindy. "Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?"
Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while...
HAROLD

KENNETH
Kenneth Park. Class of 2004. Is it true
you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan?
HAROLD
Yeah, I'm a junior analyst.
KENNETH
Awesome!
KENNETH high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him.
He then raises his hand again. HAROLD rolls his eyes...
HAROLD
Yes?
KENNETH
Uh, this is actually a two-part question.
I'm applying for a summer internship at
Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a)
what it's like being an investment banker
and b) if you would write me a
recommendation.
HAROLD
What it's like being an investment
banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's
pretty...
HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian
students. He can't bear to tell them the truth...
HAROLD
...awesome?
All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.
HAROLD
As for the recommendation, I may be able
to make a call or two...
CINDY looks at her watch...
CINDY
Actually Harold, we should be getting to
the party. We can discuss all this stuff
there. It's just down the hall.
All the Asian students get up...
HAROLD
Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait
for Kumar...

Kumar runs down the hall and finds HAROLD walking with CINDY

KUMAR

There are these two filthy pussies who
are just aching to get boned by us.

CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.
HAROLD
(to Kumar)
Let's go to the party for a little while.
KUMAR
Fuck that!
KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room,
and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in
his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy...
KUMAR
Here-- this is Harold's understudy.
You
can do whatever you want with him.

KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY

HAROLD

KUMAR

HAROLD and KUMAR try to decide where to hide.
HAROLD

KUMAR
Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for
us in the women's bathroom.
Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom.
KUMAR
Shit!
Get in that stall!
There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD
RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the
BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER
TWO and shuts the door behind him.
The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL.
Harold's

CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom.
They're
in mid-conversation.
CHRISTY
Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with
that cute Indian bloke.

IN STALL NUMBER TWO, KUMAR'S ears perk up, as we see HAROLD
and KUMAR both standing on the toilet bowl. From Kumar's POV,
he sees CHRISTY and CLARISSA through the crack of the door.

The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
look over at that stall.
CHRISTY
Oh great.
Now I think I have to go.
CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door.
The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at
each other grossed out.
From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the
girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls.
WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL.
CLARISSA
Ahhhhh!
HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified.
There is silence for a few
seconds until....
CHRISTY
Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle
shits?
We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?"
CLARISSA
Oh my God. We haven't played that since

Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST
ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the
"nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each
other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP.
Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the
dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the
couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES.
KENNETH
Pot brownies for everyone!
Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at
them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it.
Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth...
CUTE ASIAN CHICK #1
Hey, K-dog!
Can we have some brownies?
KENNETH
To tell you the truth, I'm running low.
But a quick titty flash may persuade me.
The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!"
They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs.
KUMAR
Dude, I'm starting to think you made a
mistake by not going to this party...
Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY
GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER
SECURITY GUARD (#2)--
SECURITY GUARD

KUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE
GUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM...

Further down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers
watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a
quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she
notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing.
Cindy Kim notices Harold...
CINDY KIM
Harold!
They keep running, past the bathrooms, where Christy and
Clarissa exit...
CHRISTY AND CLARISSA

They continue running.
The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see
the EXIT DOORS just ahead. Suddenly, the Hippie Asshole
walks by, blocking their path.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE

Where the hell is 109, man?
Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close
and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING
HIM ON HIS ASS.
Harold and Kumar burst out the doors and EXIT THE DORM...
The Security Guards run by the Hippie Asshole, but stop when
they see his backpack, which is half-open, and is exposing
THE GIANT BAG OF WEED. The Security Guard picks it up...

looking hot tonight! The fact that you're
not into her just might make you gay!

What?
You'd rather have Maria?
From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.
HAROLD
Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end
up with Cindy anyway. It's just more
practical. Now can we drop this and get
our asses to White Castle?

He hits the gas
and continues driving down the dark road...
HAROLD

KUMAR

don't worry. Once we get on the highway,
we'll be there soon.
HAROLD

KUMAR

HAROLD
Look, I'm completely on edge right now,
okay? After all the shit we've been
through tonight, I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

SEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS
BITING HIS NECK...

nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins
walking over to them.

BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five
years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire.
HAROLD
Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come
to the hospital.
Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.
KUMAR'S FATHER

I hope you are here to apologize for what
you did in your interview today. Dr.
Woodruff is a very good friend of mine,
and let's just say he was not at all
amused by your antics...and neither am I.
SAIKAT

What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar?
Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a

You can have all that too, if you'd just
get off your ass and go to med school.

grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on...

they'll

we walk
right into the pharmacy and get
the weed.
Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.

HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks)
walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...
HAROLD
If we get caught, you're taking the
blame. This wasn't my idea.
KUMAR
We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna
get toasted and then we're gonna eat
delicious White Castle-- just like we
planned.
All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked
out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy
feely).

It's a good thing I found you two. All
the other surgeons are working on other
patients...
The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.
HAROLD
Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all
wrong. We're not doc...
KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.
KUMAR
What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we
need to sedate the patient first or else
he could go into cardiac arrest.
HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.
MALE NURSE
Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist.
The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.
KUMAR
Hold on. What we should probably use is
marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate
the patient for surgery.
MALE NURSE

Marijuana? But why...
KUMAR
We don't have time for questions! We
need marijuana now! Get as much of it as
possible! Like a big bag of it!

Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...
MALE NURSE
We're losing him! You gotta do something!
KUMAR

Very well. I guess we'll have to do this
the old fashioned way.
KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face.
Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing?"
KUMAR (CONT'D)
First, we need to clear his C-spine. I
want stat x-rays of the chest and
abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and
start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we
need 2 units of O neg on board.
Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing
bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe
what's going on.
Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's
gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate
begins speeding up to an insane pace.
MALE NURSE
Doctor! The patient is desatting!
Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...
KUMAR
Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed
lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat!

The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE NEEDLE!
Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's
chest. It's a tense moment. The Patient is scared. So is
Harold. The Nurse looks hopeful. Kumar looks determined.
With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's
chest, causing a rush of air! The Patient breathes easier.
His heart rate drops back to normal.
MALE NURSE
Great catch doctor! His sat is up to 94!
Kumar is cool and collected. He turns to the YOUNG MEDICAL
TECHNICIANS who have been aiding the surgery.
KUMAR

Will one of you guys put the chest tube
in and wrap this up?
A chorus of "yes, doctors."
KUMAR

Well, it looks like my work here is done.
Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his
face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous.
He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just
barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits...

I'm telling you, things are finally
starting to go our way.
While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his
surroundings and notices something...
KUMAR
Hey, check it out!
Your movie's playing.
Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater
we see: "JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.
SIXTEEN CANDLES - 11:00.
KUMAR
And look who went to see it...
Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA
standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.
HAROLD
Holy shit.
KUMAR
You see? You thought you two had nothing
in common. But it turns out you both
have the same lame taste in movies. Hey,
you wanna see if she wants to come with
us to White Castle?
HAROLD
No way.
Forget about it.
Just drive.
Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his
undivided attention.
KUMAR
Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an
hour from home. And who do we see, but
your dream girl standing outside a
theater playing your favorite movie. I
mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic
comedy, and I was your annoying gay
friend, this would be the moment I'd tell
you "this is a sign."
HAROLD
Stop it.

KUMAR
Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy
Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina
Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you
yourself said things are starting to go
our way...
HAROLD
Let's just go!
KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.
HAROLD
What are you doing?!
KUMAR
(calling out)
Hey Maria!
MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN
REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR
STARTS PEELING OUT...
KUMAR
Hey, get your hand off the gas!
Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.
Just then,
THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY...
KUMAR
(looking up)
Oh shit!
Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING
DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL.
KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car
safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill.
Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.
HAROLD
You asshole! My car's probably all
scratched up now!
KUMAR
Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us
off the road!
HAROLD
I told you I didn't want to speak to her!
(composing himself)
Whatever. Let's jut get back on the
highway.

KUMAR
Fine.
KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!"
Harold and
Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.

The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is in the front seat, on the
passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between them.
HAROLD
Thanks for helping us out.
FREAK SHOW
No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded
there and thought to myself, "what would
Jesus do?"
Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a
JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard...
FREAK SHOW
So, you boys worship Christ?
The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.
HAROLD
KUMAR
Uh...Yeah.
Sure, he's great.
UGLY MAN
Great. Good to hear it. The name's
Randy...but everyone calls me Freak Show.
KUMAR
I'm Kumar. This is Harold.
Good to meet
you, Mr...Freak Show.
FREAK SHOW
Pleasure's all mine.
After a while, HAROLD starts to notice that they're driving
in the middle of a dark woods. It looks very sketchy.
HAROLD
So where exactly are we going?

FREAK SHOW
Don't worry. My place isn't too far from
here. Once we get there, I'll have your
ride fixed up in a jiffy.
The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a
RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.
KUMAR
(whispering to Harold)
Eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at
FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.
KUMAR
(whispering)
Oh my God! You gotta look!
One of
them's actually pulsating!
HAROLD
(whispering)
Will you shut up? He's right next to me!
He can hear you!
KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.
KUMAR
(whispering)
Now there's some sort of puss! It's the
most disgusting thing I've ever seen!
HAROLD
(whispering)
What's the matter with you? You think
that just because you're whispering, he
can't hear what you're saying? He's two
feet away from us. He can hear this
entire conversation. He can hear me
talking right now.
KUMAR
(whispering)
Don't worry, he can't hear anything.
Not
with all that crust in his ear.
HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then
looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard
a thing. Harold seems relieved.
FREAK SHOW
I heard every word you said.
FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't
know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact
that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.

HAROLD and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL
TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy
Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.
LIANE
Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane.
Would
you boys like some pink lemonade?
HAROLD and KUMAR can't move.
They're awestruck.
LIANE
Let me go bring in a pitcher.
LIANE
leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she
turns
on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG
ABOUT
JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house.
There
are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with
Freak
Show and Liane's wedding picture...

HAROLD
Okay. It's official.
We've entered the

KUMAR
Dude, Liane is fucking hot!
HAROLD
She's not ugly.
LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.
She pours them
drinks and hands them the glasses...
KUMAR
Thanks.
(beat)
So, tell me Liane-- how are things
between you and Freak Show presently?
LIANE
Oh, never been better.
We love each
other very much.
KUMAR looks disappointed.
HAROLD, however, is intrigued...
HAROLD
Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak
Show...end up with a woman like yourself?
LIANE
Well, I met him at choir practice `bout
four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
back then-- you know, because of all the
hideous boils on his face and neck. But
he had the most amazing voice -- like a
baby canary.
Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
talking about the same Freakshow?"
LIANE
Well, one day after Easter service, I
told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
he just mustered up some courage and
asked me out. The rest is history. And
we've been in love ever since.
HAROLD ponders this for a moment.
He and KUMAR begin
drinking their lemonade.
LIANE
So you boys gonna fuck me or what?
HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They
look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.

HAROLD

Show...and this whole Christian thing you
guys have going on?
LIANE
(a little offended)
Oh, so just because we're passionate
about our Lord, you assume we don't know
how to have a good time?
HAROLD
No, I just...
Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and
Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window,
where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.
HAROLD
Nevermind.
(to Kumar, swinging his
hand)
Okay, rock, paper, scissors...
LIANE
Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do
me at the same time.
HAROLD
Huh?
LIANE
Come on.
Give me the double stuff.
HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.
KUMAR
I'm not sure we quite understand...
LIANE
I want you both inside me simultaneously.
HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and
kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...
KUMAR
Um, are we talking about one hole or two?
LIANE
However you want to do it.

Sorry, no thank you.
KUMAR

Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad.

Shotgun anus!
HAROLD
Forget it! I don't want our balls
rubbing against each other. No way!
KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...
KUMAR
What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow
jobs!?
LIANE
Well...okay.
(to Harold)
Can you help me with this...?
Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and
puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,
who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the
cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
breasts.
LIANE
(to Harold, re: breasts)
Do you want to play with them?
Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...
HAROLD
Okay, let's do that.
Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold
starts to massage her chest.
AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a
particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...
FREAK SHOW
Hey boys-- I changed your tire...
FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...

KUMAR
No.
You did. We both heard you.

KUMAR
Positive.
FREAK SHOW ponders this.

KUMAR searches for some clue of where they are.
KUMAR
Dude, I have no idea where we are.
All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.
KUMAR
Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?
HAROLD
And get chopped to bits?
Are you crazy?
Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...
KUMAR
Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know
how to get us back on the highway.
HAROLD
Fuck that! It's my car! We're not
picking up a hitchhiker!
The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car.
NEIL
Yo, man, thanks for picking me up.
HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other.
THEY ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. Harold is no longer angry.
HAROLD
(to Neil)
Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil
Patrick Harris?
NEIL
Yep.
KUMAR
Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was
my favorite TV show growing up! You were

NEIL

Hey, that's great. Do you think we could
get going? I'm bored as shit back here.

KUMAR
So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you
ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
NEIL
Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on
that show.
KUMAR
Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
NEIL
No, I didn't go all the way with her.
HAROLD
Hey, you don't know how to get back on
the highway, do you?
NEIL
I don't even know where the fuck I am
right now. I was at this party earlier
tonight, and this dude hooked me up with
some killer X. Somehow I ended up
getting thrown out of a moving car, and
I've been tripping balls ever since.
HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.
KUMAR
Well, our night's been pretty crazy too.
We've been driving around for hours,
trying to get to White Castle, but we
keep getting sidetracked.
NEIL
Dude, forget White Castle.
What we need
is some pussy.
HAROLD
Huh?
NEIL
It's a fucking sausage fest in here.
Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll
go to White Castle.
KUMAR
You don't understand, Neil. We've been

and get directions.
KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET
leading up to a gas station in the distance...

HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and
the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from
the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a
HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS
SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES

INDIAN CASHIER
(to Cole and the punks)
Please...the pies...do not...
Cole and the Punks ignore him.
Harold and Kumar then
approach the Indian Cashier...
HAROLD
Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get
onto the highway from here?
The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.
KUMAR
(to Harold)
He probably can't speak English...
KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE
CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the
directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to
explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It
sounds like it's very complicated.
Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK
AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.
Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the
CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches
nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...
KUMAR
Who knew that learning Hindi would
actually pay off? The guy says the
highway's just down the road. We should
be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.
HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...
HAROLD
(to Kumar)
Huh?
Oh, good.
COLE (O.S.)
EXTREME KAYAKING!!!
HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and
look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY
THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH
THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR...
In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid-
air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,
GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC.
The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR,
and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.

The kayak lands on the floor.
COLE gets out and celebrates
with his friends.
COLE
That was so fucking extreme, man!
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten--
one being not so extreme, ten being
extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine
point five.
Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy
throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves,
bothering other customers.
The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.
Extreme
Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of
various
kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an
other.
Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS.
He goes
apeshit over his find.
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
Extreme Cheddar!
He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth,
getting the chips all over the place.
The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.
Cole picks up the
Cashier...
COLE

Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER
around and around.
HAROLD
Somebody should do something.
KUMAR
(to Cole)
Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy
alone and go jerk off to some
snowboarding videos or something.
EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS
Oooooooooh!
Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the
floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get
their asses kicked.

HAROLD
(to Kumar)
I didn't mean you should do something.
Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face.
Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior.
It's a tense moment.
Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground
without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks
don't know what to think as their leader is shown up.
Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as
if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back,
doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard,
this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...
KUMAR
(pissed off at himself)
Shit.
Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.
COLE
Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking
with me one more time. Just try it!
Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.
KUMAR
(to Kumar, embarrassed)
Come on, lets get out of here.
Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.
With their
leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.

Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the
talk we had, right Brad?
Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.
HIPPIE ASSHOLE

Mom-- please take me home...
The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a
frightened child.
Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we
see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's
WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on
Harold...
Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...
HAROLD
Can I at least give you my car's licence

Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him
is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold
sits down, across from Tarik.
While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the
cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.
HAROLD
So what are you in here for?
TARIK
For being black.

TARIK
I am serious. You wanna know what
happened?
Harold nods.
TARIK
I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble,
and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black
man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,
since I'm black, it was probably me,
right?
Harold shrugs his shoulders.
TARIK
Well that was the logic the cop used. I
told him I haven't even been to Newark in
months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
told me to stop resisting arrest. I
said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything."
So he starts beating me with his gun,
screaming at me, telling me to stop
resisting.
HAROLD
Holy shit.
What did you do?
TARIK
I kept saying, "I understand that I'm
under arrest. Please stop beating me."
But that didn't work. Then another cop
showed up. Then another. When it was
all said and done, it took nine cops to
bring me in here.
HAROLD
That fucking blows!
Tarik nods and continues reading his book.
Harold sees that
Tarik is remarkably relaxed.
HAROLD
I don't understand how you're able to be
so calm about all this.
TARIK
Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance.
And I have two gay fathers. I've had
people messing with me my whole life.

TARIK

HAROLD
No. I actually did hit the cop. But
only because I was trying to hit my
friend. Well, ex-friend.
Suddenly, OFFICER REILLY hangs up the phone on his desk. He
shouts out to the other officers in the room:
OFFICER REILLY
Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun shots
fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!
OFFICER PALUMBO
Finally, some action! I'm going!

Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.

Kumar walks away from the cell, goes over to the desk, picks
up the bag of weed and caresses it...
HAROLD
What the hell are you...
Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room,
pushing a black man wearing pajamas (NATHANIEL BANKS).
Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck
sweater.
OFFICER PALUMBO
(to Nathaniel)
You thought you could get away with this,
huh?
NATHANIEL
Where am I? I was in bed.
I didn't fire
any gun, I swear...
Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell...
OFFICER REILLY
(pointing)
Look!
All the cops turn to the cell. Kumar is still holding the
weed. He doesn't know what to do. Harold is scared shitless.
OFFICER PALUMBO
(re: Tarik)
Shit! Jackson's trying to escape!
Tarik looks up from his book...
TARIK
What?
Oh, not again!
The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run
over to the jail cell, ignoring Kumar and the weed.
OFFICER PALUMBO
Stop trying to escape!
TARIK
I'm not trying to escape!
Look at me,
I'm sitting down!
They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm
into the room. Harold stands back, confused. Tarik leans
against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. The cops grab him
and throw him down against the bed.

He's trying to break free! Hold him

In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls
him out of the cell. HAROLD GOES OVER TO PALUMBO'S DESK AND
PICKS UP HIS WALLET AND LAPTOP, along with the police report.
They start running out of the room. Kumar's still clinging
to the weed.
HAROLD
(to Kumar)
Wait-- shouldn't we do something about
this?
NATHANIEL

If I were you, I'd get out of here as
soon as possible.

NEIL PATRICK HARRIS IS DRIVING THE CAR, SURROUNDED BY FOUR

THE STRIPPERS ARE ALL OVER NEIL, KISSING HIS NECK, AND
PASSING A JOINT AROUND.

HAROLD
I had to do something.
KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air...
KUMAR
Wait.
Do you smell that?
KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He
reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's
a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see
EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap.

Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White
Castle. Want me to drive?
HAROLD
No. I've got everything under control. We
should be able to get there with enough
time for me to get my work done after our
feast. Just find us some tunes.
A tape is resting in the tape deck.

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other amazed that COLE has some

Harold and Kumar walk inside. Their shirts are torn and
tattered, their bodies are scratched up, and they're covered
in dirt. Everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them.
They approach the counter, where A TEENAGER STANDING...
TEENAGER
Looks like you guys had some night, huh?
Harold and Kumar look at each other, and then back at the
teenager. Their expressions are stone cold...
HAROLD
I want thirty slyders. I want five french
fries. I want four large Cherry cokes.
KUMAR
Same.
Only make mine Diet Cokes.
TEENAGER
Wow. That comes to...forty-two dollars
and seventy-five cents.

Let me take care of it.
HAROLD and KUMAR turn around and see NEIL PATRICK HARRIS
finishing his coke. He throws it in the trash. HAROLD and
KUMAR are stunned.
KUMAR
What are you doing here?
NEIL
You guys kept talking about White Castle
last night. It made me start craving it
too.
HAROLD
Where's my fucking car you prick!
NEIL
Yeah. Sorry about that. Like I said, I
was tripping balls last night. I don't
know what came over me. Your car's out
in the parking lot. Here are the keys.
NEIL tosses HAROLD the car keys.
KUMAR
Do you realize what we had to go through
after you stole the car?
NEIL
I know. It was a dick move on my part.
That's why I'm paying for your meal.
Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved.
HAROLD
Thanks, I guess.
NEIL hands them some cash...

With that, NEIL walks out of the restaurant.
HAROLD and
KUMAR look at each other, confused.
TEENAGER
Hey guys...it's gonna take a little while
to make all those burgers. You might as
well sit down.
HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to a booth and take a seat.
KUMAR
Dude, we're here. Isn't it great?
HAROLD
I know. I can't believe we made it. AND
we got the car back! If we can just get
out of here in a half hour, I can get
back to my office and get the work done.
KUMAR
Hey, look!
KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.
On the
screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW.

Today's top story...Rutgers professor
Tarik Jackson and attorney Nathaniel
Banks are suing the state of New Jersey
for racial discrimination and police
brutality. We go live to the municipal
state courthouse in Muckleburg...
Tarik and Nathaniel have a bunch of microphones in front of
them...
TARIK
What happened last night was a complete
moral travesty. My family and I are
outraged and will not settle for anything
less than justice...

We see Tarik joined by his parents (Two Old Gay Black Men--
one is comforting the other). Nathaniel walks in front of
the microphone...
NATHANIEL
(very professional)
And by justice, we mean somewhere in the
ballpark of ten million dollars....
HAROLD
(to Kumar)
Hey, good for those black guys!
ON THE TELEVISION:
We see footage of OFFICER PALUMBO and THE OTHER COPS taken
away in handcuffs...
OFFICER PALUMBO
I'm not racist! This is bullshit! If
those black bastards think they're gonna
get away with this, they've got another
thing coming! Me and my white buddies
are gonna [bleep] them up!
Officer Palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a
police car.
Harold and Kumar enjoy this.

gang of hooligans...
We see a picture of COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS in the

night, along with a companion, believed
to be his accomplice...
HAROLD'S JAW DROPS. He's scared shitless.

Police have made the following sketch of
the two fugitives, which they believe to
be quote "extremely accurate."
ON THE SCREEN, WE SEE A HORRIBLE POLICE SKETCH OF "HAROLD"
and "KUMAR"-- IT IS BASICALLY AN ASIAN MAN IN HIS SEVENTIES
WHO LOOKS LIKE CONFUCIOUS; THE KUMAR SKETCH IS AN OLD INDIAN
MAN WITH A JEWEL ON HIS FOREHEAD, WEARING A TURBAN.

Hey, guys...I got your orders!
HAROLD and KUMAR run out of the booth.

HAROLD and KUMAR have put three tables together, on which we

TWO GOOD-LOOKING GUYS (JON and HAYDEN) stare at Harold and
Kumar's orders, amazed by their size. They then look at
their own orders and realize how worthless they are.
HAROLD and KUMAR are sitting across from one another, looking
at the smorgasbord in front of them. HAROLD IS ABOUT TO DIG
IN, BUT KUMAR STOPS HIM...
KUMAR
Wait...let's do it together.

HAROLD and KUMAR have finished their meals. They both look
full and satisfied. Harold takes one last sip of his soda.
HAROLD
Oh...that hit the spot.
KUMAR
It was the best meal of my life.
HAROLD
Mine too.
The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty
containers and wrappers. After a long pause of silence,
KUMAR speaks...
KUMAR
Dude, you know what? I think I may
actually go to my interview today.
HAROLD
Seriously?
KUMAR
Yeah. You know, my whole life I've been
afraid being just another nerdy Indian
guy turned doctor. Well, tonight got me
thinking...
SUDDENLY, HAROLD NOTICES A CONVERTIBLE PARKING OUTSIDE THE
RESTAURANT-- IT'S BILLY AND J.D. WITH TWO WOMEN.
KUMAR
There are far worse things in the world
than being tagged for having a natural
ability in medicine...
HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE
FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their
women and start walking towards the front door.
KUMAR
Like having boils all over your face. Or
dealing with the shit those black guys
had to go through.
HAROLD
(not paying attention)
Uh-huh.

KUMAR
Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty
cool saving that guy's life last night.
Somewhere between that, getting yelled at
by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick
Harris, I realized that I've always
wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been
too scared to admit it.
KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...
KUMAR
Hey, Rold, are you listening to me?
I'm
having a major epiphany here.
HAROLD
I'll be right back...
At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with
their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like
some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On
the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about
her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...
J.D.
Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?
BILLY
I'll be there in a second...
J.D. and TRACY check out the menu. BILLY takes ZOE aside--
whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you
complete me" moment...
BILLY
Look, I have to admit something to you.
At the start of last night, all I really
cared about was getting some. But then I
met you, Zoe. You're so different from
all the other women I've ever met.
You're smart, funny, artistic. I guess
what I'm trying to say is...
HAROLD (O.S.)
What the fuck is going on here?
BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...
BILLY
Harold?

night with "clients." Isn't that why I
had to do YOUR work?

HAROLD

to him goes double for you!
KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.
J.D.
Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just
call me "cock boy?"
HAROLD
Yeah, you know I did. You're just
stalling because you're not quick enough
to think of a comeback.
J.D.
Oh, I'm not quick enough?

He thinks I'm not quick enough.

Well, I got news for you...

I am quick enough...

J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.
BILLY

Don't even bother with him.
We'll just
tell Berenson later...
HAROLD
Tell him what? That I'm your work horse!
That you guys think you can just party
all weekend and leave all your work to
the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh?
J.D. is stunned.

you both caught gonorrhea from that
whore.
TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out.
They slowly
back away from BILLY and J.D....

Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING
MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend.

left for Europe this morning.
Harold quickly turns around and runs back over.

walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...
AISHA

LUIS

me a favor-- make me that omelette you
were talking about. You know, with the
