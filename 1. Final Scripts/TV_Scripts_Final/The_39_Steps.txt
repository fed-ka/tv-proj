      INT. COLONIAL GENTLEMEN S CLUB. NIGHT. DAY 111

      Caption  - LONDON JUNE 28TH, 1914

    The gentle sound of snoring. A white cotton gloved hand 
      carries a silver plated tray. On it a cut glass tumbler 
      with a whisky. Next to it a bottle of soda. The tray 
      arrives at a large leather chair. 

                                  WAITER
                    Your malt, MrHannay. 

      RICHARD HANNAY looks up from his newspaper. He is in his 
      30 s, handsome, tanned, in evening wear with black bow tie.

                                  HANNAY
                          (taking the glass)
                    Thank you.

                                  WAITER
                    Soda, sir.

                                  HANNAY
                    No. Thank you.

    The waiter turns and leaves, revealing the club. No one 
      under the age of 65. All men, all in evening dress, some 
      asleep. HANNAY looks to his left. Two old men talking.

                                  OLD MAN 
                    Sticky wicket old man, that s 
                    what did for him. 

    The other old man nods. They slip into silence.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    In cafes and salons across 
                    Europe, groups huddled together 
                    discussing politics, philosophy, 
                      nationhood. In London the talk 
                    was of Hobbs  dismissal for 4 by 
                    Haigat the Oval. That s cricket 
                    by the way. 

      HANNAY downs his whisky in one gulp.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    I d only recently returned from 
                    Africa. Everything in England 
                    seemed cliquey, claustrophobic, 
                    class bound. And frankly deathly, 
                    deathly, dull.  

      HANNAY puts the glass down and leaves.        The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.2.


      INT. COLONIAL GENTLEMEN S CLUB. FOYER. NIGHT. DAY 122

      HANNAY comes into the foyer. A concierge stands by his 
      desk. HANNAY passes a bust of Queen Victoria and a silent 
      telephone cabinet. And goes out through the double doors.


      EXT. STREET. DAY. DAY 233

    The sound of heavy breathing, a man running. It s early 
      morning. SCUDDER, 40 s, outdoor coat is fleeing down the 
      street at speed. A lamplighter is putting out lights. A 
      horse drawn vehicle trundles down the street. A police 
      CONSTABLE stands on a corner. SCUDDER, aware of the 
      CONSTABLE, slows down. Moves on then SCUDDER looks behind 
      him, is he being followed? As he turns back he bumps into a 
      lone passerby. SCUDDER instantly alert. He pushes the man 
      violently to one side. The passerby says  Watch out. 
      SCUDDER doesn t apologise.He turns and runs across the 
      road. A car comes down the road as SCUDDER rounds a corner, 
      disappears from view.


      EXT. ANOTHER STREET. DAY. DAY 244

      HANNAY is walking down a different street. His bow tie is 
      undone, he s slightly squiffy. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    Bored, I d taken to staying out 
                    at night, seeking entertainment.

    On the streets newspaper boards are going up. Reading them 
    as he walks past - TENSIONS RISE IN BALKANS.


      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY. DAY 255

      SCUDDER rounds the corner at speed. And runs towards a 
      large apartment block. He rushes up to the revolve of the 
      entrance. And goes through it.


      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY. DAY 266

      SCUDDER racing up the stairs to the third floor. He goes to 
      a door marked 31, takes out his keys and enters.


      INT. SCUDDER S FLAT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. DAY 277

      SCUDDER goes over to a large pot which contains an 
      aspidistra. He removes the aspidistra which sits in a 
      separate plant pot. He then removes a false bottom in the 
      pot. And brings out a - notebook and revolver.         The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.3.


    He puts the notebook in his inside pocket and the gun in 
    his right pocket. All done at speed.


      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING. DAY. DAY 288

      With HANNAY as he comes through the entrance revolve. He 
      starts to climb the staircase. Behind him through the door 
      come two men, ACKERMAN and ENGEL. They are dressed in day 
      suits, smart, respectable. 

      SCUDDER coming at speed down the stairs from the third 
      floor to the second. He sees HANNAY coming up the stairs. 
    AND behind him ACKERMAN and ENGEL. SCUDDER pulls back round 
    the corner of another corridor before they can see him. 

      With HANNAY as he turns on to a second floor landing. He 
      pulls out his keys as - ACKERMAN and ENGEL continue up the 
      stairs to the third. 

      HANNAY opens his door goes through AND before he can close 
    the door, SCUDDER follows him in.

    The door closing with a loud slam. ACKERMAN on the stairs 
    to the third floor looking back.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. HALLWAY. DAY. DAY 299

      HANNAY and SCUDDER staring at each other. HANNAY puts his 
      keys in his pocket. He plays calm while assessing the 
      situation. (This is a bachelor rented apartment.)

                                  HANNAY
                    It s Mr.. Scudder, isn t it? I 
                    believe you live on the third 
                    floor.

                                  SCUDDER
                    There are two men out there who 
                    want to kill me.

      HANNAY staring at this obviously demented man. Tries the 
      light approach.

                                  HANNAY
                    If you make a habit of crashing 
                    into other people s homes I m not 
                    surprised. 

      HANNAY goes to open the front door again, his hand is on 
    the door knob. (By the door is a small chest of drawers.) 
      HANNAY hears the sound of a gun being cocked. He freezes 
    for a moment. One hand on the door-handle, his other hand 
    is shielded from sight by his body. A moment. Then HANNAY 
      turns.         The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.4.


      SCUDDER stands with his revolver in his right hand pointing 
    at HANNAY. SCUDDER looks down. HANNAY too has a revolver 
      pointing at SCUDDER. Behind him the top drawer of the chest 
    of drawers is open. The two men stare at each other.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    I m not afraid to fire. I served *
                    as a soldier...*

                                  SCUDDER
                    Second Boer War, intelligence *
                    officer under Hamilton at 
                    Rooiwal.

                                  HANNAY
                          (wary)
                    How did you know that?

                                  SCUDDER
                    It s my business to know who my 
                    neighbours are, MrHannay.

      A moment. Then SCUDDER returns his gun to his pocket. 
      HANNAY keeps his where it is. HANNAY waves his gun 
      indicating they should move through to the living room.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. DAY 21010

    The curtains are drawn. Sun filtering in through the 
      chinks. SCUDDER comes in. Followed by HANNAY with his gun 
      pointed at SCUDDER. 

                                  HANNAY
                    What s the story?

      HANNAY goes and pulls back the curtains still with the gun 
      pointed at SCUDDER. SCUDDER steps defensively back so as 
    not to be visible from the street. A moment SCUDDER looks 
    at HANNAY as though debating whether he can trust him then -

                                  SCUDDER
                    I m a freelance agent with the 
                    British Secret Service Bureau.

                                  HANNAY
                          (confused)
                    My housekeepersaid you were an *
                      accountant.

                                  SCUDDER
                          (don t be stupid)
                    I don t make a habit of telling 
                    people I m a spy.

                                  SCUDDER (cont'd)
                    Last night I was supposed to meet 
                    someone from the Bureau to 
                    exchange information. It was a 
                    double cross.         The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.5.


      HANNAY smiles in a cynical way. This is crazy but 
      entertaining. HANNAY sits down with his gun still trained 
    on SCUDDER.

                                    SCUDDER(cont d)
                    Obviously I ve been betrayed. 
                    I ve been on the trail of a 
                    German espionage ring operating 
                    in Britain. I tracked its 
                    headquarters to a village in 
                    Scotland. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (humour)
                    You should contact the Weekly 
                    News. They re offering 10 pounds 
                    to anyone spotting a German 
                    agent. An espionage ring could 
                    make you a very wealthy man.

      SCUDDER looks with disdain at HANNAY and his evening suit 
    and open bow tie.

                                  SCUDDER
                          (let down in his 
                            estimation of Hannay)
                    I m sorry to have disturbed you, 
                    MrHannay. 
                          (he looks at HANNAY s 
                          gun)
                    ....with your permission, I ll 
                    attempt to evade my would be
                    assassins and pass on what I ve 
                    learnt to my superior.

      A moment. Then HANNAY lowers his gun. He places it on the 
      table.

                                  HANNAY
                    No one should involve themselves 
                    in intelligence work without a 
                    good breakfast, MrScudder.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. KITCHEN. DAY. DAY 21111

    The view through a window in a door down a fire escape at 
    the back of the building. SCUDDER tries the handle. The 
      door is locked.

                                  SCUDDER
                    Do you have the key to this? 

    Two plates of fried eggs and toast sit on the table.  A 
      teapot and two cups. HANNAY places a jug of milk on the 
      table.        The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.6.


                                  HANNAY
                    I ll get it.

      HANNAY turns and leaves the room.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. DAY 21212

      With HANNAY as he comes into the living room. He picks up a 
      bunch of keys from a fruit bowl. 


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. KITCHEN. DAY. DAY 21313

      With HANNAY as he comes back into the room. As he does - he 
      sees SCUDDER holding the jug of milk. He is sucking his 
      right forefinger. He drops his hand. Puts the jug down.

                                  HANNAY
                    Eat, MrScudder. Life never seems 
                    as grim after a couple of fried 
                    eggs.

      HANNAY goes over to the fire escape door and unlocks it. He 
      pushes the door to check it s open. It is. He closes it 
      again. 

      SCUDDER has started his breakfast. HANNAY sits down 
      opposite him and starts to tuck in. SCUDDER puts down his 
      knife and fork and scrutinizes HANNAY then - 

                                  SCUDDER
                    I ve heard whispers of a plot to 
                      assassinate a high ranking 
                    European royal figure.

                                  HANNAY
                          (enjoying this if not 
                            believing)
                    Royalty? Really? Who?

                                  SCUDDER
                    Suffice it to say, for those who 
                    wish to see war, this man s death 
                    could light the tinder. 

      SCUDDER brings out his notebook from his pocket. He looks 
    at it, then slides it along the table. 

                                    SCUDDER(cont d)
                    It s very possible I will not 
                    survive once I leave here. If you 
                    love your country, take this to 
                    Captain Kell at the Secret 
                    Service Bureau. Trust no one 
                    else. No one.        The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.7.


      HANNAY stops eating his breakfast. 

                                  HANNAY
                    You ve picked the wrong man, 
                    Scudder, I m shipping back out to 
                    Africa as soon as I can.

                                  SCUDDER
                          (referring to the 
                            notebook)
                    Drop it off on your way.

                                  HANNAY
                    How do you know you can trust me?

                                  SCUDDER
                    I don t. But right now, you re 
                    all I have. 

    The two men look at each other then HANNAY picks up the 
      notebook. Puts it in his pocket. The sound of knocking on 
    the front door. HANNAY stands up. 

                                    SCUDDER(cont d)
                    Leave it.

                                  HANNAY
                    I don t imagine German spies 
                    knock.

      HANNAY leaves the kitchen. SCUDDER pulls his gun from his 
      pocket. 


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. DAY 21414

      HANNAY comes into the living room. He looks to where his 
    gun sits on the table - but thinks don t be silly.He heads 
      into the hall without it.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. HALL. DAY. DAY 21515

      HANNAY comes into the hall. He looks through the spy hole 
    in the front door. A milkman stands there. (ENGEL). HANNAY 
      smiles at his own stupidity. He opens the door.

                                  ENGEL
                          (received English 
                            accent)
                    I have a note for a gentleman 
                    called Scudder.

      HANNAY is confused, but he takes it. He opens the note, 
      it s a blank piece of paper. Realisingit s a trick, he 
      tries to slam the door in ENGEL s face. ENGEL pushes HANNAY 
      back into the flat.          The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.8.


      Suddenly the sound of a gunshot. HANNAY turns, heads at 
      speed to the living room followed by ENGEL.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. DAY 21616

      HANNAY comes into the living room and stops. SCUDDER stands 
    in the room facing him.  Blood is spreading across the 
      front of his shirt. ACKERMAN stands behind SCUDDER holding 
      a gun in his hand. HANNAY looks quickly to the sideboard. 
    His gun has gone. SCUDDER collapses forward and falls into 
      HANNAY s arms, a bullet wound through his back. ACKERMAN 
      points the gun at HANNAY. 

                                  ACKERMAN
                          (clipped received 
                            English)
                    Where is the notebook?

      With a huge effort HANNAY throws SCUDDER off himself and 
      back towards ACKERMAN. ACKERMAN is knocked back by the 
      weight of the body. The gun in his hand goes off. ENGEL 
      ducks to avoid the shot. HANNAY turns and side stepping 
      ENGEL makes a dash for the door.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. HALL. DAY. DAY 21717

      HANNAY at speed to his front door. ENGEL comes out behind 
      him. He raises his gun. But HANNAY is through the door.


      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING. LANDING. DAY. DAY 21818

      HANNAY pulls the door closed fast. HANNAY turns to run down 
    the stairs. The door to HANNAY s flat opens. ENGEL starts 
    to come out of the door. Meanwhile a woman comes out of the 
      door to another flat. She takes one look at HANNAY and 
      screams. ENGEL immediately retreats back into HANNAY s flat 
      leaving the door open. The woman then goes back inside her 
      flat slamming the door shut. The sound of the lock turning 
    on the other side of the woman s door. 

      HANNAY looks down. He has a fine splattering of SCUDDER s 
      blood on his white evening shirt. HANNAY runs down the 
      stairs.

    At the same time the police CONSTABLE (SCUDDER had run 
      past) rounds the bend of the stairs and is running up 
      towards him. The CONSTABLE stops as he sees HANNAY in his 
      bloodied shirt coming towards him.

                    Did I hear gunshot?        The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.9.


                                  HANNAY
                          (relieved to see him)
                    Follow me. A man has been 
                    murdered.

      HANNAY turns and runs back up the stairs. The CONSTABLE 
      follows. The door of HANNAY s flat is still open. The 
      CONSTABLE is about to go through it.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Careful, the killers may still be 
                    inside.

    The CONSTABLE stops. Then HANNAY enters cautiously followed 
    by the CONSTABLE.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN. DAY. DAY 21919

      HANNAY enters the living room cautiously, followed by the  
      CONSTABLE. SCUDDER lies on the floor. 

      HANNAY goes to the door to the kitchen, he pushes the door 
      open, waits a moment then peers in warily. It s empty. The 
      fire escape door is open. The CONSTABLE goes over and 
      stares down at SCUDDER. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Theyleft by the fire escape. If *
                    we hurry, we could still....

    The CONSTABLE spots HANNAY s gun on the floor.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    Is this the murder weapon?

                                  HANNAY
                    Yes. I d put it on the table. 
                    Then I went to open the door. I 
                    thought it was the milkman. It 
                    wasn t.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    Who was it?

                                  HANNAY
                    A German spy dressed as a 
                    milkman.

    The CONSTABLE looks at HANNAY. He pulls out his notebook 
    and pencil. Flicks it open to a page.

                                  HANNAY
                    No, his accomplice did. 

                                  CONSTABLE
                    Was hedressed as a milkman?

                                  HANNAY
                    No. Look I know this sounds 
                      incredible. Iwas sceptical when 
                    Scudder first told me... 

                                  CONSTABLE
                    Scudder is the name of the 
                    deceased gentleman?

                                  HANNAY
                    Yes. I d never met him before 
                    this morning but....

                                  CONSTABLE
                    If you d never met him before, 
                    may I ask how he landed up dead 
                    on your living room floor?

                                  HANNAY
                    He barged through my door.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    He broke in?

                                  HANNAY
                    Not exactly. 

                                  CONSTABLE
                    What did you do when he barged 
                    through the door?

                                  HANNAY
                    I drew my gun...naturally.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    And you shot him?

                                  HANNAY
                          (outraged)
                    No. We had breakfast. 

                                  CONSTABLE
                    And then you shot him?

                                  HANNAY
                    I didn t shoot him. A German spy 
                    shot him.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    May I have your name, sir?      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.11.


    He puts his notebook away. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Hannay, Richard Hannay.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    Richard Hannay, I m arresting you 
                    for murder.

    He pulls out his truncheon.

                                  HANNAY
                    What? This is insane.

                                  CONSTABLE
                    I m glad we agree on something. 

    The CONSTABLE pulls out a pair of iron handcuffs from his 
      pocket.

                                    CONSTABLE(cont d)
                    Hands out in front of you, 
                    Hannay.

      A beat. Then HANNAY turns and runs towards the kitchen.

                                    CONSTABLE(cont d)
                    Stay where you are.

    The CONSTABLE chases after HANNAY. The kitchen door is 
      slammed in his face.


      INT. HANNAY S FLAT. KITCHEN. DAY. DAY 22020

    The kitchen door opens. CONSTABLE comes through, sees the 
      kitchen is empty, heads to the open fire escape door.


      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. FIRE ESCAPE. DAY. DAY 22121

    The CONSTABLE comes out on to the fire-escape. Looks 
      around, no sign of HANNAY. The CONSTABLE looks to the side 
    of the building and an alley which runs to the front of the 
      building. The CONSTABLE runs down the fire escape and 
      disappears into the alley.

      A moment. Then  - under the fire escape to find HANNAY 
      hanging by his hands from the metal rung of a step. It s 
      quite a feat. The strain on his face. The sound of 
      something being beaten. HANNAY turns his head and his face 
      changes briefly to horror. Then he composes it.

      Looking at him through an open window opposite him is a 
      maid with a beater in her hand. A rug lies over the 
      windowsill of the open window. The maid is obviously very 
      frightened. HANNAY smiles at her with devastating charm.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.12.


                                  HANNAY
                    I m so sorry, did I startle you? 

    The maid says nothing but travels down his face to look at 
    the blood stains on his shirt.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (charming)
                    I ve been in a bit of a dust-up, 
                    I m afraid.
                          (with as much emotion as 
                          he can muster)
                    An affair of the heart. Her 
                    brother is determined to separate 
                    us. 

    He looks to the maid. She still just stares at him. HANNAY 
    is beginning to sweat. His hands are slipping on the iron. 
    He looks down to the courtyard below. It s quite a fall.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (trying to win her over)
                    Still, who can blame him? I have 
                    nothing to offer but love. My 
                    rival comes with 10, 000 acres 
                    and a herd of prize pigs.

    The maid smiles.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (seeming totally 
                            sincere)
                    How comforting to see such an 
                    enchanting smile. Thank you.

    The maid smiles, blushing. HANNAY still hanging there.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    I don t suppose.. ? No...I 
                    couldn t possibly impose upon 
                    your good nature.

    The maid looks like she d love to be imposed upon.


      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. ROAD. DAY. DAY 22222

    The maid comes out of the main entrance. She looks around. 
      Sees the CONSTABLE scanning the road talking to another 
      constable. The maid goes up to them. She begins talking to 
      them. She points in the opposite direction to the apartment 
      building. As she does HANNAY looks out of the entrance. He 
      sees the CONSTABLE looking in the opposite direction. 
      HANNAY comes out of the building at speed. And heads off.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.13.


      EXT. STREET. DAY. DAY 22323

      HANNAY walking down the street, his jacket pulled around 
      him. His head down. He looks across the street, 2 different 
      policemen in uniform are walking down the other side. He 
      turns away quickly, frightened.


      EXT. COLONIAL GENTLEMEN S CLUB. DAY. DAY 22424

      A brass-plate saying - THE COLONIAL CLUB. A doorman stands 
      outside. HANNAY walks head down to towards the club as -  

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    Suddenly I was facing the 
                    hangman s noose. I had no pals in 
                    town to testify on my behalf and 
                    I could think of only one person 
                    who might save me. Scudder s 
                    Captain Kell at the Secret 
                    Service Bureau.

      HANNAY checks he isn t being followed then acknowledging 
    the doorman, goes in.


      INT. COLONIAL GENTLEMEN S CLUB. FOYER. DAY 22525

      HANNAY comes through the double doors. He looks across to 
    the concierge s desk. The concierge is busy folding 
      newspapers. HANNAY heads towards the silent telephone 
      cabinet when -

                                  WAITER (O.S.)
                    MrHannay?

      HANNAY whips round holding his jacket tightly across 
      himself, the same WAITER from the previous evening is 
      standing in the foyer looking at him. He holds a tray with 
      a coffee pot on it. He takes in the evening suit, HANNAY 
      holding his jacket tight. The WAITER puzzled but ever 
      professional. 

                                    WAITER(cont d)
                    May I get you something, sir? 
                    Coffee perhaps?

                                  HANNAY 
                          (with more confidence 
                          than he feels)
                    No, thank you.

      HANNAY ducks into the silent phone cabinet.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.14.


      INT. SILENT TELEPHONE CABINET. DAY. DAY 22626

      HANNAY picks up the ear piece. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    How did one obtain the telephone 
                    number of the Secret Service 
                    Bureau?

      HANNAY turns the handle of the phone several times.

                    I d like to speak to Captain 
                    Kell.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                    What is it concerning?

                                  HANNAY (ON PHONE)
                    A matter of life and death. My 
                    death. I have to speak to him 
                    immediately.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                    I m afraid he isn t here.

                                  HANNAY
                    When will he be back?

                                  RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                    Maybe someone else could be of

                                  HANNAY (ON PHONE)
                    No. I have to talk to Captain 
                    Kell personally. Just tell me 
                    when I can ....

                                  RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)

                                  HANNAY (ON PHONE)
                    Richard.....

      HANNAY stops. He puts the mouth piece down quickly into the 
      receiver.        The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.15.


      A moment as he thinks what to do. Then he pulls out 
      SCUDDER s notebook from his inside jacket pocket. 

      HANNAY opens it. His puzzled face as he looks at  - several 
      pages of Roman numerals obviously representing words. Then 
      a page with the figure 2/7. Then three more Roman numerals. 
      Then - a page with blank paper. 

    In the middle pages of the notebook, loose, a map. HANNAY 
      opens the map. It s of Scotland. With pen lines ringing - 
    the environs of village of Kirknairnnear Loch Long.

      HANNAY looks up. Through the glass of the cabinet, he sees 
      staring at him from the concierge s desk - the concierge 
    and the waiter. They re obviously discussing him. He pulls 
    his jacket tight again. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    I had to get out of London 
                    quickly. Perhaps the only way to 
                    prove my innocence was to prove 
                    Scudder right. Track down the 
                    German spy ring he claimed was 
                    operating out of Scotland. I d 
                    try to contact Kell again from 
                    there.

      A man comes in and goes up to the concierge s desk, 
      distracting the concierge and the waiter. HANNAY is just 
      about to leave the booth when he sees a pencil on a string 
    for customers  convenience. He picks it up, rips the string 
      from the wall, pockets the pencil. He opens the door of the 
      phone box. In the distance are heard police whistles and 
      bells. 

      Then another man comes into the club, he s HANNAY s build. 
    He carries a coat and a homberg.The doorman follows behind 
      carrying his case. The CONCIERGEacknowledges the man.*

                    Arnold will inform the porter, 
                    you re here.

    As HANNAY feigns feeling in his pocket as though he s left 
      something. Then slips back in to the booth. 

    In the booth, HANNAY watches as the WAITER heads off and *
      doorman goes to find the porter. The man puts his coat, hat *
    and gloves on his case as he waits. The telephone rings on 
    the concierge s desk. The CONCIERGE picks it up.*

    In the booth HANNAY is on the phone.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.16.

                    The Colonial Club?

                                  HANNAY (ON PHONE)
                    I need to speak to Sir Gerald 
                    urgently, has he arrived yet? 

                                  CONCIERGE (V.O.)
                    Just a minute, sir.

      Through the glass, HANNAY sees the CONCIERGE call over to 
    the man. The man moves forward towards the phone. And 
      HANNAY is out of the phone booth. Everyone s attention is 
      towards the concierge s desk. Without being observed, 
      HANNAY picks up the coat, hat and case. And leaves at 
      speed. 


      INT. ST PANCRAS STATION. TICKET OFFICE. DAY. DAY 22727

      A queue to buy tickets. HANNAY joins it. He wears a good 
      suit, brogues, Sir Gerald s coat and homberg.

      A policeman walks past. HANNAY quickly lowers his hat. A 
      ticket counter becomes free, HANNAY moves forward and faces 
      a harassed ticket salesman.

                                  HANNAY
                    First class single to Inverness 
                    please.

                                  TICKET SALESMAN*
                    3 guineas, sir.*

      HANNAY pulls out a  10 pound note.The TICKET SALESMAN *
      looks him full in the face.

                                  TICKET SALESMAN(cont d)
                    I can t change that.

                                  HANNAY
                    It s the smallest I have.

                                  TICKET SALESMAN
                    I still can t change it.

                                  HANNAY
                    Maybe one of your colleagues can.

      TICKET SALESMAN looks dubious.

                                  TICKET SALESMAN
                    And maybe they can t, sir.

    Out of the corner of his eye, HANNAY sees the policeman 
      stop and look back. This is very dangerous.    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.16A.


                                  HANNAY
                          (trying not to lose his 
                            temper)
                    Well, we won t know until you ask 
                    them.

    The TICKET SALESMAN humphsthen with ill grace picks up the 
       10pound note. He then closes the shutter of his window *
      with a bang. Behind HANNAY annoyed muttering in the ranks. 
      HANNAY stands there keeping his head down.

    At a distance an unseen POVis observing him.

                                                                      TIME JUMP

    The shutter of the ticket office opens with a loud clutter. 
    The TICKET SALESMAN thrusts change and a ticket across the 
      counter to HANNAY. As - 

                                  STATION ATTENDANT (V.O.)

                    to Inverness. The gates are now 
                    closing.

      HANNAY turns and leaves at speed.

    The train is pulling out. HANNAY runs along the platform, 
      opens the train door and jumps onto the moving train.


      INT. TRAIN. DAY. DAY 22929

    The train is moving. HANNAY opens the sliding door into a 
      first class compartment. He sits down, catching his breath. 
    The door of the compartment opens. In comes a VICAR. He is 
      wearing a large black hat and round thick pebble glasses. 
    On his right hand little finger is a signet ring. HANNAY 
      smiles, the VICAR smiles back. In the corridor a bunch of 
      sailors in uniform head to the buffet car.

      HANNAY pulls SCUDDER s notebook out of his pocket. He 
      starts to study it.


      EXT. FOOTAGE OF MOVING STEAM TRAIN.3030


      INT/EXT. TRAIN/STATION PLATFORM. DAY. DAY 23131

      HANNAY is still staring puzzling at the Roman numerals in 
      Scudder s notebook in his hand. He rubs his eyes and looks 
    out through the window. The sign NEWCASTLE. HANNAY looks 
      over to the VICAR who is reading his Bible.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.18.


      HANNAY replaces the notebook in his inside pocket.  A 
      newspaper vendor stands on the platform. His news-board 
      reads - ARCHDUKE FERDINAND ASSASSINATED. BOSNIANS ARRESTED. 

      HANNAY s face as he remembers SCUDDER s warning. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    The assassination of a royal 
                    figure, just as Scudder had 
                    predicted. 

      HANNAY takes some money out of his pocket. He opens the 
      window. The news vendor sees this. Comes forward. HANNAY 
      gives him the money and the vendor hands him a paper.

      HANNAY closes the window then reads the headline - ARCHDUKE 
      FRANZ FERDINAND, HEIR TO AUSTRO-HUNGARIANTHRONE, MURDERED 
      YESTERDAY.

    He opens the newspaper. Then horror on his face as he reads  
    on the second page.Murder Portland Place London. Killer on 
    the run.AND next to it an artist s impression of HANNAY.

                                  VICAR (O.S.)
                    May I possibly take a quick look 
                    at the cricket scores?

      HANNAY quickly closes the paper and looks up. The VICAR is 
      smiling at him. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (sharp)
                    No.

                                  VICAR
                          (taken aback)
                    I beg your pardon?

                                  HANNAY
                          (having to recover fast, 
                          with great charm)
                    I thought I might read them 
                    aloud. I m quite a cricket fan 
                    myself.

    The VICAR smiles in gratitude. HANNAY opens the back of the 
      paper to the sports pages. List after list of all the 
      cricket tables. This is a long job. 


      INT. ST PANCRAS STATION. DAY. DAY 23232      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.19.


    Two policemen, including the CONSTABLE, are talking to the

                                  TICKET SALESMAN
                    He s not a gentleman I d forget 
                    in a hurry. Sold him a first

                    Inverness.


      INT. TRAIN. DAY. DAY 23333

      Through the train window - the sign CRAIG CALDER. A small

      HANNAY looks up. The VICAR is asleep. Thank the Lord for 
      that. He puts the paper down and looks out of the window.  
    AND sees police boarding the train. Fear on HANNAY s face. 

                                  TRAIN POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                    This train is going nowhere until 
                    we ve searched every compartment.

      HANNAY looks towards the VICAR, he doesn t stir. HANNAY 
      gets up and leaves the compartment.

      Police working their way down the train showing an artist s 
      impression of HANNAY -have you seen this man?

      They get to the compartment where the VICAR sits sleeping. 
    To disturb or not disturb. A moment then they chose the 
      latter. They move off. 


      INT. TRAIN. THIRD CLASS. CORRIDOR/COMPARTMENT. DAY. DAY 23636

      HANNAY looks behind him. Police coming down the corridor. 
    In front of him police moving forward. The compartment door 
    to his left, opens. Several sailors come piling out. HANNAY 
      looks into the compartment. Sitting on a seat is a man,  
      with a large coat and fedora.     The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.19A.


      Onthe seat next to him is a large carpet bag. The man *
      glances at HANNAY then away. HANNAY goes into the 
      compartment quickly and sits down opposite him.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.20.


                                  DUMMY (O.S.)
                    Excuse me for saying so but you 
                    look awfully familiar.

      HANNAY looks up. The carpet bag is open. Sitting on the 
      knee of the man opposite is a VENTRILOQUIST s dummy in a 
      suit. HANNAY looks at the man. He is looking out of the 
      window, totally unconcerned. HANNAY looks back to the 
      DUMMY. The DUMMY is looking at him.

                                    DUMMY(cont d)
                    Have we met?

                          (wary)
                    No.

      HANNAY looks to the VENTRILOQUIST. He is looking out of the 
      window, as though uninvolved.

                                  DUMMY
                    Are you sure?

                                  HANNAY

                    My name s Wesley. The drunken 
                    reprobate sitting with me is 
                    called Arthur.

      HANNAY looks to the VENTRILOQUIST. Nothing on his face.

                                  HANNAY
                    Should you talk about your 
                    companion like that?

      HANNAY glancesnervously towards the train corridor.

                                  DUMMY
                    He won t even notice. He s as 
                    thick as two short planks. 

    The DUMMY leans towards HANNAY.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.21.

                            (conspiratorially)
                    In fact I m thinking of leaving 
                    him and going solo.

      HANNAY looking at the VENTRILOQUIST s face. It is not 
      moving.

                                    DUMMY(cont d)
                    I was the talk of London once.  
                    Now am I reduced to travelling 
                    third class. Who knows who one s 
                    mixing with? 

    The DUMMY picks up a newspaper from beside the 
      VENTRILOQUIST. Glimpse of headline - Killer on the run.

                                    DUMMY(cont d)
                          (pointedly with a little 
                          flick of the newspaper)
                    Maybe even a murderer.

      HANNAY, freezing, realizing he s been recognised.He looks 
    to the VENTRILOQUIST s face. No expression. He looks back 
    to the DUMMY. HANNAY thinks quickly - how to resolve this. 
      Then HANNAY leans forward and talks quietly to the DUMMY.

                                  HANNAY
                    Maybe, if you re serious about a 
                    solo career, I could be of 
                    financial assistance.  

      HANNAY takes out his wallet and extracts a  5note. He 
      holds it in front of the DUMMY.

    The VENTRILOQUIST sitting there wearing HANNAY s hat. Next 
    to him sits HANNAY. He wears the VENTRILOQUIST's coat and 
      fedora, the hat pulled well down. The DUMMY sits on his 
      lap. (HANNAY s arm up it.) The TRAIN POLICEMAN comes into

    The TRAIN POLICEMAN looks to HANNAY, trying to see his face 
      beneath the Fedora.

                          (jumping in)

                    The gentleman s quite correct,

                    He headed out towards the front 
                    of the train.

      A moment then - the TRAIN POLICEMANopens the compartment

    The TRAIN POLICEMANheads down the corridor. More police 
    are seen moving at speed past the compartment down the 
      train. HANNAY looks to the VENTRILOQUIST, they exchange a 
      surreptitious look.

      HANNAY slips out of the compartment onto the platform and *
      heads out of the station.

      Evening. In the distance the sound of a train and the faint 
      puff of smoke in the valley. The map - the village 
        Kirknairnringed. HANNAY stands on open moorland.     The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.22A.


      He s holding the map. He looks over. In the distance is a

      HANNAY climbing off the ladder, on to the hay loft. There s 
      a window. He looks out to the sunset. HANNAY takes a deep 
      breath enjoying the air. He pulls out SCUDDER s notebook 
    and a lighter. He lights the lighter and starts to study 
    the notebook.


      INT. BARN. DAY. DAY 34444

      HANNAY is sleeping on a hay bale, covered by his coat, the 
      notebook across his chest. He starts to wake. Opens his 
      eyes, yawns and looks out of the window. The sound of dogs 
      barking in the distance. HANNAY s face changes to one of 
      horror. Spread out across the horizon of the moorland is a 
      long line of policemen, accompanying some of them, barking 
      dogs.


      EXT. BARN. DAY. DAY 34545

      HANNAY comes out of the barn without his hat and coat. He 
      runs along the side of a stone wall to give him cover. Then 
      breaks away and heads off in the opposite direction to the 
      police. Suddenly, behind him, he hears the dogs  barking 
      become fiercer. Cries from the police as they spot him. The 
      sound of whistles being blown.

      HANNAY looks behind him, still in the distance but heading 
    his way, the police. HANNAY sets off at a lick.


      EXT. OPEN MOORLAND. DAY. DAY 34646

    The police pursuing HANNAY seen through the lens of a pair 
    of binoculars. ACKERMAN lowers them. He and ENGEL are 
      observing the chase from a ridge above the open moorland.


      EXT. OPEN MOORLAND. DAY. DAY 34747

      HANNAY running. He can hear the barking of the dogs getting 
      louder. He looks behind him, the police are still on his 
      tail. He thinks, stops, then turns round and does a special 
      long 2 note whistle. Nothing happens. He whistles again. 
    And - the police dogs all sit down. The police men try to 
      rouse them. Nothing, the dogs remain seated. HANNAY takes 
    the opportunity to turn and run for his life. 

      HANNAY spots a small brow of a hill. HANNAY ducks down then 
      runs down the other side of the hill.

    On the moor the policemen have managed to get the dogs up 
    and moving.     The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.23A.


      HANNAY slides down the side of the vale. He hears the sound *
    of the dogs resuming barking. In the vale at the bottom is 
      a stream. HANNAY swiftly takes his shoes and socks off.*      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.24.


      Ducking down, he walks into the stream in his bare feet. 
      Although he winces from the rocks, HANNAY moves at speed 
      upstream. The sound of the dogs getting more and more 
      distant.


      EXT. STREAM BANK. DAY. DAY 34848

      HANNAY walking up the stream. He stops, listens, no dogs. 
    He scans the vale top. No sign of police. HANNAY gets out 
    of the stream. 

    He sits down on the bank of the stream to recover.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    I couldn t spend the rest of my 
                    days being hunted for a murder I 
                    didn t commit. I needed evidence. 
                    What was it Scudder had 
                    discovered that cost him his 
                    life?

      HANNAY pulls out the notebook from his jacket pocket and 
      opens it. A page of Roman numerals. HANNAY staring at it.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    I had to find the key word to the 
                    cipher. I d tried Scudder on the 
                    train. Marie Lloyd, even Titanic. 

      HANNAY thinking hard. Then suddenly - HANNAY writing in the 
      notebook.

      CLOSE UP of the words FRANZ FERDINAND. Underneath each 
      letter of FRANZ, HANNAY writes  - AEIOU.

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    I had it. The Fof Franz 
                      represented A, the R, E and so 
                    on.

      Then under the AEIOU- written as he speaks the Roman 
      numerals, VI, XV111, 1,X1V, XXV1as -

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    Fwas A, the sixth letter of the 
                    alphabet, so A was represented by 
                    the roman number for six V1, R
                    was E so represented by the Roman 
                    numeral XV111.If the word 
                    Ferdinand gave me my key 
                      consonants, then I had the 
                    cipher.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.25.


    CUT TO HANNAY as he looks at the notebook. He takes the 
      pencil he d stolen from the hotel out of his pocket. He 
      starts to de-cipher the code.

                                                                      TIME JUMP


      EXT. STREAM BANK. DAY. DAY 34949

      HANNAY finishes writing, he puts the pencil back into his 
      pocket. He is a very worried man. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    According to Scudder s notes, 
                    Archduke Franz Ferdinand s 
                      assassination was about to 
                    trigger a war of a magnitude 
                    never seen before. 

      HANNAY replaces the notebook in his inside jacket pocket. 
    He starts to put his shoes and socks back on -  

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)(cont d)
                    As soon as hostilities were 
                    declared the Germans planned to 
                    destroy the vastly superior 
                    British navy. Every ship and 
                    submarine would be sunk. Leaving 
                    the Germans free to invade this 
                    country.


      EXT. VALE/MOORLAND. DAY. DAY 25050

      HANNAY s worried face as he climbs up the bank of the vale. 
    The faint sound of a monoplane. 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    I was on the run, I didn t know 
                    who I could trust. How was I 
                    supposed to save Great Britain 
                    from invasion? All I wanted was 
                    to be back on the veldt in 
                    Africa.

      HANNAY comes out on to the open moorland. The sound of the 
      plane getting closer and closer. HANNAY turns back to see a 
      monoplane heading towards him.

      From the POVof the plane, HANNAY exposed on the open 
      moorland. No other human life.

      HANNAY seeing the plane get closer and closer. It is 
      heading low towards him. Horrified he realisesit s chasing 
      him. He starts to run. The plane chasing him, swooping low. 
      HANNAY s panicked face.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.26.


      Then all around he is being strafed by machine gun fire. 
      HANNAY weaving as he runs forward trying to avoid being 
      hit. 

      Ahead he sees a wall. Beyond it a road. HANNAY jumps over 
    the wall and into the road. 

      HANNAY sees a car heading towards him. He stands in the 
      middle of the road and waves his hands desperately to get 
    the car to stop. Suddenly he sees through the windscreen 
    the faces of the passengers. It s ACKERMAN and ENGEL. He 
      looks to see the plane bank away in the sky.

      Back to see the car nearly upon him. ENGEL leaning out of 
    the window, holding a gun. HANNAY turns, runs towards the 
      bank on one side of the road. HANNAY trips, and he s 
      rolling, rolling down the bank. He tries to stop himself 
    but fails. 

      Then HANNAY rolls out on to the continuation of the road 
      that curves down the hillside and now runs parallel with 
      itself below.

      HANNAY lying on the road. The glimpse of another car 
      heading towards him in the opposite direction (to ENGEL and 
      ACKERMAN). The terrible screech of car brakes. HANNAY curls 
      into a ball to minimize damage waiting for impact. 

      Nothing. A moment then he uncurls. Looks up in fear. HANNAY 
      sees, looking down at him, 2 people. VICTORIA, 20 s, 
      beautiful, hair pins in her hair. HARRY, 20 s, her brother 
    in driving goggles. 

                                  HARRY
                    Good lord, Are you alright? I am 
                    so sorry.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What are you apologisingfor? He 
                    rolled out in front of you.
                          (to HANNAY)
                    Are you the Liberal spokesman?

      HANNAY looking at her warily.

                                  HANNAY
                    I beg your pardon?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Are you Tommy Twisdon?

      HANNAY hears a car coming from the direction ACKERMAN and 
      ENGEL would be approaching. He gets up quickly. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (quickly)
                    Yes. Yes, I am.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.27.


    He heads towards their car. VICTORIA and HARRY no choice 
    but to follow.


      INT/EXT. HARRY S CAR/ROAD. DAY. DAY 35151

      HARRY is in the driver s seat, driving. VICTORIA in the 
      front passenger seat. HANNAY in the back. HARRY half 
      talking over his shoulder to HANNAY as he drives. (VICTORIA 
    has a ring on her right hand.)

                                  HARRY
                            (introducing them)
                    I m Harry Sinclair, this is my 
                    sister Victoria. Sisrang your 
                    hotel, they said you left an hour 
                    ago. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    What happened to your car? Did 
                    you break down?

                                  HANNAY
                    Yes.

                                  HARRY
                    Good job we came to find you. 

      Coming down at speed, the other way on the road, is 
      ACKERMAN and ENGEL S car. 

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                    That was some header you took.

    As the two cars pass, HANNAY ducks down pretending to do 
    his shoelace.  HARRY drives on. HANNAY looks back to see 
      ACKERMAN s car carrying on away down the road.

                                  VICTORIA
                    HHsaid you come highly 
                    recommended. 

                                  HANNAY

                    Your friend.

                                  HANNAY
                    He was flattering me.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.28.

                    He better not have been. I love 
                    my brother Harry dearly, but 
                    he ll never win a seat in 
                    Parliament on his own.

      HANNAY s face. What is this? *


      INT/EXT. HARRY S CAR/DUNGARVENTOWN HALL. DAY. DAY 35252

    An agitated middle aged man, Sir GEORGE SINCLAIR, paces up 
    and down on the front steps of the town hall, smoking a 
      cigarette. He sees the car with HANNAY, HARRY and VICTORIA 
      pull up. He stands on the cigarette and runs down the steps 
    to the car as they disembark.

                                  GEORGE
                      Where veyou been?

      VICTORIA kisses GEORGE on the cheek, then introduces him.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (to HANNAY)

                    Secretary of the National 
                    Committee of Defence....

                          (to GEORGE)
                    Tommy Twisdon.

      GEORGE takes HANNAY s hand. Shakes it. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Pleased to meet you, MrTwisdon.
                    You ve got a..twig..in your..

      VICTORIA removes a twig from HANNAY s hair.

                                  VICTORIA
                      MrTwisdontook a bit of a 
                    tumble.

                                  HANNAY
                    Perhaps if you could point me to 
                    a telephone. There s someone I 
                    have to contact in London.

      From inside the hall the sound of - WHY ARE WE WAITING? And 
      a slow hand clap.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.29.


                                  GEORGE
                    Sorry, no time for that. You 
                    better get in there fast before 
                    there s a mutiny.

      GEORGE and HARRY set off up the stairs. HANNAY hesitates. 
      VICTORIA turns and looks at him. He has no choice but to 
      join them.


      INT. TOWN HALL. STAGE. DAY. DAY 35353

      HANNAY is sitting on a stage next to HARRY. The audience, 
    is mainly made up of men, slightly restive. GEORGE moves 
      towards the lectern at the front of the stage. Much 
      shushing in the audience. VICTORIA is taking a seat in the 
      packed hall. A man of 51, the PROFESSOR wearing a country 
      English suit moves up a seat to allow her to sit down.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Thank you, Professor Fisher.

                                  GEORGE
                    Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me 
                    great pleasure to welcome your 
                      prospective Parliamentary 
                    candidate in the Dungarvenby-
                    election, Harry Sinclair. 

      Paltry applause except for VICTORIA and the PROFESSOR who 
      clap appreciatively. HARRY goes to the lectern. He 
      scrabbles in his pocket, pulls out some notes on crumpled 
      paper. Tries to make them sit on the tray for notes. 

                                  HARRY
                          (nervous, quiet)
                    Gentlemen, er, ladies, it, erm, I 
                    am delighted to.....

      From the hall - speak up laddie.

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                          (boring delivery)
                    What, right, sorry. I am 
                    delighted to stand before you 
                    this afternoon....

                                                                      TIME JUMP

      Same scene, except later. HARRY is still speaking. Some 
      people on the stage and in the hall are asleep. Smoke from 
      some of the audience as they pull on pipes and smoke 
      cigarettes. HANNAY is listening but with his eyes half 
      closed.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.30.


                                    HARRY(cont d)
                    ...in fact I think the arms race 
                    with the Germans has been a total 
                    waste of revenue. Our good 
                    friends the Germans are not the 
                    enemy.

      HANNAY freezes in his chair, coming into the hall at the 
      rear are ACKERMAN and ENGEL. He watches as they stand 
      against the back wall looking over to him on the stage. As -

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                    But for the Tories we would be 
                    working side by side with the 
                    Germans in peace. 

      HARRY has got to the end of one of his sheets of paper. He 
      stops. He looks on the other side. Nothing. He puts his 
      hand in his pocket looking for another sheet of notes. 
      GEORGE seizes the opportunity. He puts out his cigarette in 
    an ashtray and strides towards the lectern.

                                  GEORGE
                          (to the audience)
                    Thank you, Harry, that was very 
                      illuminating. Your prospective 
                    Liberal candidate, MrHarry 
                    Sinclair.

      GEORGE claps, VICTORIA joins in enthusiastically from the 
      hall. HANNAY joins in, as does the PROFESSOR, followed by a 
      smattering across the hall as -

                                  HARRY
                          (whispering to GEORGE)
                    I hadn t finished.

                                  GEORGE
                    Best leave them wanting more, 
                    son.

    As HARRY goes back to his seat.

                                  GEORGE (cont d)
                    And now the moment you ve all 
                    been waiting for, our honourable  
                    guest speaker of whom Prime 
                    Minister Asquithsaid - if you 
                    want the job done get Twisdon, Mr
                    Tommy Twisdon.

      A huge round of applause. HANNAY looks up. Sees GEORGE 
      looking at him. OH GOD HE S GOT TO SPEAK. A moment, no way 
      out. HANNAY goes to the lectern. Looks out. He sees 
      VICTORIA looking at him. He sees ACKERMAN and ENGEL 
      standing at the back of the hall. ACKERMAN puts his hand in 
    his pocket as though checking his gun is there.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.31.


      HANNAY grasps the sides of the podium. Silence. HANNAY 
      thinking what to say. The odd embarrassed cough from the 
      audience. Then - 

                                  HANNAY
                    D youknow what s wrong with this 
                    great nation? Smugness and 
                    complacency. 

      A sharp intake of breath from the audience. Some boos.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    You think because Britain has the 
                    largest overseas Empire, because 
                    she does indeed rule the waves, 
                    you re impregnable? 

      Through the audience and sitting several rows nearer the 
      stage but hunkered down in his seat, dressed in ordinary 
      suit with a cap pulled down, signet ring on right little 
      finger - the VICAR from the train.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    I do not believe you should be so 
                    sanguine in your friendship with 
                    Germany. 

      HANNAY looks over to ACKERMAN and ENGEL.

                                  HANNAY (cont d)
                    The assassination of the Archduke 
                    Franz Ferdinand proves that 
                    tensions between countries and 
                    alliances remain dangerously 
                    high. 

      A heckler from the audience - That s Europe, what s that 
    got to do with us?

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    You wouldn t be asking that, if 
                    foreign boots were marching down 
                    your high street. 

    The PROFESSOR speaks out from the auditorium.

                                  PROFESSOR
                    Surely, sir, that s warmongering.

                                  HANNAY
                    No, sir, it s a warning.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (shouting from the hall)
                    Where do you stand on women, Mr

                                  HANNAY
                    What?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Where do you stand on women?

                                  HANNAY
                    As a rule I try not to stand on 
                    women.

      Huge laughter.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (annoyed)
                    Don t you agree that one way to  
                    defeat the smugness and 
                      complacency you talk of would be 
                    to give women the vote?

      Groans from the mainly male audience. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    I think you ladies should be 
                    grateful you don t have to get 
                    your petticoats dirty fighting 
                    for your country, Miss Sinclair. 

      Huge cheers from the men. Calls of - you tell the lassie. 
      VICTORIA s annoyed face. HANNAY looks out to the back of 
    the hall and sees - police pouring into the hall. They are 
      looking at him and heading towards the stage.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (to the audience)
                    So, gentlemen, I urge you,
                    vote Harry Sinclair, your liberal 
                    candidate. 

      A round of applause as - the police push past people 
      towards the stage. Confusion in the hall as - HANNAY turns 
    and heads off the stage and into the wings.

                                  GEORGE (V.O.)
                    Yes, well, I am sure you d all 
                    agree with me that Mr

      INT/EXT. TOWN HALL/REAR YARD. CORRIDOR. DAY. DAY 35454

      HANNAY is running down the corridor. He gets to a rear 
      door, opens it. Looks out. In the rear yard, two policemen 
      heading towards him.

      HANNAY ducks back into the corridor. He closes the door and 
      bolts it. He turns AND runs straight into VICTORIA -       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.33.


                                  VICTORIA
                          (furious)
                    How dare you talk to me like 
                    that, MrTwisdon?Women sacrifice 
                    themselves every day for this 
                    country.

      Hammering on the other side of the locked door - let us in. 
      Someone let us in.

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    Believe me, this is really not 
                    the ....

      Suddenly POLICEMAN 1 appears in the corridor behind them. 
    He raises his truncheon menacingly.

                                  POLICEMAN 1
                    Stay where you are, sir. Stand 
                    aside please, Miss. 

                                  VICTORIA
                          (annoyed)
                    I am completely within my rights 
                    to talk to this man.

                                  POLICEMAN 1
                          (threatening)
                    I said, stand aside, miss.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (indignant)
                    I m a suffragette not a criminal.

    The POLICEMAN moves forward. He makes the mistake of taking 
      VICTORIA s arm. 

                                  POLICEMAN 1
                          (hard)
                    I m warning you...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Unhand me, you bully.

      VICTORIA kicks him viciously in the shins, POLICEMAN 1 
      screams. HANNAY takes this opportunity to run towards the 
      stage area. VICTORIA sees him go. VICTORIA yells at HANNAY -  

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    Wait for me.

    She turns and heads after him..       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.34.


      INT. TOWN HALL. CORRIDOR. DAY. DAY 35555

      HANNAY comes out into another corridor. There is an exit 
      door which is bolted. HANNAY pulls back the bolt. He opens 
    the door and looks out.


      EXT. TOWN HALL. REAR EXIT/ALLEY/SIDE STREET. DAY. DAY 35656

      HANNAY looks out, left and right into a small alleyway. All 
      clear. He comes out. He starts to move off at speed. 
      VICTORIA comes out of the door, looks both ways. Sees 
      HANNAY, pursues him at speed. HANNAY looks back, sees her.

                                  HANNAY
                    Go back.

      A moment then police come out of the door.  Spot VICTORIA 
    and HANNAY, the police blow their whistles. Much - stopand 
      after them. The police give chase. HANNAY and VICTORIA 
      round the end of the alley. VICTORIA spots a side street. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Down here.

    She runs down a side street. HANNAY hesitates then follows. 
      They turn another corner. And they face a high stone wall. 
      Dead end. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (angry)
                    Damn. Now look what you ve done.*

                                  VICTORIA*
                    This isn t my...(fault).*

                          (cutting her off)*
                    So much for emancipation. Find 
                    yourself another hobby.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I didn t become a suffragette 
                    because I m bad at needle point. 

      VICTORIA is pulling up her skirt.

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    All that twaddle about freedom. 
                    How can we be living in a free 
                    society when so many people are 
                    viewed as second class citizens?

                                  HANNAY

    She tucks her skirt (pelt effect) into her belt to create a 
      shorter skirt, revealing the edges of a pair of bloomers.  
      HANNAY can t help looking at VICTORIA s legs, but affects 
      annoyance. The sound of whistles getting closer. She takes 
      a running leap at the wall. Gets her hands on the top then 
      begins to heave herself over. HANNAY has no choice - he 
      takes a running leap. Gets his hand on the top. Heaves 
      himself over. And - 


      INT. SIDE STREET 2. DAY. DAY 35757

      HANNAY lets himself down on the other side of the wall. He 
    and VICTORIA are collecting themselves. VICTORIA lowering 
    her skirt, HANNAY turning away - when behind the wall they 
      hear running footsteps. Then police voices -  they must 
      have gone over this wall, Sergeant.    She s a lady,how 
    did she get over there ye divet, fly? Start knocking on 
      doors. Looks like we lost them. 

      HANNAY and VICTORIA listen as the policemen s footsteps 
      retreat. HANNAY holds out his hand.

                                  HANNAY
                          (icily polite)
                    Nice knowing you, Miss Sinclair. 
                    I ll go it alone from here.

                          (put out)
                    Just a minute. I assaulted an 
                    officer of the law. 

                                  HANNAY
                    The constabulary came after me, 
                    not you. My name s...Hannay.

                                  VICTORIA
                    You said it was Twisdon.

                                  HANNAY
                    No, I didn t. You did. My name is 
                    Hannay and I m wanted for murder.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Why didn t you say so?

                                  HANNAY
                    You never gave me a chance. Now 
                    do you understand. The police 
                    aren t interested in you. Just... 
                    go and say you re sorry.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Say I m sorry? I kicked a

                    arrest a murderer.

                                  HANNAY
                    That s absurd.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I agree. I hardly know you. God, 
                    are you going to kill me too?

                                  HANNAY
                    Of course I m not, I m 
                      innocent...

                    I warn you, you threaten me in

                                  HANNAY
                    Jove, give me patience. 

    He sets off. VICTORIA follows.


      EXT. ALLEY/BACK STREET. DAY. DAY 35858

      HANNAY looks out of the alley into the street. A moment 
      later VICTORIA pops her head out too. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Stop following me.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I have no choice, thanks to you 
                    I m a fugitive from the Law.

      Across the road VICTORIA spots ACKERMAN and ENGEL s car.   

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    Why don t we steal that car? 
                    Leave it in the next town.

      HANNAY looks up the road. ACKERMAN and ENGEL stand at the 
    end looking in the wrong direction. They are watching as 
    the police stop and interview passers by. (Their car is 
      parked pointing down the street away from them.)

                                  HANNAY
                          (referring to the car)
                    Because it belongs to those two 
                    men up there.

      VICTORIA follows his gaze.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.37.


                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    They re German spies who are 
                    chasing me with the view to 
                    ending my life.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (looking at him)
                    Not only a murderer, but a 
                    delusional maniac. Just my luck.

    She heads off across the road to the car. HANNAY has no 
      choice but to follow. He checks. ACKERMAN and ENGEL are 
      still looking in the wrong direction. 

      VICTORIA peers into the open car. She sees the cranking 
      handle and removes it. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (hissing)
                    Give me that.

      With huge annoyance HANNAY takes it from her. He goes to 
    the front of the car. He puts the handle in the cranking 
      hole.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What if the owners hear?

      HANNAY looks around. Heading towards them are a small boy 
    and a smaller girl, she has plaits. He stops them.

                                  HANNAY
                    Do you fancy earning a shilling?

    The boy and girl look at each other, then at him - they 
      nod.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Good.
                          (to the boy)
                    When I nod, pull her hair.

      HANNAY crouches down below the bonnet holding the cranking 
      handle. VICTORIA crouches down too out of the view of 
      ACKERMAN and ENGEL. HANNAY looks at the boy and nods. The 
    boy pulls the little girl s hair hard. She yells, and as 
    she does HANNAY turns the cranking handle. Nothing. The 
      engine doesn t fire.

    At the end of the road, ACKERMAN and ENGEL look back. All 
      they see is the two children and their car. VICTORIA and 
      HANNAY are hidden away. 

      Back with HANNAY - he holds the cranking handle, nods at 
    the boy again. The boy pulls the girl s hair. The girl 
      yells as HANNAY turns the handle. The engine still doesn t 
      fire.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.38.


      ACKERMAN and ENGEL look back. Nothing but two children and 
      their car. 

      HANNAY looks at the boy, nods. This time the little girl 
      yells before the boy pulls her hair. HANNAY cranks the car 
    and it FIRES. HANNAY looks at the little girl. She winks at 
      him. Then he pulls the handle out quickly. HANNAY hands the 
    boy the shilling.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Thanks.

      ACKERMAN and ENGEL turn and look towards the car. They see 
      HANNAY and VICTORIA. They start to run to the car. HANNAY  
    and VICTORIA rush to get into the car - both to the 
      driver s door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I ll drive.

                                  HANNAY
                    No, you will not...

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m perfectly...

                                  HANNAY
                          (ordering him)
                    Just get in.

    She gets in. Climbs over into the passenger seat. HANNAY 
      looks up. ACKERMAN and ENGEL are getting closer. HANNAY 
      leaps into the car. Puts it in gear, off with the 
      handbrake.And away they go. 

    The two children watching silently as ACKERMAN and ENGEL 
    run past them chasing the car. But the car is speeding off. 
      ACKERMAN and ENGEL stop and watch with frustration as they 
    see it turn left and out of view. 


      INT/EXT. CAR/ROAD OUT OF DUNGARVEN.DAY. DAY 35959

      HANNAY driving. VICTORIA in the passenger seat. They are 
      coming out of the town heading towards open road. 

                                  VICTORIA
                          (sardonic)
                    Do you have children, MrHannay?

                                  HANNAY
                    I m not married.

                                  VICTORIA
                    That s a relief to womankind.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.39.


                                  HANNAY
                          (ice charm)
                    Where exactly would you like me 
                    to drop you?

      They look at each other. Then the sound of a car behind 
      them coming at speed. They both turn to look behind.

      ACKERMAN, ENGEL and 2 German accomplices are in another car 
    are behind them down the road. ACKERMAN is driving.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Your German spies must have some 
                    pals in town. 

      HANNAY ramming the accelerator to the floor.

                                  HANNAY
                          (to the car)
                    Come on.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Who are they really? Fellow 
                    criminals?

                                  HANNAY
                    I m not a criminal. And they are 
                    German spies.

                                  VICTORIA
                      I sprechena little Deutsch.
                    Maybe we could come to some 
                      understanding. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (wry, she s is being 
                          very naive)
                    The last time I encountered these 
                    men they had killed someone in my 
                    flat, a man named Scudder. They 
                    won t stop until they have the 
                    notebook he gave me. And once 
                    they have that they ll kill us 
                    both. So unless you have a 
                    gun....  

                                  VICTORIA
                    I don t believe in violence...

                                  HANNAY
                    Of course you believe in 
                    violence. You re a suffragette. 
                    You fire bomb homes of 
                    politicians.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.40.


                                  VICTORIA
                          (annoyed)
                    What? You d rather I sat at home 
                    warming your slippers?

                                  HANNAY
                          (hard)
                    I don t want you touching my 
                    slippers.

    He looks behind. The car behind is definitely gaining.

                                  VICTORIA
                    You re a prehistoric boor.

                                  HANNAY
                    And you, my dear, are an unhinged 
                    hysteric. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    That s it. I ve had enough. Stop 
                    the car.

                                  HANNAY
                    No.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Let me out.

    As - she grabs the steering wheel. The car veers 
      dangerously.

                                  HANNAY
                    What are you doing, you lunatic?

      They wrestle with the steering wheel. The car weaves back 
    and forth across the road. It s heading off the road into 
    the rough. HANNAY has no choice but to slam on the brakes. 
    The car comes to a halt at the side of the road and stalls. 

      VICTORIA is thrown across HANNAY. She pushes him off her 
      indignantly.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Get your hands off me.

      HANNAY grabs the cranking handle by the driver s seat.

                                  HANNAY
                          (furious)
                        I never.....D youwant to get us 
                    killed, you....?

                                  HANNAY
                    The word I m looking for hasn t 
                    been invented.

      They both push open their doors and get out. VICTORIA 
      leaning forward adjusting her clothes. HANNAY rushes to the 
      front of the car. The sound of guns being cocked. They look 
    up to see ACKERMAN, ENGEL and 2 accomplices looking down at 
      them. ENGEL and the accomplices have revolvers pointed at 
      HANNAY and VICTORIA. HANNAY and VICTORIA s faces - 
      horrified. HANNAY drops the cranking handle.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (to ACKERMAN)
                    I don t understand, I thought 
                    you d come to my rescue.
                          (referring to HANNAY)
                    This criminal kidnapped me. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Ichflehedickan, lass die Frau 
                    gehen.
                          (sincere)
                    She s an innocent bystander. 
                    There s no honour in hurting a 
                    weak and fragile female.

      VICTORIA s face. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m not a....

                                  HANNAY
                          (quickly to ACKERMAN)
                    If you and I could discuss this 
                    like gentlemen.

                                  ACKERMAN
                    You assume two things, MrHannay. 
                    One I m a gentleman, two there is 
                    anything to discuss. Give me the 
                    notebook.

                                  HANNAY
                    This is a terrible mistake. The 
                    man in my apartment....

      ACKERMAN to ENGEL.

                                  ACKERMAN
                          (possible German)*
                    Shoot the woman.

      ENGEL raises the gun to VICTORIA s head. Cocks it. 
      VICTORIA s face - petrified.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.42.


                                  HANNAY
                    No, wait, it s in my inside 
                    jacket pocket.

      ACKERMAN to his accomplices.

                                  ACKERMAN
                          (possible German)*
                    Search him.

    One holds him as the other opens the inside of HANNAY s 
      jacket. HANNAY s face as the man slips his hand into the 
      breast pocket where the notebook was.

      HANNAY s face confused as he feels the man rummage around 
      then pull out his hand - EMPTY.

    The man looks to ACKERMAN, shakes his head. ACKERMAN hits 
      HANNAY across the face. VICTORIA cries out in shock as 
      HANNAY staggers back.

                                    ACKERMAN(cont d)
                          (to HANNAY)
                    Where is the notebook?

                                  HANNAY
                    It was there, I promise. 

                                  ACKERMAN
                          (possible German *
                            indicating VICTORIA)
                    Search her.

      VICTORIA s scared face as she looks to the gun pointing at 
      her. She raises her hands. The man pats VICTORIA down. Then 
    he looks at ACKERMAN, shakes his head.

                                    ACKERMAN(cont d)
                          (to his men)
                    Examine the car and the 
                      surrounding ground. Then tidy up. 
                    There must be no sign of the 
                    crash remaining.

    The men bundle VICTORIA and HANNAY into the back of the 
      car, ENGEL with a gun sits with them. ACKERMAN gets into 
    the driving seat. As they drive off, HANNAY looks back at 
    to see the other 2 men at the car looking for the notebook. 
      HANNAY s puzzled, scared face. Where is it?    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.42A.


      INT/EXT. CAR/KIRKNAIRN.DAY. DAY 36060

    The car drives past a sign saying KIRKNAIRN- 2 miles. 
      Under it on the sign in the same direction, LONG KEEP - 4 
      miles. HANNAY s face as he sees it.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.43.


      EXT. LONG KEEP. DAY. DAY 56161

    The car pulls off the road into a drive, HANNAY sees a sign 
      - LONG KEEP.


      INT/EXT. CAR/LONG KEEP. DAY. DAY 36262

    The car with HANNAY, VICTORIA, ACKERMAN and ENGEL pulls up 
      outside an imposing but small castle - Long Keep. HANNAY 
    and VICTORIA get out. HANNAY looks around. This is a remote 
      spot. No sign of human dwellings anywhere. (Maybe see the 
      plane parked in a field.)

      HANNAY and VICTORIA are pushed towards the door by ENGEL 
      with the gun, ACKERMAN follows. As they reach the door, it 
    is opened from inside by a BUTLER.

                                  BUTLER
                    If you would follow me.


      INT. LONG KEEP. HALL. DAY. DAY 36363

    The BUTLER leads the party of HANNAY, VICTORIA, behind is 
      ENGEL with the gun. And following up the rear, ACKERMAN. 
      HANNAY and VICTORIA look around. Stags heads gaze down at 
      them from the walls. Swords displayed on mounts. All very 
      traditionally Scottish gentry.

    The BUTLER opens the double doors and announces - 

                                  BUTLER
                    Miss Victoria Sinclair and Mr
                    Richard Hannay, sir.

      They move through the double doors.


      INT. LONG KEEP. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. DAY 36464

      HANNAY and VICTORIA come into a drawing room, light and 
      sunny. Comfortably furnished. And standing up to greet them 
    is the PROFESSOR. By his side is a table with a tray with a 
      teapot, milk jug and cup and saucer. ACKERMAN comes into 
    the room with ENGEL.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (shocked)
                    Professor Fisher...?

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    You know this man?      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.44.


                                  VICTORIA
                          (very confusing)
                    We discuss the weather 
                    occasionally in the post office. 
                    I thought he was English.

    The PROFESSOR looks to ACKERMAN. ACKERMAN shakes his head. 
      HANNAY looks around. Burning in an ashtray is a Zuban
      (German) cigarette. The PROFESSOR resumes his seat. He 
      pours milk from the milk jug into his cup as -

                                  PROFESSOR
                    I wish to congratulate you, Mr
                    Hannay. I was a little concerned 
                    the police would capture you 
                    before I did. But your skilled 
                    survival technique has saved you. 
                    You should join us.

                                  HANNAY
                    Join you?

    The PROFESSOR now pours tea into the cup.

                                  PROFESSOR
                    Why not? You have no love for 
                    Britain. How did you describe it? 
                    Smug and complacent? 

                                  HANNAY
                          (as though entertaining 
                          the thought)
                    Let the woman go  - then maybe we 
                    can talk.

      VICTORIA s face.

                                  PROFESSOR
                          (sincere)
                    In different circumstances I 
                    would have enjoyed that. Please 
                    believe me when I say there are 
                    aspects of my ... vocation I find 
                    distasteful. But if you don t 
                    tell me where Scudder s notebook 
                    is I will be obliged to remove

                    MrHannay.

    The PROFESSOR looks to ENGEL and nods. ENGEL grabs *
      VICTORIA. Starts to drag her to the door. VICTORIA looks to *
      HANNAY in fear.*

                    All right. *

                    I tried to read it, it was in a *
                    code I couldn t understand, so I 
                    destroyed it.

                                  PROFESSOR
                          (not believing him)
                    In which case, you are of no use 
                    to me. Sadly I ll be forced to 
                    kill you both.

    The sound of the doorbell. The PROFESSOR looks swiftly to 
    the door. Then GEORGE s voice in the distance.

                                  GEORGE (V.O.)
                    Is Professor Fisher at home?

      VICTORIA s face as she hears GEORGE s voice. Escape.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (calling out)
                    Uncle...

      ENGEL raises his gun. Points it at her head. VICTORIA 
      seeing this is silenced.

                                  PROFESSOR
                    Gag them. 

    He moves towards the door. As ENGEL and ACKERMAN move 
      towards HANNAY and VICTORIA pulling handkerchiefs from 
      their pockets, VICTORIA runs her hand nervously through her 
      hair.    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.45A.


      INT. LONG KEEP. HALL. DAY. DAY 36565

      GEORGE stands in the hall looking worried. The PROFESSOR 
      comes out of the drawing room. The BUTLER closes the door 
      behind him. 

                                  PROFESSOR
                    Sir George, this is a pleasant 
                    surprise.

                                  GEORGE
                          (visibly shaken)
                    Not really, no. There is a strong 
                      possibility my niece has been 
                    abducted.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.46.

                    What?


      INT. LONG KEEP. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. DAY 36666

      VICTORIA and HANNAY are gagged with handkerchiefs. ENGEL 
      holds HANNAY, VICTORIA is held by ACKERMAN. Both have guns 
    to their heads. They can hear the conversation taking place 
      just beyond the door.

                                  GEORGE (V.O.)
                    A man called Hannay, wanted by 
                    the police for murder...he 
                    impersonated a visiting 
                    dignitary, he s taken Victoria. 
                    Whether she went voluntarily, the 
                    facts appear confused... 

      VICTORIA s desperate eyes. The accomplice s firm grip on 
      her.

      With the PROFESSOR and GEORGE.

                                  GEORGE
                    Anyway my nephew Harry and I are 
                    calling on everyone in the 
                    vicinity to see if they know 
                    anything. 

                                  PROFESSOR 
                    Obviously I ll inform my staff to 
                    keep a look out....

                          (moved)
                    My niece is very dear to me, 
                    Professor Fisher. The daughter I 
                    never had. If anything were to 
                    happen to her...I don t know what 
                    I d do.

                                  PROFESSOR
                            (reassuring)
                      I understand. Don t worry, 
                    please. I feel sure your niece 
                    will be returned safely to you.

      VICTORIA and HANNAY hearing this.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.47.


                                  GEORGE (V.O.)
                    Thank you. I m sorry to have 
                    disturbed you.

    The sound of the front door opening. VICTORIA s anguished 
      face as she realisesGEORGE is leaving. HANNAY squirming in 
      ENGEL s hands. The sound of a muffled NO - from behind his 
      gag. Then from outside the sound of a car engine. The car 
      driving away. VICTORIA and HANNAY look at each other. Their 
      last chance of escape is driving away. The door opens. The 
      PROFESSOR comes in.

                                  PROFESSOR
                          (to ENGEL and ACKERMAN)
                    Bind and cuff them. Then take 
                    them to the oubliette to 
                      contemplate their fate.


      INT. LONG KEEP. OUBLIETTE. DAY. DAY 36969

      A darkened tunnel like a room. On the walls a couple of lit 
    oil lights throw a little light across the cell. At the far 
    end of the room is a huge heavy metal grille from floor to 
      ceiling. The heavy door creaks open. HANNAY and VICTORIA 
    are pushed into the room by ENGEL and ACKERMAN. They are 
      tied together back to back. Their hands are cuffed in steel 
      handcuffs behind them. They are gagged with handkerchiefs. 
      They struggle to remain upright. The door is slammed shut 
    by ACKERMAN. The sound of the key in the lock. 


      INT. LONG KEEP. CORRIDOR. DAY. DAY 37070

      ENGEL and ACKERMAN walk away.


      INT. LONG KEEP. OUBLIETTE. DAY. DAY 37171

      VICTORIA is struggling with something behind her back. This 
    is causing HANNAY great discomfort.

                                  HANNAY
                    Oterooooing?

    One of the cuffs round VICTORIA s hand springs open. In her 
      hand she holds a hair pin. She uses it to open the other 
      cuff. The hand cuffs fall to the floor. Hands free, she 
      pulls her arms out from the ropes binding her back to back 
      with HANNAY. Then she pulls the gag down that was round her 
      mouth.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m escaping that s what I m 
                    doing.

    She bends down which forces HANNAY to have to go down.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.48.


                                  HANNAY
                    Otcheet.

      VICTORIA steps out of the ropes. HANNAY realisesthat he 
    too can at least get out of the ropes. He turns round to 
    see a totally free - he still has gag and handcuffs - 
      VICTORIA.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Ow oou at?

      VICTORIA holds up her hair pin. She starts to put the pin 
      back in her hair. HANNAY annoyed.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Oteroute?

                                  VICTORIA
                    You? 

    She pulls the gag down from his face. 

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                            (suspicious)
                    You speak German......how do I 
                    know you re not a spy too?

                                  HANNAY
                    I spent some time in German South 
                    West Africa as a mining engineer. 

                                  VICTORIA
                          (mimicking HANNAY)
                    Let the woman go then maybe we 
                    can talk.

                                  HANNAY
                    A trivial detail, I know. But I 
                    was trying to save you.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It could have been a double 
                    bluff.

                                  HANNAY
                    If I m a spy, how come I m locked 
                    in here with you? Even for a 
                    woman that is a remarkably stupid 
                    notion.

      A moment then VICTORIA starts to pick the locks of his 
      cuffs with her hair pin. 

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Where did you learn to do this?      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.49.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Harry s rather taken with 
                    Houdini.

      HANNAY looks around the room. His eyes on the metal grille.

                                  HANNAY
                    An oubliette, where prisoners 
                    were left to rot.

      VICTORIA opens the cuffs. HANNAY removes them as VICTORIA 
      sees a door in the wall (not the door they came in). HANNAY 
      goes to the grille, pulls it. It doesn t yield. Beyond it 
      darkness - maybe more tunnel. VICTORIA tries the door she s 
      spotted, it s locked. 

                                  VICTORIA
                          (to HANNAY)
                    You ll have to charge at it, see 
                    if you can break it down.

      HANNAY looks at her then -

                                  HANNAY
                          (wry)
                    Or, I could save myself the 
                      humiliation and let you pick it 
                    with your hair pin.

      VICTORIA looks at him then she goes over, puts her hair pin 
    in the lock. A bit of jiggling it about then a click. 
      VICTORIA turns the door handle and the door opens. They 
      peer inside.


      INT. LONG KEEP. WALK IN STORE ROOM. DAY. DAY 37272

    The shadow of HANNAY and VICTORIA in the door. He comes in, 
    she sees something on a shelf. A candle and a box of 
      matches. She lights the candle. Then turns to see what s in 
    the cupboard.

      Lined up against the wall is a pile of boxes. HANNAY opens 
      one. Then turns urgently to VICTORIA.

                                  HANNAY
                    Careful where you wave that 
                    candle. 

      HANNAY pulls out some sticks of explosive.*

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                      Explosives.

                    Are you sure?      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.50.


    He opens another box. And another.

                                  HANNAY
                    Fuses and detonators. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    What do they intend to do with 
                    them?

                                  HANNAY
                    Sabotage our naval bases. Part of 
                    their plan for the invasion of 
                    Great Britain.

      VICTORIA looks at HANNAY.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I owe you an apology. It s very 
                    possible you re not the 
                    delusional maniac I first thought 
                    you were. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Thank you.

    He returns the explosive into its box.

                                  VICTORIA
                    If you were a mining engineer 
                    couldn t you blast us out of 
                    here?

                                  HANNAY
                    It had crossed my mind but no..

                                  VICTORIA
                    Why not?

                                  HANNAY
                    Because I have no way of 
                      calculating the right amount of 
                    chargeandI can t run enough *
                    fuse. I could end up blowing us *
                    both to Kingdom Come.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (bravado)
                    As you re no doubt going to Hell, *
                    it would be one way to get rid of 
                    your company.

      HANNAY looks at her. Change of mood.

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                          (serious)

      A moment THEN HANNAY turns and picks up the explosive.

      With ACKERMAN as he comes through the double doors. The 
      PROFESSOR turns to him -

                    They ve searched the crash site

    The PROFESSOR goes to the gramophone. Places the needle on 
      a record. The sounds of Alexander s Ragtime Bandby Irving 
      Berlin.


      INT. LONG KEEP. OUBLIETTE. DAY. DAY 37474

      HANNAY is running a fuse from a brick of explosive which he 
    has positioned by the large metal grille.

    He runs it back to the other end of the room where VICTORIA 
      stands.

      HANNAY and VICTORIA hunkered down. HANNAY looks to VICTORIA

                                  VICTORIA
                          (serious)
                    Please, MrHannay, this isn t 
                    your fault.

      HANNAY looks at the matches in his hand then at VICTORIA.

                                  HANNAY
                          (quietly, has to be 
                            certain)
                    Are you sure about this?

      VICTORIA holds his look.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes.


      INT. LONG KEEP. CORRIDOR. DAY. DAY 37777

      ENGEL and the accomplice reach the door to the oubliette. 
      ENGEL puts a key in the lock.


      INT. LONG KEEP. OUBLIETTE. DAY. DAY 37878

      HANNAY and VICTORIA look at each other. Then HANNAY strikes 
    the match. The sound of the key in the lock. VICTORIA looks 
    to the door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Hurry.

      HANNAY lights the fuse. It starts to go along the fuse at 
      speed. HANNAY takes off his jacket. The door begins to 
      open. VICTORIA s horrified face as she sees ENGEL and the 
      accomplice come into the room. They see the fuse. 

    The flame is running along the fuse. It s nearly at the 
      explosive. The accomplice runs forward to stop it. HANNAY 
      grabs VICTORIA. Puts her on the ground. Covers her face 
      with his jacket and uses his body to shield her. 

    AND BANG - BLACKOUT.


      INT. LONG KEEP. OUBLIETTE/TUNNEL. DAY. DAY 37979

      BLACKOUT. Silence then distorted sound.  Then the 
      background sounds returning to normal. The sound of 
      creaking. HANNAY lying on his back. His eyes are closed. A 
      moment then HANNAY opens his eyes. The grille hangs 
      creaking on one hinge - open. The accomplice unconscious 
      beside it. HANNAY tries to move - his back hurts, he 
      winces. Then he is on his feet fast. VICTORIA lies covered 
    by dust from the explosion.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.53.


      ENGEL lies unconscious on his back in the open door to the 
      main castle. The sound of voices in the corridor heading 
      towards the oubliette.

                                  HANNAY
                    Victoria, Victoria.

    She opens her eyes. He looks down, her right sleeve is 
      badly singed, her skin at the wrist red.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    We have to get out of here.

    He helps her to her feet. She is wincing. He sees his 
      jacket lying near her. He picks it up. They start to run in 
    the direction of the blown off grille and the tunnel, 
      stepping over unconscious accomplice.


      EXT. LONG KEEP. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY. DAY 38080

      VICTORIA and HANNAY emerge from the end of a tunnel into 
      countryside a little away from the castle. From behind it s *
      obvious HANNAY s shirt is burnt and his back badly 
      scorched. They both blink in the light. HANNAY s looks 
      around. The sound of dogs barking. People shouting. 
      VICTORIA sees a path over the moorland. She starts to head 
    in that direction.

                                  HANNAY
                    No.

    He pulls her in another direction. In the distance a 
      stream, the glimpse of a waterfall.

      Behind them the castle with smoke rising from the cellar 
      area. Men running around. The sound of the dogs and 
      shouting.


      EXT. WATERFALL. DAY. DAY 38181

      HANNAY and VICTORIA running. HANNAY pulls VICTORIA towards 
    the stream and the waterfall. He hides his jacket behind a 
      rock. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Get under the water.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What?

                                  HANNAY
                    Trust me. It ll reduce the effect 
                    of the burns.Hopefully they 
                    won t spot us here.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.54.


      VICTORIA aware HANNAY is holding her hand. She removes it 
      from his. They walk together into the stream towards the 
      waterfall. VICTORIA is freezing. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I survived the explosion now I m 
                    going to die of exposure.

                                  HANNAY
                    Maybe if I held you.

      VICTORIA looks at him. HANNAY holds her look.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Purely for medicinal purposes.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Perhaps it would be more 
                    advantageous if we held each 
                    other.

      A moment then they tentatively hold each other. The sound 
    of the plane overhead.

                                  HANNAY
                    Getdown. 

      Theyduck down. The sound of the plane flying above then 
      getting fainter and fainter.

                                                                      TIME JUMP


      EXT. WATERFALL.DAY. DAY 38282

    The sound of shivering. VICTORIA is shivering in HANNAY s 
      arms, her arms round him by the waterfall. HANNAY looks 
      over in the direction of Long Keep. All seems quiet.

                                  HANNAY
                    We should get out nowbefore we 
                    perish.

      They start to wade out of the streamcautiously. Both 
      supporting each other. They get to shore. Their clothes 
      dripping wet. Both are very cold. HANNAY grabs his jacket 
      from behind the rock. Puts it round her shoulders. VICTORIA 
      hesitates then -

                                  VICTORIA
                    Thank you.

                                  HANNAY
                    You should go back to your 
                    brother s. Any problem with the 
                    police, I m sure your Uncle can 
                    fix it.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.55.


    She starts wringing the bottom of her skirt out.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What do I say? I was blown up in 
                    a castle owned by an acquaintance 
                    of his who happens to be a German 
                    spy but I can t prove it. No, 
                    sorry. I don t bail out even if a 
                    cause appears hopeless.

                                  HANNAY
                    It wasn t exactly on mylist of *
                    things to do next. Caught bang in *
                    themiddle of a plot to invade *
                    the country. A country, which it 
                    has to be said, does not feel 
                    like home.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (shocked)
                    That s it, you re simply going to 
                    turn your back....

                                  HANNAY
                          (confused)
                    What? No.

                                  VICTORIA
                    But you said..

                                  HANNAY
                          (firm)
                    If I may finish...?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Sorry.

      HANNAY looks into her face.

                                  HANNAY
                    Perhaps you don t realisethe 
                    true value of something until 
                    you re about to lose it. 

      They look at each other. Then HANNAY remembers what he had 
      intended to say.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    I ll do whatever it takes to stop 
                    those men...And.. as there may 
                    well be other situations ahead 
                    that require the use of a 
                      hairpin...... 

                                  VICTORIA
                    ... We carry on together.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.56.


                                  HANNAY
                          (smiling)
                    It seems the most sensible plan.

      VICTORIA looks at him and smiles.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Not that I actually have a plan. 
                    Without Scudder s notebook, I 
                    can t prove anything.

                                  VICTORIA
                    We should go back to where the 
                    car was. See if we can find it.

                                  HANNAY
                    The Germans already searched 
                    there. Besides we d never find 
                    that stretch of road again.

                                  VICTORIA
                    It was north of Kirknairn, 
                      approximately half a mile after 
                    the left hand turning with the 
                    gravel heap on the side of the 
                    road and the beech tree on the 
                    right. 

      A moment as HANNAY looks at her, then he stares up at the 
    sky and the Sun then points - 

                                  HANNAY
                    North s that way.

      They move off using bushes where possible for cover.


      EXT. ROAD.DAY. DAY 38383

      HANNAY and VICTORIA stand looking at the grass where the 
    car stopped. There appears to be no sign of it.  

                                  VICTORIA
                          (not as sure now)
                    Is this it?

      HANNAY squats and examines the ground like a trained 
      tracker. He looks at some broken twigs, then spots a faint 
      tyretrack on the grass. He looks to VICTORIA.

                                  HANNAY
                    Yes. Well remembered.

      VICTORIA looks around as though dredging something from her 
      memory. Then she takes two steps, stops. Crouches down AND 
      puts her hand down a rabbit hole. HANNAY watches perplexed.    The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.56A.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Pray.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.57.


                                  HANNAY
                    What for? A rabbit?

      VICTORIA pulls out SCUDDER s notebook from the rabbit hole.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Scudder s notebook.

                                  HANNAY
                    What?

    He takes it, examines it. It is indeed the notebook.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I picked your pocket after we 
                    stopped.

                                  HANNAY
                          (appalled)
                    You picked my pocket?

                                  VICTORIA
                          (pleased with herself)
                    And hid the notebook so the Bosch
                    wouldn t find it.

      HANNAY  - new very BIG thought.

                                  HANNAY
                    Whoa, hang on, that means you 
                    believed my story about the 
                    spies. Risked our lives..

                                  VICTORIA
                    Trivial detail. Saved our lives.

                                  HANNAY
                    All right but that s not the 
                    point...

    He looks to VICTORIA. She doesn t look too good. She s 
      shivers then sways.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Sorry, I don t feel too clever.

      HANNAY goes over to her and supports her. He places the 
      notebook in the outside pocket of the dry jacket which is 
      round her shoulders. 

                                  HANNAY
                    We need to rest.

                                  VICTORIA
                    There s an inn a little way from 
                    here. Left, over a style.

                                  VICTORIA (cont'd)
                    Past the cattle trough. Beyond a 
                    sign post to Dungarven.

                                  HANNAY
                          (warm)
                    Why don t we postpone the 
                    argument until we get there?


      EXT. INN. NIGHT. DAY 38484

    The lights of a small inn up ahead. 

      HANNAY and VICTORIA arms around each other, walking towards 
    it. HANNAY looks up and sees a sign post. One way indicates 
      DUNGARVEN.The other KIRKNAIRN- 1 mile, LONG KEEP - 3 
      miles. The day s adventures have obviously taken a big toll 
    on their physical well being. HANNAY stops. He takes 
      VICTORIA s right hand and removes the ring from it.

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    Hold out your left hand.

                                  VICTORIA
                    If you think.....

                                  HANNAY
                          (exhausted)
                    I ve been chased, shot at,not *
                    eaten for two days, hardly slept, *
                    tumbled into the path of a moving 
                    motor vehicle, blown upand*
                    submerged in icy water. Even 
                    Casanova could not be thinking 
                    anything other than a bed to 
                    sleep in and something to eat.

      VICTORIA looks at him. Holds out her left hand. He slips 
    the ring onto her wedding finger. VICTORIA hands HANNAY his 
      jacket back. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    The burn marks on your back might 
                    provoke some comment.

      INT. INN. BEDROOM. NIGHT. DAY 38686*

      A large double bed. HANNAY and VICTORIA stare at the bed *
    and then inadvertently at each other. They swiftly look *
      away. They stand shivering in an inn bedroom. (A fire *
      blazing in the fireplace).HANNAY goes to the window, the *
      curtains are drawn, he pulls one back a little just to *
      check no one is out there. Then he turns back into the *
      room. An awkward moment.  Then aknock on the door. *

                                  HANNAY
                          (with a little relief)*
                    Come in.

    The LANDLADY comes in carrying a tray with sandwiches, tea *

                    We should get out of these wet 
                    clothes before we get pneumonia. 

      They turn their backs on each other as they undress. HANNAY 
      hears VICTORIA wincing. 

      They turn back to each other wearing the pyjamas.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Show me your arm.

      VICTORIA rolls up the sleeve of her pyjamas  - her left arm 
    is red and sore. HANNAY opens the mustard pot. He puts his *
      finger in and brings out some mustard. 

                                    HANNAY(cont d)*
                    It ll reduce the pain.*

    He begins to spread it on her burn. VICTORIA winces but 
      says nothing as HANNAY gently spreads the mustard.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    The water prevented any 
                      blistering. With luck there llbe 
                    no scar.

    He stops, wipes his hand on a napkin then gently rolls down 
    her sleeve. 

                                                                                              *

                                  VICTORIA*
                    I should do your back.*

      HANNAYhesitates then turns. Removes the jacket top. Red *
      burn marks. VICTORIA puts her fingers into the pot. Then 
    she spreads the mustard across his burns. HANNAY inwardly 
      wincing. VICTORIA studying his very fine back as she does 
      this. 

      HANNAY s face as he enjoys the touch. A moment when he 
      realiseshe s enjoying this too much. 

                                  HANNAY
                    That llbe fine. Thank you.

    He pulls his pyjamas top up. VICTORIA wipes her hand on the 
      napkin.

      Their clothes drying by the fire over the large fire guard. 
      HANNAY and VICTORIA are sitting close to the fire eating 
    the sandwiches and drinking large whiskiesas they pore *
      over SCUDDER s notebook on the table. Also the pencilis on *
    the table.The tea things including milk jug sit on the *
      tray on the floor. *

                                  VICTORIA
                    If they intend to spike our navy,  
                    surely the Bosch dhave to know 
                    our naval plans, where every ship 
                    and submarine was positioned. 

                                  HANNAY
                    That s the bit I can t get from 
                    Scudder s notes.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Perhaps Scudder never found out.

                                  HANNAY
                    The Germans obviously think he 
                    did.

      VICTORIA turns a page of the notebook to reveal - 
      translated in capitals - YEARNING RETAINER. FORGET ME NOT.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yearning Retainer? Forget me not? 
                    What does that mean? A love-
                    struck servant?

                                  HANNAY
                    It has to be double code. Scudder 
                    was obviously a bit of a 
                    romantic.

      VICTORIA looks at HANNAY. He holds the look then goes back 
    to the page. On the page next to YEARNING RETAINER, FORGET 
    ME NOT - the numbers 2/7 and the three Roman numerals. 
      Under the numerals the translated letters NCD.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Why would Scudder use a double

                    Coming from a suffragette, I take 
                    that as quite a compliment.

      They smile at each other.

      INT. INN. BEDROOM. NIGHT. DAY 38888

      HANNAY and VICTORIA lie in the bed under the covers. 
      HANNAY s hands are above the covers. A candle burns on a 
      bedside table. There is a gap between them. They are awake. 
      A moment.

                                  HANNAY
                    I ve fought in a war, Victoria. I 
                    saw men killed, women and 
                    children burnt out of their 
                    homes. Nothing glorious there.

      A moment.

                    ensure Britain is not at war 
                    again.

      VICTORIA closes her eyes. HANNAY lies there, his eyes open. 
    He turns and looks at her.


      EXT. INN. NIGHT. DAY 38989

      Standing outside staring up at the window is the VICAR 
      dressed as he was at the meeting, the signet ring on his 
      right little finger. He sees the light extinguish behind 
    the curtains as the candle is blown out.


      EXT. INN. DAY. DAY 49090

      Early morning. ACKERMAN and ENGEL s car pulls up outside 
    the inn. (ENGEL has burns on his face, one hand is 
      bandaged) They both get out. 2 cyclists are propping their 
      bicycles up against the inn wall. ACKERMAN and ENGEL go 
      into the pub, followed by the cyclists. 


      INT. INN. BEDROOM. DAY. DAY 49191

      HANNAY wakes up. Sunlight streaming in between the cracks 
    in the curtains. He turns in the bed - to see VICTORIA is 
    not there. Immediately he sits up, puts his hand under his 
      pillow and brings out the notebook.

    The bedroom door opens. VICTORIA comes in fully dressed and 
      holding a towel and pyjamas. 

                                  VICTORIA

    She moves into the bar to the cyclists. ACKERMAN and ENGEL 
      wait till she s busy then quickly head up the stairs.

      HANNAY is out of bed. VICTORIA hands him his clothes from

      runs to it and looks out. HANNAY and VICTORIA are peddling 
    for their lives down the road on the bicycles.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.65.


      EXT. HARRY S HOUSE. BACK GARDEN. DAY. DAY 49696

      HANNAY and VICTORIA on the bicycles - VICTORIA leading the 
      way. They draw up outside the back door of a detached stone 
      house away from the road. They are out of breath from 
      cycling fast. HANNAY checks behind him they weren t 
      followed.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Don t tell Harry about Scudder s 
                    notebook. He s never been good at 
                    keeping secrets.


      INT. HARRY S HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. DAY 49797

      VICTORIA opens the door and comes in followed by HANNAY. 
      HARRY is poring over a map. A teapot, jug of milk, sugar 
      bowl and teacup and saucer sits on a tray on the table. 
      There are two shotguns on the wall. HARRY looks up and sees 
      VICTORIA and HANNAY.

                                  HARRY
                    Good grief, don t come a step 
                    nearer you...

    He grabs a shotgun from the cradle on the wall. He points 
    it at HANNAY.

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                    Unhand her, you swine.

                                  VICTORIA
                    He isn t touching me, Harry. He s 
                    a friend and a hero of this 
                    nation.

      HARRY points the shot gun up away from HANNAY.

                                  HARRY
                          (a bit confused)
                    Oh right, jolly good. Damn thing 
                    isn t loaded anyway. 

    The gun promptly goes off. It fires up through the ceiling. 
    The chandellierrotates a little. HARRY is thrown back 
      somewhat by the recoil. VICTORIA ignores this.

                                  VICTORIA
                    We re just going to use the

      VICTORIA is on the telephone. HANNAY listening.

                    And no listening in...yes you do. 

      HANNAY comes up to VICTORIA as though to take the 
      mouthpiece. VICTORIA covers the mouthpiece.

                    She listens in. I ll speak to

                    if she hears you.

      VICTORIA turns her back on HANNAY. She moves her left hand 
    in front of her.

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    Hello? I need to speak to Captain 
                    Kell urgently.... No, no one else 
                    will do...I have to get a message 
                    to him today, it s of national 
                      importance.... Give him this 
                    number Argyll 135. Tell him 
                    Scudder...

      HANNAY grabs the hand piece from her and slams it back in 
    the cradle.

                                  HANNAY
                    Are you crazy? You ve told them 
                    where we are. Scudder was 
                    convinced he d been betrayed. If 
                    there s a traitor at the 
                    Bureau...

                    I had no choice, Hannay.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.67.


                                  HANNAY
                    You and Harry aren t safe 
                    here....I ll give myself up to 
                    the police. Maybe they ll believe 
                    me ....  .

                                  VICTORIA
                    Or maybe they ll hang you 
                    We just have to sit tight, 
                    Hannay, hope Kell contacts us. 

      VICTORIA goes up stairs. HANNAY is a worried man.


      INT. HARRY S HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. DAY 49999

      HANNAY comes in, HARRY s replacing the shotgun on the wall.

                                  HARRY
                    Damn fine speech you made 
                    yesterday afternoon. You should 
                    be the politician not me.

      HANNAY goes over to the window, looks out, checking. As - 

                                  HANNAY
                            (distracted)
                    Why are you going in for it?

                                  HARRY
                    Last resort. Not done very well 
                    at anything else so Uncle George 
                    thought I might make a go of 
                    politics. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Did you say your Uncle s on the 
                    Defence Committee?

                                  HARRY
                      Absolutely.

                                  HANNAY
                          (making a decision)
                    Could you fix a meeting with him 
                    for me, sharpish?

                                  HARRY
                    Of course. He ll get you sorted 
                    out. You ll be an MP in no time.

                                  HANNAY
                    Right. Thanks. Might not be a 
                    good idea to mention it to your 
                    sister. I d only get another 
                    lecture about universal suffrage.

                                  HARRY

      INT. CHURCH. NIGHT. DAY 4100100

      Darkness. A door opening, footsteps, a figure enters 
      holding an oil lamp. It s GEORGE. He closes the door behind 
      him. Moonlight through the stain glass window. The church 
      appears empty. A moment then HANNAY steps out of the 
      shadows

                                  GEORGE
                          (hard)
                    This is all very hush hush.

                                  HANNAY
                    I need to talk to someone about 
                    national security, urgently. 

                                  GEORGE
                    How did you know I wouldn t turn 
                    up with the police and have you 
                    arrested for murder, abduction 
                    and deception?

                                  HANNAY
                    I didn t, sir. 

      A moment.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, if Victoria brought you 
                    back here, there must be 
                    something about you.


      INT. TUNNEL. NIGHT. DAY 4101101

      Darkness but for an oil light and a small fire. It is 
      impossible to recognisethis location. The PROFESSOR throws 
      a book on to the flames. He s burning his code-books.

                    words, Yearning Retainer, Forget 
                    Me Not. And the letters NCD.

      GEORGE thinking. A moment then - 

                                  GEORGE
                      NCD?There s a meeting of the 
                    National Committee of Defence at 
                    Stirling Castle tomorrow. 

                                  HANNAY
                    What are you discussing?

      A moment then - GEORGE says nothing.

                                  HANNAY (cont d)
                    I ve risked my life for this 
                    country, Sir George.

      A moment then -


                                  GEORGE
                    The unveiling of the new naval 
                    defence plans. 

                                  HANNAY
                    That s it. If the Germans can get 
                    copies, they ll be able to 
                    destroy the fleet in advance of 
                    invasion.

                                  GEORGE
                          (nonsense)
                    That s out of the question. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Scudder was certain he d been *
                      betrayed....*

                                  GEORGE
                    What? I assure you, Hannay, 
                    tomorrow it will be impossible 
                    either to steal or copy those 
                    plans. The First Sea Lord, Prince 
                    Louis of Battenburg, will present 
                    them to the committee, then

                    Does Victoria know we re having 
                    this chat?

                                  HANNAY
                    No. If you had brought the 
                    police...I thought she might ... 
                    cause a scene. She s risked 
                    enough..

                                  GEORGE
                          (angry)
                    Then why the hell didn t you part 
                    from her earlier, man...
                          (a moment)
                    I want you to go back to London 
                    tomorrow.

                                  HANNAY
                    What? 

                                  GEORGE
                    I promised my brother before he 
                    died I d take care of Harry and 
                    Victoria as my own ... if you 
                    thought anything of her. 

                                  HANNAY
                    Of course I care about her.

                                  GEORGE
                    The longer you stay close to 
                    Victoria, the more you endanger 
                    her life.

      A moment. HANNAY s face. He knows that is true.

                                    GEORGE(cont d)
                            (controlling himself)
                    I ll pass on this information to 
                    Captain Kell. I ll also have a 
                    word with the Commissioner of the 
                    Metropolitan Police. You ll no 
                    longer be a wanted man.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.71.


      GEORGE pulls out his wallet and hands HANNAY various 
      denominations of pound notes.

                                  GEORGE (cont d)
                    No need to repay me. 

      A moment as HANNAY looks at the money in his hand then - 

                                  HANNAY
                    It s over?

                                  GEORGE
                    For you, yes.

                                  HANNAY
                    May I tell Victoria I m leaving?

                                  GEORGE
                    And have her hate me?

                    One day you ll thank me, Hannay.

                    break your heart.


      INT. HARRY S HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT. DAY 4105105

      HANNAY sits in a chair by the fire in his pyjamas and 
      dressing gown. By the gas lamp he is re-reading SCUDDER s 
      notebook.

      A knock on the door. A moment. HANNAY gets up and puts the 
      notebook under the pillow on the bed. Another knock.

                                  HANNAY
                    Come in.

    The door opens and VICTORIA comes in, she wears a beautiful 
      dressing gown. HANNAY stands, watching her. VICTORIA closes 
    the door behind her. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I couldn t sleep, worrying about 
                    tomorrow. Why hasn t Kell 
                    contacted us?

                                  HANNAY
                    I m sure he will.

                                  VICTORIA

      VICTORIA and HANNAY stand looking at each other. An awkward 
      silence.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.72.


                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    Isn t it strange? We were so much 
                    easier with each other when we 
                    faced death together.

                                  HANNAY
                      A prehistoric boor and...

                                  VICTORIA
                    .... an unhinged hysteric. Hardly 
                    a marriage made in heaven. 

      A moment. Then HANNAY goes towards her.

                                  HANNAY
                    Thank you.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What for?

                                  HANNAY
                    Your passion, your commitment. 
                    For helping me understand what s 
                    important to me.

      VICTORIA looks into his face.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (quietly)
                    Which is?

                                  HANNAY
                    This country, the... people in 
                    it. I never really belonged 
                    anywhere, not here, not in 
                    Africa. No loyalty, except maybe 
                    to myself. Life was a series of 
                      adventures, I was running away I 
                    suppose. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    And now you ve stopped...?

      They look at each other. HANNAY moves towards her and they 
      kiss passionately. A few moments then VICTORIA breaks away 
      a little. She looks into HANNAY s face.

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    I could stay the night.

      HANNAY looks away. VICTORIA sees this, she tries to break 
      away.

                                    VICTORIA(cont d)
                    I ve shocked you. 

      HANNAY holds her arms.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.73.

                          (messing this up)
                    No. A bit. I m flattered....

                    You don t have to say anything, 
                    Victoria. 

      HANNAY kisses her gently on the lips.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    There is nothing I would love 
                    more. Nothing. But...who knows 
                    what may happen tomorrow...?

                                  VICTORIA
                    I can look after myself, Hannay.

                                  HANNAY
                          (gentle)
                    Just this once, please, allow me 
                    to protect you.

      A moment as they look at each other. Then VICTORIA kisses 
    him tenderly on the lips. She turns and leaves. HANNAY left 
      forlorn.


      INT/EXT. BEDROOM/HARRY S HOUSE. DAY. DAY 5106106

      Sunlight through the curtains. HANNAY in bed tossing and 
      turning. The sound of a door closing. HANNAY wakes, gets 
    out of bed and goes to the window. 

      Pushing back the curtain he sees VICTORIA getting into a 
    car driven by the VICAR. HANNAY looks puzzled. He s trying 
    to recall the face.

      Flashback

    The VICAR sitting in the train compartment wearing large 
      black hat and round thick pebble glasses. On his right hand 
      little finger is a signet ring. 

      HANNAY s horrified face. He thinks. Then goes to the bed. 
      Puts his hand under the pillow, nothing. He flings off the 
      pillows and searches. No notebook. HANNAY horrified face.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.74.


      INT. HARRY S HOUSE. HALL. DAY. DAY 4107107

      HANNAY racing down the stairs. He is dressed but doing up 
    his shirt. He picks up the mouth piece of the phone then 
      winds up the phone.

                                  HANNAY (ON PHONE)
                    Hello?... Are you the same 
                    operator who connected a call 
                    from Harry Sinclair s house to

                      yesterday....What? How d youmean 
                    she disconnected it?....Before *
                    you could put her through?

      HARRY comes into the hall carrying golf clubs. HANNAY 
      replaces the mouthpiece quickly. 

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (urgent to HARRY)
                    Who was that man Victoria left 
                    with this morning?

                                  HARRY
                    No idea.

                                  HANNAY
                    Does Victoria have any German 
                    pals you know of?

                                  HARRY
                    Apart from our German cousins, 
                    you mean? 

      HANNAY s face.

                                  HANNAY
                    I need to borrow your car. Now.

                                  HARRY
                    Sorry old man, I m playing a 
                    round in the Trossachs. 

                                  HANNAY
                    It s a national emergency, Harry. 
                    I have to get to Stirling.

                                  HARRY
                    Good lord, really? Why don t I 
                    drive you?

    He puts the golf clubs down.*

                                  HANNAY*

      HANNAY s face. Torn. Unknown to HARRY, HANNAY is asking him 
    to help unmask his own sister. 

                                  HANNAY*
                    What does Victoria think about *
                    that?*

                                  HARRY

      brakes.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.76.


      HARRY pulls up at the bottom of the road up to the castle. 
      HANNAY is getting out at speed. 

                                  HARRY
                    D youwant me to ...?

                                  HANNAY
                    No, thanks. 
                          (feeling guilty)
                    You re a good man, Harry.. 

    And HANNAY is running up the hill. HARRY s puzzled face.


      EXT. STIRLING CASTLE. DAY. DAY 5110110

      HANNAY approaches the gateway into Stirling Castle at 
      speed. There is a barrier manned by armed soldiers. HANNAY 
      speaks to a SOLDIER and a SERGEANT.

                                  HANNAY
                    I need to speak to Sir George 
                    Sinclair.

                                  SOLDIER
                    Sorry sir, move along.

                                  HANNAY
                    You don t understand, it s a 
                    matter of national security.

    The SOLDIER points his gun at him. The SERGEANT stands 
      looking at him.

                                  SOLDIER
                    If you do not move sir. I ll be 
                    obliged to detain you.

                                  HANNAY
                    But...

      Suddenly the SERGEANT cocks his gun. Points it at HANNAY.

                                  SERGEANT
                    Hands above your head. Now.

                                  HANNAY
                    What?

                                  SERGEANT
                    Don t you whatme, laddie. You re 
                    that murderer, Hannay. 

    The SERGEANT signals to the SOLDIER.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.77.

    Two SOLDIERS dragging HANNAY off to the castle.


      INT. CASTLE. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR. DAY. DAY 5111111

      HANNAY is being taken down the corridor by the two 
      SOLDIERS. HANNAY sees coming towards him a large trolley 
      pushed by a maid. On the trolley are dirty cups and 
      saucers, plates and glasses stacked high. As the maid is 
      about to pass them, HANNAY with huge energy, bursts free of 
      their grip. He grabs the trolley slewing it against them. 
    The maid screams. Cups and saucers fall to the floor 
      shattering. 

      HANNAY is off sprinting down the corridor. The SOLDIERS 
      scrambling after him.

      HANNAY rounds the corner and disappears from view.


      INT. CASTLE. GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR. DAY. DAY 5112112

      HANNAY sprinting at speed down the corridor. He sees a door *
      guarded by two armed soldiers. He sprints down towards it. 
    As the soldiers see him they raise their guns - stay where 
    you are.

      Behind is heard - stop or we ll shoot.

      HANNAY looks back to see the two SOLDIERS heading towards 
      him. He s sandwiched between soldiers. He looks up to the 
      large closed double doors.

                                  HANNAY*
                          (shouting)
                    In the name of King George the 
                    Fifth. Open these doors.

    The soldiers cock their rifles. They point them at HANNAY 
      about to fire THEN - 

    The large doors open and - VICTORIA stands there.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.78.

                            (confounded)
                    Victoria?

                    Hannay.


      INT. STIRLING CASTLE. CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY. DAY 5113113

      HANNAY comes into the conference room followed by VICTORIA. 
    The guards close the doors behind them. HANNAY looks 
      around. There is a large oval table with 8 chairs. The 
      meeting is obviously over. Cigar smoke. At the head of the 
      table a place with an empty brandy glass. Tea cups, milk 
      jugs and sugar. In the middle of the table a collection of 
      maps, lists of naval emplacements. The naval plans. Also on 
    the table three red metal boxes with the words RESTRICTED. 
      HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. HANNAY turns on VICTORIA.

                                  HANNAY
                          (confused and angry)
                    What are you doing here?

      A moment then - 

                                  VICTORIA
                    I work for the Secret Service 
                    Bureau.

                          (realisation)
                    Oh god. I m too late. You re 
                    Scudder s traitor.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Don t be absurd.

                                  HANNAY
                    You took Scudder s notebook 
                    whilst I slept. You had me 
                    followed from London by the 
                    Vicar.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.79.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Why didn t I just finish you off?

                                  HANNAY
                    Not for sentimental reasons, I m 
                    sure of that. 

      HANNAY looks at the plans on the table.

                                    HANNAY(cont'd)
                    You knew all along what 2/7, NCD
                    meant - the unveiling of the 
                    British Naval plans. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    There are armed guards outside 
                    every door, Hannay. How exactly 
                    am I supposed to remove them?

                                  HANNAY
                    Under your petticoats? Lord knows 
                    what devious schemes you have in 
                    your...

      A MOMENTOUS thought descends on HANNAY.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Your head. They re in your head.

                                  VICTORIA
                    What?

                                  HANNAY
                    When you took us back to retrieve 
                    the notebook after the crash you 
                    could describe every tree, every 
                    landmark. Same with the inn. You 
                    have a photographic memory. I m 
                    right, aren t I?

      A moment.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Yes.

    As though HANNAY has been punched in the stomach.

                                  HANNAY
                    So what now? You scream enemy of 
                    the state and the guards rush in 
                    and shoot me?

                                  KELL (O.S.)
                    And waste a valuable resource?      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.80.


      HANNAY swings round, behind him stands CAPTAIN KELL, 41, 
      dressed in naval uniform. Next to him stands the VICAR, 
      also in naval uniform. 

                                  KELL(cont d)
                    Captain Kell,  MrHannay.

                                  HANNAY
                    You re Kell?

                                  KELL
                    The genuine article I assure you. 
                    Ask Churchill.

      KELL holds out his hand. HANNAY, confused, shakes it. KELL 
      refers to the VICAR.

                                  KELL(cont d)
                    Lieutenant Wakeham.

                                  VICAR
                    How d youdo?

                                  KELL
                    Sorry we couldn t introduce 
                    ourselves earlier. It served the 
                    Bureau to have you in the game. 
                    That s why I sent Victoria to 
                    cover your back.

                                  HANNAY
                    She nearly got me killed.

                                  VICTORIA
                    You enjoyed every minute of it.

                                  HANNAY
                          (angry)
                    You used me as bait.

                                  VICAR
                    As long as the Germans were 
                    chasing you, we could keep tabs 
                    on them. See who else they were 
                    in contact with. 

                                  HANNAY
                    So who is Scudder s traitor?      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.81.


                                  KELL
                    We don t know. But after 
                    Scudder s warning,we were doubly 
                    cautious. The plans travelled 
                    here in separate boxes. They will 
                    now be resealed and...

                          (thinking it through)
                    Which means the traitor had to be 
                    at this table.

                    Leave it to the experts, Hannay. 

      HANNAY looks over to an ashtray. Several cigarette boxes. 
    In front of the seat along with an empty glass is an empty 
      packet of Zubancigarettes. HANNAY picks it up, looks at 
    it, thinking...

                    Who was sitting here?

                    Uncle George.

                          (furious)
                    You honestly think Uncle George 
                    would let the Professor kill me? 
                    He loves me. He came looking for *
                    me.*

                                  HANNAY
                          (thinking it through)*
                    Suppose your Uncle was at Long *
                    Keep when we arrived. He hears*
                    the Professor threaten you. How *
                    could hejust slip away quietly?*

                    Warnsthe Professor and his thugs *
                    - If anything were to happen to 
                    her...I don t know what I d do.

                                  VICTORIA
                    That s absurd. Uncle George has *
                    been a father to me, Hannay.                         *

                                  HANNAY
                          (to console her)
                    I understand how hard this is. 
                    And when we talked last night he 
                    did seem genuinely... 

                                  KELL
                    You spoke to Sir George...?

                    I told him all I knew. He said 
                    he d pass it on to you...

                    Sir George left this room with

                    I ll have him followed. As long 
                    as he doesn t suspect we have a

                                  HANNAY

                                  VICTORIA
                    Forget Me Not. Not. It isn t just 
                    an oubliette. 
                          (confused)
                    I don t understand. We were in 
                    the oubliette. There s the tunnel 
                    we used. But that only leads 
                    inland a little, hardly a secret 
                    escape route.

      HANNAY is walking around the table. Thinking. He sees a jug 
    of milk on the table.

                                  HANNAY
                    Scudder was right about 
                    everything else. He gave his 
                    life....
                          (remembering)
                    He and I had breakfast. He did 
                      something...I remember thinking..

                                  VICTORIA
                    What? What did he do?

      HANNAY looks at the glasses, the teapots, the milk jugs. He 
      stops. Looks at a the milk jug then POW.

      Flashback

      HANNAY s kitchen - SCUDDER holding the jug of milk. He is 
      sucking his right forefinger. He drops his hand quickly. 
      Puts the jug down.

                    He used the milk to write 
                    something. Where s the notebook? 

      KELL pulls the notebook out of his inside pocket. He hands 
    it to HANNAY. He and VICTORIA rush over to a gas light on a 
      table. HANNAY opens the notebook at the first empty page. 
    He holds it over the heat. The two watch as writing is 
      suddenly revealed on the page - 39 STEPS.

                    hidden in the oubliette, there 
                    must be thirty nine steps.


      HANNAY and VICTORIA look at each other and head for the 
      door.

      They turn and look at each other.

                                  HANNAY
                    At least you re only a spy and 
                    not a suffragette.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Actually I m a spy and a

    The oil lamp is lit. HANNAY and VICTORIA approach the blown 
    off door of the oubliette. All is darkness. They step 
      through the door. HANNAY raises the light. It gives off a 
      little light into the room. They look around and - the door 
    to the walk in store room is open.

      HANNAY and VICTORIA look to each other then move towards

      VICTORIA and HANNAY emergeout of a tunnel into daylight on *
    the steps. They see the PROFESSOR standing on the *
      shoreline. With him, ACKERMAN and ENGEL. In the water a *
      large rowing boat. By it the 2 accomplices. A jetty runs *
    out into the water. Facing the PROFESSOR at a distance is *

    and HANNAY exchange a look.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.88.

                    If Germany were to become great - *
                    sacrifices had to be made. We *

                    Get into the boat, please.*

      GEORGE hesitates. The sound of a gun cocking. ACKERMAN has *
      a gun pointed at him.*

                                  GEORGE*
                    I die and the naval plans go with *

                    You have no choice now, George. *

      GEORGE turns and sees VICTORIA and HANNAY. The 2 *
      accomplices get into the boat. ACKERMAN and ENGEL start 
      firing toward VICTORIA and HANNAY. VICTORIA returns fire. 
      GEORGE and the PROFESSOR crouch down to escape the bullets.

      HANNAY and VICTORIA hunker down behind two mooring pillars *
      about three feet high and two feet wide. Dodging bullets as 
      they ricochet around them. VICTORIA points her gun towards 
      GEORGE.

                    I would expect nothing less. 

      Then from the middle of the Loch a terrible sound. Waves 
      start to roll on to the shore. The large rowing boat begins 
    to move from side to side. And out of the water rises up - 
      a German U boat. 

                                  HANNAY
                    My god, it s one of theirs. 

                                  PROFESSOR
                          (to GEORGE)
                    Come on George, the U boat can t 
                    wait. 

      It s as if this has woken GEORGE up. He starts to run 
      towards water and the PROFESSOR.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.89.


    The men on the boat hold it steady as, ACKERMAN and ENGEL 
      fire towards HANNAY and VICTORIA. VICTORIA takes aim, down 
    her sights - GEORGE. She hesitates for a moment. HANNAY 
      sees this. 

                                  HANNAY
                          (to VICTORIA)
                    Don t shoot. I ll get him.

      HANNAY gets up and sprints at speed after GEORGE, dodging 
      bullets as he does. 

    The PROFESSOR starts wading out to the boat, GEORGE 
      following. Both ACKERMAN and ENGEL are firing towards 
      VICTORIA and HANNAY.

      ACKERMAN has VICTORIA in his sights. She fires first and 
      hits him. ACKERMAN falls back on the shoreline. 

    The PROFESSOR getting into the rowing boat. GEORGE is 
      heading towards it. Covered by ENGEL s firing. HANNAY 
      dodging in and out of the bullets, VICTORIA engaging ENGEL.

                                  PROFESSOR
                    You can make it, George. 

      Then - HANNAY with a sprint, throws himself onto GEORGE 
      knocking him on to the shallows. 

      HANNAY and GEORGE wrestling in the water. A fierce fight. 
    The rowing boat has moved out a little and is now holding 
    its position. VICTORIA is reloading her gun at speed.

      HANNAY and GEORGE struggle in the water, ENGEL has his gun 
      aimed at HANNAY. 

                                    PROFESSOR(cont d)
                          (to ENGEL)
                    Don t hit, Sir George.

      ENGEL peppering the water around HANNAY with bullets. 

      HANNAY punches GEORGE on the jaw. GEORGE falls back 
      unconscious, HANNAY drags him up. ENGEL aims at HANNAY and 
      VICTORIA fires. ENGEL falls back dead. HANNAY is dragging 
      GEORGE out of the water. VICTORIA helps him haul GEORGE up 
    on to the beach.  

                                  VICTORIA
                    Why?

                                  GEORGE
                    The glory days of the British 
                    Empire are over. The Deutsches*
                    Reich, that s the future, *
                    Victoria.*

    In the rowing boat.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.90.


                                  PROFESSOR
                          (to the men in the boat)
                    Row. Row. 

    The 2 accomplices in the rowing boat start rowing towards 
    the U boat. HANNAY takes the gun from the dead ENGEL and he 
    and VICTORIA start firing at the rowing boat as they run to 
    the jetty. The 2 accomplices are hit. Suddenly the sound of 
    the U-boat engine. Tides of water. HANNAY and VICTORIA look 
      over to see the U-boat diving. 

                                    PROFESSOR(cont d)
                          (to the disappearing U 
                          boat)
                    No.

    The U boat disappears from sight. The PROFESSOR turns to 
    see VICTORIA and HANNAY standing on the jetty. Their guns 
      pointing at him. A moment then the PROFESSOR raises his 
      hands.


      EXT. SHORELINE. DAY. DAY 5124124

      HANNAY sits on the jetty. VICTORIA sits next to him. The 
      guns by their sides. (In background GEORGE and the 
      PROFESSOR being taken at up the steps by KELL and the 
      VICAR.) VICTORIA tears at HANNAY s shirt sleeve. The bullet 
      graze on his arm.

                                  HANNAY
                    It s nothing.

      A moment then - 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Thank you. I m not sure I could 
                    have shot him.

      They look at each other. Then they move in and kiss. They 
      break away  - HANNAY looks at her.

                                  HANNAY
                    When we return to London I intend 
                    to woo you. Flowers, dinner, 
                    dancing, followed by a passionate 
                    lecture on the enfranchisement of 
                    women. What do you say?

      A moment then VICTORIA smiles - 

      Suddenly the sound of a shot. VICTORIA is knocked sideways 
      into the water. On the shore, ACKERMAN is raised on one 
      arm, his gun in his hand. HANNAY grabs ENGEL s gun by his 
      side, fires and ACKERMAN falls back.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.91.


      HANNAY sees VICTORIA disappearing into the Loch, a trail of 
      blood dis-colouringthe water, HANNAY dives in after her.


      EXT.SHORELINE. DAY. DAY 5125125

      HANNAY sits on his ownon the jetty, a blanket on his 
      shoulders looking out over the Loch. KELL and the VICAR 
      come and sit down either side of him.

                                  VICAR
                    It s a deep loch, she could be 
                    anywhere. 

                                  KELL
                    I m sorry, Hannay.


      INT. ST PANCRAS STATION. DAY.126126

      OCTOBER 9th 1914. The station is busy, a unit of soldiers 
    in uniform with their kit bags march in. Families saying 
      emotional good-byes to their men as - 

                                  HANNAY (V.O.)
                    On August 4th Germany invaded 
                    Belgium. Great Britain had no 
                    choice but to declare war. 
                    Victoria and I may have helped 
                    save the country from invasion 
                    but not from conflict.

      HANNAY comes into the station at speed. He is in the 
      uniform of a Captain of the Grenadier Guards. He has a note 
    in his hand. 

      HANNAY goes to the large clock looking down on the station. 
    And looks up at it - 12 o clock. He checks the note in his 
      hand nervously. The notes simply reads - Under the clock at 
      StPancras, 12 pm.HANNAY looks around, scanning the crowd. 
      It s obvious from his quizzical expression he s not sure 
    who he s going to meet.  

      A hand taps him on the shoulder. HANNAY spins round. And 
      standing in front of him is HARRY, also in uniform. For a 
      moment HANNAY s face falls. (Deep down he had hoped for a 
      miracle and VICTORIA.) Then HANNAY smiles with genuine 
      friendship.

                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                    Harry. Good to see you.

      HANNAY thrusts out his hand.       The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.92.


                                    HANNAY(cont d)
                          (with solicitude 
                            thinking of Victoria)
                    How are you?

      HARRY takes HANNAY s hand and shakes it.

                                  HARRY
                    Fine.
                          (attempting to clarify 
                            matters)
                    It isn t me. Well of course, it 
                    isme but...
                          (quiet)
                    Victoria wanted to say goodbye.

      HARRY drops HANNAY s hand. HANNAY s face is one of sadness 
    and concern. Is this HARRY s idea of a message from the 
      grave?

      Then HARRY looks out across the crowd. HANNAY, puzzled, 
      follows his look. For a moment all he can see are jostling 
      strangers. Then standing by a wall he spots, looking 
      directly at him - VICTORIA. HANNAY s shocked face as he 
      takes that in. He is about to move forward when HARRY puts 
      a hand on his arm.

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                          (confidential)
                    Top secret, old man.

      HANNAY stops. He looks at HARRY.

                                    HARRY(cont d)
                          (quietly)
                    She ll see you after the war, 
                    Hannay.

      HANNAY looks back to VICTORIA. She smiles at him. A moment 
      then he smiles back. They stare at each other.

      Then a large trolley of luggage comes between them blocking 
      VICTORIA from view. It passes and - VICTORIA has 
      disappeared. HANNAY turns to look at HARRY. HARRY smiles 
      apologetically, then turns and walks away. HANNAY looks 
      back to where VICTORIA had stood, savouringthe 
      extraordinary knowledge that VICTORIA is alive. A moment 
      then he turns and walks away.

      HANNAY s eye is caught by a news board - BELGIUM FALLS TO 
      GERMAN TROOPS.

                                  HANNAY
                          (quietly to himself, un-
                            convinced)
                    Over by Christmas then.      The 39 STEPS SHOOTING SCRIPT  BLUE PAGES08/09/08 P.93.
