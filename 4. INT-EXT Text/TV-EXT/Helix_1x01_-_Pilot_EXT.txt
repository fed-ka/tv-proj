      Farragut storms towards his car. Walker follows.

                                  FARRAGUT
                    You sat there saying nothing. You 
                    owe me more than that. 

      Walker s face - I owe you?

                                  FARRAGUT (CONT D)
                    I was set up.

                                  WALKER
                    Set up how? They came to you 
                    because he s family -

                                  FARRAGUT
                    Fort Bragg doesn t operate on 
                    courtesy. They came to me because -

                                  WALKER
                    You re the best? 
                          (then)
                    Don t flatter yourself. I could do 
                    this on my own.

                                  FARRAGUT
                    Then do. Because I m not going. 

      Walker grabs him by the arm. 

                                  WALKER
                    I know you re upset. I also know 
                    you want togo. 

      The two stare at each other - and we know Walker s right. 
      Farragut shakes her off, gets into an old Volvo, and drives 
      off. 



      Farragut sits with his wife on a porch swing. She s curled up 
      against him, trying to act braver than she actually feels, as 
      they rock back and forth.

                                  FARRAGUT
                      I don thave to go. 

                                  MARGARET
                    He s your brother.

                                  FARRAGUT
                    But we hadn t even spoken in twenty 
                    years. The guy didn t even come to 
                    our wedding.

                                  MARGARET
                    Youalmost didn t come to our 
                    wedding. 

      For a brief moment, both laugh. These two have a long 
      history. She takes his hand.

                                  MARGARET (CONT D)
                    I ll be fine.

                                  FARRAGUT
                    You deserve better than this. I 
                    keep saying that but -

                                  MARGARET
                    One last case isn t going to kill 
                    us. 

      Margaret immediately regrets her choice of words, buries her 
      head into him.

                                  FARRAGUT
                      I don thave to go.                                                                                    11.


                                  MARGARET
                    - but you should. You know you 
                    should.

      More silence.

                                  FARRAGUT
                    You re the only family that matters 
                    to me. 

                                  MARGARET
                    You re the only family that s ever
                    mattered to me. 

      She wraps up against him even tighter. Then - 

                                  MARGARET (CONT D)
                    When do you leave?

      Farragut starts to answer, then stops. Runs his hand through 
      her hair. And she, knowing him all too well -

                                  MARGARET (CONT D)
                    There s a car waiting outside, 
                    isn t there?

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:



      The helicopter touches down and our foursome are immediately 
      greeted by Pederson and Hataki. Now without their suits on -

      Pederson is beyond huge. He could play football for the Jets. 
      Hataki, meanwhile, is extremely handsome, with sharp features 
      and deep eyes - the Japanese George Clooney. 

      Both men are clearly unhappy to have visitors. Pederson steps 
      forward. 

                                  PEDERSON
                    Colonel Frank Pederson, Army 
                      Procurement.

      Pederson and Balleseros salute one another. 

                                  PEDERSON (CONT D)
                    Sorry there s no red carpet, but we 
                    didn t know you were coming till an 
                    hour ago. We re not really used to 
                    having guests. 

                                  FARRAGUT
                    Well here we are. 

                                  HATAKI
                    Hiroshi Hataki. Roland 
                      Pharmaceuticals. 

      Farragut and Walker exchange a look. 

                                  HATAKI (CONT D)
                    Both the deceased and the surviving 
                    patient are sequestered inside. 
                    Follow me.   

      Suddenly, the helicopter starts to lift off. Walker spins, 
      concerned.

                                  PEDERSON
                    It s too cold to keep the copter 
                    stationed here. Besides -

      Pederson gestures to black SIGNS in several languages marking 
      the facility as a QUARANTINED RESEARCH AREA.

                                  PEDERSON (CONT D)
                    - we don t need the pilots any more 
                    spooked than they are already. Camp 
                      Eisenhower is just forty miles 
                    south. They can be here at a half 
                    hours notice.                                                                                    15.


      All six start approaching the entrance, but Jordan can t take 
      her eyes off the signs. 

                                  WALKER
                          (quietly to Farragut)
                    Big pharma working with the 
                    military?

      Hataki, thirty feet awaybut still overhearing her -


                                  HATAKI
                    We ll tell you everything inside.

      From Walker s now creeped out face, we seriously doubt this.



      Balleseros, now dressed in snow gear, follows Pederson along 
      the outside wall. The place truly is a fortress, with no 
      views inside save the evenly spaced three-inch metallic glass 
      windows every ten meters. 

      And inside those windows - long empty hallways that appear to 
      have been abandoned for years. It makes no sense and it s 
      scary as shit. Balleseros turns away and looks up, sees huge 
      CLOUDS forming, but says nothing. Pederson sees his face.

                                  PEDERSON
                    Weather here changes every few 
                    hours. It s nothing.                                                                                     34.


      They keep walking, Balleseros s eyes warily alternating 
      between Pederson, the integrity of the walls, and the vast 
      tundra behind him. The stark white landscape is disorienting. 

                                  PEDERSON (CONT D)
                    We have a saying up here, staring 
                    is scary. Keep your eyes in front 
                    of you. You get lost, you re dead 
                    in twenty minutes.

      They round another corner, and arrive at the EXIT DUCT. As 
      described, it leads to an enormous disease REFUSE TANK 
      surrounded by BARBED WIRE.

                                    BALLESEROS
                    Worried about thieves? 

                                  PEDERSON
                    No one s that stupid. Damn bears.

      Balleseros looks again, suspicious. Even we think wires don t 
      seem like the right kind of deterrent for twelve hundred 
      pound polar bears. 

      Balleseros pulls out a METAK gauge gun and examines the duct. 
      It s a complicated piece of engineering, but it looks fine. 
      He moves around to examine the other side when he sees -

      A COPPER TUBE, two feet in diameter, leading into the ground.

                                    BALLESEROS
                    What the hell is that?

                                  PEDERSON
                    Plumbing. What did you think we did 
                    with the shit?

      Balleseros walks closer, kicks at the surface ice around the 
      pipe where it enters the ice pack, slowly clearing a view.

                                    BALLESEROS
                    I thought the sewage pipe empties 
                    into the north side. Map J. 

      Pederson s impressed, and wary, of this guy s memory.

                                  PEDERSON
                    Right. But that s for human waste. 

      Balleseros gets down on his knees and scrapes away the 
      surface snow entirely. And that s when he sees it - through 
      three feet of ice, the water below is BROWN.                                                                                    35.


                                  PEDERSON (CONT D)
                    This here s for the monkeys.

      Balleseros looks up, alarmed. 



      Walker slowly enters the hallway, looking up, down, 
      everywhere. She takes a left, moving slowly, waiting for the 
      noise again. 

      But the slower she walks, the longer the hallway starts to 
      seem, and the softer she moves, the quieter. Impossibly long. 
      Impossibly silent. 

      This is her first time moving alone through the complex. And 
      alone, this place is a hundred times creepier.                                                                                     49.


      Walker looks behind her again. Nothing. Above her. Nothing. 
      Below her - her own feet on the oddly dim floor. And then -

      A STRANGE SHADOW FROM ABOVE. She starts up, begins to SWING 
      her arm defensively when -

      She sees Farragut. Standing there with a note pad. Silent. 

                                  FARRAGUT
                    I guess we re both scaring each 
                    other today.

      He sees her balled up fist, ready to strike, and smiles.

                                  FARRAGUT (CONT D)
                      Everything okay?

      Walker catches her breath, shakes her head yes.

      Above them, in the FAR distance, the ever so slight sound of 
      the beginning of a THUNDER STORM.

                                  FARRAGUT (CONT D)
                    Good. Because Jordan s found 
                      something. 



      He s outside. The storm is getting crazier and crazier. He 
      can barely breath. But then, he sees it -

      Literally THOUSANDS of MONKEYS, as far as the EYE CAN SEE, 
      FROZEN in the snow. Caught in the act of...escaping? 

      Ballerseros falls to his knees. He s never seen anything like 
      it. We ve never seen anything like it. These animals were 
      RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.

      Balleseros turns to his left, sees -

      Hataki, in full outdoor gear, staring at him. At this moment, 
      Hataki doesn t look in charge at all. 

                                    BALLESEROS
                    Dear God. 



      The MOTHER of all storms. As bad as it sounded, it s a 
      hundred times worse. Think HAIL the size of BOWLING BALLS. 
      ICE CHUNKS the size of CARS.

      It s strangely beautiful.

      And scary as hell.
