      FADE IN:

13011301EXT.  MOUNTAIN ROAD - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

      A steep, twisting road, with switchbacks, hairpin turns, and
      no room for mistakes.  Rounding a corner --

      An old DEUX CHEVAUX (2 CV) grinds slowly up the hill.  At
      the wheel, the ELDERLY DRIVER steers cautiously.  This road
      is more than his nerves can stand.  Then, in the distance,
      we HEAR the full-throated roar of exotic CAR ENGINES coming
      DOWN the mountain.

      ANGLE - FURTHER UP THE HILL

      a gleaming RED FERRARI blasts around a corner, a BLACK PORSCHE
      right on its tail.  They're driving fast and furiously -- on
      a collision course for the old car.

      RESUME - THE DEUX CHEVAUX

      As the Elderly Driver looks up to see --

      ELDERLY DRIVER'S POV - THE RACING CARS

      coming straight at him, side by side, engines roaring as
      they jockey for position.  There's only room for ONE CAR to
      pass without crashing or sailing off the mountain.

      The horrified Elderly Driver shuts his eyes and brakes hard,
      waiting for the impact.

      WIDER

      as at the last second, the PORSCHE brakes -- and the Ferrari
      SPEEDS UP, takes the lead from the Porsche, and SCREAMS PAST
      the old car with inches to spare.

      RESUME - ELDERLY DRIVER

      he opens his eyes, astonished and grateful to be alive. 
      Then he looks down at his pants -- his face falls.

                                      ELDERLY DRIVER
                    Oh, non.

      FOLLOWING THE FERRARI

      as it snarls onto a straightaway, a jagged single-note GUITAR
      starts up ala the JAMES BOND THEME.  The THEME SWELLS as the
      Ferrari shrinks in the distance.

13021302EXT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - DAY

      An elegant building on beautifully kept grounds.  The FERRARI
      wheels up beside a collection of expensive cars parked in
      front.  As the Ferrari's DRIVER slides out --

      PAN UP from a pair of beautiful leather shoes, crisp pant-
      legs, to a white-on-white shirt inside a tux.

      The driver's hands snap his CUFFS with a practiced motion,
      straighten a BOW TIE with an elegant tug.  Then camera MOVES
      UP, and we see the driver is --

      RICHIE

      playing the role of wealthy playboy to the hilt.  He turns
      as the BLACK PORSCHE rumbles into the drive, and the beautiful
      BLOND DRIVER gives him a look that suggests he's an idiot.

      Richie flashes a sardonic, patronizing Bond smile.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Don't feel bad.  I'm a pro.

      She shakes her head and roars away.  Richie turns to see the
      PARKING ATTENDANT watching him with a bemused look.  Richie
      straightens his tie, trying to recover his dignity.  He hands
      him the keys and heads for the Casino.  The Attendant rolls
      his eyes.

13031303INT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - LATER - DAY

      Posh elegance, restrained charm.  People cluster around
      various GAMING TABLES, chatting, catching drinks from passing
      waiters.  As we move through the room --

                                      VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.)
                    She caught him in bed with the
                    Countess.  Or was it the Count?
                          (beat)
                    Anyway, Polanski liked them enough
                    to put them in his next film.

      ANGLE - THE ROULETTE WHEEL

      a whirling pinwheel of blurred color, as the BALL clatters
      among the slots.  Richie is sandwiched between two svelte
      YOUNG WOMEN.  They're slapping the table in excitement.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 3. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

1303CONTINUED:1303

                                      RICHIE
                    Yes, yes!  Go!  Black 14!

      As with a final clatter, the ball comes to rest on

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Black, 14.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yes!  I win again!

      The WOMEN watch enviously as the Dealer shoves a large pile
      of CHIPS across to Richie.  Richie flips one to the Dealer.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Albert?  Save my place.
                          (airily)
                    This calls for champagne.

      Leaving the chips, he wades into the crowd to snag a champagne
      flute from a tray.  He turns, and bumps into --

      MARINA LEMARTIN

      spilling his drink and hers.  She's beautiful, twenties,
      clad in an elegant sleeveless black number that barely avoided
      being drenched.  Richie is mortified.

                                      RICHIE
                    Oh, man, I'm sorry...

      She watches, bemused, as he flounders, dabs at her dress
      with a napkin -- making an awkward situation worse.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                          (halting French)
                    Pardon, pardonnez moi... je suis
                    tres, tres... what's the word?

                                      MARINA
                          (teasing)
                    Clumsy?  A klutz, perhaps?
                          (a smile)
                    Don't worry.  No harm done.

                                      RICHIE
                          (relieved)
                    You speak English.

                                      MARINA
                          (a smile)
                    Yes.  At least I think so.
                          (extending her hand)
                    Marina LeMartin.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 4. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

1303CONTINUED: (2)1303

                                      RICHIE
                          (smitten)
                    I'm Richie...
                          (catches himself)
                    Uh, Richard.  Richard Redstone.

                                      MARINA
                    Do you come here often, Mr. Redstone?

                                      RICHIE
                          (airily)
                    Only when the Mirage needs servicing.

                                      MARINA
                          (impressed)
                    Really.  You own a plane?

      She glances past Richie at EDOUARD CEVICHE: dark, late
      twenties, slightly shifty looking, in a waiter's jacket. 
      Edouard catches her glance and nods slightly.  Edouard grabs
      a couple of glasses of champagne from the bar.

      CLOSE - THE DRINKS

      Edouard DROPS something in one of the champagne flute.

                                      RICHIE
                    Just a little one.  The company jet.

      Edouard hands the drinks to Richie and Marina.  Richie is so
      engrossed in impressing Marina, he's oblivious.

                                      MARINA
                    Perhaps I've heard of your company?

      Richie turns back to the roulette table.  Thinking fast, he
      sees a pack of MATCHES on it.

                                      RICHIE
                    Ah... Match-Tech.  It's new...
                      Computers, modems, that sort of stuff.

      The DEALER clears his throat.

                                      MARINA
                    I think he wants you to bet.

      Richie realizes he's holding up the play, decides to impress
      Marina.  He pushes all his chips to the black.

                                      RICHIE
                          (to Dealer)
                    Let it ride on black.

      He winks at Marina, as the ball bounces, rolls --


                                                                (CONTINUED)96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 5. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

1303CONTINUED: (3)1303

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, black... c'mon...

      -- and comes up --

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Red, four.

                                      RICHIE
                          (repeats weakly)
                    Red four.

      Richie loses.  His face goes blank as he gulps the champagne.

                                      MARINA
                    All that money gone.

                                      RICHIE
                          (with faint bravado)
                    Pocket change.

                                      MARINA
                            (sympathetically)
                    You want to try again?

      Richie tries to compose himself, waves dismissively.

                                      RICHIE
                    No, I think I'm done.

      He puts a hand to his head -- he's feeling a little odd.

                                      MARINA
                    Something wrong?

                                      RICHIE
                    I just need a little air.

                                      MARINA
                    Why don't we go for a drive?
                          (coy)
                    You can tell me all about your
                    company.

      She bats her eyes, her tone suggestive in a sophisticated
      way.  Richie drains his champagne.

13041304EXT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - DAY

      The PARKING ATTENDANT closes the Ferrari door for Marina. 
      She's behind the wheel, Richie in the passenger seat,
      definitely feeling woozy.  He's slurring slightly.

                                      RICHIE
                    I really can drive.

                                      MARINA
                    I insist.

      Marina pulls out with a wild lurch, spinning the tires.  As
      they fishtail out of the drive --

                                      RICHIE (O.S.)
                    Okay.  Jus' watch out for a blonde
                    inna black Porsche.

13051305EXT.  MOUNTAIN ROAD - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

      Marina pulls the Ferrari into a roadside stop.  Richie is
      blinking, struggling to keep his eyes open.

                                      RICHIE
                    Why we stopping here?

                                      MARINA
                    Because I thought you might want to.

      Richie straightens into a semblance of sexy charm.

                                      RICHIE
                    Good idea.  'S perfect....
                          (earnest)
                    And so are you, Marina... You're
                    perfect.

      He leans toward her, aiming for a kiss -- just as Marina
      slips OUT.  Richie flops into the vacant seat.

      Richie straightens, to see EDOUARD standing beside Marina. 
      Richie bridles, staggers from the car.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you're the waiter guy.

                                      EDOUARD
                    So?

                                      RICHIE
                    We'll have another.

      Richie steps forward -- and falls flat on his face.

                                      MARINA
                          (dismayed)
                    How much did you give him?

                                      EDOUARD
                          (shrugs)
                    One dose.  Fifty milligrams.  Like
                    the farmer said.

                          (beat)
                    Edward, that's the dose for a horse.

      Edouard shrugs and takes the driver's seat.  Marina sits by
      Richie.  Richie sinks into a warm, fuzzy world.

                                      RICHIE
                    Where we goin'?

                    Good.  Wake me up when we get there.

      His head slides down onto Maria's chest.  Edouard glares at
      him, annoyed.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Does he have to do that?

                                      MARINA
                    He's unconscious.

                    He's American.  They have a ridiculous
                    obsession with breasts.

                                      MARINA
                    Edward?  Just shut up and drive.
                          (beat)
                    We got our millionaire.

      She gives him a triumphant look.  The Ferrari pulls onto the
      road, with the kidnapped Richie inside --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

13071307EXT.  ANY STREET - DAY

      MacLeod is coming out of a shop with a few groceries --
      baguette, bottle of wine.  He reacts to the sight of

      HIS CITROEN

      Being hooked up to a TOW TRUCK.

      MACLEOD

      rushes over, waving at the TOW DRIVER.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Hey!  Hey!  Stop!
                          (trying French)
                    Arrette!

      The Driver looks over to JAMES FOULARD, forties, a humorless
      man in a suit, carrying a small notebook.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (to Foulard)
                    What's going on here?

                                      FOULARD
                    James Foulard, Mr. MacLeod.
                          (to the Driver)
                    Go ahead.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But that's my car!

                                      FOULARD
                    You will get your car back when I
                    get mine.

      He slaps an official-looking document against MacLeod's chest.

                                      FOULARD (CONT'D)
                    See you in court.

      MacLeod fumbles to look over the court order.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What the hell is this about?

                                      FOULARD
                    Don't play with me.  I want my
                    Ferrari.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What Ferrari?

                                      FOULARD
                    Your name and address were given as
                    security.

                                      MACLEOD
                    By who?

                                      FOULARD
                    A young American.  He took it from
                    my dealership for a test drive...
                    and it has not come back.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And he gave you my address?  That's
                    all?

                                      FOULARD
                    He left this.

      He takes a PASSPORT from his suit, holds it out.  MacLeod
      takes it and glances at it --

      INSERT - THE OPEN PASSPORT

      the name is "Richard Redstone," but the photo is RICHIE.

      MacLeod reacts to the face.

                                      FOULARD (CONT'D)
                    So you know him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who doesn't know Red Richovich?

                                      FOULARD
                    Who?  It says here his name is
                    Redstone.

      MacLeod looks around to make sure no one is listening, then
      speaks in hushed tones.

                                      MACLEOD
                    An alias.  Richovich is a hired killer
                    for the Russian Mafia.  One of the
                    most dangerous men in Europe.  Do
                    you know where he is now?

1307CONTINUED: (2)1307

                                      FOULARD
                    He was last seen at Casino Montecour
                      yesterday.  Since that... nothing.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re the paper work)
                    So you took it to the police.

                                      FOULARD
                    Of course.

      MacLeod nods sympathetically, puts an arm over his shoulder
      as he steers him out of the Driver's earshot.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Have you sufficient life insurance?
                          (beat)
                    You know what they do to informants.

                                      FOULARD
                    I do?

      MacLeod demonstrates as he describes the gruesome torture.

                                      MACLEOD
                    First they take these large fish
                    hooks and they put them in your nose. 
                    Then they pull them behind your head
                    to expose Your Adam's apple.  Then
                    they bring out the leeches and then...
                    trust me, you don't want to hear the
                    rest.

                                      FOULARD
                    I don't?

      With a significant look at the innocent-looking Driver:

                                      MACLEOD
                    They say they have people...
                      everywhere.

      Foulard pales visibly.

                                      FOULARD
                    What do I do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tell the police it was a mistake. 
                    I'll see what I can do about the
                    car.

                                      FOULARD
                    I'll be forever grateful.

                          the Citroen)
                    Unhook it.
                          (off the Driver's
                            hesitation)
                    Unhook it, I tell you.  Idiot, you
                    have the wrong car!

      Foulard hurriedly gets in his own car as the Driver starts
      to unhook the Citroen.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Have a nice day.

      Foulard takes off.  MacLeod turns back as the Driver lowers
      his car back to the pavement.  The Citroen sinks alarmingly
      on one side, the tire flat from the hookup.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Richie.  This better be good.

13081308EXT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - DAY - ESTABLISHING

      A beautiful chateau, seemingly deserted.  The red Ferrari is
      parked in the drive.  OVER, we hear a loud GROAN.

13091309INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - BEDROOM - DAY

      A grand room, with a sumptuous elegance that has been let go
      a little.  Decorated with beautiful period furniture, the
      prominent feature is a large, four-poster CANOPY BED with
      velvet hangings.  Lying on it, minus his jacket --

      Richie, just regaining consciousness.  He shakes his head,
      tries to sit up -- but he can't move his wrists.  He looks --
      they're HANDCUFFED to the heavy wooden bed posters.  He yanks
      at the cuffs in frustration --

                                      MARINA (O.S.)
                    Please don't.  It scratches the wood.

      Marina enters with a water jug and a glass.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    Besides, you'll hurt your wrists.

      She smiles, more like a shy hostess than a kidnapper as she
      pours a glass of water for him, holds it out.

                                      RICHIE
                    No thanks.

                          (tight)
                    Last time I had a drink with a girl,
                    I woke up handcuffed to a strange
                    bed.

      She sighs, puts the glass aside, anxious to please him.

                                      MARINA
                    Are you cold?  I could get a blanket. 
                    Maybe a couple of pillows.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm fine.  Nice bed, lots of
                      atmosphere... what more could I ask
                    for?

                                      MARINA
                    You don't have to be sarcastic. 
                    This is the best room in the chateau.

                                      RICHIE
                          (more sarcasm)
                    Excuse me, I forgot my manners.
                          (exploding)
                    Lady, you kidnapped me!

      She stands and moves around the room.

                                      MARINA
                    Don't yell at me... please.
                          (beat)
                    All we need is two-hundred thousand
                    francs.

      She smiles, as if that makes it reasonable.

                                      RICHIE
                    You're joking.  This is a joke, right?

                                      MARINA
                    This chateau has been in my family
                    for three hundred years.  Without
                    that money, it's gone... It can't be
                    gone.
                          (a plea)
                    You have to help us... Please, Mr.
                    Redstone.  Two-hundred thousand is
                    nothing to someone like you.

      She's heartfelt.  Richie feels a twinge of compassion.

                                      RICHIE
                    Don't you have some rich relatives
                    hidden away somewhere?

                      Grandfather was hopeless with money.

                    He had to take out a loan against
                    the chateau to pay our bills... now
                    the loan is due.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, I hate to break the news...
                    but this isn't gonna work.

                    Of course it will.  It has to.

      She starts for the door.

      He rattles the cuffs uselessly, and OFF his look --

      MacLeod pulls up in the Citroen.  He looks older: a little
      grey on the temples, glasses -- he has aged a graceful twenty
      years.

      A PARKING ATTENDANT approaches the window.  MacLeod looks in
      the car mirror, checking his altered look.  As CAMERA PUSHES
      into the mirror --

                    Just trying to show you a good time.

      PULL BACK as MacLeod's beautiful girlfriend DESIREE checks
      her face in the bike's mirror, while MacLeod hauls his big
      MOTO GUZZI onto the kickstand.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Desiree, the tables are
                    waiting.

                                      DESIREE
                          (reproving)
                    Duncan, you're a madman.  Three
                    hundred miles in three hours? Look
                    at my hair.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (smiles)
                    Desiree, no matter what you do, you're
                    still going to be beautiful.

      He pulls her away from the mirror and they head for the
      Casino, passing a brace of racy cars and bikes.

13121312INT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - 1978 - NIGHT

      Looking much as in the present.  The people and the clothes
      haven't changed much: tuxedos, a few long-hairs and sideburns,
      but the champagne is still flowing.

      ANGLE - THE CHEMIN DE FER TABLE

      MacLeod, changed into an elegant tux, is playing opposite a
        good-looking Englishman, JAMES.  Desiree, spilling from a
      low-cut dress, hangs on MacLeod's arm.  MacLeod is losing. 
      There are two others at the table.  Young manager CARLO
      CAPIDIMONTE watches the table for the house.  The Englishman
      deals the cards.

                                      CARLO
                    Neuf a la banc.
                          (beat)
                    I'm sorry, Monsieur MacLeod.

      He shovels the chips across the table to the Englishman.

                                      DESIREE
                          (pouting)
                    I'm sorry, Duncan.  I'm not bringing
                    you any luck tonight.

      MacLeod smiles, murmurs in her ear.

                    Why don't you let me be the judge of
                    that... later.

                                      JAMES
                    Bad luck, old man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Perhaps tomorrow it will change.

                                      JAMES
                    But not against me.  I'm off to work.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Say hello to "M" for me.

      MacLeod slides his remaining chips to Desiree.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Here, see what you can do.  I'm going
                    to get us a drink.

      As he stands, James calls to him.

                                      JAMES
                    If you don't mind, old man?  Martini. 
                    Shaken... not stirred.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Naturally.
                          (aside, to Desiree)
                    I bet he can't tell the difference.

      As he moves away to get the drinks, we PUSH IN on Desiree's
      small pile of chips --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      THE SAME PILE rests before Desiree, but it has grown
      enormously.  She's on a winning streak, and a crowd of
      KIBITZERS watches the show as MacLeod looks on, bored.

                                      CARLO
                    Et bien.  Madame wins again.

      Desiree claps in excitement.

                                      DESIREE
                    Duncan, can you believe it?  The
                    first time I ever played!

                    I mean, that's terrific.

      He looks at his watch, taps it.

      BARON LEMARTIN, the Casino's owner, a graceful, pleasant man
      of fifty, approaches, smiles benevolently at the scene. 
      Beside him, Carlo frowns.

                                      CARLO
                          (sotto voce)
                    It's not good for the house, Baron.

                          (gently reproving)
                    Carlo, my ambitious friend.  A
                    beautiful woman is happy, and that
                    is always good for the house.

                    Money isn't everything.

      RESUME - MACLEOD AND DESIREE

      Desiree is growing nervous.

                                      DESIREE
                    Duncan... what if I lose?

                                      MACLEOD
                    If you're worried, stop playing.

                                      DESIREE
                          (eyeing the bank)
                    But I could win.  Tell me what to
                    do.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let it ride.

                                      DESIREE
                    Easy for you to say.

      She nods at Carlo but grabs MacLeod s hand for support, biting
      her lip in growing tension as Carlo turns the cards...

                                      CARLO
                    Neuf a la banc.
                          (beat)
                    Madame wins.

      Desiree WHOOPS in delight throws herself in MacLeod's lap
      and kisses him as Carlo pushes the chips to Desiree.  It's a
      staggering amount of money.

                    You should play cards more often.

                                      DESIREE
                    Enough excitement for one night.
                          (giving him a look)
                    At least here in the Casino.

      MacLeod smiles.  As they rise from the table, Carlo moves
      toward them.

                                      CARLO
                    Perhaps madame wishes to leave her
                    winnings in the casino safe... ?

                                      DESIREE
                    No, madame wishes to take it with
                    her now.  In cash.

                                      CARLO
                    Cash?  A million francs?

      Desiree kisses MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You heard the lady, Carlo.

                    As Madame wishes.

13131313INT.  HOTEL ROOM - 1978 - LATER - NIGHT

      The hotel room is old, gorgeously appointed.  Desiree is
      spinning in the center of the room in wonder clutching
      handfuls of 500 Franc notes from a large pile on the table.

                                      DESIREE
                    Duncan?  Is this is how rich people
                    live all the time?

      MacLeod approaches carrying flutes of champagne.  As he hands
      her one --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not if they want to stay rich.
                          (a smile)
                    You didn't have to order the most
                    expensive suite in the hotel.

                                      DESIREE
                    But I wanted to.
                          (teasing)
                    Besides, I like it.  For once, I'm
                    the one with the money.

      She moves in close, runs her hands over his chest.

                                      DESIREE (CONT'D)
                    And I can be very generous to those
                    who bring me pleasure.

                    You think I'm some gigolo you can
                    have for a few thousand francs?

                                      DESIREE
                    No, a million francs.

      She tucks a handful of money down his shirt.

                                      DESIREE (CONT'D)
                    What would this buy me?  Your neck?

                          (beat)
                    Your mouth, perhaps?

      She kisses each part in turn.  MacLeod is aroused, moves to
      kiss her back, but she pulls teasingly away.

                                      DESIREE
                    Ah, ah, ah... I'm not free.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then I'm in trouble.  I haven't got
                    a centime on me.

                                      DESIREE
                    I'm sure you'll think of something.

      MacLeod smiles, holds up his wrist, revealing a distinctive,
      expensive WATCH (a BREITLING, etc.).  He slips it off and
      drops it on the table.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What will this buy me?
                          (moving in)
                    This mouth?  This neck?  Maybe this
                    throat...

      She throws back her head as his lips caress her throat.

                                      DESIREE
                            (breathless)
                    I'm very expensive.  At least a
                    shirt...

      She pulls his shirt down, revealing his chest, kissing him
      all the while.  He rips the top of her gown, the spaghetti
      straps break.  They're both feeling the heat of building
      passion.

                    loan.

                    Good.  Let's break the bank.

      She scoops up cash from the table, tosses it onto the bed,
      making a carpet of cash, and shoves MacLeod onto it, following
      him.  They're pulling at each other's clothes in eager
      passion, money and clothing flying in the air.

      She's on top of him, pulling at his clothes --

      ANGLE - THE DOOR

      as it SLAMS OPEN, and a MASKED GUNMAN stands there.

      MacLeod and Desiree break apart, Desiree holding two wads of
      CASH to cover her breasts.  MacLeod looks at the Gunman,
      then back to Desiree.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did you order room service?

      He throws a bag before them.

                    Okay, okay, now we all stay very
                    calm.

      MacLeod slides off the bed and stuffs a wad of bills in the
      bag.

      Desiree leaps up, pulling up her dress, and yanks the money
      out again.

                                      DESIREE
                    Never!  Duncan won't let you!

      The Gunman points his gun at MacLeod.

                                      GUNMAN
                    I'll shoot him.

                    Fine.  I'll shoot both of you.

      MacLeod grabs her.  He speaks in a gentle voice through
      gritted teeth.

                    No, you can't!

      MacLeod holds onto Desiree as the Gunman scoops money into
      the bag, then grabs MacLeod's WATCH off the table for good
      measure.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not the watch...

                    Don't you start.
                          (backing out)
                    Follow me, and I'll shoot.

      He slams the door behind him.  Desiree rises to follow. 
      MacLeod takes her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Desiree, it's just money...

                                      DESIREE
                    My money!

                    It's not the end of the world.  We
                    still have each other.

      She grabs a blanket, wraps it around her, and heads out the
      door.  As MacLeod sits there, forlorn.

13141314INT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - THE PRESENT - DAY

      Looking much as it did in 1978.  MacLeod is idly spinning
      the roulette wheel as CARLO approaches, the Parking Attendant
      trailing behind him.  In 19 years Carlo has added weight,
      lost hair, and looks very prosperous.

                                      CARLO
                    Monsieur MacLeod!  What a pleasure! 
                    It must be twenty years!

      They shake hands warmly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Hello Carlo.  Nineteen years.

                                      CARLO
                    Look at you.  You've hardly changed.

                                      MACLEOD

                          (changing the subject)
                    Is the Baron around?

                                      CARLO
                    I'm afraid not.  The old Baron went
                      a little...
                          (he taps his head
                            significantly)
                    Most regrettable.  I had to take
                    over the Casino.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A shame.  He was a good man.

      Carlo shrugs, as if burdened against his will.

                                      CARLO
                    One does what one can.

                    How can I help you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm looking for someone.

                    Richard Redstone... he was supposed
                    to arrive here yesterday.

      Carlo turns to the Parking attendant.

                    The Baron's Granddaughter?

      Carlo tightens, tries to hide his annoyance from MacLeod.

                                      CARLO
                    I believe so.

                    Old enough.

13151315INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Marina is entering with a tray of food -- just as EDOUARD is
      rising from the bed where Richie lies, handcuffed.

      Edouard has a scowl on his face, and holds a covered CHAMBER-
      POT at arms-length.

                                      EDOUARD
                    I hate this.

                                      RICHIE
                    The feeling's mutual, pal.

      Edouard stalks out as Marina sets the tray down, lifts a
      forkfull of food to Richie's mouth.  Richie turns away.

                                      MARINA
                    Please, it's very good.  My
                      Grandfather made it himself.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, there's got to be some other
                    way.

                                      MARINA

                    He's not a criminal and he's not my

      food into his mouth.

      In the darkness, a sinister BLACK CAR pulls up quietly.  The
      door opens, and a LOW ANGLE reveals DARK BOOTS landing on
      the ground.  They start towards the Chateau.

      Richie is eating slowly, his eyes on Marina's as he chews.

                                      MARINA
                    You spilled.

      She takes a napkin, leans close to wipe his lips.  They're
      eye to eye, the attraction palpable.  He suddenly leans
      forward and kisses her on the lips.

      Finally Marina pulls free, and they stare at each other
      breathlessly, not knowing what to do next.

      BEAT.  She hesitates -- then reaches up and unlocks one cuff --
      then immediately drops the key DOWN HER DRESS, where he can't
      get it.  Richie slides his freed arm around her, pulls her
      close, and they kiss.96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 25. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

      Richie and Marina, still locked in a kiss, as Richie gets

      the key.  She pulls away.

                    You pig!  I trust you, and you take

      FADE IN:

13201320INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Richie has braced his feet against the bed post and is pulling
      with all his might, groaning with effort.

                                      RICHIE
                    Come on... give!

      Suddenly -- it does.  The POST rips free, and Richie tumbles
      onto the floor.  The entire CANOPY collapses, sending a shower
      of dust and OLD ROLLED CANVASSES from the top of the canopy
      onto Richie and the floor.

      Richie stumbles to his feet, untangles himself from the velvet
      hangings, and throws them OVER the rolled canvasses.  The
      BED POST and part of the frame is cuffed to his arm, locked
      at the narrow part of the post.

                    Great.

      He races to the window, pushes it open, and tries to get
      through it.  The POST jams sideways.  As he fumbles with it,
      trying to get out through the window --

      As the Old Baron -- 19 years since we saw him -- putters at
      the stove, close by a WINDOW, humming.  He's not senile, but
      definitely eccentric.   As he stirs a pot --

      ANGLE - THE WINDOW

      as a BODY plummets past the window, a faint CRY dopplering
      away, followed by a distant THUMP.

      The Baron looks up curiously -- sees nothing -- then shrugs
      and goes back to cooking, as Marina enters.

                                      BARON
                    Ah, Marina.  How is your young guest
                    doing?  Mr. Flintstone, was it?

      He kisses her fondly on the forehead.  Marina tries to hide
      her flustered state.

                                      BARON
                    I'm glad.  This old Chateau needs
                    more people in it.  It's been too
                    empty the last few years.

      EDOUARD

      hisses at Marina from the doorway.  She leaves the old Baron
      and moves to him.

      MARINA AND EDOUARD

      whisper intensely.

                                      MARINA
                    What's going on?

      Edouard waves a NEWSPAPER he holds.

                                      EDOUARD
                    You tell me.
                          (waves the paper)
                    We steal an American millionaire,
                    and they don't even mention it!

                                      MARINA
                    Nothing?

                                      EDOUARD
                    And this company, this Match-Tech...
                    it's not listed in Dun and Bradstreet! 
                    Not on the stock exchange... nowhere!

                                      MARINA
                    Maybe it's too new.

                                      EDOUARD
                          (beat)
                    Or maybe Mr. Redstone isn't what he
                    seems to be.

      He turns and storms out.  Marina is right on his heels.

13221322EXT.  CHATEAU GROUNDS - NIGHT

      Richie wobbles to his feet, shaking off the fall.  The BEDPOST
      is still attached.  He turns toward the BUZZ --

      THE IMMORTAL is approaching in the dark.

      Richie swings up the huge bedpost to defend himself with.

                                      RICHIE
                    Okay, pal, I'm ready for you.

      MACLEOD

      steps into the light.  He takes in the handcuffs, the raised
      bedpost, and lowers his sword.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Let me guess.  Halloween?

      Richie lowers the bedpost in relief.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, what are you doing here?  And
                    what the hell happened to your hair?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Never mind that.  You're not even
                    supposed to be in France!  You died
                    here, remember?

                                      RICHIE
                    I know, but I got a new identity.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Right.  Richie Redstone, international
                    car thief.

                    Not alone.  She's got an unemployed
                    painter with her.  They think I'm a
                      millionaire.

                    Mac, she's gonna lose the family
                    chateau.  The Baron lost all their
                    money, and unless she marries the
                    guy who holds the loan, they're out
                    on the street.
                          (beat)
                    She really needs two-hundred thousand

      MacLeod sees his deep concern, and twigs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You wouldn't be falling for this
                    Marina LeMartin, by any chance?

                                      RICHIE
                    How come, every time it's a girl,
                    you always assume --
                          (beat)
                    Alright, maybe I like her a little.

                    Then why are you running away?

                    He wouldn't do that.

      The sound of the Chateau DOORBELL goes off.  They look at
      each other in horror.

      ANGLE - THE DOOR

      The OLD BARON is about to open it.

                                      EDOUARD (CONT'D)
                    Ahhh!

      Marina lunges forward, catches the Baron at the door and
      steers him quickly toward the kitchen.

                                      MARINA
                    Grandpa, hurry... the soup is burning.

                                      BARON

      As they move OFF CAMERA into the kitchen --

      EDOUARD steels himself, and opens the door to find

      RICHIE

      standing there.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I, uh... I was looking for the
                    bathroom.
                          (beat)
                    Can I come in?

      Edouard steps aside, and Richie steps inside.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry about the bed.  No hard

                    Good.  Where's Marina?

      As Richie turns -- Edouard grabs a VASE from a hall table,
      SMASHES IT over Richie's head.  Richie goes down like a sack
      of spuds, out cold.

      Marina comes in from the kitchen, sees Richie lying there in
      a pile of shattered vase glass --

13251325EXT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - NEXT DAY - ESTABLISHING

      Birds chirp.  All seems peaceful and normal.

13261326INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - WINE CELLAR - DAY

      Down some stairs close to the foyer, the cellar is a mess,
      all the racks empty of wine except for one.  Elsewhere --
      cobwebs, OLD TOOLS, lumber.  Richie is handcuffed to an empty
      wine-rack, a GAG over his mouth, pulling on his cuffs with
      no success.

                                      MARINA (O.S.)
                    You're not happy just destroying the
                    bed.

      Marina and Edouard stand at the entrance.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    You have to ruin the wine cellar
                    too?  What kind of guest are you?

      She slips off his gag.

                                      RICHIE
                    Guest?  You kidnapped me!

                                      MARINA
                    But in a civilized way.  We always
                    treated you well.

                                      EDOUARD
                    We were wrong.

                    Richard Redstone is a fraud.

                    Richard?  Is this true?  You're not
                    really a millionaire?

      Richie shakes his head.  He can't lie to her.

      He's sincere.  Marina chews her lip in indecision.

                                      MARINA
                    How do I know I can trust you?

                          (beat, craftily)
                    But he's really rich, pretending to
                    be a poor, pretending he's rich, to
                    trick us into letting him go!

                    That's ridiculous.

                    See?  He denies it.

                                      RICHIE
                    Of course I deny it!

                    Quiet, both of you!

                    Keep him quiet.  I'll get the door.

      He races upstairs.  Marina throws an accusing look at Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, I'm not lying now... I swear.

13271327INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - FOYER - DAY

      Edouard arrives, just as the Old Baron is reaching for the
      door.  Edouard scoots forward, quickly steers the Baron away
      from the door.

      his hair, takes a breath -- and opens the door to reveal --

      MACLEOD

      standing there, all smiles.  Still grey in the temples and
      with glasses.

                                      EDOUARD

                    I was coming?

                                      EDOUARD
                    He did?
                          (beat)
                    Of course he did.  How do you do?

                    Very well.
                          (winks)
                    Mr. Redstone called me.  He instructed
                    me to make sure this got to Marina
                    LeMartin.

      With a broad smile, he produces a CASHIER'S CHECK.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                      A cashier's cheque... for two-hundred
                    thousand francs.

      And as Edouard takes the check, open mouthed --96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 34. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96

      As they HEAR Edouard's strangled voice:

                                      EDOUARD (V.O.)
                          (in distance)
                      Two-hundred thousand... ?

      Marina throws an accusing look at Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, please, I can explain...

                    Don't bother.

      She quickly GAGS him, and heads up the stairs.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mgumph!  Gnyaggam!

      MacLeod looks up as Marina enters, gracefully offers him her
      hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Ah, you must be Marina LeMartin.

                                      MARINA
                    Yes.

      He plucks the check from Edouard, and hands it to her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then this must be yours.

      Compliments of Mr. Redstone.

                          (stunned)
                    Mr. Redstone is very... generous.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He can afford to be.
                          (looking around)
                    You know, this place would make a
                    wonderful hotel?  Perhaps Mr. Redstone
                    is interested in investing in such a
                    project.  If I could speak with him
                      a moment...?

      He steps forward.  Edouard quickly blocks him.

                    He's not here!

      They SLAM the door in his face.

13301330INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - WINE CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Richie is slumped against the wine rack as Marina enters.

      She removes his gag.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, please, let me explain!

                                      MARINA
                    There's nothing to explain.

      And OFF Richie's look, she pulls out the key, unlocks his
      cuffs, while Richie stares at her in surprise.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't get it.

      She grabs him, kisses him long and hard.  Richie is melting. 
      She pulls away, leaves him breathless.

                                      MARINA
                    That's for saving me.

      She hauls back -- SLAPS him hard across the face.

                    Richard Redstone?

13321332INT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - CARLO'S OFFICE - DAY

      Carlo sits at his desk, looks up at Marina and Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    That's me.

                                      MARINA
                    The Richard Redstone, the millionaire. 
                    Surely you've heard of him.

                                      CARLO
                      Perhaps... but why would he interest
                    me?

                                      MARINA
                    Because he's paying off the debt on
                    the Chateau.

      She produces the cashier's check for two-hundred thousand
      francs, slaps it triumphantly on Carlo's desk.  Carlo picks
      it up with a slight smile.

                                      CARLO
                      Two-hundred thousand francs.  How

                    But I'm afraid I don't want it.

      He slides it back.

                    What do you mean, you don't want it?
                    You have to want it.

                    There's two-hundred thousand francs
                    there.  That's the chateau's deed,
                    free and clear.

                                      CARLO

                                      RICHIE
                    Come on, Capidimonte, this isn't

      Marina slumps against a wall, stunned.

                                      MARINA
                    I don't have that kind of money.

                    was a good investment.  It would

                                      MACLEOD
                    It probably would.  But a million

                          (beat)
                    It's not gonna happen, Richie.

      Richie sags in despair.

                    What am I gonna tell her?

      Seated around a long table: MacLeod, Richie, Edouard, Marina,
      and the Old Baron, with barely touched glasses of wine.  The
      mood is despondent, as the truth of Marina s situation sinks
      in.  Edouard is in shock.

                    I carried his chamber pot.

      Richie turns to Marina.

                                      RICHIE
                    I never meant to get your hopes up.

                    I'm sorry, Grandpa.

      The Old Baron shakes his head, pats her hand.

                    You did what you could, my child.
                          (beat)
                    You all did.  It was an old man's
                      foolishness that caused this.
                          (to Edouard)
                    Edward, I have a request.
                          (beat)
                    Paint me a landscape of the Chateau. 
                    Something to take with us... to
                    remember the place we loved so much.

      Edouard nods with humility.

                                      EDOUARD
                    I'll get some new canvas tomorrow.

                    Don't bother.  There's a ton of it
                    in the upstairs bedroom.

                    They were all rolled up, stuck on
                    top of the bed...

      He's cut off as everyone leaps from their chairs, races from
      the room.  Richie stares a BEAT, then follows.

13351335INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - BEDROOM - DAY

      As MacLeod, Marina, Edouard come racing in, Richie on their
      heels.  MacLeod grasps the fallen canopy velvet, lifts it
      aside like a magician -- revealing stacks of rolled, very
      old canvasses.

      The group stares at them, tight with anticipation.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There must be a dozen of them.

      Edouard kneels reverently by the paintings.

                                      EDOUARD
                    You realize what could be sitting
                    there?  Monets... Matisse... Degas...
                      Picassos...

                                      MACLEOD
                    All the painters supported by the
                    LeMartins for centuries.

                                      MARINA
                    If one of them left a canvas --

                                      MACLEOD
                    If they did, then you're very rich.

      MacLeod bends to help Edouard, and they load a stack of
      canvasses on the bed.  Slowly, Edouard and MacLeod unfurl
      the first canvas, searching for the name.

                                      RICHIE
                    What if they're not any good?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It won t matter.  A bad Picasso is
                    still a Picasso... it would be worth
                    millions.

      He peers at the canvas as the Old Baron hobbles in.

                                      BARON
                    Who is it?  Picasso?  Monet?  They
                    say Van Gogh stayed here once...

                    Your ancestor.  An 18th century
                    amateur who fancied himself an artist.

      He opens another canvas, glances at it, goes white.  It's a
      bad likeness of Duncan.  He rolls it up hastily and tosses
      it aside.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We found the life s work of a very

                    I m sorry.

                          (beat)
                    There's only one thing left to do.

      The Old Baron straightens up with affronted Pride.

                                      BARON
                    Please, not Carlo Capodimonte!  Let
                    that nouveau riche lizard have the
                    house... but keep your honor.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, don't do this.

                                      MARINA
                    Richie... I have to.

      She turns and starts to walk out.  Richie calls after her.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm falling in love with you.

      It stops her cold.  She doesn't turn for fear she won't be
      able to do what she must.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Please.

      Marina runs out, her heart breaking.

13361336EXT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - NIGHT

      Marina is standing in the drive, a small suitcase beside
      her, waiting for Carlo.  MacLeod steps up beside her.

                    But it's not worth the price you're
                    paying.

      Marina fights back tears.

                                      MARINA
                    Mr. MacLeod... please, don't make it
                    any harder.

      ANGLE - THE DRIVE

      Carlo's BIG MERCEDES rolls up.  As Carlo climbs out, MacLeod
      makes a last pitch.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What about Richie?

                                      MARINA
                    He'll forget me in time.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe, but will you forget him?

      She reacts, biting her lip.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We'll find another way.

      Carlo holds the door for her.

                                      CARLO
                    Come, my love, we haven't got all

                          (to MacLeod)
                    I have no choice.

      She gets in.  Carlo turns to MacLeod.

                                      CARLO
                    We'll send you an invitation to the
                    wedding.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Don't do this, Carlo.

                                      CARLO
                    I'd love to stay and chat.

      He climbs in, shuts the door and leans out.  He holds up his
      watch to the light.

      the SAME WATCH MacLeod wore in 1978!

      MacLeod's memory flashes briefly back to the thief stealing
      his watch.

      RESUME PRESENT

      MacLeod is stunned for the moment and watches the Mercedes
      drive off.

13371337INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Richie and The Old Baron are at the table, a bottle of wine
      before them.  The Baron is playing Solitaire, Richie morosely
      drinking.  Edouard is trying to spread one of the old canvases
      on an easel.

                                      EDOUARD
                          (fuming)
                    I don't need this.  I am an artist. 
                    I can go anywhere.  Rome... New
                    York... Berlin.

                                      RICHIE
                    I hear there's a train leaving in an
                    hour.

                                      EDOUARD
                    You'd like that, wouldn't you.
                    You... you...

                    Ed?  I've had about enough.  Knock
                    it off.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Or what?  You punch me, kick my ass
                    around the room?  Blacken my eyes?

                    Sounds good to me.

      Edouard backs behind the canvas he's painting.

                    How did he come to own the casino?

                                      BARON
                    The same way he came to own the
                    chateau.  He came into a fortune.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Would that have been about twenty
                    years ago?

                                      BARON
                    That s right.  He invested well and
                    became a rich man.

      MacLeod's face darkens.

      He heads purposefully for the door.  The Baron turns to
      Richie.

                                      BARON
                    What does he mean?

                          (beat; to Edouard)
                    You... you can pack.

      He follows MacLeod out.  And OFF the Old Baron's look --

                    Mac, I gotta get this thing back in

                    You gonna tell me what's got you so
                    pissed?

      MacLeod takes a sharp corner, finally speaks.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nineteen I years ago, Carlo
                      Capodimonte stole a million francs
                    from someone, a friend of mine.

                    He used it to get the casino and

                    The slimy bastard.  We're gonna kill

                    Something like that.

      He smiles nastily.

13401340INT.  CASINO MONTECOUR - CARLO'S OFFICE - DAY

      Carlo's sitting at his desk as the door SLAMS OPEN -- MacLeod
      barges in, Richie on his heels.

                          (cold)

      MacLeod kicks the door shut, slams three LOCKED BOLTS home.

                          (smug)
                    That won't prove anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're right, Carlo.  But it doesn't
                    matter.
                          (beat)
                    Because I'm not taking you to court.

      He pulls a PISTOL from his pocket.  Carlo blanches and steps
      back, as Richie steps in.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, no!  You can't shoot him down
                    like a miserable dog!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Watch me.

      He raises the gun -- but Richie grabs him -- the gun goes
      sliding across the desk.

      Carlo quickly lunges for it.  MacLeod breaks from Richie,
      and grabs the gun at the same time as Carlo.  The two men
      grapple with it, the gun between them.  Suddenly TWO SHOTS
      ring out.  And everyone stops moving.

      Silence for a BEAT -- then MacLeod slowly steps away from
      Carlo, holding his chest, staggering.  He falls, grabs Carlo
      around the knees.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You got me.

      He falls dead dramatically.  Carlo drops the gun in horror.

                    Oh my God.

      There's SHOUTING outside, POUNDING at the bolted door.

                                      VOICES (O.S.)
                    Monsieur Capodimonte!  What happened? 
                    Are you all right?

      Carlo turns a panicked look on Richie.

                                      CARLO
                    It was an accident!

                          (to the voices)
                    I'm fine.
                          (to Richie)
                    You saw... I didn't do it.

                                      RICHIE
                    That's not how it looked to me.
                          (beat)
                    Looked like he called you a thief --
                    and you killed him.

                                      CARLO
                    I didn't mean it, I swear!

                                      RICHIE
                    I'll swear you did.
                          (beat)
                    The watch... the body.  Your
                      fingerprints on the gun.  Looks like
                    prison to me Carlo.

      He moves to the door, slides back the first bolt.

                                      CARLO
                    No, please!  I'll do anything!

                                      RICHIE
                    Turn over the deed to the Chateau...
                    the deed to the Casino... and head
                    for South America.
                          (beat)
                    You never come back here, and I'll
                    forget what I saw.

                                      CARLO
                    This is extortion!  I won't do it!

      He slides back the SECOND BOLT.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    The deed... or the police.

      Carlo waivers.  Richie reaches for the THIRD BOLT.

                                      CARLO
                    Alright, alright!

      He turns to the desk, opens a drawer, and takes out a sheaf
      of papers.

                                      CARLO (CONT'D)
                    The deed to the chateau.

                                      RICHIE
                    Write "paid in full" and put Marina
                      LeMartin's name there.

      Carlo writes quickly, then hands it over.  Richie is surprised
      how easy it was.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, now about the casino.

                                      CARLO
                    No.  Not the casino.  I'd rather go
                    to jail!

      He stands his ground.

                                      RICHIE
                    Too greedy?
                          (Carlo nods stiffly)
                    Okay, deal.

      He slides back the THIRD BOLT, sees the Parking Attendant
      and one or two surprised EMPLOYEES standing there.

      NOTE: MacLeod has fallen out of sight of the door but his
      feet are in sight.

                                      RICHIE
                    Nothing to worry about folks, just a
                    slight accident.
                          (beat)
                    But I think Mr. Capodimonte needs a
                    ride to the Airport.  Right, Carlo?

      He looks at Carlo.  Carlo grabs his jacket and hurries out
      the door.  Richie shuts it behind him.

      MacLeod comes back to life.

                    How was I?

                                      RICHIE
                    A little over the top.

      As MacLeod's voice trails off.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

13411341INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - KITCHEN - DAY

      Marina, Edouard, MacLeod and Richie are sitting at dinner,
      the Old Baron at the head of the table.  Marina is still
      dazed by her change of fortune.

                                      MARINA
                    I don't understand.  How did you get
                    him to return the chateau?

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac can be pretty convincing when he
                    wants to be.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a smile)
                    Let's just say Carlo had more
                    important things to do.
                          (to Marina)
                    And so do you, if you're going to
                    turn the chateau into a hotel.

                                      MARINA
                    It's a wonderful idea, but it will
                    take so much work... and I can't
                    afford to pay anyone.

      Richie puts down his wine, looks earnestly at Marina.

                                      RICHIE
                    You know I don't have any money.
                          (beat)
                    But I've got skills.  I can fix
                    things, keep the books... pretty
                    much anything you need.
                          (beat)
                    If you want me.

      He holds her eyes, the offer clear.  Marina answers with a
      smile, reaches across the table and takes his hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think that's a "yes."

                                      BARON
                    A bottle from the cellar.  Something
                    to celebrate.
                          (a smile)
                    I haven't felt this good since  58.

      He stands and MacLeod rises with him.96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 52. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96



13421342INT.  CHATEAU LEMARTIN - WINE CELLAR - DAY

      MacLeod and the Baron approach the mostly-empty racks.  As
      the Baron chooses a bottle, MacLeod stares at the lumber,
      the old tools.  He runs a hand thoughtfully over the wall.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Baron?  When was this renovated?

                                      BARON
                    World War Two, I believe.  Why?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just a hunch.
                          (beat)
                    Stand back, if you don't mind.

      He picks up a SLEDGEHAMMER from the tools, turns -- and
      HAMMERS the wall.  One blow, two, three --

      THE OTHERS

      hurry down the stairs to see what's going on, crowd in behind
      him.

                                      EDOUARD
                    He's breaking the wall!

      MacLeod hauls back for a final blow -- and the rest of the
      wall COLLAPSES, revealing --

      ANOTHER WINE CELLAR

      hidden behind a false wall.

      MacLeod and the Baron step in, followed by the others.  The
      Baron picks up a bottle, and reads in quiet awe.

                                      BARON
                    Mon Dieu.  A magnum of Chateau Latour
                      twenty-six.

      MacLeod picks up another, blows off dust.

                                      MACLEOD
                      A thirty-five Margaux.

                    How did you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                    When war broke out, families built
                    fake wine cellars for the Nazis to
                    plunder.  They hid their best bottles
                    in places like this.

      MacLeod indicates the bottle he holds.

                    This is worth six hundred dollars.

                    I'd say you're not poor anymore.

      Marina smiles, the Old Baron smiles.  He reaches for the
      bottle worth four thousand dollars.
