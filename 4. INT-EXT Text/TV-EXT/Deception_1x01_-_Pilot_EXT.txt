for an occasion, a pretty coat over a cocktail dress and high 
heels.  She walks down the street, turning a corner.  Sensing 
someone is following her, she turns: nothing.  She picks up

Joanna, 16, sits on her twin bed in her humble room, watching 
Letterman on her secondhand TV.  Headlights SHINE into the 
room.  Joanna peeks out the window, ditches her sweatshirt, 
revealing a tank top, and RUNS OUT OF HER ROOM INTO...  


Julian runs along a road next to a pond, past a crew in 
orange vests picking up garbage.  One of them, a TATTED-UP 
GIRL, early 20s, rough around the edges but not without 
appeal, catches his eye.  Julian runs past her.  In a second 
he comes back with a piece of trash, smiling.

JULIAN

Joanna walks down the lawn and enters the BOATHOUSE.

A memory of 16-year-old Joanna and Vivian, hiding their weed 
under a loose board in the boathouse closet.

Joanna lifts up the floorboard.  Sure enough, she finds a USB
