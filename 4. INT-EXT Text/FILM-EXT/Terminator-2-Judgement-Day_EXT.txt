Downtown L.A.
Noon on a hot summer day.
On an EXTREME LONG LENS the
lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity.
In SLOW MOTION
they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to
bumper.
Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces.
The image is
surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to
DISSOLVE TO:
2
Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.
The
cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.
The
skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some
unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.
Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten
million dead souls.
It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark
white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.
A TITLE CARD FADES IN:
LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029
3
ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones.
Beyond the mound is a
vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete.
The rush hour crowd
burned down in their tracks.
4
WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the
jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round
has sagged in the firestorm.
Small skulls look accusingly from the
ash-drifts.
WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing
and laughing in the sun.
A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS
SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch
lines are still visible.
CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the
tiny skull of its owner.
HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks:
VOICE
3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war
Judgment Day.
They lived only to face a new
nightmare, the war against the Machines...
A metal foot crushes the skull like china.
TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.
It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.
It is
the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.
Its glowing red eyes
compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.
The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.
Searchlights blaze down as a
formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes
overhead.
PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we
see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in
progress.
5
THE BATTLE.
Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for
possession of the dead Earth.
The humans are a ragtag guerrilla
army.
Skynet's weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot
gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called
Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.
SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:
5A
Explosions!
Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light.
5B
A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a
pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion.
5C
Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK.
5D
A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator
5E
endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.
Three terminator
5F
endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.
Another (complete cyborg),
with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the
ground.
5G
A Centurion overruns a human firing position.
Soldiers are cut
down as they run.
Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing
machines.
6
IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches
the combat with night-vision binoculars.
He wears the uniform of a
guerrilla general, and a black beret.
He is still amid running,
shouting techs and officers.
C.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.
He lowers the
binoculars.
He is forty-five years old.
Features severe.
The left
side of his face is heavily scarred.
A patch covers that eye.
An
impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.
The name
stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.
We push in until his
eyes fill frame, then...
DISSOLVE TO:
FIRE.
SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.
FILLING FRAME.
VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)
Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines,
sent two terminators back through time.
Their
mission: to destroy the leader of the human
Resistance... John Connor.
My son.
The first terminator was programmed to strike at
me, in the year 1984... before John was born.
It failed.
The second was set to strike at John himself,
when he was still a child.
As before, the
Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.
A
protector for John.
It was just a question of
which one of them would reach him first...
DISSOLVE TO:
7
Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon
formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot
of an all-night truck stop.
Then...
The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in
the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.
Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!
Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.
TERMINATOR has come through.
Physique: massive, perfect.
Face:
devoid of emotion.
Terminator stands and impassively surveys its
surroundings.
8
Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.
Sticks the .45
in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.
He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.
Kicks
over the engine.
It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron
into gear with a KLUNK.
Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE
WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.
He fires into the air and jacks
around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back.
LLOYD
I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
Now get off or I'll put you down.
Terminator turns and considers by coldly.
He eases the shifter up
into neutral.
Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.
Swings him leg
over and walks calmly toward the guy.
Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the
shotgun's muzzle.
Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's
going to kill a man in cold blood.
He's still trying to decide when
Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow
suddenly holding the shotgun.
Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.
Then...
Terminator reaches toward him.
Oh shit...
And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.
Puts them on.
Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.
12
Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.
Cold neon flares
across the chrome of the big bike.
The 10-gauge is jammed through
the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.
The lights flow
over Terminator's wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer
rounds.
CUT TO:
13
The First Street Bridge.
Rusting chain-link fence and graffiti-
covered walls.
An L.A.P.D. BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.
A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns
of the overpass.
The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head
around at the source of the light.
He pulls over quickly, in time
to see...
13A
The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between
the columns.
Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light
standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting
whirlwind.
13B
The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.
He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the
strange light.
He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the
shadows between the rows of pillars.
A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.
Nothing
special about him.
Certainly not built like a terminator.
The flash
of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he
just arrived from the future.
His features are handsome bordering
on severe.
His eyes are gray ice.
Penetrating.
Intelligent.
THE COP spins at a sound.
Too late.
Mr. X is already on him.
The
blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.
LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm
AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.
A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up
this pistol.
CUT TO:
13C
HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the police
cruiser.
FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruiser's door then MOVE UP as
Mr. X, dressed now in LAPD blue, climbs behind the wheel.
He
looks and acts exactly like a cop.
Cool, alert, confident in his
power, his expression emotionless and judgmental.
Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night.
CUT TO:
14
John cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a fenced-in
drainage canal.
He guns the bike through a hole in the retaining
fence.
Tim's eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete embankment.
17A
IN THE DRAINAGE CANAL John zig-zags along, throwing up a
roostertail of muddy water.
Tim shouts, pretending he didn't just
see his life flash before his eyes.
He slaps John on the back.
TIM
Major moves, homes!
So... where is your
real mom, anyway?
(John doesn't answer)
She dead or something?
It's hard to read John's expression.
JOHN
She might as well be.
John twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward.
CUT TO:
18
A SIGN on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads:
PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.
Beyond it
squats an imposing four-story building.
Institutional brick.
Barred windows.
About as inviting as KGB headquarters.
Security
guards patrol the manicured grass.
19
John furtively hunches before a Ready-Teller machine at the rear of
a local bank while his friend Tim stands lookout.
John slips a
stolen ATM card into the machine slot.
It is something he's rigged
up, because trailing from the card is ribbon-wire which goes to
some kind of black-box electronics unit he's got in his ever-present
knapsack.
He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a
little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box.
John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN
number for that account.
He quickly enters the number on the Ready-
Teller's keypad and asks it for 300 bucks.
The machine whirs then
begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills.
Tim looks back over his
shoulder amazed.
JOHN
Easy money!
TIM
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
John collects the twenties as the machine kicks them out.
A cool and
professional electronic-age thief at ten years old.
JOHN
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.
Come on
baby...
(he grabs the last bills)
Let's go!
They sprint around the corner to an --
25
They huddle behind the building as John counts out Tim's share.
He folds five twenties and palms them to the other kid.
When John
opens his wallet to put in his money, Tim notices a picture in a
plastic sleeve.
TIM
That her?
John reluctantly shows his friend the Polaroid.
It is a shot of
Sarah.
Pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border.
John doesn't
know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years,
and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in
time to become his father.
Yes, that photo.
TIM
So she's pretty cool, huh?
JOHN
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.
That's
why she's up at Pescedero.
She tries to blow up
a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
TIM
No shit?
JOHN
Yeah, she's a total loser.
C'mon, let's check
out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
John has tried to sound casual, but we see in his eyes that is really
hurts.
He slaps Tim on the shoulder and they jump onto his Honda.
John fires up and they whine off down the alley.
CUT TO:
26
TIGHT ON FRONT DOOR as Todd Voight opens it, revealing the unsmiling
face of Officer X beyond the screen door.
Todd greets him with a
weary sigh.
OFFICER X
Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?
TODD
That's right, officer.
What's he done now?
Officer X ignores the question.
He casually scans the living room.
OFFICER X
Could I speak with him, please?
Todd shrugs, showing the cop he's past his patience with the boy.
TODD
Well, you could if he was here.
Be he took off
on his bike this morning.
Could be anywhere.
You gonna tell me what his is about?
OFFICER X
I just need to ask him a few questions.
Janelle appears in the doorway behind Todd, concerned.
JANELLE
There was a guy here this morning asking about
him, too.
TODD
Yeah, big guy.
On a bike.
Has that got
something to do with it?
Officer X registers the significance of that.
He realizes who the
big guy must be.
He smiles.
Reassuringly shakes his head no.
OFFICER X
I wouldn't worry.
Do you have a photograph
of John?
Todd stares unhappily at the cop.
Turns to Janelle.
TODD
Get the album, Janelle.
CUT TO:
28
ANGLE THROUGH AN ALLEY from the main street.
We see John and Tim
flash by on the Honda a block away.
Hold a beat.
Then...
A BIG CHROME WHEEL ENTERS FRAME.
BOOM UP a leather-clad leg to
Terminator's implacable face.
It surveys the area slowly as the
bike idles, then kicks it into gear and moves on, scanning in a
slow shark-like manner, not aware that it missed its prey by
seconds.
CUT TO:
29
The corporate headquarters of a mega-electronic corporation.
As
imposing cubist castle of black glass.
33
Officer X has stopped two young girls in front of a 7-Eleven.
He is
leaning out the cruiser window and showing them the picture of John.
The first girl nods.
FIRST GIRL
Yeah, he was here about fifteen minutes ago.
I
think he said he was going to the Galleria.
OFFICER X
The what?
The second girl points toward a massive complex visible about the
houses several blocks away.
Officer X stares at it.
40
Terminator cruises slowly on the bike.
Scanning.
He crosses an
overpass above a drainage canal and whips his head around at the
sound of a dirt-bike engine.
40A
TERMINATOR POV -- OF TWO KIDS ON A BIKE DOWN IN THE CANAL.
THE IMAGE SNAP-ZOOMS IN.
FREEZES ON THE DRIVER'S FACE.
"IDENT POS" FLASHES NEXT TO THE BLURRY IMAGE OF JOHN.
40B
Terminator wheel the Harley around, cutting onto a street which runs
parallel to the canal.
Terminator hauls ass at keep John in sight.
He catches glimpses of the kid through trees and houses.
Loses him.
Catches one last glimpse of him heading into the parking lot of a
large SHOPPING MALL.
41
John shoots into the busy traffic.
Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.
The DRIVER swears.
Hits his air horn.
What the driver doesn't see
is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who
emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.
46A
IN THE TRUCK.
The driver hears a thump as something slams against his
door, then feels himself pulled right out.
T-1000 slides in and
takes his place.
The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.
T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.
It can see him,
up ahead, weaving through traffic.
46B
Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the
Harley.
He accelerates after the others.
47
John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done
it before.
He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a
narrower tributary which has vertical sides.
He looks back.
No sign of pursuit.
47A
Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.
The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring
diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right
into the center of the canal.
It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an
angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of
metal.
It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing
like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering
speed.
47B
John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow
concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike
has.
The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train
in a tunnel.
Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,
backlit in the setting sun.
It looks like some kind of demon.
And...
it's gaining.
47C
ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is
fighting to overtake them.
He looks down and sees John with the tow-
truck from Hell catching up to him.
It is only about twenty feet
behind him and still gaining.
47D
ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall
of metal filling frame behind him.
47E
ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the
road.
Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into
the air like Steve McQueen in "The Great Escape" and vaults the fence
bordering the canal.
It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears
along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the
truck in the canal below.
47F
John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.
The
massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back
fender.
Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.
All this is happening at
about sixty miles and hour.
Top speed for the little dirt bike.
47G
SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.
This time the 700-
pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.
It arcs
down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.
It bottoms
out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.
Only the ultra-fast
reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.
Terminator fights
for control.
47H
He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny
Honda.
Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him
onto the Harley, in front of him.
John's Honda weaves and falls,
smashing instantly under thundering tires.
The Harley roars ahead.
It hits eighty.
Ahead is an overpass, and
supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two
channels.
The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially
a short tunnel.
47I
The truck can't fit on either side.
Neither can it stop, at that
speed.
Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into
the concrete abutment at seventy.
47J
Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a
fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks
explode.
Terminator stops the Harley.
John peers around his body to see the
destruction.
A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in
the mud.
Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,
disappearing around a bend.
47K
ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.
Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of
flame.
A figure appears in the fire.
Just an outline.
Walking slowly... calmly.
The figure emerges from the flames.
It is human-shaped but far from human.
A smooth chrome man.
Not a
servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex
hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome
surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.
It
reminds us of mercury.
A mercury man.
Its face is simple, unformed.
Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.
With each step detail returns.
First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid
chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,
ears...
47K
But it's still al chrome.
With its last step, the color returns to
everything.
It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,
mustache.
Icy eyes.
It stops and looks around.
It is a perfect chameleon.
A liquid metal robot.
A killing machine
with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.
47L
ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.
T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.
More cops arrive.
T-1000
blends in perfectly.
There are always cops at diasters and scenes of
violence.
We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so
perfect.
It walks among the other cops unnoticed.
Gets into one of the squad cars.
Starts it and drives away.
48
Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the
empty street.
John cranes his neck around to get a look at the
person/thing he is riding with.
The image is strangely reminiscent
of father/son, out for an evening ride.
John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and
he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday
rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.
JOHN
Whoa... time out.
Stop the bike!
Terminator immediately complies.
He leans the bike into a turn.
They head into a nearby alley.
49
Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.
John
slides off the gas tank.
Terminator impassively stares at him.
John
checks him out.
Tentatively speaks.
JOHN
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are
a terminator, right?
TERMINATOR
Yes.
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
JOHN
No way!
John touches Terminator's skin.
Then the blood on his jacket.
His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.
JOHN
Holy shit... you're really real!
I mean...
whoah!
(stepping back)
You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right...
but sort of alive outside?
TERMINATOR
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living tissue over
a metal endoskeleton.
JOHN
This in intense.
Get a grip, John.
Okay, uh...
you're not here to kill me... I figured that part
out for myself.
So what's the deal?
TERMINATOR
My mission is to protect you.
JOHN
Yeah?
Who sent you?
TERMINATOR
You did.
Thirty years from now you reprogrammed
me to be your protector here, in this time.
John gives him an amazed look.
JOHN
This is deep.
50
John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side
streets.
They blend into the evening traffic.
In the darkness,
Terminator's wounds are not readily visible.
John cranes his head up
and back.
JOHN
So this other guy?
He's a terminator too,
right, like you?
TERMINATOR
Not like me.
A T-1000.
Advanced prototype.
A mimetic polyalloy.
JOHN
What does that mean?
TERMINATOR
Liquid metal.
JOHN
Radical.
TERMINATOR
You are targeted for termination.
The T-1000
will not stop until it complete its mission.
Ever.
John mulls that over.
JOHN
Where we going?
TERMINATOR
We have to leave the city, immediately.
And
avoid the authorities.
JOHN
Can I stop by my house?
TERMINATOR
Negative.
The T-1000 will definitely try to
reacquire you there.
JOHN
You sure?
TERMINATOR
I would.
CUT TO:
51
John is quickly going through his pockets for change.
He has plenty
of bills but no quarters.
JOHN
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta
warn them.
Shit!
You got a quarter?
Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the
phone's cash box with the heel of his hand.
A shower of change
tumbles out.
Terminator hands one to John.
John dials.
52
T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,
barking in fear.
T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.
Reaches down, OUT
OF FRAME.
We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.
Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.
The tag reads "MAX".
T-1000 nods thoughtfully.
Heads back to the house.
55
Dark.
Off a quiet street.
Terminator stands near the Harley,
watching John pace before him.
John's brain is calling time-out.
This is all too weird.
JOHN
I need a minute here, okay?
You're telling me
it can imitate anything it touches?
TERMINATOR
Anything it samples by physical contact.
John thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent's parameters.
JOHN
Like it could disguise itself as anything...
a pack of cigarettes?
TERMINATOR
No.
Only an object of equal size.
John's still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems
downright conventional next to the exotic new model.
JOHN
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to
get me?
TERMINATOR
It can't form complex machines.
Guns and
explosives have chemicals, moving parts.
It
doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid
metal shapes.
56
John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.
Terminator
stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.
He glances
down at John.
JOHN
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places
like that.
For a while she was with this crazy
ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.
Then there
were some other guys.
She'd shack up with
anybody she could learn from.
So then she
could teach me how to be this great military
leader.
Then she gets busted and it's like...
sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you
know?
It's like... everything I'd been brought
up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?
I hated her for that.
(he looks up)
But everything she said was true.
(he stands)
We gotta get her out of there.
TERMINATOR
Negative.
The T-1000's highest probability for
success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and
wait for you to make contact with her.
JOHN
Oh, great.
And what happens to her?
Terminator's reply is matter-of-fact.
TERMINATOR
Typically, the subject being copied is
terminated.
JOHN
TERMINATED!?
Shit!
Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta right now!
TERMINATOR
Negative.
She is not a mission priority.
JOHN
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
John strides away.
Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm.
John struggles against the grip.
Which doesn't do him much good.
JOHN
Hey, goddammit!
What's your problem?
Starts dragging John back to the bike.
John spots a couple of
collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts
yelling to them.
JOHN
Help!
HELP!!
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this
psycho off of me!
The TWO JOCKS start toward him.
John yells in outrage to Terminator.
JOHN
Let go of me!!
To his surprise, Terminator's hand opens so fast John falls right on
his butt.
He looks up at the open hand.
JOHN
Oww!
Why'd you do that?
TERMINATOR
You told me to.
John stares at him in amazement as he realizes...
JOHN
You have to do what I say?!
TERMINATOR
That is one of my mission parameters.
JOHN
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.
John grins.
He's the first on his block...
JOHN
Cool!
My own terminator.
This is great!
The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly
with one leg up in the air.
This big guy in black leather and dark
glasses, standing like a statue.
FIRST JOCK
Hey, kid.
You okay?
John turns to him.
No longer needing to be rescued.
JOHN
Take a hike, bozo.
FIRST JOCK
Yeah?
Fuck you, you little dipshit.
JOHN
Dipshit?
Did you say dipshit?!
(to Terminator)
Grab this guy.
Terminator complies instantly, hoisting him one-handed by the collar.
the guy's legs are pinwheeling.
JOHN
Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?
Immediately, things get out of hand.
The guy's friend jumps behind
Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --
Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --
Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and
aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead.
John grabs Terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger --
John's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.
The
guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.
He stares,
shocked.
Pissing himself.
John is freaking out, too.
He screams at Terminator.
JOHN
Put the gun down!
NOW!!
Terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk.
John scoops it up fast then
turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened.
JOHN
Walk away.
They do.
Fast.
John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward
the bike.
John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.
JOHN
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
TERMINATOR
Of course.
I'm a terminator.
John stares at him.
Having your own terminator just became a little
bit less fun to him.
JOHN
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?
You're not
a terminator any more.
Alright?
You got that?
You can't just go around killing people!
TERMINATOR
Why?
JOHN
Whattaya mean, why?
'Cause you can't!
TERMINATOR
Why?
JOHN
You just can't, okay?
Trust me on this.
Terminator doesn't get it.
John just stares at him.
Frightened at
what just almost happened.
He gets a glimpse of the responsibility
that comes with power.
Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,
who puts it away.
JOHN
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
You wanna come
along, that's fine with me.
CUT TO:
58
Terminator and John charge through the night on the Harley.
Streetlights flare past them like comets.
Two serious guys with a
mission.
One a ten-year old kid, the other a half-man/half-machine
cyborg from the post-Apocalyptic future.
CUT TO:
62
GUARD SHACK.
A bored security guard glances up as an LAPD black-and-
white pulls up.
He raises the barricade and nods at the T-1000/cop
as it passes.
THE CRUISER pulls in next to the other police vehicles.
The T-1000
walks toward the main entrance.
CUT TO:
64
Terminator and John are approaching the guard gate on the Harley.
They can see the guard inside looks up at the sound of the engine.
JOHN
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone,
right?
TERMINATOR
Right.
John looks at him.
He's not convinced.
JOHN
Swear.
TERMINATOR
What?
JOHN
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
John holds his hand up, like he's being sworn in.
Terminator stares
at John a beat.
Then mimics the gesture.
TERMINATOR
I swear I will not kill anyone.
Terminator stops the bike and gets off.
The guard, sensing trouble, has his gun drawn as he comes out of the
shack.
Terminator walks toward him drawing his .45 smoothly.
BLAM!
He shoots the guard accurately in the thigh.
The guy drops, screaming and clutching his leg.
Terminator kicks the guard's gun away, then smashes the phone in the
shack with his fist.
He pushes the button to raise the gate and walks
back to the bike.
TERMINATOR
He'll live.
Terminator climbs onto the bike.
They drive toward the hospital,
heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving area.
71
A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight
highway.
Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in
the wind.
81A
INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high.
The air is blowing
in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily by
electronic night-vision.
His eyes glow faintly red.
JOHN
Can you see anything?
81B
TERMINATOR'S POV.
A monochrome image of the highway lit bright as
day.
81C
Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone.
TERMINATOR
Everything.
JOHN
Cool.
Sarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is
happening.
But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of 1984.
She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable.
Then she turns to John in the back seat.
SARAH
You okay?
He nods.
She reaches for John and we think she's going to hug him.
She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for
injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones.
He pulls away from her.
He hates her always checking him, treating
him like he might break, like some piece of rare china.
JOHN
I said I was okay.
Sarah looks at him, exasperated and stern.
SARAH
It was stupid of you to go there.
John stares at her, surprised.
SARAH
Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than
that.
You're too important!
You can't risk
yourself, not even for me, do you understand?
I can take care of myself.
I was doing fine.
Jesus, John.
You almost got yourself killed.
We see his chin quiver.
He's a tough kid, but all he really wants is
for her to love him.
He hasn't had enough years on the planet yet to
be the man of steel she demands.
JOHN
I... had to get you out of the place... I'm
sorry, I...
His face crumples.
He starts to cry.
Sarah gives him a cold stare.
SARAH
Stop it!
Right now!
You can't cry, John.
Other kids can afford to cry.
You can't.
He's trying to be brave, he really is.
Terminator turns and sees the
water leaking from his eyes.
It doesn't make and sense to him.
TERMINATOR
What is wrong with your eyes?
John turns away, ashamed.
Sarah lets her breath out, realizing how
keyed up she is.
She turns to Terminator, giving him a wary once-
over.
SARAH
So what's your story?
CUT TO:
82
The cops have shown up, as they always do.
There are black-and-whites
everywhere, and ambulances are arriving.
Two cops and an orderly are
required to subdue poor Doctor Silberman, who is raving at the top of
his lungs.
SILBERMAN
... it was all true and we're all going to die
and the changed, I saw him change!!
It's quite pathetic.
A nurse shoots him up with a sedative.
They lead him away.
82A
T-1000 walks unperturbed among the milling cops.
No one notices him.
It slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night.
83
A rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around.
They pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office.
A
sign in the window says CLOSED SUNDAYS.
They continue around the
building to the garage's back door.
AT THE GARAGE DOOR.
Terminator breaks the lock on the roll-up door
and raises it.
Sarah pulls the security car in out of sight.
Terminator rolls the door down behind them.
85
John and Terminator walks to an old Chevy pickup parked behind the
garage.
The day is clear but windy.
Dust devils chase themselves
behind the place.
The pickup is locked but Terminator breaks the side
window with his fist and opens the door.
He and John climb in.
92A
IN THE PICKUP.
Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if
you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around
a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand.
When it
shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub
of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips.
This starts the vehicle.
It takes about three seconds.
In fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time John
flips down the sun visor.
A set of keys drops out and John catches
them.
Dangles them in front of Terminator's eyes.
JOHN
Are we learning yet?
92B
Sarah comes out.
She's found a mechanic's coverall inside, used but
fairly clean.
It doesn't fit her too well, but it's better than the
stuff from the hospital.
She's still barefoot.
The sun, which she hasn't seen in months, hurts her eyes,
Terminator and John pull up in the pickup.
She gets in.
92C
TERMINATOR
We need to get as far from the city as possible.
SARAH
Just head south.
CUT TO:
93
THE OPEN ROAD.
The pickup roars through light traffic down a long
stretch of highway.
They set three abreast on the bench seat, John
in between, like some improbable family on a car trip.
Sarah leans over to get a look at the speedometer.
SARAH
Keep it under sixty-five.
We can't afford to
be pulled over.
Terminator backs off the throttle slightly.
TERMINATOR
Affirmative.
JOHN
No, no, no.
You gotta listen to the way people
talk.
See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or
some shit like that.
You say... no problemo.
Terminator nods, filing away the information.
Sarah is ignoring the
lesson, lost in thought.
JOHN
It someone comes off to you with an attitude,
you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
TERMINATOR
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
JOHN
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."
Or if someone gets
upset you say "chill out."
Like that.
Or you
can do combinations.
TERMINATOR
Chill out, dickwad.
JOHN
That's great!
See, you're getting it.
TERMINATOR
No problemo.
CUT TO:
94-95
OMITTED
96
There's a gas pump and a sleazy fast-food stand.
Picnic tables are
set up at the side of the food stand.
A family sits at one, children
playing and running about.
96A
The pickup truck pulls into the lot.
Stops at the gas pump.
Sarah turns to John.
SARAH
You got any cash?
John pulls what's left of his Ready-Teller money from his pocket.
JOHN
Only a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you
half.
Sarah grabs all of it.
Peels off a twenty, hands it to John.
SARAH
Get some food.
She opens the truck door and steps out.
John turns to Terminator.
JOHN
No sense of humor.
97
THE ORDERING WINDOW as John and Terminator approach.
JOHN
And that's another thing.
You could lighten up
a bit, yourself.
This severe routine is getting
old.
Smile once in a while.
TERMINATOR
Smile?
JOHN
Yeah.
Smile.
You know.
People smile, right?
Watch.
Goes to the order window.
JOHN
(smiling broadly)
Hi.
Nice place you got here.
How's business?
WINDOW WOMAN
(stone-faced)
Gimme a break.
JOHN
(to Terminator)
Okay.
Bad example.
Over there, look.
John points at THREE TEENAGE GUYS standing at a drinking fountain
nearby.
One of them has said something funny and the others are
laughing, grinning.
JOHN
Like that.
TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED)
The real-time image continues while a
replay of one of the guys grinning runs in a window.
It expands, so
that the guy's mouth fills the window.
Replays again in slow motion.
A vector-graphic of the lips smiling appears, along with an array of
symbolic data.
Terminator tries it.
The result is dismal.
A rictus-like curling of
the lip.
Terminator's next effort is a marginal improvement.
JOHN
I don't know, maybe you could practice in front
of a mirror or something.
CUT TO:
98
Sarah and John are eating cheeseburgers and fries, sitting in the
truck and on the curb respectively.
They are parked away from the
other families, at the end of the gravel parking area.
Terminator
is pouring coolant into the radiator.
Sarah is deep in through,
turning and turning the whole thing in her brain.
John, unable to
deal with her silence, goes around to where Terminator is working.
98A
John sees two kids playing with machine-gun water pistols nearby,
viciously squirting each other.
FIRST KID
You're dead!
SECOND KID
Am not!
FIRST KID
Are so!
John and Terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a fight to the
death.
Sarah rounds the front of the truck, and sees the kids.
John
sighs, solemn.
He looks up at the cyborg.
JOHN
We're not gonna make it, are we?
People, I
mean.
TERMINATOR
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
John nods, depressed.
JOHN
Yeah.
Drag, huh?
SARAH
I need to know how Skynet get built.
Who's
responsible?
TERMINATOR
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet
Dyson, Director of Special Projects at
Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
SARAH
Why him?
TERMINATOR
In a few months he creates a revolutionary
type of mircoprocessor.
SARAH
Then what?
98B
Terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he speaks.
TERMINATOR
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier of military computer systems.
All
stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne
computers, becoming fully unmanned,
Afterward,
the fly with a perfect operational record.
SARAH
(getting behind John)
Uh huh, great.
Then those fat fucks in
Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer
run the whole show, right?
TERMINATOR
Basically.
(starting the engine, backing
out)
The Skynet funding bill is passed.
The system
goes on-line August 4th, 1997.
Human decisions
are removed from strategic defense.
Skynet
begins to learn, at a geometric rate.
It becomes
self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29.
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
SARAH
And Skynet fights back.
They accelerate back onto the highway.
TERMINATOR
Yes.
It launches its ICBMs against their
targets in Russia.
SARAH
Why attack Russia?
TERMINATOR
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike
will remove its enemies here.
SARAH
Jesus.
(beat, then)
How much do you know about Dyson?
TERMINATOR
I have detailed files.
SARAH
I want to know everything.
What he looks like.
Where he lives.
Everything.
99
The desert northwest of Calexico.
Burning under the sun like a
hallucination.
Heat shimmers the image, mirage-like.
Terminator turns the pickup off the paved road and barrels along a
roadbed a sand and gravel, trailing a huge plume of dust.
A sign at the turnoff says:
CHARON MESA
2 MI
CALEXICO
15 MI
A101
AHEAD is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland, a couple
of aging house-trailers, surrounded by assorted junk vehicles and
desert-style trash.
There is a dirt airstrip behind the trailers, and
a stripped Huey helicopter sitting on block nearby.
The truck rolls to a stop in a cloud of dust.
The place looks
deserted.
The door to the nearest trailer bangs in the wind.
SARAH
(to Terminator and John)
Stay in the truck.
A102
ANGLE FROM INSIDE ANOTHER TRAILER, NEARBY.
A DARK FIGURE in the F.G. has an AK-47 trained on the pickup as
Sarah gets out.
ON SARAH peering through the backlit dust.
The sound of wind.
She approaches the trailer.
SARAH
(in Spanish)
Enrique?
You here?
She hears KACHANK! behind her and spins, whipping out her .45 in one
motion.
ENRIQUE SALCEDA stands behind a rusting jeep, a 12-gauge pump trained
on her.
He is mid-forties, a tough Guatemalan with a weathered face
and heavy mustache.
He wears cowboy boots and a flak vest, no shirt.
SALCEDA
You pretty jumpy, Connor.
His fierce face breaks into a broad grin.
The shotgun drops to his
side as he walks toward her.
When he reaches her he hugs her, then
steps back.
SALCEDA
(in Spanish)
Good to see you, Connor.
I knew you'd make it
back here sooner or later.
He grins at John as he steps from the truck, and then clocks
Terminator getting out.
SALCEDA
Oye, Big John!
Que pasa?
Who's your very large
friend?
JOHN
(perfect Spanish)
He's cool, Enrique.
He's... uh... this is my
Uncle Bob.
(to Terminator, in English)
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
Terminator smiles.
Sort of.
Salceda squints at him,
SALCEDA
Hmmm.
Uncle Bob, huh?
Okay.
(yelling)
Yolanda.
Get out here, we got company.
And
bring some fucking tequila!
A thin Guatemalan KID, FRANCO, eighteen or so, comes out of the
trailer with the AK-47, followed by Salceda's wife, YOLANDA.
She has
THREE younger children with her, from a five-year-old GIRL, JUANITA,
to a year-and-half-old BOY.
She waves at John.
They exchange
greetings in Spanish.
They seem like nice people.
Terminator looks down at John, next to him.
He says quietly...
TERMINATOR
Uncle Bob?
SALCEDA
(to Sarah)
So, Sarahlita, you getting famous, you know
that?
All over the goddamn TV.
Salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle.
The two-year-old toddles
to Terminator and grabs his pants, sliming them with drool.
Terminator looks down at the tiny kid, fascinated.
What is it?
He picks up the child with one huge hand.
Looks at it.
Turns it
different ways.
Studying it.
Then sets it down.
The kid waddles
off, a little dizzy.
SALCEDA
Honey, take Pacolito.
Thanks, baby.
She hands him the tequila and takes the child.
Salceda takes a long
pull from the Cuervo bottle.
SALCEDA
(to Terminator)
Drink?
Terminator gestures "no" at the proffered bottle, but Sarah grabs it
and takes a long pull.
She lowers it without expression.
Her eyes
don't even water.
SARAH
I just came for my stuff.
And I need clothes,
food, and one of your trucks.
SALCEDA
(grinning)
Hey, how about the fillings out of my fucking
teeth while you're at it?
SARAH
Now, Enrique.
(turns to Terminator and John)
You two are on weapons detail.
CUT TO:
A103
There is an aging and rusted Caterpillar sitting behind one of the
trailers.
John expertly backs it toward Terminator who is holding
one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand.
JOHN
Hook it on.
Terminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the
tractor.
John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads,
pulling some massive load.
A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate
moves slowly under six inches of sand.
John drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the
ground.
Like the mouth of a tomb.
The kid drops down from the
tractor and walks to the hole.
JOHN
One thing about my mom... she always plans
ahead.
A104
Sarah emerges from a trailer.
She has changed.
Boots, black fatigue
pants, T-shirt.
Shades.
She looks hard.
Salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with
Yolanda.
He looks up as Sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a
BIG FOUR-BY BRONCO next to him,
SALCEDA
This is the best truck, but the water pump is
blown.
You got the time to change it out?
SARAH
Yeah.
I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the
border.
(she pulls him away from
Yolanda)
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
You get
out tonight, too, okay?
SALCEDA
Yeah, Saralita.
Sure.
(he grins)
Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my
life.
She slaps him on the shoulder.
CUT TO:
A106
Sarah and John have their weapons and supply selections laided out on
two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing.
Maps, radios,
documents, explosives, detonators... just the basics.
Sarah is field-
stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical.
There is no wasted
motion.
Not far away, John and Terminator are working on the Bronco.
They're
greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine
compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump.
JOHN
There was this one guy that was kinda cool.
He taught me engines.
Hold this a second.
Mom
screwed it up, of course.
Sooner or later she'd
always tell them about Judgment Day and me being
this world leader and that's be all she wrote.
John thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of
parental connection is obvious.
TERMINATOR
Torque wrench please.
JOHN
Here.
I wish I coulda met my real dad.
TERMINATOR
You will.
JOHN
Yeah.
I guess so.
My mom says when I'm, like,
45, I think, I send him back through time to
1984.
But right now he hasn't even been born
yet.
Man, is messes with your head.
Where's
that other bolt?
(Terminator hands it to him)
Thanks.
Mom and him were only together for one
night, but she still loves him, I guess.
I see
her crying sometimes.
She denies it totally,
of course.
Like she says she got something in
her eye.
They crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight.
TERMINATOR
Why do you cry?
JOHN
You mean people?
I don't know.
We just cry.
You know.
When it hurts.
TERMINATOR
Pain causes it?
JOHN
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's
nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.
You
get it?
TERMINATOR
No.
Terminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and the
engine catches with a roar.
JOHN
Alriight!!
My man!
TERMINATOR
No problemo.
John grins and does a victorious thumbs up.
Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly.
John laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again.
A108
SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and
Terminator.
A109
SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying.
It
is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures
to the cyborg.
Trying to get him to walk more casually.
John walks,
then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very
fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool.
They try it
again.
Continued ad lib as we hear:
SARAH (V.O.)
Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly
so clear.
The Terminator would never stop, it
would never leave him... it would always be
there.
And it would never hurt him, never shout
at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it
couldn't spend time with him because it was too
busy.
And it would die to protect him.
Of all
the would-be fathers who came and went over the
years, this thing, this machine, was the only
one who measured up.
In an insane world, it was
the sanest choice.
Sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman
made hard and cold by years of hard choices.
CUT TO;
A110
A police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the
outskirts of Los Angeles.
A ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a
freeway in the distance.
Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some
pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it.
A111
IN THE CRUISER.
The T-1000 sits inside.
John's notes and letters are
spread out on the seat beside it.
Sarah's voice speaks from a
cassette deck.
John's tapes.
Her voices mixes with the static filled
chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its
targets.
SARAH
... if we are ever separated, and can't make
contact, go to Enrique's airstrip.
I'll
rendezvous with you there.
T-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section.
It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier.
ECU on envelope.
We see the postmark:
"Charon Mesa, Calif."
TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope.
It glances
up at the sound of crunching gravel.
In the rear-view it sees a BIKE
COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it.
The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles
up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser.
BIKE COP
Howdy.
I saw you pulled over here earlier.
Everything okay?
T-1000
Everything's fine.
Thanks for checking.
(it gets slowly out of
the car)
Since you're here, though, can I talk to you
a second...
CUT TO:
A112
The T-1000 thunders along on the Kawasaki 1100, doing about a hundred
and twenty.
PAN WITH IT until it recedes toward the horizon.
CUT TO:
A113
Sarah sits at the picnic table.
The weapons are cleaned and her work
is done.
She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have
the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.
She draws her knife from its belt sheath.
Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter "N".
A114
NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip.
A115
ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking.
She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty
dog and loving it.
Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her
hands.
Backlit, stylized.
She looks over at John.
Loading guns and
supplies.
A116
ANGLE ON kids playing.
A117
SARAH'S HEAD droops.
She closes her eyes.
A118
TIGHT ON small children playing.
Different ones.
Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park.
Very idyllic.
A dream
playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides,
and a jungle gym.
It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen
in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029.
But here the grass is vibrant
green and the sun is shining.
118A
Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the
playground.
An outsider.
Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link
fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers
playing with their kids.
A grim-faced harbinger.
118B
Some girls play skip-rope.
Their sing-song weaves through the random
burbling laughter of the kids.
One of the young mothers walks her
two-year-old son by the hands.
She is wearing a pink waitress
uniform.
She turns to us, laughing.
It is Sarah.
Beautiful.
Radiant.
Sarah from another life,
uncontaminated by the dark future.
She glances at the strange woman
beyond the fence.
118C
Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence.
She starts shouting at
them in SLOW MOTION.
No sound comes from her mouth.
She grabs the
fence in frustration, shaking it.
Screaming soundlessly.
Waitress Sarah's smile falls.
Then returns as her little boy throws
some sand at her.
She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the
fence were a shadow, a trick of light.
118D-118F
OMITTED
118G
THE SKY EXPLODES.
The children ignite like match heads.
Sarah is
burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed.
118H
THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children.
Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips
into her, blasting her apart and she...
119
Wakes up.
All is quiet and normal.
The children are still playing nearby.
Less
than fifteen minutes have gone by.
Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table.
Every muscle is shaking.
She is gasping.
Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is
soaked with sweat,
She can escape from the hospital, but she can't
escape from the madness which haunts her.
She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the
scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.
They are:
"NO FATE."
Something changes in her eyes.
She slams her knife down in the table
top, embedding it deeply in the words.
Then gets up suddenly and
we --
CUT TO:
A120
LONG LENS on Sarah walking toward us, striding across the compound
with grim purpose.
She carries a small nylon pack and a CAR-15
assault rifle.
Her face is an impassive mask.
She has become a
terminator.
A120A
JOHN LOOKS UP from his work in time to see Sarah throw the rifle
behind the seat of their stolen pickup, jump in and start it.
She
slams it in gear.
Salceda walks up to John.
SALCEDA
She said you go south with him...
(he points at Terminator)
... tonight, like you planned.
She will meet
you tomorrow in...
But John is moving, running after her.
JOHN
Mommm!! Wait!!
A120B
MOVING WITH SARAH as she leaves the compound.
We see John running
after her... yelling.
Can't hear his words.
She looks in the rear-
view mirror but doesn't slow down.
CUT TO:
A121
John and Terminator ponders the message carved into the top of the
picnic table.
Sarah's knife is still embedded there.
JOHN
"No fate."
No fate but what we make.
My father
told her this... I mean I made him memorize it,
up in the future, as a message to her --
Never mind.
Okay, the whole thing goes "The
future is not set.
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves."
TERMINATOR
She intends to change the future somehow.
JOHN
I guess, yeah --
(snaps his fingers as it hit him)
Oh shit!!
TERMINATOR
Dyson.
JOHN
Yeah, gotta be!
Miles Dyson!
She's gonna blow
him away!
John motions to Terminator and breaks into a run.
JOHN
Come on.
Let's go.
LET'S GO!!
CUT TO:
A122
Sarah speeds through the darkening desert.
Expressionless.
In her
dark glasses, she looks as pitiless as an insect.
DISSOLVE TO:
A123
TRACKING WITH THE BRONCO, Terminator and John heading toward L.A.
TERMINATOR
This is tactically dangerous.
JOHN
Drive faster.
TERMINATOR
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.
It
could anticipate this move and reacquire you
at Dyson's house.
JOHN
I don't care.
We've gotta stop her.
TERMINATOR
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
JOHN
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way.
Haven't you learned anything?!
Haven't you
figured out why you can't kill people?
Terminator is still stumped.
JOHN
Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die.
But everybody's not like that!
Okay?!
We have
feelings.
We hurt.
We're afraid.
You gotta
learn this stuff, man, I'm not kidding.
It's
important.
PANNING as they pass, revealing the lights of the city ahead.
CUT TO:
A124
EXT, DYSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The house is high-tech and luxurious.
Lots of glass.
Dyson's study
is lit bluish with the glow of his computer monitors.
He is at the
terminal, working.
Where else?
We see him clearly in a long shot
from an embankment behind the house.
A DARK FIGURE moves into the foreground.
Rack focus to Sarah as she
turns into profile.
She raises the CAR-15 rifle and begins screwing
the long heavy cylinder of a sound-suppresser onto the end of the
barrel.
CUT TO:
A125-A125K

129A
IN EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Sarah's eye at the night-scope.
TIGHT INSERT on her finger as it tightens on the trigger, taking out
the slack.
She takes a deep breath and holds it.
Adjusts her
position minutely.
132
Terminator and John leap from the jeep, sprinting toward the house.
The shots sound muffles from outside.
JOHN
Shit, we're too late!
136
The T-1000 sprints up and throws its leg over the big C.H.P. Kawasaki.
Fires it up.
It smokes an arcing scorch-mark on the pavement as it
spins around and roars away.
CUT TO:
148
The security duo of Moshier and Gibbons cowers behind cars in the
parking lot in front of the building.
They turns as L.A.P.D. BLACK-
AND-WHITES pour into the lot, turn the area into a disco of whirling
blue and red lights.
152
OMITTED
153
The cops are jumping from their cars and ducking behind them.
Emphasis on small arms here.
Behind them an ugly BLACK SWAT VAN
screeches into the lot.
153A
We hear the THUMP OF ROTORS as a POLICE CHOPPER arrives and swings in
close to the building.
It rakes its XENON SPOTLIGHT through the
second floor offices.
154
Terminator crosses the office toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.
He is outlines starkly by the spotlight as it rakes through the dark
offices.
Without breaking stride he kicks an executive desk toward
the window.
154A
Glass explodes outward and the desk topples, falling to the sidewalk
below.
154B
Terminator, standing at the edge, FIRES A LONG BURST with strafes the
police cars lines up below.
Cops duck as glass flies.
Terminator,
with his superb aim, hits no one.
But noticed is served.
154C
The cops (surprise) FIRE BACK.
Terminator turns and is walking
calmly from the window as glass, office furniture, drapes etc. are
riddled by return fire.
A few rounds hit his back, but he doesn't
notice.
He reloads as he walks.
155
The varsity takes the field as the SWAT TROOPERS sprint forward by
squads.
They flank the lobby and work their way inside, deploying
rapidly.
They move and freeze, behind cover, quivering with
adrenaline.
They have all that great SWAT equipment:
body armor,
gas-masks, M-16s, tear-gas launchers, ropes.
The works.
They make
a lot of hand signals and keep their mouths shut.
They're well-
trained and deadly.
157
OUTSIDE we see cops firing TEAR GAS grenades through the broken
windows into second-floor offices.
158
As the face of the building EXPLODES in an eruption of glass and fire.
Remains of the second-floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge
fireball rolls out, leaping into the sky.
The cops look up, stunned.
The helicopter banks away from the heat.
Burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers
break ranks, pulling back.
171
ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose.
A BIKE COP who has
just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd, directly toward
the building.
171A
T-1000 guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses
from a parking structure to the Cyberdyne building.
It enters on the
second floor, which is now a burning maze.
172
Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.
Firing the
tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining
rounds among the cop vehicles.
Unprotected officers run, choking
and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.
It
is a total rout.
175
AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining
masks to unprotected cops.
A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside
him.
He looks up.
His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty
launcher.
Instinctively he catches it.
Terminator grabs his flak
vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.
175A
The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.
The uninjured SWATs are
tending their wounded.
They look up at the sound of shouts and a
roaring engine.
176A
THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and
debris.
Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a
smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads
to the bank of elevators.
Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he
seals the corridor with the back of the van.
176B
Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing.
They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle.
The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.
CUT TO:
177
T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office
and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining
cops firing at it.
It knows.
It looks around.
Analyzing options.
It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of
this corner office block...
It twists full throttle on the powerful bike.
Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the
windows --
178
T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle.
It
rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and --
178A
SLAMS into the canopy.
The impact of bike and rider pitches the
chopper radically.
The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the
bike tumbles to the pavement below.
178B
The T-1000 doesn't.
It clings to the shattered canopy.
Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head
through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the
jagged hole.
It reforms instantly into its previous self on the
passenger seat.
178C
It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver's
seat.
The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.
It drops
toward the parking lot.
T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the
ground.
178D
Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by
inches.
The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the
parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.
OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS, HERE IT COMES...
179
Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van
onto a divided highway.
Sarah and John are catching their breath,
still coughing from the CS gas.
Terminator look to the rear-view
mirror.
He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them,
gaining.
Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.
It is a rolling
armory.
There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.
SARAH
John, get under these.
Hurry!
He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet-
proof vests on top of him, completely covering him.
Then she grabs
two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.
She starts on a shotgun
as --
180
The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed.
Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to
be crawling.
The van hits it top speed of eighty.
They swerve to
miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER.
180A
The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.
180B
T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine
pistol and FIRES.
The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.
The door
windows are BLOWN IN.
Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000's aim.
The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.
One of the doors is kicked open.
Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest,
crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.
SHE OPENS FIRE.
180C
Bullets riddle what's left of the chopper's canopy as the T-1000
returns fire.
The van is stitched with hits.
180D
INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls,
ripping up the interior.
The vests covering John are hit repeatedly.
We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back
door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.
She pops
back out and fires in controlled bursts.
The M-16 empties and she
grabs another.
180E
Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it
and knocking it skidding.
181
OMITTED
181A
Sarah reloads and keeps firing.
The van swerves around a Toyota.
A
moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top
of the car.
181B
T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.
181C
Sarah has popped out to fire.
She takes a HIT in the thigh, and
several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.
She is thrown back onto
the floor of the van.
She lies there, an exposed target...
181D
Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.
He locks up the van's brakes.
Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies.
Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.
182
And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.
The rotor disintegrates.
The back doors of the van are crushed in as
the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,
trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.
The chopper hits the
pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a
shapeless mass of twisted metal.
It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.
182A
Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently
from the impact.
It smashes up against the center divider, screeching
along the concrete, and then pulls away.
Terminator puts the hammer
down and the van accelerates.
He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP
crawling like a snail ahead.
THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is
sawing into the tire.
The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.
The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,
and the van slides sideways and topples --
STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.
182B
INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her
bleeding leg.
She is white and shocky.
Terminator starts to
extricate himself from the crumpled driver's seat.
183
BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk
metal, unrecognizable.
Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard,
shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.
The big tires lock up in
clouds of tire-smoke.
The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short
of the wrecked chopper.
183A
The shaken DRIVER jumps down.
The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.
DRIVER
Goddamn, are you alri --
183B
SSSHHCK!
T-1000 drives a blade through the man's abdomen and walks
on past without slowing, or even looking at him.
183C
It climbs into the open cab of the tanker.
Releases the brake.
As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters
on the side which say "CRYOCO INC.
LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY'.
184
AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the
wreck.
Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the
bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.
John has
borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.
184A
The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.
The DRIVER,
A Hispanic guy in his 50's, is getting out to help them.
Terminator
and John hear a CRASH and look back as the
185
helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.
186
JOHN
Holy shit.
Come on, Mom... we gotta keep
moving... come on --
TERMINATOR
(to the pickup owner)
We need your truck.
The guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as Terminator
slides Sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel.
John
runs to the passenger side.
187
THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts
up through the gears.
188
Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.
The
tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.
Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug
loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.
It accelerates
slowly.
189
THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the
way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.
The 18-wheeler shifts
to a higher gear, still accelerating.
190
With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving
the pickup back and forth across the lanes.
The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.
JOHN
Faster!
He's right on us!
Terminator doesn't reply.
He rapidly unslings the blooper, still
around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.
191
LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens,
filling frame with chrome and lights.
191A
K-WHAM!!
It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.
191B
Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and
crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.
The spinning
chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail
screeches along the other side.
The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.
It ricochets violently between
the big-rig and the divider
Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel.
Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides.
The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in.
Metal and glass shower in through the side windows.
The frame twists and buckles.
John feels like the fillings are being
shaken right out of his teeth.
The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind
them.
191C
Terminator slides toward the passenger side.
Keeping his foot on the
gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver's seat.
TERMINATOR
Drive for a minute.
JOHN
Where you going?!
Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand.
Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its
frame.
It flies over the top of the truck.
191E
Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.
He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.
191F
POOM!
The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.
It EXPLODES
against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.
Liquid
nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.
191G
The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.
The tanker swings like
a pendulum behind the cab.
191H
The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards.
Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen
vapor.
It is gaining again.
Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload.
191I
John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.
191J
T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the
ramp after him, still accelerating.
It is twenty feet behind them
and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.
191K
The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES.
The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.
Steam blasts
out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.
191L
The semi rams the back of the pickup again.
Spewing smoke and vapor
like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back
of the pickup.
Driving it right through the intersection at the
bottom of the ramp, and straight toward --
The chase has led them to an area of heavy industry.
192
THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup
right through them.
Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos
and impacts.
He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier.
John isn't even steering.
They are just being pushed.
There's
nothing he can do.
They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare
which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.
192A
Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup.
He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and --
Leaps onto the semi.
He climbs rapidly onto the hood.
192B
And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
Right into T-1000's face.
The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke
and fire
Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to
SHUDDER AND
192C
SCREAM.
IT IS JACK-KNIFING.
Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires
are shrieking over the pavement.
The tractor is smashed back at
right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.
192D
The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways
across the pavement.
It begins to topple.
Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top.
With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig
slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.
A sheet of sparks
sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.
192E
John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building
looming right in front.
The huge rolling doors are partly open.
No choice.
He steers right through them into the mill, as --
192F
Terminator, with one second to go, leaps from the cab --
He flies through the open doors as --
The tanker hits the building and --
193
