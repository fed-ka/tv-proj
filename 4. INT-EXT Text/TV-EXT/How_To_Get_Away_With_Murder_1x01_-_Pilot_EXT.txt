FOOTBALL PLAYERS.  CHEERLEADERS.  A SEA OF SCREAMING, RILED UP
COLLEGE STUDENTS...because we've been thrust into the center of a
PEP RALLY for the MIDDLETON UNIVERSITY WARRIORS.  By day, this
quad is filled with the best and brightest minds in the country --
future Rhodes Scholars and Nobel winners -- but right now?  They're
just drunk.  Spooky, foreboding music sets the tone as we MOVE
SLOW MOTION over the crowd.  Even though it's the middle of winter,
the GUYS are SHIRTLESS, showing off their pecs painted in school
colors while their GIRLFRIENDS sit on their shoulders, chugging
from bottles of whiskey.  It's a wild, rowdy, debaucherous ORGY
of school pride that only America's wealthiest children could get
away with.  The only person who could possibly get them to pay
attention right now is the FOOTBALL COACH shouting into a mic on
the stage, a preacher with his disciples.  He holds a TORCH.

                                      FOOTBALL COACH
                    It's been a rough year, no doubt,
                    but that all ends Saturday!  Because
                    that's when this team, my Warriors,
                    are gonna burn those lazy, cocky,
                    pansy-ass Princeton players to the
                    ground!  AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
                    MIDDLETON?!!  LET ME HEAR IT!!

As the crowd ROARS, the coach now brings the torch to a TOWERING
WOODEN EFFIGY behind him, the word "Princeton" painted across its
make-believe jersey.  And as the effigy BURSTS INTO FLAMES and
the MARCHING BAND LAUNCHES INTO SONG, the camera suddenly speeds
up, pushing through the students and over the bonfire and past
the gothic buildings and ivy-covered arches that make up this
beautiful campus until we CRASH INTO --


It's dark and eerie as we whip past the trees, deeper and deeper
into the woods, the sounds of the pep rally fading behind us. 
Suddenly the camera SCREECHES TO A HALT.  We are now in a small
CLEARING.  Through the dark we see 3 TWENTY-SOMETHINGS, a diverse
motley crew, shivering in the cold and freaking out.  About what,
we'll soon discover.  The first of them, MICHAELA PRATT (27,
preppy, type-A) paces and thinks as the two others sit, quiet and
trembling.  She was born knowing how to "lean in" so that's what
she's going to do right now -- take control, CEO this shit.

                                      MICHAELA
                    It's been too long.  We did what we
                    said, we waited, we stuck to our
                    word, but we can't just sit here all
                    night.  We have to do something. 
                    And I know you're not going to like
                    it, but I'm calling Aiden.                                                                                       2.

                                      PATRICK
                    ARE YOU HIGH??!  

Under normal circumstances, PATRICK DONAHUE (25) is sexy,
sophisticated, confident, cool, and hyper-articulate.  Right now
though?  He's shitting his pants.

                                      PATRICK (CONT'D)
                    We're not calling your fianc !  We
                    wait.  THAT is what we decided so
                    THAT is what we're going to do.

                                      MICHAELA
                    I was never part of that decision.

                                      PATRICK
                    Because you had a meltdown!  You
                    could barely make a sentence!  So
                    shut up, sit down, and stop acting
                    like a little bitch baby.

                                      MICHAELA
                    I am acting like a person does in a
                    situation like this!

                                      PATRICK
                    No.  You're hysterical and you need
                    to calm the hell down.

                                      MICHAELA
                    DO NOT TELL ME HOW TO FEEL RIGHT
                    NOW!

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    Hey.

They all jump, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER, just like we do at home,
because now a 4th person stands there.  Meet WES GIBBINS (27). 
Wes is boyish, easy-going, instantly likable...and his t-shirt is
covered in blood.  

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Sorry it took me so long.  I went
                    back for this.

Wes removes a backpack, pulls out a TROPHY, also covered in blood.  

                                      MICHAELA
                    Wes!  Why'd you bring that here? 
                    Take it back right now.

                                      LAUREL
                    No.  It's smart.

Finally we hear from LAUREL WILDING (23, bookish, introverted). 
She's been quiet up till now.                                                                                         3.

That's her thing -- she's a thinker, an observer, the type of person
easy to underestimate.  She has the answer now though, decisive,
confident.

                                      LAUREL (CONT'D)
                    The People vs. Gallivan!  Pennsylvania
                    vs. Gottlieb!  Cases the prosecution
                    should've won but lost because there
                    was no murder weapon...  

                                      PATRICK
                    So what are you saying?  

                                      LAUREL
                    We clean it and put it back.  Hide
                    it in plain sight.
                          (beat)
                    After we bury the body.

A long beat as everyone takes that in.  Then --

                                      MICHAELA
                    No, absolutely NOT.  

                                      PATRICK
                    I agree with Michaela.

                                      LAUREL
                    Patrick--

                                      PATRICK
                    The trophy we need, yes.  But the
                    body stays where it is.

                                      LAUREL
                    The body is what gets us caught.

                                      PATRICK
                    Then why'd we leave it there in the
                    first place?

                                      LAUREL
                    Because we panicked.  All of us. 
                    But now that we're finally thinking
                    straight--

                                      MICHAELA
                    You are not thinking straight--

                                      LAUREL
                    Then what do you suggest??! 

                                      MICHAELA
                    Something that doesn't involve
                    carrying a body across campus on the
                    busiest night of the year!                                                                                         4.

                                      PATRICK
                    She's right, Laurel.  Even if we
                    were able to get it out of the house,
                    unseen, the ground is frozen--

                                      LAUREL
                    We have all night to dig!

                                      PATRICK
                    You don't know what you're talking
                    about!

                                      LAUREL
                    This is murder, none of us know what
                    we're talking about!

                                      MICHAELA
                    Please, just yell that a little louder--

                                    WES
                    Hey...

                                      MICHAELA
                    Honestly, you're all dumber than I
                    thought if you think we should go
                    back there. 

                                      PATRICK
                    I'm agreeing with you!

Now everyone's yelling, except Wes who keeps trying to interrupt.

                                          MICHAELA/PATRICK/LAUREL/WES
                    You should've agreed with me weeks
                    ago when I begged, BEGGED, to tell
                    the police instead of deluding
                    ourselves that we were on the right
                    side of this!/And I'm sorry Laurel
                    but someone will sniff out the body
                    if we bury it, if they don't catch
                    us before, there are cops everywhere
                    tonight!/You two need to MAN UP and
                    THINK because we're going to jail
                    unless we go back there and destroy
                    the DNA!/Guys...Listen...Hey...SHUT
                    UP!

Finally they all stop, look at Wes.  He's calm, focused, a quiet
and confident leader to this very outspoken group.

                                    WES
                    It's two against two.  We have no
                    other choice.  We flip a coin.

Beat.                                                                                       5.

                                          MICHAELA/PATRICK/LAUREL
                    That is the dumbest thing you've
                    ever said.  /I'm not letting a
                    freaking coin decide this.  /We're
                    adults, we can figure this out...

                                    WES
                    We don't have time to fight!  We
                    need to make a decision and commit
                    to it.  So if someone has a better
                    idea, say it now!

They all realize, no one does.  Wes pulls a coin out of his pocket.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Heads we get the body.  Tails we
                    leave it where it is.  Okay?

A beat, then they all nod.  Okay.  And as Wes tosses the coin in
the air, the four of them watching and freezing and totally totally
fucked, we HOLD TIGHT ON WES AND CUT TO:


Wes, the September sun on his face, now rides his bike through
Middleton's pristine, manicured campus.  A CHYRON appears:  FOUR
MONTHS EARLIER.  He weaves his way past the fresh-faced,
Abercrombie-clad undergrads playing frisbee on the green and
professors holding class under trees.  And just as we find
ourselves remembering our own college days and wishing we could
go back, and to this idyllic campus in particular, Wes stops his
bike in front of a beautiful, historic building.  He looks up at
the letters etched into the stone: "MIDDLETON LAW SCHOOL."  Wes
takes in the sight, his face full of so much hope and promise,
that he doesn't notice the BULLETIN BOARD he passes on his way
inside.  Stapled across every inch of its surface is the same
FLIER -- it shows a PHOTO of missing student LILA STANGARD (21,
all-American) printed with the words, "Have you seen me?"  As we
HOLD ON this eerie, haunting image, a mystery about to unfold...


We're outside a quaint, two-story Victorian right on the edge of
campus.  A WOODEN SIGN sits out front -- "THE LAW OFFICE OF
ANNALISE DEWITT, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY."  And now as we get
closer we see that STUDENTS pour out the door...

                                    GINA (PRE-LAP)
                    Every day before lunch it was the
                    same thing.


Where we left off, the Cop waiting for an answer.  A long beat--

                                      PATRICK
                    It's my car, sir.

                                      CAMPUS COP
                    You're double parked.  You might get
                    a ticket with all the city cops out
                    tonight.

                                      PATRICK
                          (phew)
                    Oh.  Right.  I'll move it now.

But before Patrick can, the Cop stops, now noticing the rug they've
now lowered to the ground and stepped in front of.  Huh.  

                                      CAMPUS COP
                    This is that law professor's office?

A beat, each of them hoping the other will do the talking until --

                                      MICHAELA
                    Yes.  Professor DeWitt.  We're her
                    law students, but she's out of town
                    and she told us to take this old rug
                    to the bonfire.  

                                      CAMPUS COP
                    She asked you to go into her house
                    and burn a rug for her?

                                      MICHAELA
                    It sounds weird, I know.  Why don't
                    I get her on the phone for you so
                    she can explain?

Michaela digs out her phone as Laurel steps forward, glaring --
what the fuck does she think she's doing?

                                      LAUREL
                    It's a little late to call her, don't
                    you think?

                                      MICHAELA
                    The nice officer here thinks we're
                    burgling our professor's house, let's
                    just clear this up.
                          (then, to the cop)
                    I mean, unless you'd rather me not?  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                     19.

                                      MICHAELA (CONT'D)
                    She had to go to this funeral today,
                    her mother's funeral, but she's
                    probably not asleep yet.  Hopefully...

                                      CAMPUS COP
                    It's fine.  Just--

                                      DRUNK DUDE (O.S.)
                    Hey you guys!!  

Down the street, a DRUNK COLLEGE STUDENT carries a GIANT REINDEER
LAWN ORNAMENT as he runs to catch up to some friends.

                                      DRUNK DUDE (CONT'D)
                    This'll burn good!

                                      CAMPUS COP
                    God dammit.  
                          (then, to our students)
                    Be safe, okay?  There are ton of
                    crazies out tonight.

The Cop rushes to regulate on the drunk kids.  Patrick turns to
Michaela, impressed.

                                      PATRICK
                    Where the hell has that girl been
                    all night?

                                      MICHAELA
                    Can we just get this over with?

And now Michaela goes to pick up the rug, straining to lift it as
we HOLD ON HER DETERMINED FACE AND FLASHBACK TO --


Philly's criminal courthouse.

                                      LINDA WHEELER (PRE-LAP)
                    So I just kept pumping his chest...


As Wes catches up with a now furious Patrick--

                                    WES
                    Patrick!

                                      PATRICK
                    That color blind crap was pure luck!

                                    WES
                    At least there are 3 spots left.

                                      PATRICK
                    Getting a spot isn't the point,
                    Waitlist.

                                    WES
                    It's not...?

                                      PATRICK
                    Winning is the point.  Law Review,
                    Order of the Coif, a Supreme Court
                      appointment...  It all starts with
                    that trophy.  That's who DeWitt's
                    going to respect and mentor and make
                    into a king.  That will be me.                                                                                     28.

                                    WES
                    Or me.
                          (off Patrick's scoff)
                    Whatever, I was just gonna ask --
                    why don't we split up the prep-work
                    for tomorrow?  Study group style...

                                      PATRICK
                          (stopping them)
                    What's your LSAT score?

                                    WES
                    Oh come on.

                                      PATRICK
                    You're a waitlister which means you
                    probably got below a 170, right?

                                    WES
                    ...165.

                                      PATRICK
                          (rushing off)
                    Gotta go.

                                    WES
                    Patrick!

                                      PATRICK
                    Not because I think you're a moron,
                    which I do, but because my plan
                    doesn't allow for a 3rd wheel.  Later!

As Patrick runs off, Wes wondering what he's up to...


Wes rides his bike through an arch and SCREECHES TO A HALT. Because
the ENTIRE QUAD'S LIT UP BY CANDLES, hundreds of students holding
a VIGIL for Lila.  Fianc  Logan speaks to the crowd from a stage. 

                                      LOGAN
                    If Lila was here, I know she'd want
                    to thank everyone for their support.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                     29.

                                      LOGAN (CONT'D)
                    She loves this place so much, just
                    like we all love her...

Logan chokes up, his teammates now all patting him on the back
and escorting him away.  3 SORORITY GIRLS approach the mic.

                                      SORORITY GIRL
                    This is for Lila.

They start to SING.  Something overwrought and funny like Demi
Lovato's Skyscraper.  Wes watches the students sway and cry,
finding this all very strange, then pushes his way through them...

                                    WES
                    Excuse me.  Sorry.  Excuse me...


A now breathless Wes dumps his bike on the lawn and runs to the
front door, which he finds ajar.  He enters -- it's quiet, empty...  

                                    WES
                    Hello?

No answer.  He moves into the house, looks in the study, living
room.  No one home.  But there -- he sees a light on in Annalise's
office, some voices and laughter inside.  He walks over to the
office door, which is slightly open so he can see Annalise, her
back to him as she sits on the desk.  Wes knocks.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Professor DeWitt--

And the slight pressure of his knock now makes the door slide
open enough so Wes now can now see a NAKED MAN NOW POP UP FROM
BELOW THE DESK.  Annalise jumps up, quickly pulling down her skirt.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Oh my god.

                                      NAKED MAN
                    Get the hell out!

Wes turns, racing out of the office and back to the front door...

                                      ANNALISE
                    Hey!  Stop.

Annalise, eerily calm, heads down the foyer, stopping him.

                                    WES
                    I'm so sorry.  The door was open and--

                                      ANNALISE
                    Oh my god, I'll kill him.                                                                                     30.

A now annoyed Annalise heads over to a desk, dials the phone.  As
it rings, she looks to Wes, who really just wants to leave...

                                      ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                    So why are you here?

                                    WES
                    Oh.  That.  It can wait--

                                      ANNALISE
                    Clearly it can't if you barged in
                    here this late.
                          (into the phone)
                    Frank.  You didn't lock up.  Again.

She hangs up, looks to Wes.

                                      ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                    Speak.

                                    WES
                    Right, um, I came across this case --
                    Commonwealth vs. McGinnis -- which
                    says we can motion for a faster
                    verdict if we think the prosecution's
                    evidence is insufficient--

                                      ANNALISE
                    A directed verdict.  

                                    WES
                    Huh?

                                      ANNALISE
                    What you're suggesting is called a
                    "directed verdict." If we ask for
                    one and get denied, all the jury
                    will hear is that the judge thinks
                    there's enough evidence to convict.  

                                    WES
                    But you discredited the first
                      assistant's testimony today and--

                                      ANNALISE
                    You had an idea, I'm telling you it
                    was a bad one.  Good night, Seth.

                                    WES
                    Wes.

                                      ANNALISE
                    Right.

And now Annalise pushes him out the door.  Off a mortified Wes --

                                    END OF ACT TWO                                      ACT THREE


That night in the woods.  Patrick's SUV now idles outside a 7-11.


Back in the woods, where our four exhausted, aching students lug
the rug through the dark.  Patrick holds a flashlight when they
SUDDENLY HEAR GIGGLING IN THE DISTANCE.  Our four all hit the
ground, hiding.  Wes whispers to Patrick.

                                    WES
                      Flashlight.

Patrick shuts it off just as a DRUNK COUPLE comes into view,
heading right for them.  Our four all share looks, panicked, as
the couple finally stops, making out up against a nearby tree.

                                      DRUNK GIRL
                    Hey.  Jen can't find out about this.

                                      DRUNK GUY
                    I'm not gonna tell her.

And now they kiss again, pulling at their zippers, about to go
for it right there, our four all panicking when...a RINGTONE PLAYS.  

                                      DRUNK GIRL
                    What is that??

It's Laurel's cell!  As she goes to silence it, we see the name
"Frank" along with a PHOTO of him smiling on the phone's screen.

                                      DRUNK GUY
                    Hey!  Who's there??

Our four stay silent, faces pressed into the dirt.

                                      DRUNK GIRL
                    Can we get out of here?

And now the couple runs off as fast as they can.  Once they're
gone, Laurel breathes a big sigh of relief.  That is, until--

                                      MICHAELA
                    Why is Frank calling you?

                                      LAUREL
                          (caught)
                    What? 

                                      MICHAELA
                    I saw your phone, Laurel.  What the
                    hell's going on?

And as Michaela, Patrick, and Wes all stare at her, waiting for
an answer, we HOLD ON LAUREL'S SCARED FACE AND FLASHBACK TO --                                                                                     42.


Laurel, 4 months earlier, knocks on the front door.  Frank answers.  

                                      LAUREL
                    Frank, hi, I'm in DeWitt's class.  

                                      FRANK
                    Shouldn't you be at that party?

                                      LAUREL
                    I hate those things.  And  I saw
                    something today at the courthouse
                    that I think you should know about.

And as Frank wonders what she means, we TIME CUT TO:


Another day in court.

                                      ANNALISE (PRE-LAP)
                    Your honor, this is a trick!


Our Four now reach the same spot where we first met them, as they
drag the rug to the middle of the clearing.  Exhausted, chests
heaving, they all collapse on the ground.  Except for Wes.

                                    WES
                    Come on, get up, we have to do this.  

They don't move.  So beaten down.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    I SAID GET UP!

They finally stand as we STAY ON Wes, who now pulls a BOTTLE OF
LIGHTER FLUID from the 7-11 bag.  And as we realize, they're going
to burn the body, we HOLD ON a tireless Wes and FLASHBACK TO:


A victorious Annalise stands with Gina before a GROUP OF REPORTERS.  

                                      ANNALISE
                    I took this case pro bono knowing an
                    innocent woman had been scapegoated
                    by a desperate, overworked D.A.'s
                    office.  Gina is and always has been
                    innocent and we're just so happy the
                    jury was able to see that...

At the bottom of the steps, our students watch, in absolute awe.  

                                      MICHAELA
                    I want to be her.

                                      PATRICK
                    Me too.                                                                                     56.

                                      LAUREL
                          (quiet)
                    I don't.

Wes looks to Laurel, noticing that she's watching Agnes Levinson
stand at a nearby curb as Arthur's nurse helps him into the car. 
Agnes is looking straight at Gina, the two of them sharing a
knowing, conspiratorial smile.  And then Agnes climbs into the
car, Wes now whispering to Laurel...

                                    WES
                    What do you know?

Laurel turns to Wes.  Debating whether to tell him.  

                                      LAUREL
                    Nothing.

And as Laurel leaves, we go OFF WES, watching Annalise with the
press and wondering whether this case was all one big lie...


Wes catches up to Annalise.  

                                    WES
                    Professor DeWitt!

                                      ANNALISE
                    Wes.  How can I help you?

She smiles, like there are no secrets between them.  A beat passes
as Wes gathers the strength to say this.

                                    WES
                    So that detective...?

                                      ANNALISE
                    Is my boyfriend.  Yes.

She holds his look.  Direct.  Unapologetic.  And before he even
knows what he's doing, he says --

                                    WES
                    I don't want the job.  Not if you
                    picked me because of that.

                                      ANNALISE
                    That?                                                                                     58.

                                    WES
                    You got him to lie on the stand. 
                    About there being doctored videos...

Annalise just looks at him, her face revealing nothing.  She takes
a step closer.  Intense yet calm.

                                      ANNALISE
                    Is that why I picked you?  Because I
                    thought I picked you for showing
                    initiative coming to my office that
                    night.  And because your directed
                    verdict idea showed you think outside
                    the box.  And because your self
                    defense argument proved you were
                    good on your feet.  Those are all
                    qualities I look for in my employees. 
                    I was excited for you to be one of
                    them.  But now that you've exposed
                    exactly what you think of yourself,
                    that you don't believe you deserve
                    this job--

                                    WES
                    That's not what I--

                                      ANNALISE
                    That is exactly what you said.  Right
                    before you accused me of having my
                    boyfriend lie under oath to win this
                    case.  We won because of our defense --
                    pinning it on the business partner,
                    discrediting an eye-witness, making
                    the jury feel for Gina.  But of course
                    you don't understand that because
                    you don't understand anything.  You're
                    a 1L -- soft, uneducated, dumb.  So
                    dumb you might still decide to turn
                    down this job.

Wes stops, looking up at her, surprised.

                                      ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                    Yes, I'm letting you reconsider. 
                    Think carefully because everything
                    that comes after this moment will
                    determine not the type of career you
                    have, but life.  You can either spend
                    it in a sad corporate office drafting
                    contracts and hitting on chubby
                    paralegals until finally putting a
                    gun in your mouth...or you can join
                    my firm and become a person who does
                    something with his life.  So decide. 
                    Now.  Do you want the job or not?

Off Wes, both repulsed and attracted, terrified and excited...                                                                                     59.



Annalise parks her car in front of the garage, then steps out,
heading toward the back door when she SUDDENLY STOPS, gasping.

We REVERSE to see a dark, angry Nate now stepping out of the dark. 
Annalise looks scared, her eyes now darting around for an escape
path.  It's dark here though, far off from the street, only a
small light from the back door casting shadows over their faces.                                                                                     60.

                                      ANNALISE
                    Tom's inside.

                                    NATE
                    Good.  Maybe he'll catch us.  You
                    wouldn't mind that though, right? 
                    You were all ready to out us today
                    in that courtroom anyway...

                                      ANNALISE
                    I would never have done that.

                                    NATE
                    No.  You just wanted to threaten me
                    with it.

                                      ANNALISE
                    Nate...

                                    NATE
                    Just tell me this -- it was a long
                    con, right?  You picking me up that
                    night?  Screwing me all these months? 
                    All because you knew that, eventually,
                    you'd need to use me for a case?

                                      ANNALISE
                    Don't be dramatic.

Now Nate CHARGES her, PINNING her against the garage, his fingers
digging into her shoulders, so full of rage and desperation.

                                    NATE
                    You made me lie under oath!  Sell
                    out my department, the people I work
                    with!  Don't you get that?!  Or do
                    you just not care?!  You just use
                    people, right?!  Collect them and
                    screw them and spit them out when
                    you're done!  That's what gets you
                    off!  It doesn't matter whose life
                    is ruined in the process, just as
                    long as you win and go home to your
                    big house and trust fund husband who
                    never learned how to screw you right!

A long beat as Annalise takes in his fury.  But if she's scared,
she isn't showing it.  Instead she speaks calmly, coolly...

                                      ANNALISE
                    I never lied about how I feel about
                    you.

He holds her look, debating whether to trust her.  Finally, he
takes a step back, getting control.  A long moment passes.                                                                                     61.

                                      ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                    And let's be clear -- you're the one
                    who picked me up.

And now she's smiling, sexy and flirty and in control, which is
all Nate needs to push her up against the garage, kissing her
hungrily, her kissing him back.  And as they tear at each other's
clothes, gasping and grinding and engaging in the kind of public,
messy, animal sex we'd never dare have ourselves, we move to...


A REPORTER stands outside the Kappa house.  Police cars and
spectators are in the background.   

                                      REPORTER
                    Police are confirming that a woman's
                    body was found inside the Kappa Alpha
                    Theta house on Middleton's campus...


Our four, no longer strangers, standing around the BODY, its face
still hidden from us.  Patrick, Michaela, and Laurel finish placing
scraps of wood around the body as Wes pulls out a box of matches.

                                    WES
                    Okay.  Last chance.  Either we all
                    agree or we stop right now.

                                      MICHAELA
                    Just do it.

                                      LAUREL
                    Hurry, so the bonfire can cover the
                    smoke.

And they all look to Patrick, who is a wreck, but finally nods.

                                      PATRICK
                    It's the only way to destroy the
                    DNA.

Finally, Wes lights the match.  And it's only now that the light
exposes the FACE OF THE MURDER VICTIM.  It's Tom, Annalise's
husband.  And as Wes drops the match, Tom's body BURSTING INTO
FLAMES, the four of them watching their lives change forever,
knowing there's no going back, we...FADE OUT.
