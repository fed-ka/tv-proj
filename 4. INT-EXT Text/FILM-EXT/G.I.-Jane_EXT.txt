CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
Buttoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down
marble steps to reach a pair of limousines.
Hayes and two
FLAG OFFICERS wait.
HAYES
Well?
WHITE HOUSE #2
(shaking hand)
Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.
POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
Winterscape:
Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends
through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow,
morning water calm.
There's an almost hallowed beauty to
it all.
Soon we pick out...
A spot of day-glo.
Coming out of the mouth of morning.
Overtaking the floes.
CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL.
She pushes her flat-water kayak
downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time.
Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington
bridge, she passes...
Cars overhead.
Grid-locked by snow conditions.
In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic
behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument.
Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket.
She rips through
velcro to free a cell phone.
JORDAN
Lieutenant O'Neil.
ROYCE (V.O.)
Gotta situation here.
Where are
you?
Stuck in traffic?
JORDAN
(checking dive watch)
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir.
Watcha got?
POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
Riding the current, Jordan blows a troubled sigh as she
accesses the file of her brain.
Drifting past the
Jefferson Memorial:
JORDAN
North Korean beaches are the best
protected, most heavily monitored in
the world.
The civilian population
is so propagandized that it acts as
an Early Warning system.
Extraction
team has to be small and silent --
I'd go with Seals over Delta Force.
Problem is, don't want to hold a
conventional sub off-shore for
target practice.
Where's The Polk?
INTERCUTTING:
ROYCE
Halfway 'round the world.
So that's
the problem -- we can get the team
in, just not out.
JORDAN
(an inspired beat)
Unless you Whiskey Run.
ROYCE
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
JORDAN
Quick-hit technique used by Capone.
Rigged a getaway car with running
boards and handles.
All his guys
had to do was jump on and take a
ride.
Check the files -- DPRK-57 --
I doped it out as a contingency
plan:
Seal Team infiltrates, picks
up the package, links up with
recovery sub.
But don't waste time
opening and closing hatches.
They
just grab the periscope and hang on
for neutral waters.
A dubious beat.
ROYCE
You expect the extraction team to
ride the sub bare-back?
Is that
correct, O'Neil?
JORDAN
Only four minutes to neutral waters,
sir.
Why not?
Silence on the radio:
They're discussing her scenario
privately.
During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of
the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.
On the far bank
lies...
Naval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication
antennae.
Jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response.
ROYCE
All right, sending the
recommendation across the river.
Royce out.
The phone goes dead.
JORDAN
No, thank you, sir.
SECURITY STATION - N.I.C. - DAY
Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian
employees transit a security station on their way inside.
Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and
balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.
She flashes a
photo-badge and double-times inside.
GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - NIGHT
A small gunkhole harbor up the Potomac.
Snow falls thick
and silent on overturned canoes, stored for the winter.
Beyond stands a clapboard rental house.
CORONADO BRIDGE - SAN DIEGO - DAY
Jordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping
Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead.
A flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge.
Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the
pelicans.
THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
On base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt
courtyard.
The is "the grinder," reminiscent of a
gladiator's arena.
She notices at one end...
A silver ship's bell.
Hung prominently.
B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
The Spec-Recon TRAINEES loiter outside their open rooms,
pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman
tapes.
This is the last day of liberty they'll have for a
long time.
MILLER
What am I scannin' here?
Other eyes quickly lock in on...
Jordan.
Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground
floor of an identical building, trying to match key number
to room number.
Every door is open, every room empty.
Soon she feels the presence of...
The men.
They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten,
twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut.
These guys
are what Hitler saw in his dreams.
Jordan picks up her pace.
Where the hell is her room?
On all three levels of their building, the men shadow
Jordan en masse.
Not hooting.
Not leering.
Just
assessing.
Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building:
She's got the entire floor to herself.
With a last look
over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside.
THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
C.O.
Special Reconnaissance.
Here you
will be trained to infiltrate
hostile territory... to be the real-
time eyes on the ground... to
recover assigned targets and, if
need be, to fight your way out under
adverse conditions.
CAMERA SURVEYS faces of the trainees:
MILLER, MCCOOL,
SLUTNIK, CORTEZ, FLEA, STAMM, ENGLAND, NEWBERRY, WICKWIRE.
We'll get to know them later.
Dressed in Navy greens,
they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in
hand.
Pacing before them:
C.O.
That is all that will be said about
the special nature of this class --
by us or by you.
Many of you have
waited years for admission to this
program.
Opportunities like this
are rare -- and those who seize upon
them are rarer still.
He approaches Jordan.
We can tell what she's thinking.
"Just keep moving.
Don't single me out."
C.O.
Other than that, there is little to
be said but "Good luck, gentleman."
(correcting)
"Gentlepersons."
Jordan flinches.
C.O.
Now I turn you over to the chief
training officer.
He has earned six
naval commendations, the purple
heart, and the Navy Cross for
heroism and valor.
I give you
Master Chief John James Urgayle.
Taking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment,
sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him,
too:
His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50.
An ageless warrior.
Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs
in this guy's veins.
The Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo --
and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is
expecting:
THE CHIEF
The sun and moon... the ebb and flow
of the Pacific tides... global
warming... the very angle of the
Earth upon its axis... these are
just some of the things I control in
my world.
Trainees swap private looks.
MCCOOL
We're fucked.
SLUTNIK
Darth Vader reads poetry...
MCCOOL
We are so fucked.
BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - DAY
START on boots, crashing through shallow surf, spraying
water.
We assume this is a routine beach run -- until
VIEW RISES to reveal...
Telephone poles on their shoulder.
Working in groups of
10, trainees labor under 300-pound poles.
Jordan, six
inches shorter than most, looks like Atlas carrying the
weight of the world.
But she's doing it.
INSTRUCTOR
Count down... one, two... count
down... three, four...
CLASS CADENCE
One, two, three, four... One, two,
three, four...
An ambulance shadows the class.
Perched on the front
bumper like an hood-ornament, the Chief keeps working his
bullhorn:
THE CHIEF
You may think that you are the
brightest, the best, the strongest.
I assure you, that is a total
delusion on your part.
It is my job
to show you just how weak human
beings can truly be.
60 percent of
you will not finish this course.
How do I know?
Because that is an
historical fact.
It's also intimidating shit.
THE CHIEF
Poles down.
The earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp
sand.
Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh
batteries into his bullhorn.
He does it like a man
thumbing rounds into a shotgun.
THE CHIEF
Now for the bad new:
I always like
to get one quitter on the first day.
And until I do, the first day does
not end.
So look around right now
-- go on, do it.
I wonder who it's
gonna be...
He passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.
He's the Chief's bulldog.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Down to BVDs!
The guys strip down to boxers.
Jordan settles for boxers
and jog bra.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Now face the Pacific... link arms...
and take a stroll!
The class wades in.
The first wave takes Jordan's breath
away:
It's February, and the water is cold.
When they
move out of instructors' earshot:
STAMM
What is it with the damn phone
poles?
We sign up for Spec-Recon or
GTE?
WICKWIRE
Just trying to thin the herd.
That's all they want to do right
now.
Some of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on
a cheap wet T-shirt contest.
Jordan covers herself
instinctively -- and hates the instinct.
Modesty isn't
going to get her through this.
SLUTNIK
Man.
Doesn't she know it's rude to
point?
NEWBERRY
Wow.
You see that girl?
WICKWIRE
I got eyes, Newberry.
SLUTNIK
One night.
Just one night in my
room, she'd forget all about playin'
commando.
ENGLAND
Tone that shit down, Slutnik.
You
heard with they said.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Out of the water!
The class breaks for the beach.
THE CHIEF
Now make like sugar cookies and roll
in the sand for me.
The trainees hit their bellies and roll.
Indeed, they
look like sugar cookies.
THE CHIEF
Collect those poles, gentlemen.
Still a lotta beachfront you haven't
seen...
Groaning, the trainees grab poles.
Jordan's pole, wet
slips from their collective grasp...
And bangs Stamm's ankle.
He HOWLS through his teeth.
ENGLAND
How bad?
Stamm?
JORDAN
We better get a medic over --
STAMM
No, goddamnit.
No.
INSTRUCTOR
Up!
Up!
Up!
Up!
Stamm swallows the pain.
Poles go back on shoulders.
Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down
the beach.
MUD PIT - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Wallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic
sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where
trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder
blades and push their crotches skyward.
THE CHIEF
Pain is your friend.
You ally.
It
will keep you awake in times of
emergency... it will tell you when
you are seriously injured... it will
keep you angry and remind you to
finish the job and get the hell
home.
But you know the best thing
about pain?
CLASS
No, sir!
THE CHIEF
It lets you know that you aren't
dead yet.
Instructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into
proper position.
Jordan struggles with the reverses.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Go regulation if you can't do the
reverses, O'Neil.
She looks around.
A lot of the guys are having trouble
with the reverses, not just her.
JORDAN
Thank you, sir.
But I like these
just fine.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
JORDAN
I'll try anyway, sir.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
You'll try what we tell you to try,
O'Neil.
Go regulation.
She switches to standard push-ups, her face disappearing
into the ooze with every downstroke.
Soon the Chief's
boots slosh into FRAME.
He's still looking for his human
sacrifice.
THE CHIEF
Who's it gonna be.
I just wonder,
who is it gonna be...
BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - SUNSET
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
On your belly... on your back... on
your feet... on your belly... on
your back... on your feet...
Whistle-drills.
Silhouetted against a lowering sun, the
students flop around like docked fish.
THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
THE CHIEF
You have noticed a ship's bell
hanging at the west side of this
courtyard.
If, at any time, you
feel you cannot continue with your
training -- that bell is your
salvation.
Strike it three times,
and the ordeal is over.
Nervous eyes flick to the bell.
THE CHIEF
Yes, it is a long walk.
So I'll
make it as easy as I can.
He turns his back to the class.
THE CHIEF
Now you don't have to watch me
watching you break rank.
Because I
know someone here wants to do it.
CAMERA SEARCHES their faces.
There isn't one trainee here
who hasn't thought about it.
Including Jordan.
THE CHIEF
Now I know what you're thinking...
SLUTNIK
(low)
I'm thinkin' we could jump him right
now...
THE CHIEF
"Can I really take 15 weeks of this
bubonic asshole?"
If you don't know
the answer to that question, the
answer is "No, you cannot."
And
that is another historical fact.
So
do it.
Admit you don't have what it
takes... admit you are out of your
depth -- or we're all heading back
to the beach right now.
(waiting a beat)
Instructors!
Time hack!
Following the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive
watches.
THE CHIEF
Six... five... four... three...
two... one... HACK!
(to class)
The time is now 12-hundred.
The sun
is shining brightly.
Plenty of
daylight left for another phone-pole
run...
GROANS behind him.
The groans give way to the SOUND OF
BOOTS breaking rank.
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
QUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to
watch someone cross the grinder.
At least we know who it
isn't.
CLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.
He
turns around to find...
Stamm at the bell.
For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan.
Was he expecting her?
THE CHIEF
Leave your helmet there, Stamm.
Back to the barracks.
Stamm drops his helmet and limps away.
THE CHIEF
The rest of you should remember one
thing.
The only easy day was today.
Lieutenant Wickwire?
Turning it
over to you.
WICKWIRE
Cuh-lass, face right!
They march off.
B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Jordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry.
She
fishes for keys at her door.
VOICE
It's not so much that they hate
you...
Jordan looks.
Someone is sitting on an outdoor table,
smoking.
He leans into the light so she can see his face.
It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class
officer.
He's dangerously handsome.
WICKWIRE
They're more afraid of you.
JORDAN
Well, now I feel so much better.
WICKWIRE
It was made clear before you came --
harassment equals career suicide.
Can't say anything good, so they
don't say much at all.
To your
face, anyway.
JORDAN
Whose orders were those?
WICKWIRE
It was made clear.
(getting up)
Anyway, stay ballsy.
First week's
hell, then it levels out.
Until
S.E.R.E. training, anyway.
That's
hell-and-a-half.
JORDAN
And how do you know that?
WICKWIRE
Made it to Week 10 last time.
JORDAN
I didn't know they let you try
again.
Especially at your age.
WICKWIRE
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across
the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings.
Back across no-man's land.
SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - CORONADO - DAY
A PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the
base.
He's peering through a 600mm lens.
PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:
FOCUSING through cyclone fencing...
PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad
trainees gathered at an obstacle course.
OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
An explosion of sand:
England and Wickwire belly-flop
into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire.
Clear,
they gain their feet and blitz toward...
The rolling logs.
They balance-beam their way to...
The rope climb.
Racing to the top, they reach a platform
and fling themselves down onto...
The high poles.
They land awkwardly, losing their wind
and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before...
Racing for the finish.
The Chief thumbs a stopwatch.
THE CHIEF
England, 88 seconds.
You're good to
go for the slide-for-life.
Wickwire, roll back till you get
south of 90.
WICKWIRE
Fuck.
Yes sir.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Who'd you kiss to get back in here,
anyway?
Wickwire dusts off and starts back for...
The starting line.
Stepping up next is Cortez, the human
fighting cock.
Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up
for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall.
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
Hang on, here...
He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the
base of the wall.
It's a little two-step platform.
SNICKERS, MOANS from the guys.
Cortez can barely contain
his disgust.
CORTEZ
Aw, what is this...
JORDAN
(mortified)
Sir...
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but
it's gotta go out.
(calling out)
Five... four... three...
JORDAN
I can make this wall without --
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
... two... one... MARK!
Cortez blurs away.
Jordan starts a step late.
Cortez takes the wall clean.
Eschewing the two-step,
Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out
because of it.
She takes the wall awkwardly.
INTERCUT the others as they break rank to follow, eager to
see Cortez blow her off the course.
CLASS
Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!
Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going
under the barbed wire.
CORTEZ
Shit of a saint...
Catching up, Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and
leads going into...
The rolling logs.
They both tight-rope across nimbly and
bound on toward...
Rope climb.
Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but
Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar,
doubling her speed.
CLASS
Take her, take her here, Cortez...
lookit that monkey-man go... hoo-
yah, hoo-yah...
Cortez reaches the top platform.
Now he's faced with...
The high poles.
He's seen others land sideways and pay
the price.
Trying another way, Cortez takes a flying
leap...
And WHUMPS down with legs astraddle.
He tried to cushion
the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently.
His balls took the brunt.
Jordan WHUMPS down beside him with legs astraddle -- and
shoots Cortez a "Hey, no problem" look.
She rolls off the
poles...
And drops to the pit below.
Cortez lands right behind.
Now it's a flat-out sprint for...
The finish line.
He takes her at the tape.
THE CHIEF
Cortez, 93 seconds.
O'Neil, 94.
Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery
on your gonads and line up again.
O'Neil... move ahead.
Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around.
JORDAN
Say again, sir?
THE CHIEF
You heard me.
Move on.
CORTEZ
Aw, this is such bullshit...
Others GRUMBLE in commiseration.
Jordan flushes with
anger.
JORDAN
Chief, sir, I don't understand
why --
THE CHIEF
Educate her, Pyro.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Automatic five-second deduction,
which slips you under the wire.
It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil
-- standard procedure for all
females in physical training
courses.
Where you been the last
few years?
JORDAN
What "all females"?
If I'm the
only --
THE CHIEF
Twice now, I have said the words
"move on."
He turns his back, leaving no possibility of discussion.
Jordan stares after.
SLUTNIK
Can't live with them, can't kill
them.
What's the point?
MCCOOL
Somebody throw a tent over this
circus.
WICKWIRE
(low to Jordan)
Just let it go.
If it's in your
favor, just shut the hell up and
take it.
B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Dressed in bathrobe, Jordan reaches her door.
She pauses
to check...
The outdoor table.
No visitors tonight.
B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
The men' building.
Slutnik and a few others loiter on a
balcony, mirroring her stare.
CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Hastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base.
Her
march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking
lots... jumps hedges... and finally reaches...
C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
An on-base bungalow.
Jordan bangs on the front door until
the C.O.'S scowling face appears.
JORDAN
Pardon the hour, sir.
But you told
me to come to you immediately if I
felt I was being mistreated in any
way.
C.O.
Didn't take long.
He waves her inside.
B.O.Q. BUILDING - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
... marches across the no-man's land...
OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
START on flares igniting overhead.
FOLLOW the flares as
they parachute down into the surf to illuminate...
The class, standing in one long line, arms linked.
As
black waves knock out their legs, we're reminded of show
girls kicking their way through some macabre review.
BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Firing flare guns and working their bullhorns:
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
58 degrees this morning!
That's not
a bad water temp, really -- if
you're standing where we are!
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
Slurred speech, lack of proper motor
control, short-term amnesia -- all
early signs of hypothermia!
Advanced hypothermia is easy to
detect in a classmate!
He'll look
like he's dead!
THE CHIEF
Body heat.
In situations of extreme
cold, you can always count on body
heat to keep you alive -- and I do
not mean your own.
We will break
you of the cultural barriers that
dictate you should not invade
another man's space.
Are any of you
in a situation of extreme cold right
now?
INTERCUTTING trainees and instructors:
CLASS
Yes, sir!
THE CHIEF
Then why aren't you all over the man
next to you?
The class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank.
Behind Jordan, Montgomery (a.k.a. "Flea") hesitates:
He's a bantam-weight from Georgia, his manners bred into
the bone.
He just can't find a delicate way to grab
Jordan without mounting her.
JORDAN
Just do it, okay?
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
If you can't feel the other guy's
pecker, you ain't in tight enough!
I want nuts to butts!
JORDAN
Come on, Montgomery...
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
Flea!
O'Neil!
Why is there a break
in that line?
Finally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead
and mounts him.
The class closes down into a long human
snake.
JORDAN
(in his ear)
Montgomery, why do they call you
"Flea"?
FLEA
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" --
but that gets whittled down to just
"Flea."
For short, ma'am.
JORDAN
So it really has nothing to do with
actual brain size?
FLEA
No, ma'am.
JORDAN
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect
you just showed me.
But I don't
need it and don't want it -- not
that kind of respect, anyway.
It's
just gonna hurt us both, okay?
FLEA
I'll work on it, ma'am.
JORDAN
Do that.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
(to the Chief)
Time.
THE CHIEF
Check your watch, Pyro.
Seems fast.
CAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water.
Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.
Badly.
JORDAN
Hey.
You okay, Flea?
FLEA
'Snot me.
It's him.
Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's
shuddering.
Jordan feels him shaking through Flea.
MILLER
Jesus, my hands... they aren't
workin' right...
NEWBERRY
How long i'zis for?
WICKWIRE
'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals,
no more.
NEWBERRY
Swear each time's gettin' longer.
MCCOOL
This where you bailed last time,
Wick?
WICKWIRE
Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February
last time, either.
FLEA
How you doin', Miller?
Miller?
No answer.
Bad sign.
On shore:
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
22 minutes...
Ignoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn:
THE CHIEF
Remember, all this is completely
voluntary.
For any of you who don't
want to continue, Instructor Johns
is now serving coffee and danish at
the ambulance.
A portable light comes on.
Indeed, an instructor is
setting up coffee service.
THE CHIEF
Any takers?
SLUTNIK
He's the fuckin' Antichrist.
MCCOOL
Wick!
They really got donuts over
there?
Or just some'a last night's
dinner rolls?
FLEA
Look like donuts to me...
JORDAN
(in disbelief)
What're you guys doing?
Huh?
MCCOOL
Just askin'
JORDAN
What, you gonna give it all up for a
maple twist?
How dumb you gotta be?
That's exactly what they --
Suddenly the line rips apart.
It's Miller, breaking for
shore.
CLASS
NO!
Soon the dyke is bursting everywhere:
Four others break
rank, following Miller's lead.
The deserters stagger onto the beach.
MEDICS close in
quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in
their faces, asking brain-check question.
MEDICS
Tell me what day this is... look at
me now... what city are you from,
sailor... here, look right here...
A medic nods to the Chief.
No hypothermia.
Not yet.
THE CHIEF
You want another minute to think
about this?
Huh?
(no response; to
Miller directly)
Do any of you want to reconsider?
Avoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head.
THE CHIEF
Johnson.
Get 'em out of my scan.
It's a death sentence.
As the quitters slouch for the
coffee truck...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
By my watch... which, of course
appears to be broken... they've been
in 27 minutes without the benefit of
protective gear.
TIGHT on the Chief.
Scanning the remaining trainees.
Thinking about holding out out for one more.
TIGHT on Jordan.
Knowing who he's waiting for.
Wondering
if she can outlast him.
THE CHIEF
(into bullhorn)
Everybody out.
With a SHIVERING CHEER, the trainees stampede ashore,
grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives.
Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:
They've conquered a
common enemy.
But when she tries to get high-fived...
The guys turn their backs.
It's a cold rebuff, worse then
any water.
HOLD TIGHT on Jordan.
Shivering.
Watching the guys drift
away.
Hating them.
WICKWIRE
Hey.
Way to gut it out.
JORDAN
Thanks, Wick.
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign,
tall and striking.
Passing the bell, Blondell checks
on...
The helmets lined up beneath.
A dozen already.
An O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees
double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a
beach run.
Among them, still, is Jordan.
It brings a
Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Change those clothes, be back here
in six minutes!
And I am timing
you!
The class scatters.
Slutnik hits the brakes when he sees
Blondell and her friend.
SLUTNIK
Jesus Christ.
And I only got three
minutes apiece...
ENGLAND
(jerking him away)
Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik.
You ain't their type.
Overhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now
realizing.
Their eyes meet.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
O'Neil!
What're you gawking at?
BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
150-pound rubber boats ("Zodiacs") litter the beach.
The
class is breaking down into six-man crews.
THE CHIEF
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl,
Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise.
Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior
officer.
Follow his orders to your
death.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Get it up!
Crew Five finds their Zodiac, hoists it onto their heads.
THE CHIEF
Boat Six -- England, O'Neil, McCool,
Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik.
Lieutenant England is your senior
officer.
Jordan rolls her eyes:
At least two of the guys in her
crew are blue-ribbon misogynists.
Cortez and Slutnik
don't like it any better.
JORDAN
Ah, c'mon...
CORTEZ
Motherachrist...
SLUTNIK
Me?
Again?
THE CHIEF
(looking up)
Somebody got a problem with the
muster?
JORDAN
Fine by me, sir!
CORTEZ
No problem, sir!
SLUTNIK
Full of joy here, sir!
Exchanging looks across their Zodiac, Jordan and her new
crewmates lift the boat overhead.
THE CHIEF
Boat Seven...
BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
With BATTLE CRIES, 12 boat crews charge into the teeth of
the POUNDING SURF.
Some lose their boat to the first
wave; others clear the surf and scramble aboard.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
(into bullhorn)
First crew to finish gets hot food
and warm racks for the night!
Rest
of you are digging hide-sites and
eating earthworms tonight!
OCEAN - DAY
Beyond the breakers, the Zodiacs run parallel to shore,
crews paddling furiously, racing the wind, the sun, the
other crews.
Instructors shadow in power boats,
stopwatches running.
BOAT SIX - OCEAN - DAY
McCool
Don't wanna be pickin' no sandcrabs
outta my ass tonight!
ENGLAND
So shutup and stroke, McCool!
SLUTNIK
Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah!
Flea checks on Jordan.
She paddles hard, really digging
in.
Flea grins:
On some level, he has to admire this
women.
Jordan catches the grin, gives one back.
Ahead, buoys mark the finish line.
And just when it seems
victory is at hand...
THWUNK.
Something hits Boat Six.
Suddenly it's losing
air.
Jordan torques around to see...
The Chief on a nearby boat, speargun in hand.
THE CHIEF
Your boat just hit razor coral.
What do you do now?
ENGLAND
Patch and pump!
C'mon!
Whose ass
is on the kit?
MCCOOL
I say keep paddlin'!
We're
almost --
ENGLAND
Forget it, McCool!
Pri One is to
save the boat, not win a race!
So
let's get on it!
They flail to save their sinking boat.
Boat Five noses
past, stealing the lead.
Wickwire tosses Jordan a passing
look.
"Sorry, but..."
UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Up and down the dunes, crews are digging "hide-sites" --
six-man holes that will be their homes tonight.
Cortez
and Slutnik are uprooting shrubs, collecting camouflage
material.
CORTEZ
Four years I petition to get into
this program.
Four years.
Finally
get here, and now it's co-ed?
Such
bullshit.
Now I'm gettin' hammered
just 'cuz she's on our crew.
SLUTNIK
Least you don't have to sleep with
her every goddamn night.
CORTEZ
Tellin' you, I'd rather be the last
class with balls than the first one
with chicks.
CUT TO:
UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Jordan and Flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of
their hide-site.
England and McCool shovel back to back.
MCCOOL
Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a
Navy man.
Wanted to fire them big
guns on a big-ass battleship.
But
Navy said to him, "Oh, no.
You can
only do one thing on a battleship."
"Well what's that?" grandaddy said.
"Cook," they said.
Now this ain't
100 years ago -- I'm talkin' United
States Navy, middla World War II.
And you know the reason they gave
him?
You know why they tol' my
grandaddy he couldn't fight for his
country?
ENGLAND
He talked too much?
MCCOOL
"Negroes can't see at night.
Bad
night vision."
JORDAN
You're kiddin' me.
Jordan jumps in the hole, ready to take over shoveling.
MCCOOL
See, you just the new nigger on the
block, O'Neil.
That's all.
And
maybe you moved in too early.
He climbs out.
HOLD on Jordan, looking off down the
dunes, seeing the other crews covering up and going
underground for the night.
How the hell did she wind up
here?
So far from home?
SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - DAY
A Jeep speeds along the public highway, carrying the C.O.
back to base.
When the Jeep tops a rise:
C.O.
What in God's name...
Ahead, a half-dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder.
All cameras are trained on the base.
BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
And blasts outside, intending to shake some answers out of
Bald Spot.
But here Royce finds...
A dozen naval officers waiting for their cars.
All of
them now wear caps.
Royce tries to check faces of the quickly departing men.
but it could have been anyone.
DISSOLVE TO:
OCEAN - DAY
A high-speed transport ("Seafox") is SLAMMING OVER SWELLS.
Lashed to one side is a rubber life boat.
SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY
THE CHIEF
Crew Six!
Stand by!
ENGLAND
Flea!
'Cool!
O'Neil!
Cortez!
Slutnik!
In that order!
Five-
second intervals!
Let's go!
England's crew lines up for cast-and-recover drills:
One
by one, they speed-roll off the transport...
... and drop into the life boat.
After quickly
stabilizing, they roll off the life boat...
... and disappear underwater like human bullets.
England
is last to cast off.
OCEAN - DAY
Jordan resurfaces.
Treading water, she scans for...
Seafox.
It makes a hard turn in the water and starts
back.
The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is
lowered into position.
Still hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse
order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez.
They each stab an arm
through the passing loop...
SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY
... and vault back aboard, slick as hell.
CORTEZ
Hoo-yah!
Better'n sex in a car
crash!
But now they're bearing down fast on...
OCEAN - DAY
Jordan.
She braces as best she can.
As SEAFOX THUNDERS
past, she stabs for the loop...
And snags it with her hand.
But only her hand.
Hanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential
water.
Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it.
If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown.
SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY
At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the
boat's wake.
THE CHIEF
(to pilot)
Next recovery!
Keep goin', keep
goin'!
OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
COUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward
McCool and Flea.
They make textbook recoveries.
She's
the only one who couldn't cut it.
MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
BLONDELL (O.S.)
S.E.R.E. training coming up.
Eating at a table with other women, Jordan turns to see
Blondell setting down her tray.
BLONDELL
They take you away to San Clemente
Island.
Half the guys quit when
they come back.
Supposed to be just
hell-and-a-half.
JORDAN
That's what I hear.
BLONDELL
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant?
How come you're doing this?
I mean,
we're kinda curious.
JORDAN
Who's "we"?
BLONDELL
Just some of the women.
QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Walking across the base:
JORDAN
I don't know if there's any single
reason.
But my father was Navy.
And he had this old-time recruiting
poster in his den.
It showed a girl
trying on a sailor's uniform while
saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man!
I'd join the Navy!"
Was maybe 10
years old when I first saw it, and
even then it felt wrong.
Made me
mad.
And I don't think a month has
gone by that I haven't thought about
that poster.
"Gee, I wish I were a
man."
BLONDELL
I've been accused of that wish.
JORDAN
The woman I saw you with...
BLONDELL
Just a friend.
We have friends,
too, you know.
JORDAN
But are there... I mean, how many...
BLONDELL
More than you'd guess.
It's just
that we don't hold coffee klatches.
If more then three of us get
together at any one time, the guys
think it's some kind of uprising.
They laugh.
BLONDELL
Sounds funny now, but it's really
not.
We have to be careful.
The
Navy still knows how to put on a
witch-hunt.
Reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board.
Jordan finds a half-dozen phone slips for her.
JORDAN
Royce...
PHONE KIOSK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Jordan sighs and slumps against the phone kiosk.
Where to
start?
ROYCE (V.O.)
That bad?
JORDAN
I feel like there's men here,
there's women here -- then there's
men.
But hey, what'd I expect?
INTERCUTTING Jordan and Royce:
ROYCE
Well, not this.
I was doing the
Pentagon scene few nights ago.
Got
some fresh stuff -- about you.
You
may be in a hostile camp.
I think
someone may be taking steps to
ensure that you crash and burn.
JORDAN
Me?
Why me?
ROYCE
Don't you know?
How they're talking
about you?
JORDAN
I saw an article...
ROYCE
I can't walk two blocks in
Washington without hearing about
"G.I. Jane."
You're all over the
place, and whether you wanted it or
not, the feminists are sizing you up
for that poster.
Jordan's face sours with an errant thought.
JORDAN
So why are you telling me this?
ROYCE
Big symbols make big targets,
Jordan.
I think someone's gunning
for you.
JORDAN
You know, Royce, I got enough heat
on me without you turning up the
jets, too.
ROYCE
I'm only trying to warn you in
case --
JORDAN
Well, let me warm you:
I'm going
though with this.
The more
everybody fucks with me, fucks with
my head, the more it just makes me
want to finish.
So don't expect me
back crying in your arms any time
soon, okay?
ROYCE
That's not what I want, Jordan.
I
mean... it is and it isn't...
JORDAN
Still can't make up your mind, huh?
Gotta go, Royce.
ROYCE
Jordan.
You watch your ass.
JORDAN
Sure.
I'll join the crowd.
AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
A HELO WARMS UP on its pad.
Crew Six approaches, garbed in black wetsuits, loaded down
with weapons and rucksacks.
Jordan is at the lead.
OCEAN - NIGHT
The helo swoops low over the water, moon silhouetting.
Black figures helo-cast into the ocean.
OCEAN - NIGHT
... and knifes into black water.
The HELO PATTERS away.
An inky stillness overtakes the world.
Jordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around,
revealing her position to...
Her crew.
Five black faces regroup around her.
SLUTNIK
Feel right at home, McCool?
They secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks.
Jordan checks a heat-bearing compass.
JORDAN
(nodding direction)
South-southeast.
And I don't want
to hear another word till we're
underground.
Pushing rucksacks ahead of them, they start swimming
towards...
A moonlit shoreline.
Half-mile ahead.
ROCKY SHORELINE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT
Jordan's crew reaches shallow water.
They deflate their
vests and rucksacks.
Jordan trades her face mask for
night-vision goggles.
NIGHT-VISION POV:
Sweeping the rocks.
Nothing at first.
Then two "hostiles" appear, patrolling the rocks.
Jordan motions "down."
Six faces sink from sight.
NIGHT-VISION/UNDERWATER POV:
Of the "hostile" patrol
moving on.
They resurface.
On Jordan's cue, the crew sheds flippers
and begins scaling rocks.
They've made landfall.
HIDE-SITE MONTAGE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT
MONTAGE:
Racing the coming sun, Jordan's crew builds
their hide-site... digging feverishly... filling sand
bags... telescoping open a roof pole, fanning out spars...
laying canvas roof panels into place... camouflaging the
panels... sprinkling sanitizing powder around the
perimeter to ward off animals.
INTERCUT WITH...
A snake slithering across the ground.
As it nears the
hide-site...
A knife whacks its head off.
Slutnik picks up the carcass, kicks dirt over the severed
head.
No trace.
SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
CAMERA PANS the island, awash in morning light.
Woodlands
lie distant.
A road is the only man-made feature -- until
in FOREGROUND, we find a spotting scope poking from the
ground.
SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
WIDE VIEW:
As a lone figure appears on foot.
ROAD - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
The asphalt road shimmers with midday heat.
Suddenly a
TROOP CARRIER ROARS over a rise.
SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts,
splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE
FIRE as they blitz for...
The woodlands.
"Hostiles" FIRE and pursue.
Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath
him.
He goes down like a doped race horse.
Suddenly
exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:
Flea ran
right over their hide-site.
Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet.
WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the
link-up site just inside the woods.
Flea comes in
hobbling.
Badly.
SLUTNIK
This ain't workin' right!
MCCOOL
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
SLUTNIK
This ain't even workin' wrong!
A beat as Jordan deliberates.
She doesn't want to go out
like this.
FLEA
Really don't wanna be captured, el-
tee.
Heard some bad things.
JORDAN
Fuck.
(snatching the radio)
Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew
Six requesting emergency extraction.
Stand by for a PRC fix...
SKY - DAY
As a helo pirouettes in midair.
WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
Jordan's crew lopes through the woods, searching for a
place to bring the helo down.
Right on their heels...
ARTILLERY SIMULATORS THUMP-THUMP-THUMP, illumination
GRENADES POP and flare.
This may not be war, but it'll do
until the real thing comes along.
WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
On the run:
MCCOOL
32 feet, six inches!
JORDAN
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Finally they break into a clearing.
Is it big enough?
JORDAN
'Cool?
MCCOOL
(doesn't care)
Smoke it!
Jordan chucks a smoke grenade.
CLEARING IN WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
Whirling smoke, the helo descends.
Jordan's crew breaks
early, trying to get there the instant it touches down.
But before they can...
An FAV crashes through the underbrush, M-60s BARKING in
the helo's direction.
The helo bounds away.
Jordan's crew tries to retreat -- but a second FAV cuts
them off.
WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
JORDAN'S POV:
Brush slapping her face.
Crew Six is being hauled through the woods, hands tied
back, boots around their necks, pulled along by...
The captors.
We assume they're instructors in camouflage
paint -- but we're moving so fast it's impossible to be
sure.
P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
A P.O.W. camp, disturbingly authentic.
A dozen trainees
are already here, held in pens of bamboo and barbed-wire.
Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry -- all five get
tossed into a pen.
Jordan is pulled away.
FLEA
Where are you... HEY!
Where are you
taking her?
BOXES - P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
Jordan is thrown to the ground.
Her eyes go wide when she
sees a row of steel boxes nearby.
They're scarcely larger
then coffins.
P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT
As "hostiles" pull Flea out of the pen.
NEWSSTAND - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
Royce stops for a newspaper.
As he pays, something else
catches his eye.
He picks up...
A "People" magazine.
The grainy image of "G.I. Jane"
fills the cover.
A photo inset, much clearer, shows a
beaming DeHaven.
"BEHIND EVERY GREAT WOMAN..."
ROYCE
(shaking head)
Suitable for framing...
P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
Legs hobbled, uniform soiled, Jordan is led past a row of
huts.
She looks like she got hit by a train -- and got
back up.
JORDAN'S POV:
Vision still blown out.
But inside the
pen, we make out 40 trainees now.
One guy wrings out a
sock and drinks from it.
Jordan moves past huts.
VOLATILE VOICES spill out as
trainees get interrogated.
JORDAN'S POV:
Outside one hut, we see Flea.
At least we
think it's him:
Strapped face-down to a table, sobbing
quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup.
They
broke him -- and it's an ugly, ugly sight.
P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY
... and throws her onto a table.
In the pens, all faces turn to watch.
Even instructors
stop what they're doing as...
The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind
her.
THE CHIEF
Didn't you know you'd be raped if
you were captured?
Didn't you even
think about that?
JORDAN
Sure.
Just like your men do.
THE CHIEF
I think we oughtta practice it,
just so you know what to expect.
He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open
her pants.
JORDAN
Should I practice bleeding, too,
sir?
Would that make me a better
soldier?
He covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand.
THE CHIEF
(to the men)
Any of you can stop this!
Just give
me the location of one more hide-
site, and it ends right here!
In the pen:
SLUTNIK
(wide-eyed)
Someone's trippin' out here...
The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead
dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give
the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty
face.
THE CHIEF
Three crews are still on this island
somewhere.
Who knows where?
The men trade itchy looks.
Some do know.
JORDAN
Don't do it, don't do it...
The Chief throws her down like garbage.
THE CHIEF
Who's gonna tell me?
Who's gonna be
chivalrous and stop this abuse?
What, you want to see her get
mauled?
Is that it?
The men shift anxiously.
Should they talk?
Behind the
Chief, Jordan staggers to her feet.
JORDAN
Don't tell him shi --
The Chief whirls, decks her a crescent-kick.
Instructors
lurch forward instinctively.
THE CHIEF
(waving them back)
She's fine!
(squatting beside)
When I put you down, O'Neil, take
the hint and stay down.
She licks her bloody teeth -- and considers kicking his
balls into his brainpan.
Instead she makes a move to get
up.
He grinds her back down with a crowbar forearm.
THE CHIEF
(for her ears only)
I am saving your life, O'Neil.
You
may not know it, but I do.
You're
an inferior soldier, a bad officer,
and I don't want you learning that
inconvenient truth when you're stuck
in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy
lines and don't know how the fuck to
get out.
You get out now, O'Neil.
Seek life elsewhere.
And if you
can't do it in front of me, do it
behind my back.
Pinning her down with just his eyes, he rises -- and
starts away.
Behind him, Jordan struggles to rise.
An ANXIOUS MURMUR races through the men:
They don't want
to see this.
They don't want to see her crucified.
MCCOOL
Down... stay down...
Hearing, the Chief turns back to see...
Jordan wobbling to her feet.
Eye-lock.
JORDAN
Fuck you and the boat you rode in
on.
Sir.
TIGHT on the faces of her crewmates -- Slutnik, Cortez,
McCool.
In their eyes, a new respect.
The Chief see it.
Instructors see it.
Everyone does.
THE CHIEF
(to instructors)
We're done here.
Beaten, he walks right out of camp.
Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes.
Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight.
But this time
he made it.
A medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away,
walking drunkenly for...
Flea.
She begins wiping the makeup from his face.
JORDAN
Make you a deal, Flea.
Never tell
me how I look -- and I'll never tell
you.
PIERS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - SUNSET
The Chief chucks gear onto a transport boat.
FOOTSTEPS
approach.
He knows it's Pyro.
THE CHIEF
You don't think she'd be raped if
she were captured?
You don't think
the threat of rape would be used to
leverage the men?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
You broke a dozen training rules
back there -- before I lost count.
THE CHIEF
I've had it.
Just because they pay
me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean
I'm gonna be one.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
She's a trainee, just like the
others.
Why are you coming down so
hard?
THE CHIEF
She's an officer.
There's a higher
standard.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
She's a women, and that's why you're
ridin' her bareback.
THE CHIEF
Of course it is.
And I'm gonna stay
on her until everyone realizes this
is not some bullshit equal-rights
thing, that real lives are gonna be
lost.
Maybe mine, maybe yours.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
I oughtta report you.
THE CHIEF
I think you probably would -- if you
didn't know I was right.
STREET - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
As a limo moves -- heads for the Capitol building.
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
The bell.
It reflects the moon.
TILT DOWN to reveal a
new batch of helmets -- the casualties of S.E.R.E.
A
graveyard of its own.
THE EXCHANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Jordan exits with purchases.
Her face is still bruised
from S.E.R.E.
With a minute to kill, she peruses a
bulletin board casually.
But a RAISED VOICE leads her
eyes to...
Wickwire.
At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.
He
looks flustered when he spots Jordan.
JORDAN
Sorry, didn't mean to --
WICKWIRE
That's okay.
Just an ex-girlfriend.
And know I remember why.
JORDAN
First big night of liberty and no
date?
You're pathetic, Wickwire.
WICKWIRE
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's
with the others, have a drink or
four.
Don't wanna come, do you?
JORDAN
(touching bruises)
I can't go out.
Not like this.
WICKWIRE
I think you look beautiful.
JORDAN
Thanks for lying.
But you're the
class officer, Wick, and it'd just
be weird if we hook up.
Besides...
Catching up, Blondell exits the exchange.
BLONDELL
Sorry.
Forgot I needed oregano
and...
She sees Wickwire.
An awkward beat for them all.
JORDAN
Do you, uh, know...
WICKWIRE
Sure, sure.
JORDAN
We're going over to her place to
make salad and pasta.
Just, you
know, nothing special.
WICKWIRE
Okay.
Well... thought I'd ask.
Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.
HOLD on
Wickwire, looking after them.
Thinking it through.
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees.
They spot Jordan approaching.
MCCOOL
So what'd he want?
O'Neil?
She passes them robotically.
Flea realizes where she's
going.
FLEA
Oh, no... no, no, no, no...
They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way.
THE CHIEF
Stand fast!
McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:
The Chief has emerged
from the instructor's office.
Helpless, they watch as...
Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the
baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer.
RING ONE:
On the pained faces of her crewmates.
RING TWO:
On the Chief.
Taking no joy in it.
Just
accepting it as inevitable.
THE QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
RING THREE:
On Wickwire as he walks across the base.
His
regrets are obvious.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
UPRIVER - THE POTOMAC - DAY
The ice floes are gone.
The river banks are budding
green.
Soon CAMERA FINDS a power boat making its way
upriver.
A lone figure sits on the prow.
POWER BOAT - DAY
It's Jordan.
Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her
legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what
she left with.
Around a river bend appears...
The gunkhole harbor.
Home.
GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - DAY
The boat docks.
Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out
thanks, starts up the dock.
But now she comes to a stop,
seeing...
Royce.
Stepping out of the house.
EXTREMELY WIDE:
River shimmering behind them, they meet
on the dock.
A charged stand-off:
Where do they pick up?
Can they pick up?
Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and
steps into his wide-spread arms.
Royce wraps her up as if
to never let go.
For the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins
crying, sobbing uncontrollably.
ROYCE
(in her ear)
I want to kill them... I want to
kill the guys who made you cry like
this...
CAPITOL BLDG. - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
The real Capitol dome.
A flag is being raised over the
Senate Wing.
CAPITOL BDLG.
- WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
A car parks at barricades.
Jordan and Royce emerge, both
in uniforms.
D.C. COP
Don't even dream about leaving that
vehicle there.
ROYCE
Government car -- tow it if you
want.
Just point us to DeHaven's
office first.
Not waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps
two at a time.
We've seen this look on her face before --
and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into
orbit.
C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT
Through a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to
his ear.
He stands at attention even though wearing a
bathrobe.
Half-audible through the glass:
C.O.
Yes sir.
No, I'm not saying it
would be impossible, sir, just...
Yes sir.
No sir.
Yes sir.
I can
appreciate that, sir.
Good night,
sir.
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
START on the helmet graveyard.
Hands enter FRAME to
reclaim one helmet in particular.
TILT UP on Jordan,
back in the grinder, back in Navy greens.
The Spec-Recon class is here.
Crewmates gawk like stone
idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up.
C.O.
(to class)
One of you here understands better
than anyone what this is all about.
Someone who has engaged in conduct
unbecoming.
Someone who knows, I
would hope, what he must now do.
CLOSE on Wickwire.
Feeling the heat.
Wondering if they
really know who it is.
Now the C.O. parks himself right
in Wickwire's face.
C.O.
And unless that someone takes the
honorable way out in the next 10
seconds -- I will make certain he
faces action under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice.
Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.
He slows
when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows
would be inadequate.
JORDAN
Just walk away and never stop.
He does.
As Wickwire RINGS OUT:
C.O.
It seems we have an opening for
class officer.
Any nominations?
Eyes swing to Jordan.
Way ahead of them:
C.O.
All those in favor?
A CHORUS OF AYES.
Jordan puddles up.
C.O.
Chief Urgayle, turning it back over
to you.
On his way to the front, the Chief stops to check in with
Jordan.
THE CHIEF
Well, I'm trying to figure out if
you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous
-- or some new alloy of all three.
JORDAN
Good to see you again, too, sir.
THE CHIEF
Okay, O'Neil.
So you've impressed
all the others.
Now try me.
CORONADO BRIDGE - DAY
The morning sun is an orange ball balanced on the Coronado
Bridge.
In silhouette, pelicans circle, some dive-bombing
into the bay below.
Suddenly a HELO HOWLS across the sun,
scattering the birds as it heads off-shore.
OCEAN - DAY
As the helo swoops down onto the ocean deck.
OCEAN - DAY
The ILB splashes down into the ocean.
Jordan's crew helo-
casts in after it.
From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches
as...
Jordan's crew swims to the ILB, bobbing in the swells.
Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the
boat.
Nothing happens.
FLEA
C'mon, c'mon...
Cortez tries to help.
The handle spins in his grip.
CORTEZ
This tank's not gonna cut it, el-
tee.
Handle's stripped.
Jordan looks skyward.
100 feet overhead, the Chief gives
her a parting salute as the helo lifts away.
SLUTNIK
I just wonder how that happened.
JORDAN
Cortez, see if you can dig out the
tools without losing the rest of out
gear.
Try a wrench on that thing.
HELO - DAY
More birds pepper-shot the helo:
One SHREDS through the
main rotor, another through the tail rotor.
Another bird
gets sucked right into...
The main turbine.
OCEAN - DAY
MCCOOL
What the shit is...
Jordan whirls.
She's just in time to witness...
The helo hitting the water.
In seconds it's gone.
A stunned beat.
We never knew the ocean could be this
quiet.
When the anesthetic of shock wears off:
SLUTNIK
You don't suppose this is just part
of...
JORDAN
FLEA!
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT!
Mark it, mark it!
Cortez?
What the
hell you waiting for?
Cortez torques his wrench hard:
CO2 flows into the ILB,
inflating it.
The crew scrambles aboard.
Jordan digs
like a dog to find a radio.
JORDAN
Base, this is Crew Leader Six.
We
have a downed helo 12 miles west-
south west of base with three
aboard.
Repeat, we have a downed
helo with three aboard...
Slutnik yanks a starter cord:
Their outboard MOTOR ROARS
to life.
The boat does a donut in the water and blasts
away.
CUT TO:
OCEAN - DAY
The ILB powers over swells.
Flea is perched on the bow,
nose to the wind like a hunting dog.
FLEA
CUT IT!
CUT IT HERE!
Slutnik motors down.
FLEA
Close as I can get, el-tee!
JORDAN
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take
your minis, hit the water.
Go, GO!
They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins.
Jordan snaps up the radio.
JORDAN
Base, this is Crew Leader Six.
What
is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo?
Over.
BASE (V.O.)
Crew Leader, we have a Medevac
rerouting from Long Beach, but no
other helos prepped at this time.
Seafox One and Two are launching
now.
Over.
A beat.
JORDAN
Base, don't think you copied me.
We
are 12 miles out.
Seafox tops out
at 30 knots, which makes it a no-
show for 18 minutes.
Over.
BASE (V.O.)
You copied right, Crew Leader.
We're looking for options ourselves.
SLUTNIK
Maybe we should call the Coast
Guard.
JORDAN
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
CUT TO:
OCEAN - DAY
McCool surfaces.
MCCOOL
Visibility drops dead at 40 feet.
If they're deeper than that...
The others surface and swim in.
CORTEZ
Nobody's comin' outta that crash,
el-tee.
Nobody.
A grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.
With a
voice seemingly from the far side of the moon:
THE CHIEF (V.O.)
Base, this is Basher One.
I've got
a small problem here.
Do you copy?
Jaws drop.
JORDAN
(into radio)
Basher One, this is O'Neil.
We are
barely reading you.
What is your
situation?
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf.
OCEAN - DAY
THE CHIEF (V.O.)
Managed to activate the ELB.
If you
just radio base and let them know,
they'll fix on that.
Oh, and make
sure they send a helo with a winch
-- door's blocked by a reef.
Over.
JORDAN
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be
here for 15 minutes.
What's your
air situation?
Over.
THE CHIEF (V.O.)
Say again?
How many micks?
JORDAN
15, sir.
OCEAN - DAY
FLEA
If we could just fix on him...
MCCOOL
Beacon's a no-go for us.
JORDAN
(into radio)
Chief -- did I see a flare box
aboard?
And can you get at it?
Over.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
The Chief props up the co-pilot's head.
Gulps air.
Ducks
underwater to grope through wreckage.
Only now do we see
that "questionable leg" he was talking about:
It's
snapped at mid-calf, blood rivering out.
OCEAN - DAY
THE CHIEF (V.O.)
Got it.
JORDAN
(into radio)
Show us where you are, Chief.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
Again the Chief goes below water.
He finds a small breach
in the fuselage... sticks the flare launcher through...
and pulls the trigger.
With a MAGNESIUM FLASH, the flare launches...
UNDERWATER - DAY
... streaks toward the surface...
OCEAN - DAY
... and arcs into daylight 50 yards behind the ILB.
FLEA
Six o'clock!
Marking, marking!
JORDAN
Spotted you, Chief.
Pri One is to
slip you some air, so we're coming
down with a tank -- just something
until the A-team shows.
Over.
An ominous beat.
JORDAN
Chief?
CHIEF (V.O.)
O'Neil... there's no air in your
main tanks.
MCCOOL
What?
They scramble to check their main dive tanks.
Even
through the gauges show full, they're dead empty.
All of
them.
OCEAN - DAY
SLUTNIK
He's circlin' the drain, el-tee.
Jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard -- the
stuff she can count on.
Mental turbos kicking in:
JORDAN
So we got two full mini-tanks, three
minutes each.
'Cool?
How much air
in yours?
MCCOOL
Maybe half.
Not even.
JORDAN
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it
down, we're gonna need it.
Cortez,
help him.
Flea?
You take one of the
two full minis -- and just follow my
lead.
CORTEZ
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with
paddles?
MCCOOL
(grabbing her)
O'Neil.
Our air's gonna crap out as
soon as we get down there.
You know
that, don't you?
JORDAN
So I guess we get one shot at it.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
Reaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their
oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until...
An opening appears.
Jordan and Flea swim into the breach...
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
McCool's air craps out.
He abandons his oar and swims for
the surface.
That leaves only...
Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open.
He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it
scares the bejeezus out of him.
OCEAN - DAY
Twin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the
water.
Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot...
The ILB.
Newberry POPS A FLARE skyward as Slutnik
DOWNLOADS INFO over the radio.
CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
Cortez's air goes dead.
He gives it three more seconds,
eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they
have to come out... right... fucking... absolutely...
NOW:
Jordan appears with the Chief.
Flea is at their
heels with the co-pilot.
Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims
for the sky.
The HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef.
Jordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest.
It inflates
instantly.
One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the
surface...
OCEAN - DAY
... and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief.
They
covered 50 feet in four seconds.
Doing a 360, Jordan spots...
Seafox One coming their way.
Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim.
Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place:
They're wasting no time on the pick-up.
Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a
death-grip on the Chief's vest.
THE CHIEF
(growling)
O'Neil...
JORDAN
Shut up, sir.
I'm concentrating.
The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring.
SEAFOX THUNDERS past.
Jordan plunges her free arm through
the loop...
And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat.
Throwing a rooster tail a mile long, Seafox pivots on the
water and heads back to base.
MCCOOL
Hoooooo-yah!
NEWBERRY
Go, go, go, go!
SLUTNIK
Uh-huh!
That's right!
Just like we
always practice it!
DISSOLVE TO:
GUARD HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Limousine leading, a parade of vehicles reaches the base
entrance.
A man exits the limo to expedite matters with
the BASE GUARD.
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
Senator DeHaven is here for the
graduation ceremonies.
BASE GUARD
What are all these other vehicles?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
Just a small press corps.
Routine.
BASE GUARD
And that pickup truck at the end?
DEHAVEN'S AIDE
That?
That would be the all-woman
America's Cup team.
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
C.O.
(into microphone)
Special Reconnaissance Class 118,
you may now stand down.
All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites,
the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH.
What
began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40.
Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce,
smiling through his fears.
Not far away sits Blondell.
No one claps louder.
Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates.
Pyro finally manages to take her aside.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Lieutenant?
I was asked to give you
this.
It's a small case.
Jordan opens it to find a medal of
bronze and blue enamel.
JORDAN
The Navy Cross...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
I believe he earned it for saving a
man's life in Saudi Arabia.
He
wanted you to have it.
He was very
clear on that point.
JORDAN
I was looking for him earlier,
but...
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
The Chief was granted early
retirement as of 17-hundred
yesterday.
By 18-hundred he was
gone.
Out of the Navy.
JORDAN
(knowing better)
Just a coincidence?
INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Maybe it's not my place to speculate
on his private thoughts.
But I
think the Chief knew that his way --
his world -- had come and gone.
Jordan nods, understanding.
CUT TO:
GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
DeHaven.
She's holding a press conference, trying to turn
piss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job:
DEHAVEN
... of course, we always prefer
peace to war.
But if we're going to
war, give women a piece.
Give them
the choice to defend their country.
And if the President doesn't like
that idea -- if he wants to continue
to deny women their equal rights --
then I'll be happy to step out back
with him any time, anywhere...
Jordan approaches.
Spotting her, the PRESS PLEADS for a
photo-op with both women.
DEHAVEN
Jordan?
Jordan, dear...
Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn,
Jordan walks right past DeHaven...
And joins Royce.
Together they turn and leave.
C.O.
Senator, perhaps this would be a
good time for that lunch.
Will the
America's Cup team be joining us?
BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
Jordan and Royce walk hand in hand, strolling the same
beach she trained on.
JORDAN
So here we are again.
Staring three
years of operational duty in the
face.
ROYCE
Look.
It's not like you'd be
completely out of reach.
And maybe
we could call in a few favors, get
you stationed at Norfolk instead of
Coronado.
There are ways of dealing
with these things -- I mean, if
people are so inclined.
JORDAN
(warily)
Which is guy-speak for...
ROYCE
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no
matter how long."
Finally, the right answer.
AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
START TIGHT on Jordan's face.
Even beneath the camouflage
paint, we can see her exhilaration.
PULL BACK to find her
in a line of commandos boarding an IDLING C-130:
She's
embarking on her first mission.
KEEP PULLING BACK until
we've lost her completely -- until she's just one soldier
among many, indistinguishable from the rest.
FADE OUT.
THE END
