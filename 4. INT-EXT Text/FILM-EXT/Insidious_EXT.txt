A Spanish-style home. Very pretty. This is not the suburbs.
More of an inner city neighborhood. There's history here.
Josh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his Subaru.
A home security officer trudges down the steps of the house.
Renai, Josh, Foster and Cali all stand outside in their
pajamas, shivering in the frigid night air.
SECURITY OFFICER
There's no one in there, it's all
clear. If someone was there, they're
gone now.
31.
Renai steps away from the children, out of their earshot.
RENAI
I saw somebody.
SECURITY OFFICER
Maybe it was a shadow...?
RENAI
No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a
man. He was tall, and he long,
greasy hair. He was wearing a grey
jacket. He looked right at me.
SECURITY OFFICER
Well, like I said...he's gone now.
Renai looks to the others. Sees only disbelieving faces.
Josh sits on a park bench, staring into the distance. He
takes out a flask of whisky, swigging from it.
In the sunlight, the house looks like a happy place.
Renai sits on the front steps, alone. It is late. She looks
somehow tired and wired at the same time. Smoking a cigarette.
Josh pulls in. Fumbles out of his car, tipsy.
JOSH
What are you doing up?
RENAI
It's midnight, Josh.
JOSH
When did you start smoking?
RENAI
You've been coming home late every
single night. You've never had to
do that in all of the years you've
been at the school. Now all of a
sudden you have to stay back late?
JOSH
I don't like it either, but I'm
grading tests. What choice do I have?
We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.
RENAI
Your mother is paying Dalton's
bills, Josh. I know because she
reminds me every chance she gets.
36.
JOSH
Jesus, I can't win with you. That's
my son in there too, not just yours!
He paces, the anger sobering him.
JOSH (CONT'D)
I've always felt like less than
good enough for you. I feel it
every time you mention our bills.
That subtle voice that says `can't
you get a job that pays more than a
teacher'? And now I can't even look
at you without feeling it.
RENAI
You're projecting that onto me.
You've written an entire story
about I'm how I'm feeling without
once asking me how I'm feeling.
JOSH
I don't need to ask. I know you.
RENAI
I am losing my mind here in this
house, Josh. I'm scared and I need
you and you're not here. Where are
you?
JOSH
I told you, I'm grading tests.
RENAI
I don't mean that. I mean you're
not here. With me. In this
situation. You're avoiding it, like
you do anything stressful, whether
it's this or a parking ticket.
JOSH
Christ, I should have stayed at the
school.
RENAI
There you go again.
Renai stands up and walks inside the house. The door closes.
A moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home.
Movers mill about, hauling boxes and couches.
Josh pulls up to the house. Turns off the car.
46.
An old Cadillac is sitting in the driveway. Josh clambers out
of his car and peers in through the window of the Cadillac,
quizzical.
A battered van is parked in the driveway of the house.
The Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern.
His street beckons beyond the door.
Josh floats across his lawn.
There are no people or cars on the street...it is as desolate
as a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
A
TOTAL
ABSENCE
OF
LIFE.
Some lights flicker from within the houses, but no movement
or signs of human forms. Only mist.
Josh floats an inch above the road, moving down the street.
One thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon
or city scape here...Josh's immediate surroundings are
visible for about one hundred yards or so...anything beyond
that, in any direction, fades into blackness. As if someone
were shining a giant spotlight down on him.
Josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world.
He looks down at his feet.
He is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He
concentrates with fierce intensity--
--and then watches as his feet touch the ground.
85.
He is walking.
He starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement.
JOSH
Dalton?
The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were
inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or
angles for it to bounce off.
JOSH (CONT'D)
Dalton? Where are you?
For a long time, there is nothing...
...
...then he sees it.
A figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner
with his back to Josh.
Josh moves towards the figure.
Closer. Closer.
The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back.
Josh glances around the corner. There is nobody there.
He continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in
the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and
stares...
...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition.
He looks to his right and sees--
--A SHADOW.
Behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle
light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and
disappears.
Josh walks towards the front door of the house. He reaches it
and turns the handle.
It's over.
Specs and Tucker haul a large tripod case to their van,
heaving it into the back.
They stand in awkward silence. It's been a long day.
TUCKER
I guess you did some pretty awesome
stuff in there. You deserve some
credit.
SPECS
You did good too in an assistant-
type way.
Tucker can't hold his stoic pose any longer. He breaks out
laughing, followed quickly by Specs.
TUCKER
Thanks, boss.
They shake hands.
TUCKER (CONT'D)
Dude, I got some amazing shots. We
are gonna write a book and my shots
are gonna be the main selling point.
SPECS
Yeah.
(BEAT)
Not the main selling point, but
definitely important, for sure.
101.
