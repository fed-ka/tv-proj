It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City
LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her
thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.
Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.
Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is
twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday
party they attended in The City.
Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink
handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on
her right wrist.
The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station
platform.
TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,
SLURRED SPANISH to each other.
Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them
as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.
The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys
make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's
quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F
TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.
Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.
And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the
stairwell behind them.
Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and
the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his
gun.
Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks
terrified.
The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over
her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and
her wedding band.
One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.
The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to
the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.
We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.
Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.
2.
-- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.
The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail
car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.
Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy
holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK
OF CONTEMPT.
The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?
-- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --
When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the
car doors from closing.
A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...
There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke
... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.
Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.

M.O.S
2
A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white
sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.
BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a
man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big,
plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches
the platform, he stops.
Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay
on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees
it. Then he turns...
THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.
Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it
into his pocket.
Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police
MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.
Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her
legs not quite working.
Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting
her as the blanket falls to the ground.
Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but
can't.
Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches
the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.
3.
The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment.
Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down,
he's back up.
Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all
the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.
WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a
clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN
TOWERS STAND TALL.

A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the
distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a
funeral. It's a memorial.
A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a
stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE
SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.
Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty
coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles
and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse.
Time is money.
Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket
pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then
extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins
towards the mourners.
His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in
the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive
bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but
doesn't want anyone to know she has.
TYLER
(sweetly)
Hello, your majesty. How are you?
DIANE
I'm fine... you look good...
He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his
stepfather...
LES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and
tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos.
5.
The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his
diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's
holding a little paper bag.
She flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers...
TYLER
Thanks for organizing everybody.
Caroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him.
CAROLINE
You smell like Listerine and beer.
He snorts and kisses her cheek.
Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of
smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names:
"Mom" "Tyler" "Les", "Dad", "Caroline". She begins to arrange
them in a little circle on the grave.
Tyler's father...
CHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely
dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator.
CHARLES
(aside, to Tyler)
You couldn't wear a tie?
Tyler holds his father's eye.
TYLER
Could have.
Beat.
Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive.
POV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side-
by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline
sits on the ground, arranging the stones.

Tyler and his roommate, AIDAN BREWER, 22, energetic,
inappropriate, walking west towards N.Y.U. Young people in
easy, summery dress. Tyler smokes. Aidan doesn't. Aidan
remembers something, smirks.
AIDAN
I sold your girlfriend a
toothbrush.
TYLER
You sold my who? ...What?
AIDAN
That voluptuous, delightfully
oblivious little blonde you left in
your bed this morning... I sold her
a toothbrush. Got three bucks.
TYLER
...Congratulations?
AIDAN
Are in order, yes. Because that
sale inspired our newest business
venture: "The S.L.U.T."
TYLER
I was unaware we had a previous
business venture.
10.
AIDAN
The 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'.
It's the one-night-stand travel
pack for women. We throw in some
make-up, toiletries, cell phone
charger, cab numbers. Retail it at
S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.
TYLER
And you think women would buy this?
With money?
AIDAN
Hey one-night-stands happen... It's
a part of life... like stubbing
your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a
corner and bend back your pinky
toe, other times you wake up in a
freshman dorm wearing a field
hockey tee shirt wondering why your
balls smell like cinnamon...
TYLER
(nodding sagely)
Of course. Yes.
AIDAN
Don't underestimate the novelty
gift market. Think about it...
instead of giving that token slutty
friend a ten-inch purple dildo for
her birthday, you hook her up with
"The SLUT." Everyone has a laugh
and the implication that she'll
probably use it someday remains.
What do you say? Are you down?
TYLER
I'm down with getting you on some
sort of medication.
AIDAN
OK...fine...be cynical...just
remember at some point in history
two people had a conversation just
like this about the light bulb. One
of them went on to fame and fortune
and the other one probably went to
work at Mickey D's or something.
TYLER
Or Denny's. Denny's was big in the
19th century.
11.

A TINTED TOWN CAR stops in-front of a funky corner brownstone
where Caroline waits in a plaid jumper on the front steps.
THE DRIVER opens the back door of the car.
10
12
At the Alice in Wonderland statue where KIDS climb all over
the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters.
12.
The statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun.
Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter, his face turned towards
the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse.
Tyler lights a cigarette. AN UPTIGHT MOMMY glares at him.
UPTIGHT MOMMY
Why don't we make this a non-
smoking statue?
CAROLINE
(emerging)
Yeah, Tyler . Why don't we make
this a non-smoking statue?
He makes a face.
CAROLINE
You promised you'd quit...
TYLER
I know.
CAROLINE
You're gonna get emphysema and then
you're gonna have to drag an oxygen
tank with you everywhere...
TYLER
You think that would be the worst
part about having emphysema?
CAROLINE
Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the
bathroom.
Tyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground.
CAROLINE
Why do you think Dad doesn't
wanna...like, listen to me?
TYLER
Dad loves you.
Caroline gives him a look.
CAROLINE
So? You can love someone and not
want to spend any time with them.
Caroline is climbing around Alice. Her hands on Alice's hair.
13.
TYLER
You've got that right.
CAROLINE
Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at
Christmas, last year, she wouldn't
let Les leave them in a room
together 'cause she said there
would be a "yule tide homicide."
TYLER
That's because Aunt Sara drinks...
You don't drink, right?
CAROLINE
Duh.
TYLER
So why would anyone wanna avoid
you?
Caroline shrugs, not convinced. A silent moment passes.
CAROLINE
Michael used to drink.
TYLER
Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21.
All 21 year olds drink because it's
new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks
because she wishes she was 21.
A shared smile.
CAROLINE
You're 21.
Tyler's smile fades.
13
15
Tyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo
opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot
of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a
fine time.
AIDAN
I love this street. I love this
city. Where are you guys from,
again?
AIDAN'S GIRL
Miami.
AIDAN
Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New
York is it, man. God broke the mold
when he made this city.
17.
TYLER
You ever actually been to any of
those places?
AIDAN
What's your point?
There's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a
tiny dress.
AIDAN'S GIRL
What are we doing? I'm freezing.
AIDAN
Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me.
O/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from
far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into
the night...
VOICE O/S
Michael...Mi-i-chael!
Tyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot
a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and
fishes out his pack of cigarettes.
AIDAN'S GIRL
(to Aidan)
Asshole.
She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.
AIDAN'S GIRL
Are you coming?
Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.
TYLER'S GIRL
(to her friend)
Hold on, Lauren.
The girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to
convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.
Tyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking
MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND
EQUIPMENT.
A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of
them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at
the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch
the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.
18.
MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just
wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and
lurches again.
MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.
MUSICIAN#2
What's your problem?
NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
My problem? Keep your hands off my
car, asshole.
MUSICIAN#2
Blow it out your ass, Guido.
MUSICIAN#1
Go back to Long Island.
The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the
front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat
at his side.
NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
I'm from Queens, faggot
A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver
starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as
the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned
into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped
into the pavement.
TYLER'S GIRL
So we were thinking we could go...
Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.
AIDAN
(under his breath)
God damn it.
Aidan runs off after Tyler.
Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing
the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the
guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not
stopping.
Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the
guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits
Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the
chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.
It's a brawl.
19.
Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl,
following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near
enough to the brawl to imperil herself.
A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl.
She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement,
splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.
16
16
An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site.
THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb.
SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we
first met him at the train station, is standing with the
Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn.
Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to
her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the
Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction.
Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger,
is on the radio to Dispatch.
Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a
blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to
his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan...
CRAIG
Cut those two loose.
Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.
LEO
(quiet)
Take a walk.
Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his
wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl
and...
Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1.
CRAIG
Anything in here that's going to
stab me, Einstein?
Craig finds a packet, or a vial.
CRAIG
Nice. You like to get high and hit
women?
20.
Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in
the action.
NEANDERTHAL#1
I don't even know the bitch.
Rage flickers across Craig's face.
Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going
through their pockets.
CRAIG
How about you two?
Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.
MUSICIAN#1
It wasn't us, man!
NEANDERTHAL#1
That cocksucker kicked my car!
CRAIG
Shut up, genius.
MUSICIAN#1
(to Neanderthal)
Eat shit, pencil dick.
CRAIG
Alright. That's it. Everybody goes
downtown.
Tyler steps forward, interrupting...
TYLER
It wasn't them.
Aidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend.
AIDAN
(sotto)
Tyler...
LEO
(quietly, to the guys)
Take a walk, I said.
TYLER
Hey!
Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.
21.
TYLER
They didn't do anything. They
didn't start this. Those assholes
did. Why do these guys have to go
downtown?
CRAIG
What are you still doing here?
TYLER
This is bullshit. It was those
gorillas who started this.
Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through
Tyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling
through.
CRAIG
Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you
think I give a shit?
TYLER
You're a police officer. You're
supposed to.
What the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to
Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns
a bit to Tyler.
CRAIG
It's a great relief to me, Mr.
Roth, to know that you're on top of
the situation. Now go the fuck
home.
He turns back to work.
Tyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate "Please!
Let's get out of here!"
Tyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.
Aidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig
looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be
out of his mind.
TYLER
How about you do your job?
SLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the
pavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies
there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on
Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the
cuffs on.
22.
17
19
Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of
red-brick row houses.
Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching
through her bag.
25.
Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys
across the roof. She drops them in her bag.
ALLY
Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it.
Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee
mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his
English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the
car.
She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye
makeup.
ALLY
You're exhausted. When you have a
stroke I'm going to abandon you on
a park bench.
They start to back out.
ALLY
This drive is too long.
20
25
It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a
CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards
Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says
makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls
snicker.
Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on
a fire hydrant.
TYLER
(to Caroline)
Hey.
He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his
cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a
group swoon.
He takes Caroline by the elbow...
TYLER
Excuse us, we're due in surgery.
He gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth
Avenue.
CAROLINE
What happened to your face?
TYLER
Horrible threshing accident.
CAROLINE
You're so retarded.
TYLER
Don't mock the afflicted. Here,
I brought you something.
He hands her the book of Myths.
TYLER
This was my favorite book ever.
Michael had it and he hit me over
the head with it until I read it.
Its about all these God and
Goddesses who spend all of their
time being jealous and petty and
otherwise acting like human beings.
The illustrations are amazing.
Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles.
29.
CAROLINE
Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where
are we meeting mom?
TYLER
Guggenheim. What's up with those
girls?
CAROLINE
I just...they think I'm weird.
Sometimes I sort of space out.
TYLER
When you're drawing?
CAROLINE
Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle
Fleischman had to snap her fingers
at me a lot today. And everybody
laughed and they all think I'm a
freak of nature.
Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the
school.
TYLER
Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature."
Caroline smirks.
TYLER
Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je
m'appelle "Freak of Nature". Sacre
Bleu. French Toast.
CAROLINE
What are you going to tell mom
about your face?
TYLER
I finally found something I'm good
at?
26
26
Aidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or
out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she
just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual.
30.
AIDAN
...I know by every numerical
measurement I didn't pass but what
I was hoping was that maybe you
give me a grade on my trying to
pass. My commitment to effort. My
commitment to commitment...Since
the semester is nearly at it's
terminus.
Craig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags. Ally
gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the
stairs, right past Aidan.
AIDAN
(distracted)
I mean... uh... life's only about
what we put into it. It's about
people. And what they put into it.
And I'm -- ah, screw it.
Aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps.
27
30
Ally in sweat pants, an ancient tee-shirt, her hair in a
Scrunchie, eating Mallomars from the bag and reading.
Craig yells from the bottom of the stairs. He carries a bag
from a video store.
CRAIG
Don't be mad...
ALLY
Dad, we've seen freaking Erin
Brockovich twice already. You
always cry.
CRAIG O/S
I do not.
ALLY
It's embarrassing.
Her cell phone rings.
ALLY
Hello?
36.
31
31
TYLER
Hey. It's Tyler.
INTERCUT:
Ally winces.
ALLY
Hi.
TYLER
You're going to stand me up. I can
feel it in my bones. I'll be
devastated.
ALLY
No... I...I was just...
TYLER
You were just sitting around in
your pajamas watching T.V.
ALLY
No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm
just...getting dressed.
She wipes her hands on her sweats, smearing them with
chocolate.
ALLY
And I'm going to meet you at the
place at..what time again?
TYLER
Eight.
ALLY
Right...yes. Eight...okay.
She hangs up.
ALLY
Shit.
She whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the
bathroom.
32
34
Tyler and Ally exit out onto the street. Tyler immediately
takes out his cigarettes, his lighter, then he notices...
Ally looking at him disappointed.
ALLY
Really?
Tyler takes the cue puts the packet and lighter away. A beat.
ALLY
I had a nice time.
TYLER
You had a nice time or you're
having a nice time?
Ally considers.
TYLER
Because if you're having one, why
rush to end it?
35
35
AFTER
They approach a CARNIVAL GAME, one those ubiquitous
basketball tosses. THE ATTENDANT badgers passersby to test
their luck. GIANT STUFFED ANIMALS hang all around it.
Tyler pays the Attendant, gets the basketballs. Tosses one,
two, the third, then nothing. Game over.
TYLER
Did I tell you I'm Caucasian?
40.
ALLY
Apparently.
Tyler pays again, wipes out again. Game over. Tyler pays
again. Loses again. He's visibly frustrated now.
ALLY
Can't we just stroll while I feed
you ice cream with fireworks in the
background?
TYLER
No. If I stop, he wins.
ALLY
Who, the attendant?
TYLER
No, the frigging Giant Panda.
Tyler hands the ATTENDANT another dollar.
36
36
Ally carries a GIANT PANDA under her arm. Tyler walking
beside her with a self-satisfied smile.
ALLY
I don't know what you're smiling
about.
TYLER
I won.
ALLY
Paying off the attendant is not
winning... It's cheating.
TYLER
I just paid a premium to cut out
the middle man. That's innovation.
That's free market enterprising.
That's what made America great.
ALLY
Aha. By the way, what happened to
your eye?
Tyler touches the bandage.
TYLER
Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight.
41.
ALLY
How butch.
TYLER
I know. I'm practically a pirate.
ALLY
Okay, Captain Morgan...
TYLER
(laughing)
You've got some serious timing.
ALL
It's getting late.
TYLER
I'll walk you to the train.
ALLY
I'll take a cab.
37
37
Tyler is just hailing her a taxi. He stands there holding the
door open.
ALLY
Thanks.
Beat.
Tyler leans in to kiss her. Ally turns away.
ALLY
Not tonight. Not never... just...
not tonight.
CAB DRIVER
We goin' or what?
ALLY
Hey! Turn on the meter.
Tyler respectfully leans back.
TYLER
So dessert before dinner for fear
of death by rogue asteroid... yes.
Kissing guy you're obviously
attracted to before driving off
into the unknown New York night...
no.
42.
Ally considers.
She gives him a quick but tender kiss.
ALLY
You're really weird.
She gets in the cab.
ALLY
(to the driver)
I'm going to Queens and I don't
wanna hear about it.
Off she goes in the taxi. Tyler watches her go.
38
38
Caroline exiting with the crowd. One of the Bitchy girls
shoulder checks her from behind as she passes. Tyler, waiting
on his perch, catches it, walks up to her.
TYLER
Happy end of sixth grade!
CAROLINE
Finally.
39
CHILDREN climbing all over the bronze statue. Caroline among
them. She sits on a mushroom cap, letting her legs dangle.
Tyler watches her from their usual bench, his bike leaning
next to him.
CAROLINE
They have me in this art program
summer thing at Pratt...
TYLER
I heard.
CAROLINE
It's very prestigious due to my
artistic greatness.
TYLER
Don't pretend. I know you're proud.
You should be.
Caroline allows herself a tiny grin.
43.
CAROLINE
There's, like, a thing...
TYLER
A thing?
CAROLINE
(sheepish)
A show where you show what you've
done and stuff. Will you come?
TYLER
Let me check my book. Abso-freaking-
lutely. I'm camping out. I'm
sleeping there the night before.
Caroline is secretly thrilled.
CAROLINE
You're so retarded. Mom's been
hyperventilating with joy.
TYLER
Good. I'm sure Les was...
TYLER/CAROLINE
"Really supportive"!
CAROLINE
Your school's over, right?
TYLER
Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les
get the beach house again?
CAROLINE
Yup. What are we going to do for
your birthday?
TYLER
Nothing.
CAROLINE
Can we have a party?
TYLER
No.
CAROLINE
A little one? At Mom's? With Aidan.
I'll make Mom behave. No crying.
TYLER
Like that's possible.
44.
Caroline smiles.
40
49
Sunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway,
a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works
out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach
chair, trying again with the guitar.
AIDAN
...So? She just left? No good bye?
Tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. Aidan
finishes up a set.
AIDAN
Maybe she heard you play the
guitar.
TYLER
You were the one dumping Jello
shots down her throat. You almost
killed her.
Aidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of
weight on the bar.
AIDAN
There are sins of omission and sins
of commission, my friend. I've
dealt with mine and I've forgiven
myself... you should do the same.
55.
Aidan lifts. It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler
forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains.
AIDAN
...little help, T... little help,
little help, lotta help... TYLER?!
Tyler blows three perfect smoke rings. Finally he puts down
the guitar and helps get the bar up. Aidan panting, rubbing
his chest.
AIDAN
What the hell was that?
TYLER
Penance. I have to get to work.
50
55
Tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop.
56
60
Aidan and Ally on the roof, they've arranged themselves in
the deck chairs.
ALLY
That was weird. I assume most moms
don't smoke weed in front of their
son's...um
AIDAN
Piece of ass?
ALLY
You know, you're a poet.
AIDAN
Hey. I know one thing. I know that
in the time I've lived with Tyler,
he has never introduced a girl ...
woman...female...to his mom before.
ALLY
It's not like he had a choice. She
ambushed us.
66.
AIDAN
Yeah, but he would've shoved you in
a closet or something. Or literally
pretended you were a hallucination.
ALLY
Ha ha.
AIDAN
I mean it. It's the first time.
Ever.
ALLY
Did it ever occur to you that
that's kind of weird?
AIDAN
No.
Ally throws up her hands.
61
71
Tyler and Ally wait in front of the restaurant as Charles
takes another call. A TOWN CAR and DRIVER wait as well.
ALLY
I think he's lovely.
Tyler puts his head in his hands.
TYLER
God.
Charles returns. His face blank.
TYLER
Don't say it.
CHARLES
I have to go to the office.
TYLER
You have somewhere else to be, Dad.
Charles adjusts his tie. Tyler loosens his.
Ally is unsure where to look.
CHARLES
The exhibit runs til nine. You guys
take the car. I'll meet you.
TYLER
I don't believe you.
CHARLES
That's all there is, Tyler.
TYLER
It's not good enough.
CHARLES
I don't have to justify anything to
you. Take the car. I'll get a cab.
I'll meet you.
76.
He steps into the street to hail a cab.
Tyler watches his dad get into a taxi, then holds the car
door for Ally.
72
85
Caroline and Diane walk up to the DOORMAN. Caroline carries a
gift, a sleeping bag. Diane smiles at her daughter.
CAROLINE
Stop smiling. You look insane.
Diane can't help it try as she might.
91.
DIANE
I'm sorry, honey. I just... it's
nice. Like an end of the summer
send off.
Caroline rolls her eyes.
DIANE
Have fun.
Caroline goes into the lobby. Diane heads back to her car.
86
88
The party girl's MOM is in a bathrobe. She looks horrified,
she has one hand covering her mouth and is whispering into a
cell phone. Caroline is on the kitchen phone. Her long hair
has been CUT TO PIECES while she slept. She is crying.
CAROLINE
(into the phone)
Mom?
89
90
Aidan paces nervously. Craig appears in an apron. Aidan
smiles.
AIDAN
Hi.
Beat.
AIDAN
Is this the, uh, that is, does, uh,
Alicia Craig. Does she live here?
Craig nods.
AIDAN
Oh great. I'm...
CRAIG
You think I don't remember you?
AIDAN
No, sir.
ALLY
Who is it Dad?
Ally sees Aidan. She touches her father's forearm.
ALLY
It's OK...
Craig steps back into the house. Six inches.
ALLY
Really.
He backs into the hall. Aidan and Ally are alone.
ALLY
What do you want?
AIDAN
Look, I'm a prick.
ALLY
And...
Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck.
He's got the
mangled Honey Bear.
ALLY
Dad...
93.
He goes again. Pfft. Aidan's visibly relieved.
AIDAN
Tyler's not.
She starts to close the door.
AIDAN
Wait. Shit. This isn't really my
thing.
ALLY
He lied to me.
AIDAN
He's in love with you.
ALLY
He'd like to think he is.
Aidan doesn't get it.
AIDAN
I don't know what that means...I've
seen him look at one other girl the
way he looks at you. She's a lot
shorter and shares his DNA.
Ally looks away.
AIDAN
You don't have to forgive him
today... just forgive him.
Craig reappears from the deep.
CRAIG
Thanks for stopping by.
Father and daughter go back into the house.
Aidan exhales.
91
94
Tyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a
cigarette. Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it
behind her.
TYLER
Last one ever. I swear.
ALLY
I don't care.
Beat.
TYLER
I know you're not here for me but,
thank you for being here.
A silent moment passes.
TYLER
For what it's worth, I think you're
amazing.
ALLY
It's not worth much. You made
everything between us a lie.
TYLER
I'm sorry.
ALLY
Okay. Now what? I'm supposed to
just forgive you?
A BMW 7 Series speeds around the corner. Stops in front of
the house. Charles gets out of the car, sees his son.
CHARLES
How is she?
TYLER
She's sleeping.
Diane emerges from the house. Charles strides quickly towards
her.
96.
95
101
Tyler leaning against the bike rack, waiting. He sees Ally
running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the
crowd.
102
102
No mimes, just dealers. Ally with a girlfriend, walking
towards the East Side. Tyler catches up to her.
99.
Shakes the friend's hand. After a beat, Ally agrees to walk
with him. He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away, but
walks next to him.
103
103
Tyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline
with him.
Tyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally
watches from a bench.
As befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the
sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early
September tanning possibilities.
Tyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her.
Beat.
ALLY
Using the little sister is dirty
pool.
TYLER
(carefully)
Is it working?
Beat.
ALLY
Maybe.
Tyler has a smile the size of New York City.
Ally smiles back.
DISSOLVE TO:
104
104
Bright sun pouring through the window. Ally lying asleep.
Tyler is up and dressed now, he grabs his journal off his
desk, kneels beside Ally. He is bathed in the pool of light
streaming in.
TYLER
(nuzzling)
Hey...Hey.
100.
ALLY
Hmmm.
TYLER
I'll be back in an hour. I have to
stop by my dad's office.
ALLY
(sleepily)
Do you want french toast or
pancakes for breakfast?
TYLER
Whichever tastes better a la mode.
Ally smiles.
ALLY
Say hi to your dad for me.
Tyler watches her lying there.
TYLER
If I said I love you... what would
you say?
ALLY
(laughing)
I love you.
TYLER
I love you too.
Tyler kisses her. Then heads out into the...
105
106
Charles waiting on the doorstep, his Town Car waiting on the
curb. Diane answers the door expecting to find Caroline's
driver, she's confused to find...
101.
DIANE
Charles?
CHARLES
Good morning Diane.
DIANE
What are you doing here?
CHARLES
Tyler's coming by the office, but I
thought I'd ride to school with
Caroline first.
Diane is speechless. This is a first.
DIANE
Um...OK...sure...yeah...great.
She's not ready though, she's going
to need at least twenty minutes.
Charles hates waiting.
CHARLES
(adjusting his tie)
All right.
107
107
Tyler chaining up his bike. His cellphone rings. He checks
it. Knows what it's regarding before he answers.
TYLER
Are you canceling all together or
are you just running late?
108
109
Tyler rounding a corner.
102.
TYLER
I'm already here.
CHARLES
I'm taking Caroline to school.
He looks at his daughter. She looks back at him, then looks
out the window.
Tyler considers.
TYLER
Take your time. I'll just wait in
your office.
CHARLES
It may be a while.
TYLER
That's okay.
Tyler hangs up and joins the herds of suits heading down the
street.
110
113
That line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off.
Charles' Town car rolls to a stop. Caroline gives him a kiss
on the cheek. It registers, sort of. She gets out. Charles
watches her all the way into the school.
His DRIVER sees him watching Caroline in the rear view
mirror.
Charles gives the Driver a look "you're waiting for an
invite?"
The Driver peels out.
114
119
We're now looking at Tyler from just outside Charles' office
window and we're PULLING BACK...
Until we see Tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily
familiar grey metal siding...
Until we see can barely see Tyler and the base of a giant
white antenna...
Until we can no longer see Tyler as he's disappeared into the
composite of the building and we've pulled back far enough to
reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the...
92nd Floor of The North Tower of the World Trade Center.
A moment of still perfect silence. The Towers. The blue sky.
Then we hear the faint sound of AA Flight 11's ENGINES as it
closes in on the North Tower.
CUT TO BLACK.
Silence. Darkness. We wait in it.
TYLER V/O
Whatever you do in life will be
insignificant but it is very
important that you do it because...
120
120
Charles Roth steps out of his car. His gaze fixed skyward.
All around him the other DRIVERS mimic his behavior.
TYLER V/O
It's a good bet...
121
121
Diane sweeping cigarette butts off the stoop.
TYLER V/O
Nobody else will...
106.
Diane joins a group of ONLOOKERS staring up from a street
corner in Brooklyn where the black smoke stains the blue sky.
One of them has a radio to his ear.
TYLER V/O
Michael...
Diane staring at it.
TYLER V/O
Someone's been trying to tell me
something.
122
122
Craig, through a LONG LENS standing by his car with the door
open. He is, crystal clear, barking orders, while waves of
blue and slashes of orange float around him.
TYLER V/O
Maybe it's you...
123
123
Aidan and Ally absolutely frantic on the roof. Holding hands.
Craning to see. Ash begins to float down on them. It gets
caught in Ally's hair.
TYLER V/O
This girl! Ally! Her life, even the
nightmare parts seeped into me and
I swear to God I can hear you
better.
124
125
THE PAPER, so much of it, all of it singed, smoke-stained,
falling like snow flakes coating the streets and the
sidewalks. Amongst the memos and faxes that will now never be
sent and never received we find...
107.
TYLER'S JOURNAL.
TYLER V/O
Someone comes into your life...
126
126
A light rain falls. Two TOMBSTONES stand side-by-side.

Charles, Caroline, Diane and Les approach the tombstones. A
family mourning. Diane slips her hand through Charles' elbow.
The gesture seems quite natural, easy.
DISSOLVE TO:
127
128
Caroline literally dragging Charles into the ROSE BUILDING AT
LINCOLN CENTER, while he yells into his cell phone.
TYLER V/O
And half of you says "Danger! Stay
in your cave! You're nowhere near
ready!"
Caroline has come to the end of her rope with her dad. She
grabs his phone and throws it into the fountain, spins on her
heel and marches into the auditorium. Charles is completely
thunderstruck.
TYLER V/O
And the other half -- and this is
the part I think is you --
He is torn between his phone and his daughter for a sec,
chooses Caroline and takes off after her...
...then comes running out by himself to rescue his phone.
108.

Ally, we find her as we first found her mother, silhouetted
against the Lower Manhattan skyline where two beams of purple
light reach up forever where the Towers once stood.
TYLER V/O
I love you.
Her train pulls into the station. Ally boards with a few
other commuters. She takes a seat by herself across from...
A MOM and A TODDLER, a little girl. The baby is squirming
impossibly, the mom looks exhausted.
Ally watches them, remembers him, as the faintest hint of a
smile crosses her lips the subway lights flicker and we...
CUT TO BLACK.
TYLER V/O
Don't be a stranger.
