Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
ASH (V.O.)
The book awoke something dark in
the woods.
SUPERIMPOSE:
4
BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
inscribed on the pages.
Illustrations of demonic faces with
white eyes.
5
ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
8
BLOOD RED CLOUDS
8
sweep past the moon.
ASH (V.O.)
In order to rid myself of the foul
thing, I read from a passage in
the book that was supposed to open
a hole.
A hole in Time that would
send the Evil back. And it worked.
9
A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH
9
recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
12
Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.
He is
swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
Time.
13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE
13
swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.
The smoke
swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
words:
"BRUCE CAMPBELL"
"Vs"
The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
"THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
14
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
15	 ASH												 15
He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
BEATING of his heart.
16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION
16
He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.
The funnel
cloud electrifies.
17	 ASH'S BODY
17
RIPS at the fabric of Time.
79
SHEILA
a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
atop his horse.
SHEILA
M'Lord Arthur!
Where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?
ARTHUR
Eye.
And fought valiantly.
But
last night fell in battle to Duke
Henry's men.
SHEILA
Her face does not immediately register the grief.
She attempts
to step forward but stumbles.
She steadies herself against the
stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
at him as he's dragged along.
SHEILA
Foul thing!
A pox on your throat!
Thou art a Murderer!
A black
Murderer!
80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
restrain her.
SHEILA
cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
VILLAGE WOMAN #1
May you be consoled by their
suffering in the pit.
81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
ground. This is THE PIT.
82	 ASH												 82
looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
what they have in store for him.
83	 SHEILA
83
stares at him in hatred.
84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
eyes Ash curiously.
This is Duke Henry the Red.
DUKE HENRY
You sir, are not one of my
vassals.
Who are you?
ASH
Who wants to know?
DUKE HENRY
I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
Lord of the Northlands and leader
of its people.
ASH
You ain't leadin' but two things
now, pal. Jack and shit.
And Jack
left town.
85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS
85
address the doomed men:
ARTHUR
There is an Evil that has awakened
in this land.
And whilst my
people fight for their very souls
against it, you, Duke Henry the
Red, wage war on us. Your people
are no better than the foul
corruption that lies in the bowels
of that pit!
May God have mercy
on your souls.
86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
crank a massive wench.
Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
slides back, revealing a dark hole.
The Pit.
87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
a echoed wailing rises up.
88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
stiffen in fear.
89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
OLD WOMAN
Aye. Into the pit with the
bloodthirsty sons of whores!
She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
CAMERA PANS TO...
90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
as he's thrown down into the pit.
He disappears into the
blackness.
91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
watching with disbelief.
We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
looking down into the blackness we hear:
HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
I beg of you... by all that's
holy!
Lower a rope!
Lower... Oh,
for the love of god!
no!
NO!!!
AIIIIIiiieee!
The sound of ripping and scratching.
The SHRIEK of terror is
cut short as...
A GEYSER OF BLOOD
erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
93	 ASH												 93
is frozen in fear.
TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
There!
He's escaping!
ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
jerks from the pit to...
94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
making a break for it!
He's past the guards, heading for the open
drawbridge.
95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS
95
spot him and fire arrows.
96	 ANGLE ON											 96
PING!
PING!
They bounce off the Warrior's armor.
He's makes it to the open
drawbridge when...
97	 ARTHUR
97
pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.
ZING!
He lets it fly.
CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2
98
The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
a wooden post.
He dies standing.
99	 THE CROWD											99
Cheers.
They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
in line...
100	ASH												 100
turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
ASH
Hey, I never even saw these
assholes before..
He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
You gotta tell 'em you don't know
me. We never met. Tell him.
HENRY
I do not believe that he shall
listen.
101	THE WARRIORS
101
grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
102	ASH												 102
tumbles down into the pit.
He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
water at the pit's bottom.
He stands and coughs out a mouthful
of the rancid water. He looks about.
UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
104	ASH												 104
spins to a small sound.
Nothing.
Just the mist rising from the water.
106	ASH												 106
shifts his glance again.
107	A SHADOW											 107
rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
108	ASH												 108
doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
break the surface.
109	ASH												 109
spins... but there's nothing there.
As he turns back around,
he is confronted by...
A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
face!
110	CLOSER
110
Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
jerks like a marionette as it advances.
111	ASH SCREAM
111
and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.
He tries to
scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH
113
He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS
114
hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE
115
grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA
116
shouts for Ash's death.
117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE
117
The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
118	LONG SHOT - ASH
118
is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
119	THE DEADITE
119
races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
120	ASH												 120
cries out in pain.
121	ASH'S LEGS
121
cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.
He
flips the beast.
122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
123	THE DEADITE
123
grabs Ash by the throat.
124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
125	THE DEADITE
125
advances.
126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
shouts down at Ash.
127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an
object falling at him through the glare above.
128	THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION
128
tumbling downward.
Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its
blade of steel.
Ash's Excalibur!
129	ASH - SLOW MOTION
129
summons his strength and leaps upward.
130	LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION

Tumbling downward...
131	HIGH ANGLE- ASH

ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars
past CAMERA.
132	LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION								 132
Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
133	ASH'S STUMP
133
snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
134	ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW
134
He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
ASH
Come on, you blasted piece of--
He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
VERRROOOOOOM!!
135	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS
135
gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.
Blue exhaust billows up from
the pit.
136	THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE						 136
lunges at Ash.
137	DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW
137
Buzzzzz!!
138	ASH												 138
is splattered with black bile.
139	THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND
139
flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast.
140	CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND
140
as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.
141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND
141
flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite
hand.
He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
143	CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH
143
Ash decapitates the beast.
144	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS
144
stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this
guy's guts and style.
145	THE LAST REMNANTS
145
of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
146	ASH												 146
climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges
from the earthen wall before him.
147	ASH												 147
slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it
back into the water.
148	ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS							148
gasp as...
THUMP!
149	ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM									 149
comes up, over the edge of the pit.
Followed by... THUMP!
Ash's
bloody hand.
Then his bruised face.
Covered in the black blood
of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
ASH
All right now. Who wants to be
next?
Who wants some.
150	GOLD TOOTH
150
look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
ASH
You want some more?
Huh?!
Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out
to Henry.
ASH
Now climb on those horses and get
out of here.
151	HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS
151
quickly mount horses.
ARTHUR
Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
152	ASH												 152
slaps Henry's horse.
ASH
GIDDYUP NOW!!
HYAAAH!
153	THE STUNNED CROWD
153
parts allowing...
154	HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS
154
to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
155	ARTHUR
155
stares at Ash with hatred.
ARTHUR
For that, I shall see you dead.
156	ASH												 156
removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
ASH
This is my boomstick. It's a
twelve gauge, double barreled
Remington pump. Next one of you
primitives touch me...
157	ASH SPINS,
157
pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
on the forgotten chain.
The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
158	ANGLE ON											 158
BLAMMITY-BLAM!
The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it
summersaulting down into the pit.
159	THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST
159
echoes off the mountains like distant thunder.
160	SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD
160
look to Ash in reverence.
161	ASH												 161
twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,
WHOOSH...
and holsters it.
ASH
Bring me your hoo do man.
202
Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.
203	ASH												 203
points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.
204	THE BLACKSMITH										204
pounds upon the hand armor, modifying it.
205	SHEILA
205
knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.
206	BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY
206
THE BLACKSMITH
attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
207	ASH												 207
tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a
ratchet like device.
208	ASH												 208
extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.
WHOOSH!
CLANG!
209	SHEILA
209
gasps.
210	ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND							210
SNAPS open with great force.
211	ANGLE ON											 211
WHOOSH CLANG!
ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND
clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron
goblet.
212	CLOSE ON ASH
212
He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.
DISSOLVE TO:
A log, that serves as the door's bolt, holds fast.
242	THE EVIL FORCE										242
emerges from over the ridge.
243	ASH												 243
unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.
He slings the chainsaw
from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.
Click.
He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT
that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.
He thrusts out his
arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!
The blade bites into the log that bolts the door.
245	THE EVIL FORCE										245
draws closer.
CLOSE ON CHAINSAW BLADE
halfway through the log.
Sawdust flies.
ANGLE ON DOOR
The partially cut log gives way.
Ash tumbles into the storage
shed. He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the
log across the latch, re-bolting it.
251	THE EVIL FORCE										251
Hammers at the door of the Shed.
BANG!
A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
BANG!
Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder
behind Ash.
253	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT
253
It cracks.
254	ASH												 254
presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying
that whatever it out there, won't get in.
BANG!
Splinters fly.
255	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT
255
BOOM!
The crack widens.
256	THE DOOR FRAME										256
behind Ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
257	ASH												 257
begins to SCREAM.
And the BANGING halts.
258
All is quiet.
Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.
And
that's when it hits.
LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
Force.
Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
Shed, spinning head over heels.
Ash rips through other doors,
taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
as he flies through the air.
ASH
enters the Mill.
ASH
Anybody here?!
The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his
breath.
ASH
This place'll do for the night.
Get the book in the morning.
266
Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.
267	ASH												 267
peers through the window.
ASH
listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
of the gale.
270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270
on the window quietly KNOCK.
Ash shivers and rubs his arms for
warmth.
ASH
Damn this cold.
271	ASH												 271
looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
272	GASOLINE											 272
pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
273	ASH												 273
lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the
flame for warmth.
ASH
'least I won't freeze to death.
He turns to a tiny sound.
274	WIDE SHOT - ASH
274
behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
past.
275	ASH												 275
spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
BLAMITY-BLAM!
The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW
276
Only the night woods.
The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
a tree branch swaying in the wind.
277	ASH												 277
reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
crack.
278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
through the crack in the door.
279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND
279
CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.
There is
movement.
ASH
races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES
288
Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.
From the eight
pieces of mirror spring...
289	EIGHT TINY ASHES
289
Two inch high versions of himself.
They leap from the mirror
fragments and land on the floor.
290	ASH												 290
is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
grab a discarded dinner fork.
Like men on a battering ram, they
race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
292	ASH												 292
SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
stove pipe.
293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.
Another
leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
294	ASH												 294
barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
off.
295	THE TINY ASHES										295
SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.
They jump away from the
shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
296	ASH												 296
pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
297	TINY ASH #1
297
is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
him.
298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
WHOOSHES past.
FA-THONG!
299	THE FORK											 299
skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
300	ASH												 300
stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
of him by other tiny ASHES.
His head slams into a stove pipe.
He crumples.
He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
stove.
SSSSSSssss.
He pries his face loose with a spatula.
301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
is pushed off a high shelf.
CLANG!
302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD
302
and spills slippery grease about the floor.
303	ASH												 303
with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
and forth on the grease.
He stands and tries to dislodge the
bucket.
He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
path.
He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
needles jutting from it.
304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH
304
SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
stove pipe.
CLANG!
Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
the needles from his buttocks.
He looks about for the little
imps.
305	TINY ASH #2
305
crouching behind a log attempting to hide.
BUT...
306	ASH												 306
has seen him.
He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
#2 into the stove's fire.
ASH
Ooops.
307	TINY ASH #2
307
is burned alive.
308	ASH												 308
glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
309	TINY ASH #3
309
is dashing across the open expanse of floor.
Ash's gigantic
foot comes down to crush the little man.
Tiny Ash #3 raises
a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
RIP!!
310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
through Ash's shoe.
311	ASH												 311
jerks his leg upward in pain.
Ash dances about the place
hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
312	ASH												 312
awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
tiny ropes.
Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5
313
suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
stand atop Ash's face.
They push from either side of his
nostrils, plugging his nose.
Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
air.
As he inhales...
315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6
315
is released.
316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN
316
He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
317	ASH												 317
inhales the living beast whole.
He chokes violently.
He breaks
his bonds an he hacks for breath.
He puts his finger down his
throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
avail.
He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
gone.
He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
to a chair.
He goes pale.
ASH
Nasty little thing's inside me.
He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
Well let's see how you like a
little hot water!
He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
contents painfully down his throat.
He sets down the kettle
and waits for a moment.
A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
ASH
emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.
Then his
arm.
He rips back his shirt sleeve.
318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION
318
We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
319	ASH												 319
watches in horror as...
320	THE TINY FIGURE
320
squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.
The
Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
iron hand swings at him.
321	THE IRON HAND										 321
connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
322	ASH												 322
lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.
But
the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
the opened vice.
323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
cranks the vice's handle.
324	THE VICE											 324
tightens around Ash's head.
Trapped, he looks to...
325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
rummaging through a wooden toolbox.
It comes upon a crude wooden
punch.
326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED
326
stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.
But Ash expertly dodges each
stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
is super fast motion.
327	ASH												 327
with is head still wedged in the vice.
ASH
Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
328
has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.
He emits
a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
ASH
Soon as I get out of this thing
I... YIEEEE!!
THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
ASH
No!
Not the teeth!
YANK!
329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
his inspection.
It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.
It
scurries from view.
330	ASH'S HEAD
330
struggling in the grip of the vice.
ASH
Where the hell are ya!?
331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
ASH
I can't see ya!!
HIS EVIL HAND
raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
right half of his body.
ASH
No, no--not the poke--
SSSSsssssssss!
332	ASH												 332
jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.
He holds up
his iron hand.
It's back to normal.
Again under his control.
ASH
Okay then.
But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
shoulder itches.
He scratches it.
The Itch grows.
It itches
madly.
He rips back his shirt.
Upon his shoulder... THERE
BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT
333
It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.
Beneath it, a mouth and nose
begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
334	ASH												 334
SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.
The CAMERA
follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
woods.
362
It's eyes pop open!
It peers up at Ash from the grave.
It
croaks;
EVIL ASH HEAD
You'll never get that Book. I will
come back for you.
ASH
Hey, what's that you got on your
face?
EVIL ASH HEAD
Huh?
363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD
363
It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a
shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.
364	EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO
364
as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
365	ASH												 365
buries it deep.
He raises a crude burial marker high above his
head;
ASH
(muttering under his
breath)
Rest in pieces.
366	ASH												 366
backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
GROANS in the gale.
ASH
This must be it. The cemetery.
368	ASH												 368
moves toward the cemetery.
369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY
369
In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
370	ASH												 370
draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.
He glances down to...
371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL
371
sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.
The jaw
bone drops open with a squeak.
372	CLOSE ON ASH
372
His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and
shadow.
374	ASH												 374
arrives at the foot of the massive stone.
375	UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE								375
Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
376	CAMERA PANS REVEALING...								376
A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
377	CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING...
377
A THIRD!
378	CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL:				 378
THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
379	A BAFFLED ASH										 379
steps close.
ASH
Wait.
Three books?
Nobody said
anything about that. Ha!
That
Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
fulla his secret words and phrases
and, and, his... bullshit, he
forgot to mention anything about
that.
Like do I take all of 'em
of one or 'em, or what?
Well...
He reaches for the first book and opens it.
380	ANGLE ON											 380
WHOOOOOOSH!!!
To reveal a black hole.
SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
stronger.
383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET
384
Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD
385
stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
386	ASH PUPPET
386
A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH
387
His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
normal.
ASH
Woah.
Wrong book.
He turns to study...
388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
ASH
tries to decide between them.
At first he's sure which one it
is.
Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
the other.
389	THE BOOK											 389
moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
ASH
Huh.
Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.
The Book
flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
like a bat!
391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED
391
Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
392	THE BATBOOK
392
shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
ASH
Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
393	ASH												 393
pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
pedestal.
394	ASH												 394
faces the remaining book.
He slowly reaches for it as the wind
kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!
Two empty
eye sockets stare out from it.
This is the Book of the Dead...
396	ASH												 396
bristles in fear.
ASH
Okay.
The words.
Say the words.
KLATOO!... VERATA...
uh...
Uh...
Necta... uh... Nectar...
Necktie... uh...
He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
ASH
KLATOO... VERATA...
NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
The wind stops.
It seems to have worked.
He looks about with
growing confidence.
ASH
Okay then.
But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
soundtrack.
397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY
397
ASH
A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
one are thrust from the earth.
ASH
Hey, wait a minute. Everything's
cool!
I said the words!
I did!
A DOOR
blows open revealing Wiseman John.
He looks at the gathering
storm with foreboding.
WISEMAN JOHN
Something is amiss.
400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
out at the storm.
TWO WARRIORS
hold Ash's horse as he dismounts. There are excited shouts from
the villagers
VILLAGERS
The stranger has returned!
He's
brought the book!
ASH
is led to the THREE WISEMEN.
WISEMAN JOHN
The Necronomicon.
Quickly.
433	ASH												 433
pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
WISEMAN JOHN
Did you bring the Necronomicon!
434	ASH												 434
slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
Wiseman.
ASH
Yes. It's just that...
WISEMAN JOHN
Just what?!
ASH
Nothing. Here
Ash produces the Necronomicon.
Now send be back. Like in the
deal.
435	WISEMAN JOHN
435
takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
WISEMAN JOHN
No...I sensed something had gone
awry. The book's power. It's gone.
436	THE CROWD											436
murmurs at this bad news.
437	ASH												 437
suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
WISEMAN JOHN
When you removed the Necronomicon
from it's cradle, did you speak
the words?
ASH
Yeah.
basically.
WISEMAN JOHN
Did you speak the exact words?!
ASH
Well, maybe not every single
syllable, no.
But basically I
said them.
Yes.
438	WISEMAN JOHN
439
bows his head, stung by this information.
WISEMAN JOHN
Dung eating fool!
Thou hast doomed
us. When thou misspoke the words
the Army of the Dead was awoke.
ASH
Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
you could clean this thing up,
once I got you the book. You said
there was a passage in there that
could get rid of this thing and
send me back.
WISEMAN JOHN
The passage is useless to us as
long as these evil dead walk. They
have a terrible desire for this
book. And they shall come here
to get it. Once in their
possession, the Evil shall rule
the Earth for one thousand
years...Because of you...we are
doomed.
ASH
You wanted the damn book. You got
yer book. I did my part of the
deal.
WISEMAN JOHN
We did strike a bargain. I will
return you to your own time as
promised.
ASH
Yeah. Well good. That was the
deal.
So uh...when do you think
we can...
439	ASH												 439
looks about at the condemned faces.
440	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE VILLAGERS							 440
CAMERA PANS past the doomed faces in the crowd.
ASH
I mean...when can you send me...
441	ASH												 441
sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's
doomed her.
ARTHUR
The Wisemen were fools to believe
that you were the Promised one.
That one such as you could have
saved us!.
442	ASH												 442
is solemn.
443	ARTHUR
443
and the others turn away in contempt.
444	SHEILA
444
moves closer.
SHEILA
I still believe that thou wilt
help us.
ASH
No.. They're right.
I screwed
up. I didn't come through for you,
and...
I'm sorry for it.
SHEILA
I still have faith in thee. In
my heart I know thou wilt still
succeed.
ASH
Sheila... It's over for me. I
don't belong here and I'm going
home. I didn't have what it took.
It's over.
He bows his head and moves off.
A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!
445	ALL HEADS											445
look to the sky.
446	TWO WINGED DEADITES									446
possessed women with bat-like wings, swoop down.
447	TEN VILLAGERS										 447
scream as they flee from the winged beasts.
448	WINGED DEADITE #1
448
Like a delta winged F-15, it banks towards Sheila.
ASH
No!
449	ASH												 449
races to intercept.
He plants himself between Sheila and the
beast.
450	WINGED DEADITE #1 - POV								 450
As it swoops at Ash.
451	ASH												 451
opens his steel hand, then clamps it closed again on the handle
of his sword.
452	ASKEW ANGLE
452
The immense shadow of the broad winged Deadite falls over Ash.
453	ASH												 453
swings his sword upward.
454	CLOSE SHOT - THE BLADE
454
severs the tip of the Beast's rotted wing.
455	THE FLYING DEADITE									 455
shrieks in pain as it soars over Ash. No longer aerodynamically
sound, it crashes to the ground.
456	A GROUP OF WARRIORS									456
fire their arrows into the beast, pegging it to a tree.
The
bone white eyes of the creature darken.
457	ASH AND ARTHUR										457
spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM.
458	SHEILA
458
in the clutches of WINGED DEADITE #2.
SHEILA
M'Lord Ash!
Help me!
The beast flies off with the fair maiden, soaring over the
castle wall and into the distance.
459	ASH												 459
shakes his fist at the receding beast.
ASH
Damn you!
460	THREE MOUNTED SCOUTS
460
come riding in through the castle doors.
SCOUT
An army of the dead!
They have
gathered in the wilderness and
come this way.
ARTHUR
How far from here?
SCOUT
But two days ride.
ARTHUR
Then these winged ones are only
the first of them.
WISEMAN
Perhaps we should go from this
place while we can.
GOLD TOOTH
We could be safe in the mountains.
WARRIORS
Yes!
To the mountains!
We must flee!
They'll take our souls!
461	ANGLE ON											 461
BLAMMITY-BLAM!
All eyes look to...
462	ASH												 462
who stands on a high castle wall, clutching his smoldering
shotgun.
ASH
Go ahead and run.
Run home and
cry to mama.
I'm through runnin'.
I stay we stay and fight.
463	ARTHUR
463
takes a challenging step forward.
ARTHUR
How will we stop an army of the
dead at out castle walls?
How will
you fight that?!
With more words?
Most of out people have already
fled.
We are but forty men.
ASH
We'll get Henry the Red and his
men to fight with us.
ARTHUR
We shall not stand in battle,
alongside the likes of him. Our
honor will not allow it.
ASH
Then you'll die.
Honor and all.
Now who's with me?
464	THE CROWD											464
is silent as they consider Ash's words. Then from the rear, the
Village Blacksmith steps forward.
BLACKSMITH
I'll stand by you.
465	A WARRIOR											465
steps forward. Then another.
WARRIOR #7
You may count on my steel.
WARRIOR #8
And mine!
466	THE CROWD											466
steps forward vowing their allegiance to the cause.
467	ARTHUR
467
reluctantly joins them.
482
ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH
look under the hood of the Delta 88, parked in the Blacksmith's
shop.
483	THE DELTA'S ENGINE									 483
is shattered.
484	ASH												 484
frowns.
485	ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH
485
pour molten iron into a large sand mold.
486	THE SAND											 486
is brushed away revealing gear wheels.
487	HAMMERS
487
beat upon red hot iron, fashioning helicopter like rotor blades.
488	THE BLACKSMITH'S STOVE
488
is lowered into the Delta's engine compartment.
498
A look of shock and fear on all the faces.
ASH comes into
frame.
CAMERA CRANES UP with him as he scales the ladder to
the lookout tower. He peers out to the darkening horizon.
499	ASH												 499
hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones.
Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching
armor.
500	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE HORIZON
500
Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the
horizon.
Then fifty more.
THREE WOODEN CATAPULTS
are wheeled into position.
ARTHUR
Powder!
532	GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							532
hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults.
Their fuses are lit.
533	ASH												 533
gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of
black powder catapulting.
534	LONG SHOT - CASTLE									 534
Three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle
walls.
535	THREE FALLING SATCHELS P.O.V.'S
535
CAMERA CRANING DOWN toward the skeletons as they look upward
in horror.
BOOM!
The first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider. Bones
fly.
BOOM!
FOUR DEADITES are obliterated.
536	EVIL ASH											 536
turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
EVIL ASH
You needn't bother.
537	EVIL ASH											 537
slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
EVIL ASH
You are now my captain. I will
now allow anything to stop me from
possessing the Necronomicon. Get
me into that castle.
538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:
NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN
RAM THE GATES!
539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539
use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors
of the castle.
BOOM!-BOOM!
540
begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
541	TWO VILLAGE WOMEN
541
scream!
542	TEN WARRIORS
542
wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors.
547
TWO DEAD WARRIORS
fall to the courtyard. Villagers lift them away on stretchers.
548	ARTHUR
548
shouts to Ash:
ARTHUR
Where is Henry?!
ASH
He'll be here.
ARTHUR
I think he will not. But know
this.
No matter how this battle
fares, I was wrong to think you
a coward.
555
are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but
are quickly overcome.
556	EVIL SHEILA
556
takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
557	EVIL ASH											 557
smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
just beyond the parapet.
EVIL ASH
The book shall be mine!
He raises his rusty sword.
LADDERS!
558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD
558
storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
large rocks rain down upon them from above.
559	TWO WARRIORS
559
push away ladder #1.
560	FOUR SKELETONS ON LADDER #1
560
swing away from the wall and crash to the ground.
561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2
561
leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
562	WARRIOR #2
562
knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
WARRIOR #2
We can't hold this wall much
longer!
563	A DEADITE ARROW
563
pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
A VIKING DEADITE
looks up as he hears...
CHUG!
CHUG!
CHUG!
565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.
565
THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
Behold...
566	THE DEATHCOASTER
566
The stripped chaise of the Delta
88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
567	GOLD TOOTH
567
shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
568	ASH												 568
is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE
569
SCREAMS to announce its birth.
570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET
571
cheer!
572	EVIL DEAD											572
at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
574	ASH												 574
operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
Thwop!
Thwop!
Two more skeletons bite the dust.
leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
576	GOLD TOOTH
576
disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
the Deadites.
577	EVIL SHEILA
577
leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
EVIL SHEILA
Thou didst find me beautiful once.
ASH
Honey...You got real ugly.
578	EVIL SHEILA
578
attacks with a SHRIEK!
579	ASH												 579
spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
BLAMMITY-BLAM!
...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
Deadites.
580	ASH												 580
pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
craft.
581	THE DEATHCOASTER
581
careens out of control.
582	ASH												 582
tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
583	THE DEATHCOASTER
583
flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
584	ASH												 584
picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!
Evil
Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
slices one end of it with his sword.
587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
parapet.
588	ASH												 588
looks to...
589	EVIL ASH											 589
approaching the Necronomicon.
590	ASH												 590
kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
burns and SHRIEKS!
592	ASH												 592
watches in horror as...
593	THE FLAMES RECEED
593
revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
EVIL ASH!
It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
594	ASH AND EVIL ASH
594
bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
fly.
Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
the Necronomicon.
CLANG!
With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
595	ASH'S SWORD
595
imbeds in a wooden beam.
596	EVIL ASH											 596
grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
597	ASH												 597
grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
598	ANGLE ON											 598
WHOOSH!
KLANG!
WHOOSH!
KLANG!
Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
599	ANGLE ON											 599
KLANG!
The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
upon the spoon of a catapult.
600	ABOVE...											 600
SKELETON ASH
swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
downward, and Ash side steps it.
601	ASH												 601
rabbit punches CAMERA.
602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD
602
Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
603	ASH												 603
delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
a circle.
604	THE SKELETON
604
gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
over the edge.
605	ASH												 605
falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
at the burning fuse.
606	EVIL ASH											 606
leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
607	SKELETON ASH
607
Behold...
He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
Keep.
608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH
608
SKELETON ASH
You're finished.
He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
SKELETON ASH
I possess the Necronomicon. I've
crushed your pathetic army. Now
I'll have my vengeance!
He raises his sword for the death blow...
609	THE SHRILL CALL OF BATTLE TRUMPETS						609
GUARD (O.S.)
Duke Henry's men!
They've come!
610	ASH AND THE SKELETON
610
turn...
A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
courtyard to attack the Deadites!
612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT
612
turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
613	ASH												 613
has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
Ash.
614	ASH												 614
snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
through the rope, springing the catapult.
615	THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL
615
are flung over the castle wall.
616	HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE						616
THE SKELETON PROJECTILE
rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning
satchel follows.
BOOM!
The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air.
A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
crush the last of the Deadites.
DISSOLVE TO:
617	GLORIOUS BEAMS OF MORNING SUNLIGHT						617
streak over the horizon. Ash enters frame. He holds the
Necronomicon as he looks wearily out over the battlefield.
618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING

Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur's Warriors
work together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a
bonfire.
619	CLOSE SHOT - TWO DEADITE SKULLS

engulfed by flames, crack in the heat.
DISSOLVE TO:
ASH (V.O.)
Peace was made between the two
peoples.
And a new nation was
formed.
They offered my a chance
to stay among them and teach them.
A chance to lead them.
To be
King.
But Sheila was gone.
Besides, I had places to go.
FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
625	THE WISEMEN
625
mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from
the Necronomicon.
A flask is dipped into the liquid.
WISEMAN JOHN
hands the flask of liquid to Ash.
WISEMAN JOHN
The Book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep a century.
Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
awaken in thine own time.
ASH (V.O.)
Yeah.
Right...
Ash takes the flask and studies it.
...but what other choice did I
have?
DISSOLVE TO:
628
ASH
Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.
He
ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.
ASH (V.O.)
I locked the door.
629
BOOM!
The powder charge blows.
The cave's entrance is sealed shut
with an avalanche of rock.
The car headlights come on, piercing the blackness.
631
ASH
uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.
ASH (V.O.)
I closed my eyes.
He lets six drops fall into his mouth.
One for each century
he must sleep.
ASH (V.O.)
I took a drink.
Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!
A
7th drop!
Ash swallows the liquid.
ASH (V.O.)
I didn't know if it was day or
night. I started... to get
drowsy... And I slept...
632	ASH												 632
falls into a deep slumber.
DISSOLVE TO:
633	THE DEATHCOASTER'S HEADLIGHTS							633
fade.
DISSOLVE TO:
634	CLOSER ON ASH'S SLEEPING FACE							634
now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.
ASH
...And dreamed.
635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
Ash's wrist.
636	THE SUN
636
rises then sets.
637	THE MOON											 637
follows.
638	A CRACK
638
forms along the surface of the aging rock wall.
ASH (V.O.)
Dreams last lasted centuries.
639	A BARREN TREE										 639
sprouts buds, they swell forming leaves which change to the
brilliant colors of fall then drop.
640	A FROST
640
covers Ash.
641	ICICLES
641
on the ceiling of the cave melt.
The water drops down onto
Ash's face.
He stirs.
642	ASH												 642
awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.
Sunlight streams
into the hole he has created.
