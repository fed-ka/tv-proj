	LUTHOR lowers the binoculars, smiles, turns to where Asabi
	stands by the breakfast table: white linen cloth, sterling
	silver service, O.J. fresh squeezed, coffee fresh brewed.
	Luthor's smile widens; all's right with his world.  He seats
	himself.  Asabi provides a napkin.  Two beautiful JAPANESE
	WOMEN, clad in rec: silk dresses slit up one side, appear and
	bow.  They hold between them a pogo stick.  Luthor nods to
	them, nods to Asabi, who hands them each a perfect white rose.

				JAPANESE WOMEN

		Domo arigato.

				LUTHOR
		Do itashi mashte.

	They bow again, denart.  Asabi pours coffee, uncovers a
	chafing dish of baked squab, serves, steps back.  Luthor
	rifles through his stack of morning newspapers.  A slight
	frown creases his forehead.

	Luthor looks at Asabi, who nervously looks away.  Luthor,

	RING, ANOTHER, then...

				LOIS (O.S.)
			(answering machine)
		Hi. You've reached the desk of
		Lois Lane.  Leave a message at
		the tone, but don't expect a
		call back unless it's about
		Superman.  Have a great day.

	BEEP.  Luthor hangs up.  The ambiance of the morning is
	shattered.  The hawk glides into the balcony and
	settles onto its perch behind Luthor's chair.  Lex
	turns a dark look in its direction.

					CUT TO:



	Lois' cab pulls up.  Lois hops out.  The cab waits, idling,
	as Lois sprints to where a crowd has collected.  They look
	up the side of the towering edifice.



	The police NEGOTIATOR stands near the raised ledge that
	borders the roof.  Other police have established a command	*
	post nearby.

				NEGOTIATOR
		It's always darkest before the

17	ON LEDGE						17

	The "jumper" is Jules.  He balances on the narrow parapet,
	holding onto and drumming idly on the brick chimney that
	rises beside him.  He's totally at ease.

		Well, can I get you somethin'?

				JULES
			(considering)

				NEGOTIATOR
			(encouraged)
		Whatever you want.

				JULES
		Make it decaf.  Caffeine makes me

				NEGOTIATOR
			(repeating)
		Whatever you want.

	He turns toward the command post, about to call for the
	drink, then stops, thinks.

				NEGOTIATOR (Cont'd)
		Jumpy?

	Jules takes a step away from the chimney, pretends to lose
	his balance, teeters on the edge.  The Negotiator grabs
	for him, misses.



	As JuLes dramatically waves his arms the crowd gasps.  Then
	A RED AND BLUE STREAK FLASHES ACROSS THE SKY toward the
	ledge. Everyone points, exclaims.


	SUPERMAN LANDS beside Jules, catches him before he falls.

	Superman helps him off the ledge.

				SUPERMAN
		You don't really want to do this.

				JULES
		You're right.  I've seen the
		error of my ways.



	Monique, looking terrified, stands on the rooftop ledge.
	Albert holds her by the ankle from below.  With the other
	hand Albert holds a cellular phone.

				ALBERT
			(into phone)
		Confirm.

				MONIQUE
		Albert, please be careful.

				ALBERT
		Don't worry.  I've got you.

		Execute.

				ALBERT	*
		Roger that.	*

	To her shock and surprise, Albert lets go of Monique's ankle
	and uses his walking stick to push her off the ledge.  She
	drops with a scream.


	Jules is helped inside.  Then, with SUPER HEARING, Superman 
	hears the scream.  He whirls, TAKES OFF.

		Go!

	The Cabbie goes.



	Monique falls, still screaming... Superman CATCHES HER.


	An ambulance, SIREN on, pulls away just as Lois' cab
	careens to the curb.  Lois hops out. Again the cab waits,
	idling. Clusters of People are still gathered on the side-
	walk; occasionally someone points up.  Lois runs toward
	one such cluster.

	Lois grimaces, shuts her eyes, takes a deep breath.  When
	she turns to face Clark she's all smiles.

				LOIS
		Clark, that's great!  Really
		great.

				CLARK
		I better phone it in.

	Lois shakes her head vigorously.

				LOIS
		Don't.  They'll just rewrite you.
		My advice is: get back to the

	Lois smiles.  Clark runs to the cab, gets in, leaves.

				LOIS
			(to herself)
		No, I owe you one.

	She spots a nearby phone stand, heads toward it.  A man 
	gets there first, lifts the receiver, deposits a coin.
	Lois, smile gone, grabs the receiver from his hand and
	punches a number.  He starts to protest; Lois motions him

	Lois hops out of a cab and sprints toward the police line.
	Then, the BUILDING EXPLODES.  She ducks, a bit of flying
	debris strikes her forehead, she cries out, falls.

	L & C - "Neverending Battle" - Rev. 7/14/93 (Yellow)	32.


	Investigators comb the rubble. There's still lots of
	dust and smoke in the air. Ambulance teams tend to the
	wounded onlookers, but none of the injuries seem serious.

	Lois Lane, a blood-stained bandage covering the small cut
	at her hairline, bends to pick up something from beneath a	*
	fallen brick: a shred of red cloth. Can it be? She
	examines the material, then carefully wraps it in a tissue
	and pockets it. As she straightens, she spots Clark Kent
	listening intently to INSPECTOR HENDERSON near the bomb
	squad van. She hurries to join them. Henderson has bomb
	components spread out on a folding table.

		It's nothing.

				HENDERSON
		You guys want to hear this, or

				LOIS
		Yes.

				HENDERSON
		The explosion was radio-

		unknown point of origin within a
		two-mile radius of this site.
		Also, there were video cameras
		installed in the lobby that were
		not park of the building's
		security system, or any other
		system that the management
		company knew about.  We think the
		two are connected.

				LOIS
			(instantly putting

		You're saying someone waited for
		Superman to appear, watched him
		enter the building, and then
		detonated the explosives?

				HENDERSON
		That's our theory

	An ambulance pulls away, SIREN WAILING.  Clark, stricken,
	watches it go.  Henderson is hailed by another cop, leaves.

	FADE IN:


	Superman flies above the lights, weaving through the towers,

	Lots of foot traffic. One area is roped off so a giant
	crane can hoist a billboard atop a roof. A crowd has
	gathered to watch. The billboard lifts and is slowly swung
	toward the building. Then, trouble. The crane's MOTOR
	STALLS AND RE-STARTS with a jerk. The sudden motion causes
	one of the two steel cables supporting the billboard to
	snap. The operator SHUTS the MOTOR down.


79B	CLOSEUP - BILLBOARD				79E

	It depicts a family at the breakfast table; mom and dad read
	the paper. Text: Wake Up To The Daily Planet. Below that,
	the famous logo. It dangles by a single cable.


79C	CROWD						79C

	Gasps and moves back.  Workmen appear from behind and out of
	the cab of the crane and confer, pointing and gesturing at
	the problem.  The situation is serious, but not yet
	dangerous.  Then, with a TWANG of METAL FIBERS FRAYING, the
	remaining cable begins to unravel.  The workmen scatter.


79D	BILLBOARD						79D

	It casts a shadow on the empty sidewalk below.  It will
	fall, the only question is how soon.


79E	CROWD						79E

	waits breathlessly for the anticipated crash.  But now, with
	no warning, a GRANDMOTHER holding her two granddaughters,
	one by each hand, emerges from a storefront inside the roped 
	off area and proceeds onto the sidewalk, into the shadow.
	The crowd reacts.

				VARIOUS PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
		1.  Look out!
		2.  Above you!
		3.  Get out of there!

	The Grandmother looks up, sees the menace, tugs at 
	the kids, one of whom drops a stuffed animal.  The kid wants
	to go back for it, but Gramma won't let her.  The KID begins
	to CRY.  The threesome reach the border and safety, but the 
	kid breaks free and runs back to her toy.  The Grandmother
	starts back after her.  Another METALLIC TWANG: the cable
	now consists of a single strand.
