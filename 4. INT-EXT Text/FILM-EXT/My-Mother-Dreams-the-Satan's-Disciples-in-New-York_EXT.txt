A lone farmhouse sits isolated against a prairie backdrop,
silhouetted by a marbled dawn sky.
A paint-chipped truck rounds the corner on a dirt road
leading into the farm.
Marian, waiting on the porch, ready to go, rises and waves.
A FEW MOMENTS LATER -
Marian's son, STEVE, dressed in jeans and flannel shirt,
loads his mother's single piece of luggage into the bed of
the truck, climbs back into the cab, where his mother is
sitting, and drives off.
DISSOLVE TO:
A JETLINER descending in the hot, cerulean sky.
DISSOLVE TO:
Marian, looking a little forlorn and out of sorts, stands out
by the taxi area with her suitcase on a tote, looking around
for a cab, unsure what to do.
CURBSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
MISCHA, a somewhat dissolute-looking Russian cabbie in his
thirties, roughhouses Marian's single piece of luggage into
the dirty, cluttered trunk of his cab.
The TAXI passes on a turnpike, streaming with vehicles,
headed toward Manhattan.
DRIVE-BY TRANSITION.
Cars pouring into Manhattan over one of the many bridges
spanning the East River.
CUT TO:
The cab brakes to a halt, bringing Marian INTO THE FRAME, her
face strickened with fear.
Marian climbs out of the cab as Mischa, in the background,
opens the trunk to retrieve her bag.
Marian, taking in the
foreign surroundings, seems confused about something.
MARIAN
Pardon me, Mischa.
Is this 526 East 5TH
Street?
Mischa closes the trunk and approaches Marian with her one
piece of luggage on a tote.
MISCHA
No, no.
Sorry, I can't drive you to
door.
There's a roadblock on Avenue B
...
(he gestures down the street)
right there ...
MARIAN'S AND MISCHA'S P.O.V. -
At the far end of the block, we SEE a movable, blue NYPD
roadblock.
BACK -
The two of them, Marian looking puzzled.
MISCHA
This is one-way street.
You go down the
block to the middle.
MARIAN
(pointing uncertainly)
This way?
MISCHA
Yeah.
Not far.
You will be fine.
(beat)
It's still day.
He chuckles to himself, but Marian doesn't get the joke.
MARIAN
I see.
How much?
MISCHA
Forty-five all total.
MARIAN
Forty-five?
I thought it was only
supposed to be thirty?
MISCHA
Thirty is base price.
Tolls, tax, tip
... it all adds up.
Marian unsnaps her wallet and grudgingly hands the
disreputable cabbie two twenties and a five.
Mischa takes the money and starts away.
Halfway back to his
cab, he turns around and calls out to Marian, who stands
frozen on the dilapidated street.
MISCHA
Hey, lady.
(Marian turns)
Hold purse like this.
Mischa hugs an imaginary purse close to his side.
Marian
apes his advice in all seriousness.
MISCHA
(nodding approval)
Good luck.
Mischa climbs back into his cab and peels off.
NEW ANGLE -
HIGH DOWN WIDE of Marian standing forlornly at the end of the
street, a Dayton's shopping bag in one hand, her luggage
strapped to the tote in the other.
TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED:
MY MOTHER DREAMS THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK
CUT TO:
Marian pulling her luggage apprehensively down the street.
She passes THE SQUATTERS, a motley group of homeless
teenagers, pierced, tattooed, wild hairdos and even wilder
attire.
SQUATTER #1
Hey, lady, can you help us out with some
change today?
Marian, shocked by their circumstances, rolls her luggage
past them, smiling faintly.
SQUATTER #2
Come on.
Every little bit helps.
A
little food, you know?
MARIAN
Maybe some other time.
SQUATTER #1
Thanks a lot anyway.
Marian continues on.
She's distracted by ...
A WOMAN in her thirties, who looks like she hasn't slept in a
week, bent over the railing of a second-story fire escape
balcony, in the throes of a veritable rage.
WOMAN IN A RAGE
You forgot your fucking plant, you
fucking asshole!
Marian stares up at her, even more disconcerted than ever.
The enraged woman continues her tirade at an unseen old
boyfriend below.
WOMAN IN A RAGE
And there's a lot of other shit in there
you forgot.
Just wait there, I'm going
to go fucking get it for you, all right?
No, just wait there! Do you want me to go
get it for you?
Well, why don't I just
do that, huh?
I'm going to do that right
now!
Marian looks away and, intrepid Midwesterner that she is,
pushes on.
A MAN, dressed strangely, stands surreally in the middle of
the street, blowing huge clouds of cigarette smoke.
A GAY COUPLE parade past, laughing hysterically.
NEW ANGLE - AT THE END OF THE STREET -
A PACK of unmufflered, chrome-coruscating HARLEYS round the
corner in a ear-shattering approach.
MARIAN -
stops dead in her tracks and stares in heartstopping terror.
ACROSS THE STREET -
The BIKERS, wearing their club's colors embroidered on blue
jeans, and leather, vests, back their motorcycles in a
uniform row against the curb, kill their engines, park them
at an angle on their kickstands, and dismount.
They high-five a biker known as the DISCIPLE PROSPECT, a
small, mean-looking man with a red bandana tied taut over his
head, and then disappear into the windowless clubhouse,
passing through a large, forbidding, black door with the
skeleton of Death riding a motorcycle painted on it.
The Disciple Prospect tosses the butt of a cigarette into a
rusted steel drum and flames erupt.
MARIAN -
in horror, cannot pry her eyes away from them.
NEW ANGLE -
An upstairs window on a six-story, red-brick co-op building.
PAULA, Marian's daughter, a pretty woman with short dark
hair, is leaning out the window, waving.
PAULA
Mom!
Hi!
I'll be right down.
Paula emerges to greet her mother.
Marian glances one last time across the street and exchanges
oblique looks with the Disciple Prospect, now parked on a
stool next to the burning drum.
He seems to home in on her.
Out the window.
Two BIKERS stand with their arms
crisscrossed against their leather-vested chests, framing the
burning drum on the sidewalk, guarding the phalanx of
Harleys.
CUT TO:
A Kenneth Anger Scorpio Rising-like MONTAGE:
A black-booted foot kick-starts a Harley.
A gleaming chrome exhaust pipe vibrates and spits smoke.
A black-gloved hand revs a handle-bar accelerator.
A helmet is pulled down over a Hun-like face.
Flames roar in the steel drum as though a signpost in Hell.
One of the DISCIPLES, bare-chested, long-haired, sweating,
swings a baseball bat and calls out to Marian in a singsong
voice:
BIKER
Oh, Marian ...
Another half-naked BIKER, arms tattooed up and down, has
Marian's suitcase open and is scattering her belongings out
into the street.
He finds the framed photo of her deceased
husband and tosses it to the pavement.
He raises his head
slowly with a sneer and looks up at ...
MARIAN -
standing in the window in her nightgown, a hand covering her
mouth, looking down in utter terror on the fire-lit tableaux
of her nightmare.
THE BIKER ON THE STREET -
starts stomping on the photo with the heel of his boot,
shattering the glass.
Then he removes the photo from the
frame and slowly drops it into the roaring conflagration in
the oil drum.
The other dawdling Disciples guffaw loudly.
SLAM CUT TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT of Paula's red-brick co-op, splashed with
sunlight and framed by a bright blue sky.
Looking down on the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse.
Two BIKERS
and their GIRLFRIENDS swagger out of the clubhouse, don their
helmets, mount their bikes, kick-start them to life and roar
off down the street.
MARIAN -
draws away from the window.
She picks up her "Streetwise
Manhattan" laminated map, puts her glasses on, looks at it,
debating whether to tackle the streets of New York or not.
A FEW MINUTES LATER -
Marian, determined now to get out of the co-op, pulls her
purse over her shoulder and grips it like the cabbie
instructed.
Then she moves to the front door, opens it, and
steps warily out into the hallway.
She freezes when she
HEARS THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS.
Manhattan skyscrapers framed against a twilit sky.
Marian and Paula, arm-in-arm, walk down the block back to her
building.
A MOTORCYCLE rounds the corner, slows to a crawl, and one of
the Satan's Disciples stares over at the two of them as if
casing them out.
Paula won't look at him, but Marian can't
avert her gaze.
DISSOLVE TO:
DOLLY ACROSS a line of idling Harleys, the bikers, one at a
time in succession, switching their single-beam headlights
on.
PAN ACROSS the FACES of the Disciples, mounted on their
cycles, dark helmets, faded blue jeans jackets embroidered
with elaborate stitching of their club's insignia, cigarettes
dangling from their hirsute mouths, baleful-looking
countenances, revving their engines loudly, tauntingly.
NEW ANGLE -
From across the street, Marian, appearing like an apparition
in her nightgown, surreally walks toward them, a beseeching
look on her face.
MARIAN
Excuse me.
Could you please turn your
motorcycles off?
They're so loud, I
can't sleep.
GO TO SLOW MOTION as the BIKERS, some ten in number, slowly
approach the frail-looking Marian.
Gently, they pick her up
off the ground and raise her aloft.
Then, like some moving
human bier, they carry her through the forbidding black door
into their clubhouse.
Marian, not wanting to be a disappointment to her daughter,
damn her fears, gathers her purse up and starts out the door.
Seen from Marian's perspective across the street, the front
of the Satan's Disciples headquarters is quiet.
There are
only a couple Harleys parked out front.
Marian, relieved that there are no bikers out, hurries off in
the direction of First Avenue, determined to see the sights
of the city.
DISSOLVE TO:
A giddy, almost dreamlike, MONTAGE of Marian touring New
York.
She's SUPERIMPOSED over famous landmarks, as if she
were standing stationery and the city were in a diorama
rotating all around her.
The Empire State Building; Circle
Cruise Line; eating a hot dog from a street vendor; shopping
at Macy's.
Marian beams as she is magically whisked along,
walking on air.
DISSOLVE TO:
Marian comes INTO THE FRAME around the corner.
She has a
spring in her step and a broad smile emblazoning her face.
But her sanguine mood is quickly shattered when she HEARS
shouting.
She freezes in her tracks.
ACROSS THE STREET - THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES HEADQUARTERS -
The Disciple Prospect and another Biker are roughing up a
teenage KID, wrestling him into submission.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
You're just chilling, huh?
Not on this
block, do you understand?
MARIAN -
at the security door of Paula's building.
She rummages
anxiously through her purse, but she can't find her keys!
MARIAN
Oh, no.
Marian glances across the street, her face tensed with fear.
ACROSS THE STREET -
The Bikers continue to roughhouse the Kid.
The Disciple
Prospect brandishes a plastic bag under his nose.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
What's this, huh?
KID
I ain't got shit on me.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
What is that?
You're chilling, man?
Well, then maybe we need to warm things
up for you, man.
How many times do we
got to tell you?
You don't listen and
you don't learn and that's the problem.
That is the problem.
MARIAN -
turns away from the escalating violence across the street and
punches one of the buttons on the intercom.
A WOMAN'S VOICE
crackles over it.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hello?
MARIAN
My daughter lives here and I'm her mother
and I've lost my keys.
There's no answer.
MARIAN
Hello?
Hello?
Marian returns her frightened gaze to the altercation across
the street.
ACROSS THE STREET - MARIAN'S P.O.V.
Two more DISCIPLES emerge from the clubhouse.
One of them
squirts lighter fluid on the fire burning in the steel drum
and the flames explode.
Then KID is dragged over toward the
fire.
The Disciple Prospect drags him dangerously close to
the flames.
DISCIPLE
Roast him!
KID
(screaming)
All right all right all right.
MARIAN -
petrified, as if she'd stepped into a re-enactment of a
passage out of Revelations, walks briskly down to the middle
of the block toward a pay phone.
DISCIPLES CLUBHOUSE -
The Disciples kick the drug-dealing Teenager a couple more
times, then set him free, laughing as he flees down the block
in mortal fear.
PAY PHONE -
Marian drops the appropriate coins in the coin slot and dials
a number from memory.
MARIAN
(quavery voice)
Yes, is Paula there? ... Could you leave
her a message, please?
Tell her it's
urgent.
(gathers herself)
Her mother has lost her keys and is
stranded on the street with the Satan's
Disciples ... When she comes back, would
you tell her to come home as quickly as
she can? ... Thank you.
Marian hangs up the phone and turns, quails in terror.
NEW ANGLE -
The Disciple Prospect is towering over her, staring down at
her with a scowl on his face.
MARIAN
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
I just need to use the phone, lady.
MARIAN
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
What happened?
Did you lose your keys?
MARIAN
(withdrawing anxiously)
Have a nice day.
WIDE SHOT -
Marian walks quickly ACROSS THE FRAME.
As she EXITS RIGHT,
the Disciple Prospect ENTERS LEFT and trails after her.
Marian is at the front entrance, uncertain what to do.
She
quailss when the Disciple Prospect approaches.
Without a
word, he reaches his arm over her and presses a buzzer to one
of the units.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hello.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
Washing machine repairman.
The DOOR BUZZES almost at once, and the Disciple Prospect
pushes it in and holds it open until Marian is safely inside.
He looks at her a little annoyed.
Marian is absolutely
nonplussed.
CUT TO:
The Disciples are backing their bikes against the curb,
parking them, and filing into the clubhouse.
BATHROOM -
Paula dispenses the remaining pills into the palm of her
hand.
PAULA
(to herself)
Three left.
LIVING ROOM -
Marian looking apprehensively down at the Disciples'
headquarters, stupefied.
Paula emerges from the bathroom in the background.
Marian
doesn't turn to acknowledge her.
She continues to stare
transfixed at the bikes and the fire-burning oil drum.
PAULA
(softer)
Okay?
Does that sound like a plan?
Marian doesn't answer.
Paula stands some distance from her distracted mother, a
worried expression featured on her face.
FADE TO:
The Disciples dismounting from their bikes below, shutting
down their engines and removing their helmets.
Marian's FOOT STEPS OFF THE CURB.
WIDER ANGLE -
Marian crosses the street headed in the direction of the
Satan's Disciples headquarters.
The Disciple Prospect is sitting alone, guarding the line of
parked Harleys.
He's wearing dark aviator shades and his
trademark red bandana tied over his head.
Marian steps
bravely right up to him.
MARIAN
Excuse me, sir.
(the Disciple Prospect looks
up, poker-faced)
I just wanted to thank you for helping me
get into my building yesterday.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
MARIAN
My daughter lives across the street from
you people and she tells me that you keep
this area safe.
Is that true?
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
We like to think so, yeah.
MARIAN
And you don't deal drugs?
The Disciple Prospect removes his sunglasses and looks at her
mock reprovingly.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
Who told you we deal drugs?
MARIAN
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
You don't have to worry.
She's going to
be fine.
We're law-abiding citizens just
like you.
MARIAN
What about yesterday?
Kicking that poor
boy?
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
(mildly annoyed)
That poor boy's a crack dealer from
Alphabet City.
We do not allow his kind
on this block.
Marian seems to accept the explanation.
She glances up.
THE CLUBHOUSE DOOR -
The black, forbidding door leading into the clubhouse with
its painting of Death on a stylized Harley, gripping
lightning bolts for handlebars.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT -
looking at Marian looking up at the door.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
Is there something else I can do for you?
MARIAN
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
(taken aback)
You want to come inside?
MARIAN
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or
anything.
The Disciple Prospect emerges from the club with the HEAD
DISCIPLE, a gentle giant of a man with a long, flowing wispy
beard and an old man's paunch.
They're muttering about
something.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
Her daughter lives across the street and
she was wondering ...
HEAD DISCIPLE
What?
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
She's curious ...
The Head Disciple glances over at Marian standing curbside,
expectantly awaiting approval.
He sees that she's ingenuous.
HEAD DISCIPLE
What the hell ...
(calling out to Marian)
Come on in.
Marian, smiling, comes forward.
HEAD DISCIPLE
(pointing to the steps leading
up to the door)
You watch your step here.
And the three disappear inside.
A narrow, stand-alone ten-story isosceles-shaped office
building, on an island of land in downtown Manhattan.
ESTABLISHING SHOT.
On the sidewalk, the Disciple Prospect sits next to the fire
breathing oil drum, standing sentry over the Harleys.
One of the Disciples comes out of the clubhouse and they high
five.
The Disciple mounts his Harley and is about to kick
start it to life, when the Disciple Prospect rises from his
stool.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
Yo, man!
The Disciple about to start his bike, turns.
The Disciple Prospect raises two fingers to his lips in a
kind of warning, then gestures up to Paula's co-op where
Marian is sleeping.
The Disciple, remembering the new rule, nods assent with a
slightly annoyed expression.
Then, he puts his Harley into neutral, dismounts, and starts
slowly walking it down the quiet, ill-lit street.
A lovely, sun-drenched day.
Shadows dapple a promenade along
one of the park's many ponds.
Paula and Marian walk arm-in
arm.
PAULA
I think you should consider coming out
and staying with me longer.
MARIAN
Oh, I don't want to be in the way.
You've got your career and everything.
PAULA
You wouldn't be in the way.
I like
having you around.
MARIAN
Dear, I was thinking.
Why don't we go to
Paris next year?
I've never been.
Your
father, God bless him, wasn't much for
traveling.
PAULA
I'd love to.
They walk off into the golden light.
CUT TO:
Marian steps down the stairs of her daughter's building.
A
smile breaks out on her face when she SEES:
A MOTORCADE -
of idling Harleys in the middle of the street, waiting for
her.
MARIAN -
turns to the Head Disciple, materializing behind her,
carrying her luggage.
He gestures with his head toward the
motorcycles.
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET -
The Disciple Prospect takes Marian's luggage from the Head
Disciple and hauls it over to one of the waiting Harleys and
straps it on to the carrying rack.
Then, he helps Marian onto the back of the Harley she's going
to be riding to the airport.
Gently, he places a helmet -
festooned with decals of fire-breathing reptiles - over her
head and affixes the chin-strap.
DISCIPLE PROSPECT
All right?
Marian nods and beams at the same time.
The other Harleys form a circle around Marian's motorcycle.
The Disciple Prospect gives them a signal and they start off,
one by one, forming a V-shaped procession.
Marian, completely comfortable on her motorcycle, her arms
around her Disciple escort, her fever dream now manifest.
CRANE UP as the procession heads down East 5TH.
WHITE OUT -
