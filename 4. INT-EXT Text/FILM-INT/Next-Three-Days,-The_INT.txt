No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:
THE LAST THREE YEARS

Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN
is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,
if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.
Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.
LARA
You know what? If you were smart
you would stop talking right now.
ERIT
Sue me. I just know that women should
never work for women.
John laughs and applauds.
Mick buries his head.
LARA
How can you say that??
ERIT
They're always threatened. Especially
if you're beautiful and they're not.
LARA
Erit, you are so full of shit.
ERIT
So, your boss isn't threatened by
you?

LARA
Because she's a bitch! --
(as John and Mick laugh)
--Not because she's a woman.
ERIT
And you would describe her as
"attractive"?
LARA
That has nothing to do with it!
ERIT
And there is my answer.
JOHN
Either of you like another drink?
Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.
ERIT
Women should work under men, men
under women. That's it.
JOHN
(egging her on)
But men under men?
ERIT
That's fine, too.
(the men burst into laughter)
They're used to it! Why are you
laughing?
MICK
(re: Erit)
I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
rather work under you than her.
ERIT
(insulted, shoots back)
Oh please, I'd rather work under
him, too.
That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.
LARA
You'd rather "work under" John?
ERIT
You have a problem with that, too?

LARA
No, why would I have a problem with
your little sexual innuendo?
ERIT
What is up your ass tonight??
Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is
going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.
LARA
So, I shouldn't take offense that
you're coming on to my husband right
in front of me.
ERIT
(claws out now)
Lara, if I wanted your husband I
would have him.
LARA
How? You couldn't possibly show him
more of your tits.
The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.
ERIT
-- You know what your problem is?!
JOHN
MICK
That was a great meal!
Okay--okay!

LARA
Hello!
JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.
LARA (CONT'D)
Did he cry?
JENNA
Only when I dropped him down the
stairs.
Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.

She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.

Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for
her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.
JOHN
Thanks.
See you next weekend.
Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.
John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses
him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.
He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.

Lara wakes, troubled.
It's the middle of the night.

Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it

KITCHEN -- MORNING

Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the
table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.
JOHN
Okay, your turn.
Luke skewers a piece with his fork.
Lara passes, hustling
to get to work.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Very good, very good...

Luke puts it in his mouth.
JOHN (CONT'D)
No, no, no; you feed me.

Your son is hopeless.
Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.
LARA
Squeeze in tight.
JOHN
You can't do this every morning.
It
is way too corny.
LARA
Smile.
It's just until he's eighteen.
It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.
LARA (CONT'D)
Present.
JOHN
(examining it)
Sweetie, you have to stop believing
everything you read in a catalogue.
LARA
You hate brushing your teeth; this
one brushes them in thirty seconds.
JOHN
(as if stung)
I love brushing my teeth.
(to Luke)
The lies your mother tells.
LARA
(ignoring him)
When's your last class?
JOHN
Three, and I have papers to grade.
Can you pick up Luke?
LARA
After yesterday I probably don't
have a job anyway. Do you think it
was wrong to call her a useless cow?

LARA

"When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!

Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin.
JOHN (O.S.)
I sent him flowers and a handmade
card.
LARA
You're completely impossible.
JOHN (O.S.)
Did you notice what I got for my
birthday this year? A grunt.

JOHN
Mom said Happy Birthday and my father
went . Made me tear up.
Lara returns, trying hard not to smile.
LARA
Ever think that someone has to be
the bigger person here?
JOHN
(to Luke)
Remember this for the custody hearing:
how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
LARA
How are you going to feel if Luke
grows up and doesn't call you?
Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.

JOHN
Now she's driving a wedge between us.
LARA

JOHN
And now she is abandoning you.
Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back
shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.

Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it
run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings.

John rises to answer the door.

Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood
on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it.

As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge.
DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John
has no time to react.
DETECTIVE QUINN
Police.
Mr. Brennan?
LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.
DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)
My name is Detective Quinn. This is
a search warrant for these premises.
John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside.
DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)

Stay where you are.
JOHN

DETECTIVE QUINN
Touch me again and you'll be arrested.

Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero.
She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member,
who takes it and bags it under:
DETECTIVE COLLERO
Lara Brennan?
LARA
WHAT?!
DETECTIVE COLLERO
Lara Brennan, you are under arrest
for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.
She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her.
LARA
She's dead??
Elizabeth is dead??

JOHN
(tries to push past)
She didn't do anything!
DETECTIVE QUINN
I will only --
JOHN
(tries again)
She didn't do anything!
DETECTIVE QUINN
Put him in cuffs.
The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his
wrists. John watches as his child cries, his wife is led
out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.

LUKE (O.S.)
Daddy!...
DADDY!!
A light comes on.
John steps out of his bedroom and enters
his son's room.
JOHN (O.S.)
It's okay.
Just a bad dream.
He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.

John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.
JOHN
You okay?
Luke nods.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Okay, you can sleep here as long as
you stay on this side of the bed.
Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You're such a snake, I don't know why
I keep falling for the same trick.
John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow.
John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo
that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning.
He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.

- John waits in a long line, mostly women. He glances over
at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and
sees children playing. Luke plays by himself.
- John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard
takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
through and the buzzer goes off.
John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
from his pocket, looks at it curiously.
JOHN
It's a toy!
The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech.
The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and
pulls on Luke's jacket.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Don't worry.
We'll get it back.
23

They walk along the hall with all the other visitors.
12.

John stares out the window at the city beyond.
Life seems
so close.
He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.
The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.
Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
who plays with his back to her.
LARA
Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?
(no response. Tickles him)
Come on, give Mommy a kiss.
JOHN
Rat-Bag.
Give Mommy a kiss.
He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos.
LARA
Is Daddy reading you my letters?
JOHN
Every night at bedtime.
LARA
What are you building?
A fort?
Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head
and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand.
LARA (CONT'D)
Was he scared going to school?
JOHN
I walked him to class, gave him a kiss;
he didn't even look back to wave.
LARA
What did you make him for lunch?

JOHN
Turkey sandwich, just butter and
bread, no "vegetables" on it. He
swore he ate his apple.
He hands her a pack of photos.
Lara devours them.
LARA
Look at his friends.
And his desk.
This is his teacher?
JOHN
Miss Phillips.
LARA
You may have to move to another school
district.
JOHN
Already spoke to a realtor.
LARA
(still looking at photos)
How was your first day?
JOHN
Excellent. Over half my class stayed
awake. Talked to your mom.
LARA
When is she coming?
JOHN
She's having a lot of trouble with
her business.
LARA
It's only been a couple of years,
I'm sure she'll get around to it.
(beat)
Have you heard anything?
JOHN
About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just
not telling you. What did Meyer
say?

She couldn't have just disappeared.
JOHN
Meyer's looking for a new
investigator.
LARA
Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a
button pop - they must have been
blind not to find it.
JOHN
He'll go through all the evidence
again.
LARA
Great, because I haven't quite
bankrupted us yet.
JOHN
We're doing fine.
LARA
(fondly)
You just lie and lie.
(strokes his face)
But you are very handsome.
(admiring him)
Can you do me a favor?
JOHN
I don't know, I'm a little busy.
LARA
I need you to run for governor.
JOHN
-- Oh, that I can do.
LARA
You can change this rule about no
conjugal visits, because I don't
think I can last another twenty years.
She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place.
He
reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back.
LARA (CONT'D)

The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and
blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other
visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.
26

Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump-
suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for
contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls
it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.

Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke
standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a
complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the
toilet, staring at his watch.
JOHN
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Good?
Luke nods.

John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out
with a young associate. He spots John and approaches.
MEYER
John, I said my office at four

Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate.

John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the
ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at
his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.
JOHN
But what if we find the woman who
was leaving the parking lot?
MEYER
The PCRA was rejected. No new
evidence can be submitted. Not
anymore.
JOHN
It was a robbery!
Someone stole her
purse!
MEYER
And if they'd used her credit cards
we would have had something to argue.
I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.
JOHN
So, that's it. Now we just have the
Supreme Court.
MEYER
John, in the last thirty years, the
Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder
case. No decent lawyer would even
file the pleadings.
JOHN
So, I need to find an indecent one?
MEYER
No, I'm going to file it. But I
need you to do something for me.
JOHN
Anything.

MEYER
I need you to look at the evidence
and just forget Lara is your wife.
JOHN
(stopped by that)
I've seen the evidence, Meyer.
MEYER
I'm not saying judge her innocent or
guilty, I'm just saying look at it.
He co-worker sees her leaving the
scene, she has the victim's blood on
her clothes, her fingerprints on the
murder weapon--
JOHN
(is this a bad joke?)
We went out for dinner! How do you
do that after you kill somebody?
She would have to be a psychopath!
MEYER
-- And the fight in the office.
JOHN
Everyone fights with their boss!
MEYER
But this one ended up dead.
John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.
JOHN
So, you never believed she was
innocent?
MEYER
How can you say that?
JOHN
So, what are you saying, Meyer?!
MEYER
That it no longer matters what we
believe; Lara's not getting out.
And you have no idea how much I hate
saying that.
JOHN

I'll find someone to file the
pleadings.

John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The
door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles
and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face
and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.
John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up
her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his
face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.
John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears
run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her
phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder --
desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.
He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention
of the guard on his side.
Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but
she can't hear it, and neither can we.

MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from
clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything
they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door.
In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to
see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away,
uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention.

John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and

She can't have visitors.
JOHN
That's ridiculous; I have to see

DUTY NURSE
I'm sorry.
John turns away and heads down the corridor to find her
himself. The Duty Nurse sees this and takes off after him:
DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)
You can't go down there!
John shoves open a door, moves on to the next.

My wife attempted suicide.
HOSPITAL GUARD 1
DUTY NURSE

She's not allowed visitors.
JOHN

DR. BECSEY
Why isn't she in the ER?
HOSPITAL GUARD 1

Becsey is not unmoved.
He shares a look with the nurse.

DR. Becsey opens the door for John.
Note a prison guard
standing outside.
DR. BECSEY
Two minutes.
Becsey leaves. A uniformed female prison guard looks up
from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John. He looks to
his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and
weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.
Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something
terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels
beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little
finger, wraps her fingers around it.

Luke lies in the crook of his father's arm, his own arms
full of penguins, turtles, a black dog and an opossum. John
reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed.
JOHN
And give a big hug to Pengui, Little
Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley,
Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of
love, Mommy.
(beat)
You gonna give them hugs from her?

Luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend
those. They come from the cottage
where Mommy and I used to take you
when you were a baby.
LUKE
Then can I have them all?
JOHN
...Sure.
He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.
50
50
Luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand. John tucks him in
with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks
back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring
at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.
51
51
Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher.
He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He
places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer
crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages
through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
counter, feeling destroyed and needy.
And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
places it on the counter and moves away.
John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and
shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.
Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then
suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No
sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts
into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He
flings it open...
52
53
Don Quixote is written on the chalkboard.
JOHN
So, what is it about?
Julie?
JULIE
That belief in someone's virtue is
more important than virtue itself?
JOHN
No. I mean, yes, that's in there.
But what is it about?
No takers.
JOHN (CONT'D)
It is about how rational thought
destroys the soul. It is about the
triumph of irrationality, and the
power that is in it.
54
54
John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each
having something to do with prison or prison life.
He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at
a time and discards each in turn.
As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer
screen linked to the school system.
ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by
the school search engine -- many of the items have already
been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls."
He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author
is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption
reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY.
55

A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV
screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table.

It's a course that investigates what

DAMON
Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
JOHN
You escaped from jail seven times.
Damon lights a cigarette.
A TOUGH GUY nearby objects.
TOUGH GUY
No smoking!!
DAMON
Yeah, who would want to cut short
your precious life?
Damon takes a deep drag.
JOHN
Mind if I tape you?
DAMON
Go for it, it can't be used as
evidence. What do you want to know?
John sets up the small digital recorder.
JOHN
How you escaped when no one else
could.
DAMON
Balls and a little luck.
(beat)
No prison in the world is airtight.
Each one has a key. You have to
find it.
JOHN
How do you do that?
DAMON
A lot of looking. Especially at
things that break the daily routine.
Guards get comfortable doing the
same thing every day. Something
happens where they have to think,
adapt.

DAMON (CONT'D)
That's when they will make mistakes.
But when you see it you have to be
ready. You have to have the entire
plan already in place before you
even know how you are going to get
out of the jail.
Escaping is easy; the hardest part
is staying free.
57
57
The tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets
of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall.
DAMON (O.S.)
You have to know where you are going
to go and how you are going to get
there. You have to know how they
plan to catch you, where, and when.
JOHN (O.S.)
How the hell do you know that?
He starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker.
DAMON (O.S.)
You pay off someone who knows. And
a lot depends on if the prison is in
the country or the city.
58
58
JOHN
The city.
That came out too quickly. Damon now understands. John
sits, silent, knowing he blew it. Damon takes his time.
DAMON
Where are you from?
JOHN
...Pittsburgh.
DAMON
Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges
and tunnels they can block off.
59

The art paper bunches and rips under the pressure of the
marker. John tears it off the wall.

DAMON (O.S.)
From the time they make the call,
the police can have the center of
the city sealed tight in fifteen
minutes.

60
JOHN
How can they be so exact?
DAMON
After 9-11 Homeland Security made
every city have a lock-down plan --
downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes.
They can do DC in under ten.
61
61
John draws a circle on the wall and writes in it: 15 MINUTES --
DAMON (O.S.)
Within thirty-five minutes they will
have cops at every tollbooth on the
interstate --
-- Surrounds it by a larger circle: 35 MINUTES.
62
62
DAMON
And be running rolling stops on the
secondary roads. They won't have
your photograph yet, but they will
have your description.
63
63
He draws spokes out from the circles.
JOHN (O.S.)
What if you can't make it out?
64
64
JOHN
Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of
time.
DAMON
Then surrender.

DAMON (CONT'D)
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone you are with.

John writes DESCRIPTION at the end of one spoke.
DAMON (O.S.)
Stay far away from the train and bus
stations.
66
66
DAMON
Forget the local airports.
Leave
from another state.
67
67
John scribbles key words on the wall.
DISTANT AIRPORT.
68
68
DAMON
Second: identity. It's easy to find
fake papers, harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.
69
69
John writes "IDENTITIES."
DAMON (O.S.)
You'll need a passport, driver's
license and a social security number.
70
70
DAMON
If you have to rent a car, find a
place that will take a cash deposit.
They'll still run a credit check, so
use a real person's name on the ID.

Third: destination.

John writes furiously on the wall.
"DESTINATION."

DAMON (O.S.)
You want somewhere that doesn't
attract American tourists and doesn't
get American newspapers. Think Yemen
and you get the idea.
72
72
DAMON
Then money.
73
73
John's writes "MONEY."
DAMON (O.S.)
You need a truck load of it.
Everything's expensive: hotels,
travel, information.
74
74
JOHN
How much?
DAMON
Enough to last at least five-six
years. Run out of money and you run
out of friends.
75
75
John underlines "MONEY."
76
76
John is starting to understand the enormity of this
undertaking.
DAMON
But before you do anything, you have
to ask yourself if you can do it.
Can you forget about ever seeing
your parents again. Can you kill a
guard, leave your kid at a gas
station, push a nice old lady to the
ground because she is between you
and the door? Because to do this
thing, that's who you have to become.
And if you can't, don't start, because
you'll just get someone killed.

77
77
John backs away from the wall to see it covered in a spiderweb
of notes.
JOHN (O.S.)
How did you get caught?
78
78
DAMON
I gave myself up. I couldn't take
wondering when someone was going to
come through the bedroom door.
(beat)
Got what you need?
JOHN
Yeah.
DAMON
What do you have in your pocket?
John opens his billfold.
Damon takes the cash, leaves him a
twenty.

On the wall we see the massive diagram John has created.
The screen goes BLACK. Read:
THE LAST THREE MONTHS

81
John rides, looking down at the river below.
82
82
John steps through the puffer (the machine that detects drugs)
and into the secure area. He makes a mental note of
everything he sees: the number of guards, cameras, etc.
83
84
He tapes the photos to the wall.
85
85
Walking down a corridor with the other visitors, John steps
in a puddle of water. Behind him the others notice and step
around it. Moving on, they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling
a water-stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch.
86
86
John traces a route on a map with a highlighter.
87
87
The wall grows thick with photos and notes.
88
88
He reads an article on his computer -- about illegal aliens
and fake ID's.
89
89
John enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how
dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch
is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He
studies it as he bites into a sandwich.
90
90
John and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors
toward the visitation rooms.
Just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the
elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling
one of Luke's shoelaces loose.
LUKE
It was already tied.
John reties the lace as the group moves on.
He keeps one
eye on the elevator.
The door opens and the guard
steps in - and John notices two
WORKMEN in hardhats inside.
The elevator closes, the shoelace
is tied, the group has moved
on down the hall and they are
alone. John pulls the laces
and unties Luke's shoe.
LUKE (CONT'D)
You untied it again!
(CONTINUED)
33.

The guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile
and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name:
OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Mr. Brennan?
Startled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON.
DR. LIFSON
We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.
JOHN
Oh, sorry.
Hello, Doctor.
DR. LIFSON
(to approaching guard)
I'll bring them back myself.
91
91
John leaves Luke playing and steps into the office. Lifson
partially closes the door, so John can still see his son.
DR. LIFSON
We check your wife's blood regularly.
She's been refusing her insulin. I
don't want to sound dramatic, but
it's just another form of suicide.
JOHN
I'll talk to her.
DR. LIFSON
If she doesn't --
JOHN
I'll talk to her.
(steps out)
Let's go, Squirrel.
92

John and Luke wait. The prisoners enter.
Lara looks
terrible. John stands and embraces her.
JOHN
Hey. Are you alright?
LARA
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

Lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son, who
is engrossed in his toys as usual.
LARA (CONT'D)
Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?
He doesn't respond. She kisses him on the head then takes a
seat. John sits beside her. They speak in whispers.
JOHN
The doctor told me about the insulin.
LARA
(watching Luke)
Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.
JOHN
You forgot?
For how many days?
LARA
I forgot, okay? I have things on my
mind.
JOHN
--And so much to do.
LARA
Oh, that's nice.
JOHN
Why are you doing this?
LARA
Can I please just watch him play?
Tell me about kindergarten.
JOHN
No.
I need you to --
LARA
Fine, I won't forget again, okay?
(trying to fight away these
thoughts:)
I am just never going to walk him to
school or wash his clothes or make
him dinner...and I don't know how I
can live knowing that. Okay?
JOHN
Lara. Look at me. Something will
happen. I promise.

LARA
(cruelly - but hushed)
What? What is going to happen?
There are no more appeals, there are
no more anything. Exactly what
miracle are we hoping for, John?
He looks down, beaten.
She lets go of her anger.
LARA (CONT'D)
I need you to do something for me.
JOHN
Sure.
LARA
Stop bringing him.
JOHN
Come on...
LARA
He hates coming here.
Look at him.
JOHN
Lara....
LARA
Please. It's not his fault. It's
too hard to watch him forget me.
John looks at his son, playing at a distance, his back to
them. It's hard to argue with her, she's right.
LARA (CONT'D)
You want to hear something funny?
JOHN
Yes.
Anything.
LARA
My mother tried to send me anti-aging
cream.
John smiles, but like hers it may be the saddest smile in
the world. They sit and watch Luke play.
93
93
John checks his bank statements and adds them up on the wall
under MONEY. The total is $8,840.00.
He stares at that figure for a moment.

EUGENIE, the REAL ESTATE AGENT, walks John to the door.
EUGENIE
You're sure that you don't want a
lawn sign?
JOHN
I'm very sure. Thanks.
95
95
A STUDENT shows John how to use Photoshop to enlarge and
crop a photo.
96
96
John uses Photoshop, looking through family pictures for an
appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of
the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and
starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo.
Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring
at the screen.
97
98
John sits among six other passengers.
COPTER PILOT
On the left, Allegheny County Jail.
Built in 1995, it is now the largest
jail in the world. There have been
three escape attempts. No one's
made it out alive. On your right...
Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues.
John stays fixed on the left window.
HIS POINT OF VIEW:
The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly
what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread
hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a
bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.
37.
99
99
LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his
desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google
Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle.
John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed
color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the
outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR.
LYLA
On the first landing, which was as
small as the necessary turn of the
stairs allowed, there was a niche in
the column, about a yard wide, and
in this niche the prince felt
convinced that a man stood concealed.
He thought he could distinguish a
figure standing there.
100

John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on
one that reads EXPERIENCED HELICOPTER PILOT, COMBAT VET,
WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER.
ANGLE ON JOHN'S WALL
Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the
heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs
of several PILOT candidates.
Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop
of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing
site indicated with an X in a circle.
Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the
adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In
block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"
101
101
Luke, John and George stand in the foyer, Luke with his child-
sized, brightly-colored overnight bag. John pulls off Luke's
coat, kisses him on the head and looks up at George.
JOHN
Thanks.
George nods, takes Luke's hand and walks to the kitchen.
38.
102
104
John climbs into his car and tosses the pills onto the
passenger seat, among a half dozen others. There is a sharp
RAP on his window; Mouss. John rolls down the window.
MOUSS
You have to pay up front.
JOHN
I can do that.
MOUSS
You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?
JOHN
No.
MOUSS
Ask for Harv.
JOHN
What's your name?
MOUSS
Just say Mouss.
39.
105
106
Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't
exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned
out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for
"Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is
playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED
GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV.
JOHN
Mouss said to come see you.
HARV
He did, did he? What do you want?
JOHN
Three passports, a driver's license,
and real social security number.
HARV
How do you know Mouss?
JOHN
He babysits my kid.
HARV
(sizes him up, then:)
Okay.
Harv gives him a look; nods for him to follow.

John cleans the cuts on his face with peroxide, adds a Band-
Aid. He stares at his face, letting defeat wash over him.

John deducts $2,000 from the MONEY column.

His face purple with bruises, John pulls himself out of bed
in response to the RINGING DOORBELL.
111
111
John limps to the front door and opens it to see Eugenie,
his realtor, standing with a nice couple. They see his face,
try and hide their reactions.
EUGENIE
You did remember I was showing the
house?
JOHN
Give me two minutes.

John tacks two large dark blue sheets up over the wall,
covering his plan.

GRACE
Oh, my lord!
What happened?

John sits as Grace approaches with iodine and cotton balls.
Through the window he sees Luke playing with the dog.
JOHN
It was stupid, I fell off the bike.
GRACE
The bike that's been in our garage
for two years? Put your head back.
JOHN
Some guy made a crack about Lara.
GRACE
So, that's what you do now: punch
everyone who thinks she's guilty?
JOHN
What's that supposed to mean?
GRACE
It means it's important what YOU
believe, not --
JOHN
Really?
So, what do you believe,
Mom?
John stands and opens the back door.
GRACE
Why are you trying to start a fight?
JOHN
(calling out back door)
Come on, buddy!
(to his mother)
Where is his bag?
GRACE
Why are you doing this?!
Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears.
JOHN
No reason. I just stupidly thought
people who loved her would actually
believe she's innocent. My mistake.
(CONTINUED)
42.
115
CONTINUED:
115
GRACE
Stop this!
John turns and sees GEORGE standing in the open doorway. He
has heard everything. He gives his son a dismissive look
and walks off towards his bedroom. John feels like a heel.
JOHN
(to Luke)
Give Grandma a kiss.
Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag.
116
118
John asks a couple of guys on the corner about papers and is
turned away. As he returns to his car, he doesn't notice
MIKE, the long-haired guy from Drake's Bar, watching from
astride his motorcycle. A SECOND RIDER pulls up beside Mike.
John pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance.
119
119
John watches Jenna leave; closes the door, climbs the stairs.
43.
120
120
John sees Luke sleeping, surrounded by his animals.
The
doorbell rings.
121
121
John peers out surreptitiously, sees MIKE standing there.
He rings the bell again.
John runs and snatches a kitchen knife, returns to the door,
secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack.
JOHN
What?
Mike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice.
MIKE
I was at the bar.
I know what you
are looking for.
Caught off guard by the voice, John just stares at him.
MIKE (CONT'D)
I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips.
John stares at him, unsure what to do.
MIKE (CONT'D)
You really want to talk out here?
John puts the knife in his back pocket and steps out onto...
122
123
John pulls cash and an envelope from his jacket pocket.
124
124
Mike counts the money and shoves it in his breast pocket.
MIKE
I'll bring them Wednesday.
JOHN
Not here.
Don't come here again.
Mike stares at him.
John stares back.
MIKE
Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
Under the bridge; two o'clock. If
I'm not there on time, leave.
John closes the door behind him and watches Mike walk off
toward his motorcycle.
125
125
He drops the carving knife back in the drawer. As he looks
up, he sees THE SECOND RIDER staring in the window, his helmet
still on. John's heart almost stops. The rider DRIVES OFF.
126
127
John and Luke enter the back door. Luke automatically heads
for the living room. John calls after him:
JOHN
No video game.

LUKE (O.S.)
You'll just lose again.
EUGENIE (V.O.)
(on voicemail:)
John? It's Eugenie. You're not
going to believe it; the people I
brought over? They made an offer!
I'll bring it in the morning.
BEEP.
JOHN
(buoyed/to Luke)
Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly
destroy you.
128
128
John watches a video on YouTube: "How to unlock any door."
The person on screen demonstrates how to make a "bump key."
KID ON SCREEN
-- a bump key. First, find any key
that fits into the same make of lock.
129
129
John files down a key, held in the jaws of a vice.
130
130
John inserts the bump key into the door lock, bumps it with
the butt of a screwdriver. The key won't turn.
131
131
He files down the key some more.
132
133
John gets in, heading up to his classroom. People avoid
looking at his face. One woman can't help noticing. John
nods and smiles. He pushes the elevator button and notices
the name: OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY.
134
134
John scans the room as he waits. Two children play in the
set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner
behind glass using a phone. A moment later, a woman enters
with a large shoulder bag. She is a NOTARY.
NOTARY
Mr. Brennan?
135
135
No other visitors today.
A NOTARY sits with Lara and John.
NOTARY
And just put your thumb there.
And Lara puts her thumb print on the book.
NOTARY (CONT'D)
Thanks, that's all I need.
The notary heads for the door.
John turns to the female
guard who is waiting.
JOHN
I'll just be a moment.
He turns back to his wife.
LARA
(touching him, melting)
Your poor face. How could you do
that to yourself?
JOHN
I am useless without you.
I can't
even ride a bike.
LARA
I think it's very sexy.
JOHN
I'm sorry we had to do this.

LARA
You have nothing to apologize for.
But you should have told me before
this.
JOHN
I know.
LARA
I don't want you not telling me
things.
JOHN
From now on I will.
LARA
(beat)
I won't know where to picture you.
(off his look)
I close my eyes and I see Luke in
his bedroom, you on the sofa by the
Window. I won't know where to picture
you anymore.
136
136
John stares at his laptop as the class does a test. Knowing
he isn't paying attention, a STUDENT angles his multiple
choice test so that his friend behind can see the answers.
137
137
John waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs
the door before it closes. He slips inside and finds a rack
with keys. He takes one from the hook marked ELEVATORS.
138

John files down the elevator key as he did the house key.

John moves aside a box on the shelf and removes the handgun,
wrapped in an old chamois.
PAULA

He turns to see Paula standing in the open garage door.
JOHN
Hi.

John tries to look casual as he stands with the thinly
disguised gun in his hand.
PAULA
I was wondering if I could ask you
to water my plants next week; I'm
going in for an operation.
JOHN
I hope it's nothing serious.
PAULA
My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me.
He's blaming the lab; the lab's
blaming him. But I'll be fine.
Thanks.
And she walks off.
John gets in the car and slips the gun
between the seats.
140
140
John pulls into the empty parking lot beside Don's and waits.
Checks his watch: 1:49 PM. A car pulls in. The guy sits
there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant.
141
141
John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he
is supposed to leave. He makes a call.
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
English Department, this is Catherine.
JOHN
Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling
well, I'm going to take him home. I
need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
I will let him know.
142
142
John checks his watch: 2:27. His cell phone rings, displays
the name MICK; John presses IGNORE. He feels for the gun
between the seats.
143
144
Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging
his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside
his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides
it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing.
145
145
John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He
takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the
separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and

places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal
detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can
get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.
JOHN
How are you doing today?
GUARD
Don't touch that.
JOHN
Sorry.
John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone --
John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the
counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors.
JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.
146
146
John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors.
He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard
ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to
open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.
He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing
and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump
key. It fits.
The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting
room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps
the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again.
Visitors keep moving past him.
He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is
preoccupied at the door.
He turns it harder. Nothing.
He tries to pull it out.
It's stuck. John panics.
The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.
John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.
John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
the crowd and moves on.
Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
the visiting room.

He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to
insert his key in the elevator.
John rounds the corner into the visiting room. The camera
stays on his face until we finally hear A DEAFENING ALARM.
147
147
John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a
small office. Through the glass he watches the MAJOR
interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing.
She nods and leaves, passing him with a look. The Major
holds the door open for him.
148
MAJOR'S OFFICE -- A SHORT TIME LATER
148
The MAJOR plays John the CCTV video from the corridor. He
flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall.
The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms
obscures the view of the elevator.
MAJOR
So, you are where in here?
JOHN
...In the middle there.
MAJOR
In the middle. Can you point to
yourself?
JOHN
(looks)
It's hard to tell.
I think that's
me there. Why?
He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the
background.
MAJOR
So that's not you there.
By the
elevator?
JOHN
(looks)
....No.
(points to another person)
I was over here. You want to tell
me what's going on?
MAJOR
You want me to tell you?

148
JOHN
Yes.
The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.
MAJOR
You know what a bump key is?
JOHN
Sorry.
Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John.
Finally:
MAJOR
If this was you, you might want to
think about what's going to happen
to your kids if both of their parents
are in prison.
The major stares right through him.
149
149
John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard. As he
nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step
ladder, holding a new CCTV camera.
150
150
Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge
to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero
steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
and vomits.
DETECTIVE COLLERO
-- The worst date you've ever been
on? This was worse. And this guy?
He really thinks he is doing great.
Then he's driving me home and I know
he's going to try and kiss me, so I
pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm
actually snoring, right in his car.
Does that stop him?
John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him.
They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying
attention and wonders what he's looking at.
DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)

John turns and walks away.
Quinn keeps watching.
DETECTIVE QUINN
Did I tell you not to date cops?
Collero's eyes find John as well.
He disappears around the
corner.
151
151
John rides home, devastated that his plan has failed, and
wondering what he will do. He checks over his shoulder to
make sure he isn't being followed.
152
152
John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His
head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door.
He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun;
dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.
MICK (O.S.)
Let me in, asshole!!
153
154
John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living
room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
he can't let his brother see this.
The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door
and looks out and scowls.
MALE NEIGHBOR
What's your problem? He's not home!
MICK
Not home?
So you're saying I'm blind?
MALE NEIGHBOR
No, I'm saying you're an idiot.

Mick pounds on the door aggressively.
Then just gives up.
MICK
You know what? You're right.
I am
an idiot.
And he walks off to his car.
155
158
John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer
upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers.
LUKE (O.S.)
...Dad?
159
160
John and Luke enter, John sorting through the mail.
Nothing
from Lara.
161
161
John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his
drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls
one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new
letter in the old yellow envelope.
162
162
This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes
his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself.
JOHN
You want to read a letter from Mom?
Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in
his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He
pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As
Much As Chocolate...
LUKE
She didn't write that.
JOHN
My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I
love so, so much. I wish I could
have walked you home today, it was
so beautiful out.
58.
163
163A
John flings open the medicine cabinet, finds an old bottle
of Lara's insulin. He checks the label.
163B
163B
John hits a key and a medical article appears: LIFE
THREATENING COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES.
...Severe Hyperkalemia...extremely high levels of potassium
...cardiac arrest...particularly dangerous as there are no
outward symptoms...
164
164
The camera swirls as John searches the wall and photos of
delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants,
he charges the desk & rifles through more photos.

He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it
over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over
the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van
from a medical laboratory.
165
168
John Googles: "How to break into a car."
169
169
John heats a screwdriver on the open flame of the gas fire,
then places the red hot tip of it on an old tennis ball.
170
173
Shelves line the walls; on them sit plastic trays of envelopes.
John climbs in and finds the tray from ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL.
174
175
John finds the envelope marked "Lara Brennan." He checks
his watch, only 44 seconds have lapsed. He slips the card
out, photographs it with his cell phone and puts it back.
176
177
John checks his son, who sits on the bare living room floor
playing a video game on the TV, the remaining item.
JOHN
You okay?
Luke nods and shoots somebody.
178
178
John brings up Lara's form in Photoshop on his laptop and
erases the hand-written numbers in the test results boxes.
179
179
John writes numbers in the blank boxes of the medical form.
Then he sits back and worries that he's got it right. Calls:
JOHN
Luke!
Time for bed.
180

John enters the child's bedroom and stops dead.
The wall over Luke's bed is covered with crayon scribbles,
imitating the chart on his father's bedroom walls.

Luke walks into the room, and steps up beside his father,
staring at the wall. He takes his father's hand, and the
two just stand there in silence.
181
181
John waits as the other prisoners enter. Lara kisses him;
looks in his eyes. He sees the despair behind the smile.
JOHN
...What's wrong?
She takes a letter from her pocket.
JOHN (CONT'D)
What is it?
She hands it to him.
John reads.
His face changes.
JOHN (CONT'D)
No....NO! They can't move you. Not
without notice! Monday isn't notice!
LARA
I was only here through the appeal.
We knew I'd be moved to a prison.
JOHN
Muncy is the other side of the state.
Lara nods. Off John's face, the screen goes BLACK.

THE LAST THREE DAYS

John stands with Eugenie, the frightened realtor.
JOHN
I don't have two weeks!
I need it
tomorrow!
EUGENIE
The title hasn't been cleared --
there is no way that --
JOHN
How much can they give me?!
EUGENIE
Nothing!
John turns on his heel and slams out through the door.
62.
183
183
John stares at the wall -- MONEY is down to $1,497.
He rifles through a drawer, finds a pair of sunglasses.
He snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf.
He tosses a bag on the bed, unzips it and pulls out the gun.
184
185
A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor
mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the
stolen license plate.
Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat
and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he
looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens
the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads
back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to
work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do
this.
Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs
up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.
A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out
of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and
scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.
ELAINE
What are you doing?!
You almost
killed us!
JOHN
Are you --?
ELAINE
Are you out of your mind?!
You don't
look?!
She stoops to grab the few items that fell.
He tries to
help.
JOHN
I am so sorry --

185
CONTINUED:
185
ELAINE
Get away!
Get away from us!
She stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car
and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming.
He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his
weakness wash over him.
186
186
John sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of
visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can
see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear:
MEYER (O.S.)
I'm sorry.
JOHN
No, it was a long shot.
Thanks.
187
187
MEYER
(into phone)
How's Lara?
188
188
JOHN
She's okay.
Thanks, Meyer.
John hangs up and stands.
189
189
John stands in the corner, staring out through the high,
thick windows. He turns as he hears Lara and other prisoners
coming. He tries to smile, but she knows something is wrong.
LARA
What's wrong?
JOHN
Nothing.
LARA
Is it Luke?
JOHN
No. He's fine. I had Meyer see
what he could do about not getting
you moved.

JOHN (CONT'D)
I told him traveling that distance
would be a hardship on us, that Luke
was already having trouble at school.
Which is true. I haven't been
spending enough time with him.
LARA
You haven't? YOU haven't? God,
John, you are too much. Luke is
having a 'hard time' because mommy
is in jail for murder, not because
daddy doesn't spend enough time with
him! Your father was right, you
don't live in the same world we do.
JOHN
(stung)
That's nice, that the two of you
talk. What world do I live in, Lara?
LARA
I don't know, but it's not the real
one. I am in here for the rest of
my life! And you want me to believe
in some fantasy that -- !
A guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get
their attention. Only John looks up.
FEMALE GUARD
We good here?
JOHN
Yes.
Sorry.
Lara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity.
The
guard walks away under:
LARA
Now you come here all long-faced,
like you've let me down. What do
you want me to do, make you feel
better?
JOHN
Got it.
I'm sorry.
LARA
And now you're apologizing.
You
really are a gem.

JOHN
What do you want from me?
LARA
Nothing. You're too perfect already.
You know you never even asked me if
I did it. If I killed her.
JOHN
(stopped dead)
Because I knew you didn't.
LARA
Then you'd be wrong.
She leans forward and whispers in his ear.
LARA (CONT'D)
I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I
hit her in the face. I heard her
neck snap. You know why I did it?
Because she pissed me off. I threw
her purse in the river. We paid for
dinner with the cash from her wallet.
She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking
in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.
LARA (CONT'D)
I'm sorry.
I'm actually very sorry.
She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the
changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.
190
190
Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then
disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench,
leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards.
191
191
John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by
what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head.
Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving
him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing
there. Commands him:
GUARD #2
Sir, you cannot stand there.
(beat)
SIR, you need to exit the building
NOW.
66.
192
192
Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition.
She
picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak.
JOHN
Shut up. I don't care what you say
or how you say it. I don't believe
you did it and I never will. I know
who you are.
She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into
the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at
her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.
193

John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys.
They exchange a look.
JOHN
Thank you.
The Major nods and locks the door.
John heads out.

Luke in his arms, John takes a My Little Pony off the shelf.
JOHN
You think?
LUKE

Girls love them.

Grace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her,
quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned.
JOHN
Hi Mom.

ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
202
Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately
attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.
JOHN
(to Alex)
Back up! Get back!
Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.
ALEX
-- Shoot them both!
JOHN
-- I'll shoot the dog!

202
ALEX
-- Shoot the dog!
THUG
-- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!
John fires into the floor beside the dog.
ALEX
-- You want the police here, asshole?!
JOHN
-- Good idea!
John fires two more shots into the floor.
ALEX
(to thug)
-- Put the gun down!
The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.
JOHN
-- Call the dog off!!
Put it away!
ALEX
-- Release!
The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.
JOHN
-- Put it away!!
(aims gun at it)
PUT IT AWAY!!
Alex reluctantly opens a closet door.
ALEX
In!
Get in!
He has to shove the barking dog into the closet.
JOHN
(to thug)
You, too!
THUG
I'm not getting in there!
John fires into the wall!
ALEX
Get in!

And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog.
John
sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.
JOHN
-- Give me that chair!
Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him.
John props it under the handle of the closet door.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Move!
He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.
ALEX
You're dead.
DAVID
I didn't do anything!!
ALEX
You brought him!
DAVID
I didn't bring him!
JOHN
Shut up!
He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the
closet never stops barking.
203
203
John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between
them.
JOHN
On your knees! Hands behind your
head!
John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following
his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs
it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.
DAVID
I can't kneel!
JOHN
On the floor!
David kneels with great difficulty.
Alex calmly does as
he's told, his eyes on John.

203
John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it,
finds a couple thousand in cash.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Where's the rest?
DAVID
That's twelve hundred dollars!
(emptying his pockets)
Here, take it.
A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor.
JOHN
(gun on Alex)
Where do you keep your money?!
Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John.
ALEX
Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.
JOHN
I'll shoot you!
ALEX
You won't even shoot a dog.
JOHN
Tell me!
ALEX
Shoot the floor again, impress me.
John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his
gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding.
JOHN
I'm going to kill you both.
ALEX
No, I'm going to kill you both.
DAVID
Give him your money!
ALEX
(to David)
Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.
Enraged, John fires a round into Alex's leg.
Alex screams.

DAVID
Stop it!!
ALEX
(smiles thru pain)
See? You aren't going to kill me.
That was the worst you can do. So,
now you've done it. Go home. I'll
come find you and kill you.
John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of
tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours
it on the floor.
ALEX (CONT'D)
You're wasting some good shit.
Now he pours it on Alex.
JOHN
Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.
John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere.
THUG (O.S.)
What's going on?! Let me out!
ALEX
You going to burn me out?
John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to
yell and pound. Now calmly:
JOHN
Yeah.
That's what I'm going to do.
DAVID
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.
JOHN
Your money.
ALEX
(no longer smiling)
This is a meth lab, you idiot!
JOHN
No.
It was.
And he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle.
David
screams as the room explodes in flames.

ALEX
(suddenly desperate)
My kid is upstairs!!
JOHN
-- What??
ALEX
MY KID!!
Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned,
John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the
gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.
DAVID
Let me go!!
JOHN
Get up there!!
John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the
trail of blood.
DAVID
The house is going to explode!
ANGLE ON BACK DOOR
Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun
leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet
door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.
204
204
John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.
Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
the small bed, his back to us.
Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.
A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...
Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....
John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.
(CONTINUED)
74.
204
CONTINUED:
204
John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David.
David
looks around through the roiling smoke:
JOHN
Is anyone up here?!
He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet --
empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
on the floor half-filled with cash.
John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into
the trash bag.
205
205
The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.
206
206
John steps over the bodies; sees David looking up at him.
DAVID
Don't leave me. I don't want to
burn. Don't let me burn.
The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at
the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he
knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.
207
207
John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot
kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.
208
210
John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down
the street.
The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds
of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his
shoulder.
DAVID
I don't want to die.
I don't want
to die.
Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.
John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.
211
212
Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the
wound in his side.
He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies
a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and
jacket from a Target bag.
A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full
of cash into his backpack.
213
213
John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He
barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out
of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.

Nabulsi climbs the stairs to find SGT. HARRIS watching the
CSI team work. Nabulsi steps up behind the CSI worker.
LT. NABULSI
(almost a whisper)
Get out of my way.
The man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness.
Nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man.
LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)
What do we have?
SGT. HARRIS
A miracle. Meth lab in the basement,
the house still standing. Should be
just a crater.
LT. NABULSI
(straddles Alex)
Do we know him?
SGT. HARRIS
Alex Gaidar, history of violence and
drug trafficking.
Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room.
LT. NABULSI
He have a kid?
SGT. HARRIS
Neighbor said wife left with him
last year. Big surprise there.
LT. NABULSI
They type all this blood yet?
SGT. HARRIS
No, but someone left through the back
door bleeding. Zone Three found a
gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.
Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs.
77.

217
John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key
from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is
surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters,
carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair.
When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas,
reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.
JOHN
Hi.
What are you doing up?
George shrugs.
An uncomfortable silence.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I've come to get Luke.
George nods. After another silence, John starts down the
hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.
GEORGE
John?
Are you alright?
John turns around, surprised.
JOHN
I'm fine.
The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the
room.
His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket
falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and
sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane
tickets and passports.
218
218
John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke
sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his
face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here,
and is overwhelmed.
219
219
George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket.
We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the
passport and reads each of the false names.
78.
220
220
John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like
this. He tries to wake Luke.
JOHN
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just
after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.
221
221
John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock.
It's almost five. How could that have happened?
222
222
John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in
his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food.
JOHN
What do you say?
LUKE
Thank you.
JOHN
Give Grandma a big kiss.
LUKE
I'm too tired to kiss.
JOHN
Luke...
GRACE
I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.
(to John)
We want to take him to the Harvest
Festival in Kutztown, where they
have the Clydesdales.
John thinks about saying something, can't.
He watches Luke
give Grace a kiss.
LUKE
Thank you, Grandma.
John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway.
His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it.
The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket.
(CONTINUED)
79.
222

222
John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He
looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John
can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.
JOHN
Bye Mom.
They kiss.
John's father stands behind him.
GEORGE
Goodbye.
George grabs his son in an awkward hug.
John is shocked.
He pats his father's back. They break.
JOHN
(to Luke)
Let's go.
John leaves.
The front door closes.
Grace walks away.
223
225
John packs a backpack -- two white lab coats, wire cutters,
a large screwdriver, two rolls of duct tape, the handgun,
insulin vials, etc.
80.
226
226
Luke sits on his bedroom floor, trying to cram a firetruck
into his already full rollerboard.
LUKE
(calls)
Can I carry it?
John appears with a box of trash bags.
JOHN
No.
Just what fits in your bag.
John hurries off.
LUKE
....What about my pockets?
JOHN (O.S.)
Or your pockets.
Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table.
He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave
him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket.
A quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor.
227
227
John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his
wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35.
He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos,
sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. He
decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of
wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.
228
230
He checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster, taking
a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there.
231
232
A clerk on the phone is cut off. She jabs the connection
key, does not get a dial tone -- looks to the lights on the
other phone lines and sees them go out as...

John holds his lab results between his teeth as he flips
through the envelopes. He finally finds Lara's envelope,
removes her report and replaces it with this one.

What kind of a criminal drives a

SGT. HARRIS
A socially responsible one?
(avoids Nabulsi's searing
look by reading the report)
Over a thousand of them registered
in the city, seven thousand in the
state.
LT. NABULSI
How many registered to felons?
SGT. HARRIS
Six in the state. Four of them to
embezzlers or white collar criminals,

LT. NABULSI
Guess we start with the murderer.
SGT. HARRIS
She's in prison for life.
The rapist
is out.
LT. NABULSI
Find him.
238
240
SGT. HARRIS
(enters with reports)
Rapist is in a wheelchair.
Not sure
if that was karma or --
LT. NABULSI
The murderer. Where is she
incarcerated?
SGT. HARRIS
(checks papers in his hand)
County; right here in town.
LT. NABULSI
(after mulling this over)
She have a husband or kid old enough
to drive?
Harris exits, knowing he should have checked.
241
241
THE MALE NURSE re-reads the test results.
Dr. Lifson
approaches, having been summoned.
DR. LIFSON
What?
MALE NURSE
(handing it to her)
Lara Brennan's bloodwork.
DR. LIFSON
(scans, now concerned)
Get the lab.
He dials.
242
243
The MALE NURSE hangs up.
MALE NURSE
Still busy.
I'll try again.
DR. LIFSON
(studying bloodwork)
No. Get an ambulance, take her to
University. I'll meet them there.
244
COUNTY JAIL - LARA'S CELL -- MORNING
244
Lara looks up as her door opens, and is surprised to see two
FEMALE JAIL GUARDS with a wheelchair.
245
246
SGT. HARRIS
(enters with paper)
Husband. School teacher.
LT. NABULSI
(rising)
You got a home address?
247
248
Handcuffed and shackled, Lara stares lifelessly at her GUARD
as the EMT connects the leads of a heart monitor.
249
251
The front door pops open and Nabulsi and Harris step in.
They quickly see that all the furniture is gone.
252
252
Nabulsi joins Harris, who is staring at the wall where the
wallpaper has been removed.
LT. NABULSI
Get the warrant.
253
254
Nabulsi inspects Luke's room, still fully furnished, the
curious faded crayon drawing on the wall. He spots a couple
of coins on the floor. He picks up a quarter, and flips it.
Harris steps into the room.
SGT. HARRIS
She's being transferred to University
Hospital.
LT. NABULSI
Right now?
SGT. HARRIS
Right now.
(CONTINUED)

254
CONTINUED:
254
LT. NABULSI
...Have them call the escort vehicle.
Tell them we'll meet them at the
hospital in less than ten.
And he pockets the quarter and steps out of the room.
255
255
The EMT and two JAIL GUARDS wheel Lara up to the desk and
hand over her chart.
JAIL GUARD #1
We have Lara Brennan.
The duty nurse checks her chart and nods to a NURSE.
DUTY NURSE
Put her in 7725 and start an IV.
The EMT passes her over to the nurse and leaves. The DUTY
NURSE picks up the phone as they move off down the hall.
DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Can you please page Dr. Becsey?
256
256
The nurse wheels her in and GUARD #2 uncuffs her from the
gurney, as GUARD #1 gets a call on his cell phone.
JAIL GUARD #1
Yeah?... We're here: prisoner's
secure, no problems.... Will do.
He hangs up and turns to see John enter, carrying Luke's
backpack, wearing a white doctor's smock. He raises a gun.
JOHN
Put the phone down.
Guard #1 obeys.
NURSE
Oh please, no.
LARA
John??
JOHN
Remove your holsters, put them on
the floor and get on your knees.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
256
LARA
(can't make sense of this)
What are you doing here?
JOHN
DO IT!!
Guard #2 reaches for his weapon; John pistol whips him to
the floor. The nurse cups a hand over her mouth to stifle a
scream.
JOHN (CONT'D)
DO IT NOW!!
257
258
A second handgun and holster
slides across the floor to meet
the one that already lies by
John's feet. The two guards
kneel, facing the far wall.
John pulls a roll of duct tape
from the backpack and tosses
it to the terrified nurse.
JOHN
Tape their hands and feet.
(when he hesitates)
Do it!!
The nurse tapes the guards' wrists behind their backs.
LARA
You have to stop this.
JAIL GUARD #1
You walk out that door with him and
you will both be killed.
(CONTINUED)
89.
258

JOHN
Tape their mouths!
John picks up the key and undoes Lara's cuffs.
LARA
No.
Stop.
John yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and
tosses them to her.
JOHN
Put it on.
LARA
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!
JOHN
Because we have no other choice!!
Put it on!
(to nurse)
Turn around.
He does, John starts taping his wrists.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Lara, put the clothes on!
LARA
No.
JOHN
NOW!!
LARA
No!
They stare at each other.
John offers her his cell phone.
JOHN
Okay. Tell your son you aren't
coming.
LARA
...Where is he?
JOHN
Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't
coming.
LARA
How can you do this to me?
(CONTINUED)

JOHN
Push send. Tell him I'm not coming
back either.
LARA
John --
JOHN
Does it look like I'm going home?!
Tell him he is alone now and his
mother and father aren't coming back!
Lara stares at him with hatred, mutters:
LARA
You son of a bitch.
Lara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked
except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn
away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him.
John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER
starts running.
259
260
Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to
the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice
DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The
Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to
understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall
and stares after them.
DR. LIFSON
What are you doing?
John yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator,
pulling his gun from his pocket.
The Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the
hall, throwing open the door to room 7725.

The elevator doors are closing as John arrives and jams his

HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- DAY

LARA
Where's Luke?! Is he safe?
Where
is he?!
JOHN
He's safe!
262
263
Lara and John barely breath.
264
265
Nabulsi jabs the elevator button. He reacts as a HOSPITAL
SECURITY GUARD comes running toward him.
LT. NABULSI
What's wrong?
Before he can answer, the elevator doors open and they come
face to face with John and Lara. John sees their police IDs
and levels his weapon.
Around them, patients and employees scream and run away.
JOHN
Back away!
LT. NABULSI
Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.
JOHN
Get back!

Lara stands frozen.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Hit it!
She presses a button.
The doors start to close.
LT. NABULSI
Don't do this.
Doors closed.
Nabulsi runs and screams:
LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)
Where are the stairs?!
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 leads the way. Nabulsi and Harris
pass him at the door as he yells into his walkie.
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2
Male and female; white lab coats!
Parking levels!
266
266
LARA
(freaking out)
Oh please oh please oh please...
JOHN
It'll be okay.
(she keeps panicking)
Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be
okay; I promise.
She stares at him, having never seen him like this before.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Lara?
She nods.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Take the coat off.
93.
267
267
Nabulsi, Harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the
lower elevator lobby. Nabulsi sees the doors aren't opening
and runs back to the stairs, meeting the cop from upstairs
on his way down.
LT. NABULSI
Stay here!
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2
(into walkie)
Parking garage! Get your asses down
here!
Nabulsi and Harris leave them and thunder down the stairs.
268
ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
268
The elevator doors open and John tosses the lab coats out
toward a trash can in the direction of the garage. He pounds
the elevator button.
269
269
Nabulsi and Harris burst onto this floor -- see the elevator
doors are closed.
LT. NABULSI
Watch that door!
Harris obeys as Nabulsi flings himself down the next flight.
270
270
The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly.
He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
parked cars.
Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a
SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi
realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.
LT. NABULSI
(shouts into walkie)
Who's in the lobby?!
But he only gets static.
He charges back toward the stairs.
94.
271
271
The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his
weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors
he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.
They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.
They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
speaks.
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1
Main floor, rear corridor.
John and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE.
They enter and head for the loading bay.
272
272
Nabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers
run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene,
realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a
shout:
HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)
Back here!
They turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the
corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall,
who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara.
LT. NABULSI
(into radio, on the run)
Get units to Grant Street!
273
278
John and Lara quicken their pace.
The camera tilts up and
to the glass ceiling.
278A
279
John sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs.
Almost dragging Lara, John nudges past slower people to make
it onto the train. Then they wait. The doors don't close.
280
281
Above -- Nabulsi sees the train and shoves past commuters.
282
282
John spots him coming, slips the long screwdriver from the
small backpack he's carrying. Lara sees him tighten his
fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as:
283
283
Nabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station.
Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it.
284
286
Nabulsi runs down the tracks, the car ahead nowhere in sight.
287
287
The T-Train DRIVER gets an emergency call from the base. He
looks back into the car as IT RISES UP OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND.
Daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground.
John jams the long screwdriver into the door and PRIES IT
OPEN.
288

Harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks.
He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train.

John checks the counter, still running on his watch. 11:05.
He wets his thumb and rubs his wrist until the 15 is erased.
All that remains now is the second number: 35. They merge
into traffic heading toward the suburbs.

JOHN

He nods toward the glove box
JOHN (CONT'D)
There's a case in there. Brush,
moisturizer, makeup. Everything you
had was old. I hope I got it right.
She opens the glove box, unzips the case, and is touched by
this small gesture.
296
296
Detective Collero, who we last saw when they arrested Lara,
stops by Detective Quinn's cubicle.
DETECTIVE COLLERO
You want to take a guess who just
escaped from jail?
297
300
John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an
intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror,
the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them.
John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer
at 35, praying he's not their target.
The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the
four lane street.
John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch -
29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.
GPS VOICE
Time to destination: eleven minutes.
Lara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time.
301
302
John's eyes flick to his stopwatch: 32 minutes flicks to 33.
Signs appear quickly now.
Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next
Left.
John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to
make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.
Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can
escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to
them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his
grandparents after all.
Then there it is:
The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on
the right.

The sign to the Zoo sits behind it, pointing to the next road

John takes the freeway ramp.

The SUV climbs up the on-ramp, leaving the city behind.
304
304
LARA
You took the wrong turn!
It's back
there.
No response. Lara looks back over her shoulder, wondering
if this is some kind of shortcut.
LARA (CONT'D)
The zoo is back there. You're going
the wrong way!
(no response)
It's back there!
(no response)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!
JOHN
She'll call my parents.
LARA
What??
JOHN
They'll take care of him, I will
figure out how to get him to us.
LARA
Are you out of your mind!
JOHN
I tried!! There's no more time!!
Any second now there's going to be a
roadblock ahead! It might be there
now!! If we don't get out now we
don't get out!!
Lara sits back in her seat, stunned and horrified, as John
continues.

JOHN (CONT'D)
I promise. I promise I will find a
way to get Luke to us. I will find
some way.
Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch.
John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he
slams his foot on the brakes!
The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn.
Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision.
John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a
circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder,
miraculously facing in the right direction.
John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt.
She opens the door and steps out.
John closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back
together. He opens his door and steps out.
305
305
John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's
pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and
comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.
Behind them the cars whip by.
No one even thinks to stop to
see if they need help.
Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.
There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
how they got here.
Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.
306
306
They close the doors, and John starts the engine and they
drive forward. John takes the first exit.
307
311
John drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection. A sign
points out the interstate to the left -- and he can see the
overpass and freeway entrance; the business district to the
right. He checks his watch: 48 minutes. He resets it to
zero. Game over.
He switches on the radio and searches for NEWS.
Luke taps Lara on the shoulder.
She leans down.
LUKE
I think we're going to the cottage.
LARA
Really?
He nods knowingly.
LUKE
I have money.
Lara almost loses it; smiles.

LUKE
Okay.
John finds the news station.
NEWS RADIO

tollbooths. And downtown is worse.
Stay away from the train station if
you are trying to get anywhere. Not
sure what is happening but a KPGH
caller says trains aren't moving and
commuters are getting irate.
(etc.)
LARA
John?
(no reply)
What are we going to do?
JOHN

We're going to the train station.
John turns right, heading downtown.

Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green
trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION

Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she
enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS

SGT. HARRIS

Nabulsi is on the phone, catching hell from his Captain, who
has had an earful from his counterpart in the State Police.
LT. NABULSI
I understand....I understand. I
didn't tell them to stop EVERY
vehicle. Just the ones with a couple
and a young child.
He hangs up, takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it
on his desk.
316
316
John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes.
The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap.
ELDERLY MAN
Are you sure twenty dollars is enough?
Ticket to Buffalo costs three times
that.
And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat,
with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.

New York, New Jersey, Virginia,
Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana?
LT. NABULSI
You know what direction they are
going, smart ass?
DETECTIVE COLLERO
Captain, a lot of these places barely
have fax machines.
LT. NABULSI
Then start dialing.

Prioritize. Closest airports first.
Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will

SGT. HARRIS
You want to see it?
LT. NABULSI
Only if it will tell me where they

SGT. HARRIS
Not so lucky.
Nabulsi flattens the coin. Something makes him stare at his
fingers. He moves his hand, revealing a Canadian quarter.

Nabulsi comes out of his office, passing a waiting ERIT.
ERIT
Excuse me?
You call this coffee?
Nabulsi shakes that off and enters the SITUATION ROOM. Every
phone at the table is manned, all having the same conversation:
SGT. HARRIS
I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police
Department. We have a fugitive
warrant for Lara and John Brennan,
they are most likely traveling with
their six year-old son, and we have
reason to believe they might be flying

LT. NABULSI
So you have absolutely no idea where
they are going?
GEORGE
I told you.
We never spoke.
George stares Nabulsi down.
327

A female security agent searches Luke, digs a handful of
Canadian quarters out of his pocket. John's heart races.
328

The Brennans approach passport control. Lara glances at
John, sees he is sweating and red. She slips her hand into
his and takes the passports.
LARA
I'll do this.
She turns and smiles at the officer, putting on all her charm.
LARA (CONT'D)
Hello.
He remains stern-faced. Taking their passports, he examines
them against PHOTOGRAPHS on his computer screen. He looks
at them, looks at the passports again, then finally waves
them through.
LARA (CONT'D)
Thank you.
As they step away, the passport officer turns, sees his
replacement waiting. He stands and exits to take his break.
The SECOND PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER takes his seat and motions
for the next traveler to approach. As they do an ALERT comes
on his computer screen. He taps on it -- and up comes
photographs of LARA and JOHN.

The young AIR CANADA FLIGHT ATTENDANT kneels to help the
child with the colorful rollerboard -- we see it's a FIVE

She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past
him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara
lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face
to face with her sleeping son.
Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first
time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her
wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.
