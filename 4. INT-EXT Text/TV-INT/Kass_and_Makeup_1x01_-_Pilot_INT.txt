    A clip from an old hit show, 'The Family'. The Wire meets 
    Sopranos. VINCENZO (VINCE) CANTONE, a Mafia Don trying to deal 
    with the dual worlds of his underworld family and his rapidly 
    disintegrating family at home. 

    On screen, Vince s wife GINA can barely contain her hurt and 
    rage as she confronts Vince.

                                  GINA
                Is he dead?

    Vince remains cold and silent.

                                  GINA (CONT D)
                Did you kill him?

                                  VINCE
                Don t ask me about the family, Gina.

                                  GINA
                He is my family! He's my sister s son! 
                You re my husband   you are not my 
                blood!

                                  VINCE
                I'm not your blood?!

                                  GINA
                DID YOU KILL HIM?!

                                  VINCE
                ...No.

                                  GINA
                Swear it to me. Swear on your mother 
                and your children.

                                  VINCE
                  I swear... on my mother and our 
                children   I did not kill your 
                sister s son.

    CLOSE on Michael for his  catchphrase  from the show.

                Nothing is more important than The 
                Family. You know that.

    Gina breaks down and pulls Vince tight, hugging him.

                                  GINA
                I don t believe you.

    The SOUND of a bottle breaking O.S. takes us out of the 
    playback.


    An OLD ASIAN MAN is watching  The Family  on TV.

    He glances out his window onto the courtyard of the apartment 
    complex. A LOUD PARTY is in full swing around the pool. 

    He looks annoyed. He picks up a phone and dials.

                                  OLD ASIAN MAN
                Hello... this is the second time I m 
                  calling... you have to come over 
                here... everything too loud... 

    CAMERA MOVES outside with the old man's look.


    A large studio apartment - kitchen, dinette and large living 
    room/bedroom. A lot of life is crammed into a little space.

    There are photos and other memorabilia of a once prominent 
    actor s life -- a few Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. 

    The place is mess - dirty laundry, food containers, mail, 
    bedding and towels strewn about.

    MICHAEL KASS (46) - the actor we saw as Vince in the clip, is 
    sleeping atop the bed, still fully clothed.

    A PHONE RING startles him awake. He's hung over.

                                    MICHAEL
                Hello?

                So did you get my messages?

                                    MICHAEL
                Who is this?

                                  HOWIE
                Who is this? It s Howard Simon, your 
                agent.

                                    MICHAEL
                Jesus, Howie. What time is it?

                                  HOWIE
                It s 8:15 - 45 minutes before your 
                nine AM audition. I sent you 3 texts 
                last night. Tell me you got them. And 
                don t call me Howie.

    He has no clue... about much of anything right now.

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah. I, uh, I got em... I think... I 
                must have had a rough night. 

                                  HOWIE
                  I thought you stopped drinking.

                                    MICHAEL
                I wasn t drinking, I had a couple of 
                drinks.

                                  HOWIE
                That s drinking. Look, don t blow this 
                  audition. It s not so easy getting you 
                seen these days.

    Michael turns towards the bed.

                                    MICHAEL
                I know, I know... you re a genius.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  4.

    He now notices there s a NAKED GIRL in his bed, stomach down, 
    head turned away from him. A distinct tattoo of an angel is 
    visible on her exposed shoulder.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)

                There s a girl in my bed.

                                  HOWIE
                Another hooker?

                                    MICHAEL
                No, I think it s my neighbor.

                Good for you.

                                    MICHAEL
                No, shut up... This is weird.

                                  HOWIE
                Well, get her on the walk of shame and 
                don t be late for the audition.

                                    MICHAEL
                Okay, Howie, I got it.

                                  HOWIE
                Howard!

    Michael hangs up. Walks towards the bed tentatively.

                                    MICHAEL
                Vanessa? I think we got a little 
                wasted, kid. Look, no need to be 
                  embarrassed, I don t think anything 
                  happened. Vanessa?

    Michael gets to the other side of the bed and finally sees 
    Vanessa s face. 

    Her eyes are open and glazed over. Her skin is unnaturally 
    pale. There s no question she s DEAD.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                Oh God...

    He completely freaks out.

    He looks around the room, desperately. Goes to the front door, 
    opens it to yell for help, then changes his mind. 

    He closes the door and goes for the phone. He dials 911.

    He thinks about this for the first time. 

                                    MICHAEL
                My name? Why?... No, it s okay, I m 
                wrong. We re good.

    He hangs up, even more rattled. 

    His eyes go directly to the Fridge. A BUSINESS CARD is 
    attached under a  The Family  fridge magnet.

    He grabs the card.

                                  ALI
                Michael, what do you want from me? Go 
                to the police. Call a lawyer.

                                    MICHAEL
                And say what? I ve got no answers for 
                  anything. I don t know how I got home. 
                I don t know how she got there. I 
                don t know what happened.

    Harrison enters the office.

                                  HARRISON
                Sorry. Michael, did you call 911? 

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah, but I got scared - I hung up.

                                  HARRISON
                I just heard on the scanner - CSI and 
                the coroner are at The Oakwood.

                                    MICHAEL
                But I hung up.

                                  ALI
                You can t just hang up. They trace the 
                call.

                This girl didn t just die, she was 
                  murdered.

                                    MICHAEL
                I know! That s why you ve gotta help 
                me.

                                  ALI
                              (frustrated)
                Dammit, Michael - Why do YOUR problems 
                still become MY problems? What am I 
                supposed to do - break the law for 
                you? Harbor a suspect? Innocent people 
                go to the police - they trust the 
                system.

                                  HARRISON
                But he s not just a person, Ali. He s 
                a public figure. One that s been to 
                jail and in and out of rehab.

    Michael gives him a questioning look.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                I m a fan. He won t be treated like 
                everyone else. The media will crucify 
                him before sunset.

                                  ALI
                That doesn t mean he gets to change 
                the rules.

    Harrison comes over to her for a private moment.

                                  HARRISON
                Do you not want to help him because 
                you don t believe him or because he s 
                your ex-husband?

    Ali searches for a moment, then...

                                  ALI
                  I believe him. He s not that good an 
                actor.

    Michael has overheard.

                                    MICHAEL
                Allison, I know I haven t made things 
                easy... for anybody. I m not asking 
                you to forgive me. I m asking you to 
                believe me and to help me.

                Eight hours. I ll give you eight hours 
                and after that, no matter what, you go 
                to your lawyer or the cops, I don t

                You answer only that phone on only   
                that line. Don t go near the door, 
                don t look out the window, don t move 
                until you hear from me or I swear to 
                God, I ll kill you myself.

                          (to Harrison)
                Hey - Thank you.

                                  HARRISON
                Sure... That line about  you don t 
                have to forgive me just help me  - was 
                that from the finale of season 2?

    Michael doesn t acknowledge anything. He just indicates that 
    Harrison should hurry.

    A cadre of COPS and CSI TECHS, taking pictures and searching

                They re here on my say-so. Anybody got 
                an issue with that, you can report me.

    They begin looking about. Harrison can t help but react to the 
    small trove of memorabilia from Michael s career.

                                  HARRISON
                Jesus. Is that an actual Emmy?

                He s not blowing money on a maid.

    Ali focuses on Vanessa s CORPSE, her lifeless eyes staring 
    into space.

    She and Harrison begin examining the body closely from 
    opposite sides of the bed.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  17.

    A CSI-TECH lifts Vanessa s head to show the FINGER IMPRINTS on 
    her neck.

                                  HARRISON
                The attack was from the rear. Splayed 
                  imprints, most likely from the perp 
                wearing gloves.

                You re a freakin  genius, Potter.

                                  HARRISON
                Gloves would mean the murder wasn t 
                  spontaneous. It was pre-meditated.

                                  ALI
                And who plans to bring somebody to

                  Something else weird. Only nine 
                  impressions on the throat.

    Ali crosses to him and places her hands around his neck.

                Which one s missing?

                                  HARRISON
                Right ring finger.

    Ali lifts the matching finger away.

                Hard to exert pressure and keep that

                The impressions are clean, very exact.

                Given half an opportunity, he d take 
                it. This guy didn t. Three, Michael is 
                a lot of things, but violent is not

    Ali and Harrison are talking into the speakerphone.

                It s not good. She was strangled to

                  outstanding business with a couple of 
                people but nobody that would pull

    Michael hangs up. He looks tired and feels worse.


    Michael enters and runs the tap, splashes water onto his face 
    and head. Specks of soap fly onto the mirror as he does this. 

    He looks at his reflection and notes how the soap spots 
    occlude bits of his face. An idea sparks.

    He wipes the mirror clean and takes the bar of soap. With the 
    soap, he draws a mustache over his reflected lip and considers 
    it.

                                    MICHAEL
                            (changes his voice)
                Hello... Michael Kass.

    Now he heavies his eyebrows and sideburns.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                            (changes it again)
                Hello... Michael Kass.

    He swabs a mass of white hair on his reflected head. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                            (several voices)
                Hello... Michael Kass. Michael Kass. 
                I m Michael Kass.

    He now turns from the mirror, a determined set to his face.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                Not... Michael Kass.

    Michael leaves the bathroom in a hurry.


    Michael passes an array of CREATURES, ALIENS, ROBOTICS, and 
    several plaster castings of famous actors. 

    A large open space surrounded by shelves of equipment, body 
    parts, make-up, wigs, wardrobe, hand props, chemicals and 
    various paraphernalia.

    VILMER SANTINI, 50 s, looks like some odd mix of Einstein and 
    Charles Manson. An artist and engineer, he is part 
      philosopher/part guru - depending on which left over drug from 
    the 80's kicks in at any given moment. 

    As Michael enters, Santini is testing an explosive effect on a 
    plaster head loaded with stage blood and brain.

                                    SANTINI
                Fire in the hole!

    The EXPLOSION obliterates the head.

                                    SANTINI (CONT D)
                  Superior. Hey, Mike.

                                    MICHAEL
                Santini, I need your help.


    Santini is rolling a home-made cigarette, having just heard 
    Michael s tale. In the background, an odd Jamaican influenced 
    hip-hop is playing.

                                    SANTINI
                Somebody is punking you hard, my 
                brother. This is a real crossroads for 
                you, man. Two worlds colliding. 
                Y know? Everyone faces their trail... 
                This is your trial.

                                    MICHAEL
                  Actually, I m trying to avoid a trial.

    The music finally gets to Michael.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                Jesus, can you turn down the music? 
                What is that?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  23.

    CONTINUED:

                                    SANTINI
                You don t know Jimarcus? Reggae fusion 
                hip-hop? Step into serenity, bro.

    Santini adjusts the volume. 

                                    SANTINI (CONT D)
                So, what do you want to do?

                                    MICHAEL
                I gotta get out there but everybody is 
                looking for me. 

                                    SANTINI
                And you re easy to spot, Starman.

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah. So how about we make it harder?

    Santini knows what he means and likes it.

                                    SANTINI
                  Superior. Inspire me.

                                    MICHAEL
                            (thinking it thru)
                I got to get to that club. Some kind 
                of exec. European flavor. Metrosexual. 
                No threat. Has money. Connections. 

    Santini smiles and crosses to a mirrored make-up table that 
    has been covered with a drape. He sweeps off the smock, 
    revealing the items underneath.

                                    SANTINI
                  Ignition!

    A SERIES OF RAPID CUTS...

    As Michael is transformed in phases of makeup, wigs and facial 
    hair. 

    In the final shot, Michael regards himself in the mirror as 
    Santini removes the smock from his shoulders, admiring. 

    Michael is a different man - one with new life and purpose. 
    But just who he is....

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

    FADE IN:


    This is the place - four star dining and the hottest bar and 
    dance floor in LA. At present, a crew of workers are prepping *
    the main room for the night. 

    Ali and Harrison are waiting at the bar. An ATTRACTIVE HOSTESS *
    comes up to them.

                                    HOSTESS
                Mr. Galindo can see you now.

    She leads them into the main room. As they walk, Harrison 
    leans into Ali.

                                  HARRISON
                Don t use your last name right now. 
                Just a precaution.

    They approach a strikingly handsome, very well-dressed Cuban 
    man in his 40 s. This is VICTOR GALINDO, the owner of CLB. 
    Clearly powerful, he wears it with ease and charm. Off to the 
    side, but ever present are TWO BODYGUARDS.*

    Galindo approaches, hand extended, oozing easy charm.

                                    GALINDO
                Hello, I m Victor Galindo.

                                  HARRISON
                I m Det. Potter. 

                                  ALI
                Det. Jaworski. Thank you for taking 
                the time to see us.

                                    GALINDO
                My pleasure. How can I help you?

                                  HARRISON
                We re investigating the death of a 
                young woman. We believe she was here 
                last night.

                                    GALINDO
                I assume this was an untimely death?

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  25.

    Ali holds up her cellphone showing a photo of Vanessa.

                                  ALI
                Does this girl look familiar?

                                    GALINDO
                I m sorry, I couldn t say.

                                  ALI
                Why not?

                                    GALINDO
                On any given night, there are close to 
                500 people in this club. Many very 
                  attractive, young ladies. I m afraid 
                they all start to blend in the mind. 
                  Occupational hazard. 

                                  HARRISON
                Maybe you d recognize a name? Vanessa 
                Blake?

                                    GALINDO
                No, I m sorry. It s not a name I know.

    The Hostess waits beside A MAN that we can t quite make out.

                                    GALINDO (CONT D)
                Excuse me. Yes, Ramona?

                                    HOSTESS
                There s a mister Dovess.. Doovesser...

                                   CAMERON 
                  Douvassier. Cameron Douvassier. Not 
                easy to get from the spelling.

    This is Michael, transformed and adorned with a smart, trendy 
    suit, glasses on a neck chain and some jewelry.

    As he moves forward into the scene, no one - not even Ali or 
    Harrison - have any idea he is anything but what he presents 
    himself to be. It is a perfect and complete disguise.

                                   CAMERON  (CONT D)
                I m with Rousse Parfait Entertainment. *

    Cameron wanders off onto the dance floor. Galindo redirects 
    his attention to the detectives.

                                  HARRISON
                Vanessa was here with a celebrity last 
                night. Maybe that would help you 
                  remember.

                                    GALINDO
                Perhaps. We do seem to be popular with 
                the Hollywood elite.

                I m sorry. Is that a cartoon?

    A CLATTER OF EQUIPMENT. 

     Cameron  has been  perusing  by the DJ stand and has toppled 
    some items. He quickly covers.

                                   CAMERON 
                  Apologies. Excellent acoustics, B-T-W.

                Good day, detectives.

                Tragic. You knew her?

                                    GALINDO
                Not well.

                                   CAMERON 
                You told them -  not at all .


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  29.

    Galindo raises a curious brow.

                                   CAMERON  (CONT D)
                  Excellent acoustics.

                                    GALINDO
                The young lady... had an escort. I am 
                  extraordinarily protective of our well-
                known clients. 

                                   CAMERON 
                Ah - clarity. Celebrities and their... 
                escorts, can you assure me such a 
                crowd on any night?

                                    GALINDO
                I can do better than assure. 


    This is a plush, upscale private office.

    Galindo shows  Cameron  footage from surveillance cameras set 
    up around the club - a whole deck of seven or eight monitors.

                                    GALINDO
                This footage is just from last night. 
                I think you may recognize some faces.

                                   CAMERON 
                Quite the assemblage. Ah, Snooky. 
                Quell shock. Tyra. Nice to see the 
                former governor relaxing. Is that 
                Charlie Sheen?

                                    GALINDO
                No, John Stamos.

                                   CAMERON 
                Whew. 
 

     Cameron  now spots himself on one of the monitors, being 
    pulled toward the dance floor by Vanessa Blake.

                                    GALINDO
                Ah, that is the young lady the 
                  detectives were asking about.

    On the monitor, a Barmaid brings two drinks over to Michael 
    and Vanessa. They accept and toast a silent  thank-you  to 
    some unseen someone off camera.

                                   CAMERON 
                A shame - she looks lovely.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  30.

                She was. Her friends will be 
                  devastated at the news. 

                                   CAMERON 
                Friends?

    Galindo points out several stunning girls on different 
    monitors.

                                    GALINDO
                There. There. That one. Many more.

                                   CAMERON 
                  Stunning. Are you a collector?

                                    GALINDO
                They are here every night. I ve come 
                to believe there is no party without 
                them. Perhaps you should see for 
                  yourself. Tonight. As my guest. We can 
                finish our business then.

    Galindo hands him a card.

                                   CAMERON 
                I pray it won t be all business, 
                Victor.

                                    GALINDO
                Amen.


    Ali and Harrison stride past the counter and booths, looking 
    to connect with the mystery caller. 

    As they pass a booth, Cameron s hand shoots out to stop them.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  31.

                If I were paranoid, I might say you 
                two were stalking me.

                Did you call us? Do you know something 
                about last night?

                                   CAMERON 
                I know your ex-husband is innocent.

                                  HARRISON
                How do you know that?

                And nothing... is more important than 
                the family.

    Harrison clues in.

    Michael smiles, he doesn t see that Ali is angry.

                                  HARRISON
                That s unbelievable. UNBELIEVABLE!

    Ali starts slapping and kicking at Michael who can do little 
    to fend it off. Then Ali starts striding off.

                                    MICHAEL
                Ali, wait...

                                  ALI
                Is this a game to you? I m risking my 
                ass every second I help you and you re 
                playing dress-up?

                                    MICHAEL
                I m not playing. But I couldn t just 
                sit and do nothing. 

                                  ALI
                No, that would waste a perfectly good 
                  opportunity to SCREW EVERYTHING!!!

    He moves her back toward their booth.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                I m trying to help. You did great at 
                my apartment cause you re cops. But 
                you struck out at that club because 
                you re cops. 

                                  ALI
                We re not cops anymore.

                                    MICHAEL
                  Detectives, same thing. You re bound 
                by rules. I m not. I can be anything I 
                want. And admit it, I fooled you. I 
                fooled Victor Galindo. And I got good 
                  information.  So, I m crazy? Fine, 
                this whole situation is crazy. Now you 
                can stand there and hate me or I can

    Ali sits, but she s still upset.

                                  ALI
                I choose both.

                                  HARRISON
                Very mature. Good work.

                Shut up, Potter. Go fly your

                                  HARRISON
                And thus endeth the maturity.

                                    MICHAEL
                Galindo absolutely knew Vanessa. He 
                just wasn t copping to it.

    Harrison s cell rings and he answers it.

                Vanessa hung with a group of girls

                Thanks man, I owe you.

    Harrison hangs up and scribbles something on a napkin.

                The lab confirms Rohypnol in her

                a team out to talk to the husband.

                You re right, by the way. She and I 
                would never have gotten that 
                  information. You might want to wipe

    Harrison heads out. Michael reaches for a napkin on the table. 
    It s the one Harrison was scribbling on.

    INSERT:  Dan Blake, 17731 Cloverdale Rd. Husband. 

    Michael looks up just in time to see Harrison shoot him the 
    tiniest glance before heading out.  


    Michael and Santini work the computer. Google Maps ZOOMS in on 
    a particular house. The Napkin is there for reference.

    INSERT SCREEN: A satellite view of a suburban house.

    Santini hits the  Street View  button. There is a truck parked 
    in front and gardeners working.

                Good enough.

    A SERIES OF RAPID CUTS...

    In the final shot, Michael regards himself in the mirror as

    FADE IN:


    Blake sits, clearly shaken by the news of his wife s death.

                When was the last time you spoke with

                                  BLAKE
                I m not sure. Uh, we spoke often. At 
                least once a week. Maybe more.

    The Cop makes a note. Blake feels he needs to explain.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                We were working it out. Vanessa just 
                felt like she needed to get away... 
                Think things through. We were working 
                it out.

                                  COP#2
                Did she ever mention any other 
                  relationships? Friends? Boyfriend?

                                  BLAKE*
                Yeah, she had some friends, I guess - *
                  a roommate. I don t know how close 
                they were.

                Yes, sir.

                Your wife s body was discovered in his 
                  apartment. 

    Blake, seemingly devastated turns to the window. He locks eyes 
    with this unknown gardener.

    Michael, caught unexpectedly, over-compensates by clipping 
    away like a madman. In his zeal, he manages to CUT HIS FINGER. 
    He moves off from the window.

    Michael continues pruning while eyeing the officers and Blake 
    in the house. As their conversation ends, Blake leads them to 
    the front door. 

    Michael tracks them, moving toward the front door to catch the 
    final snippet of conversation.

                Follow up? Follow up on what?

                                  COP#1
                This is an ongoing investigation, Mr. 
                Blake. I m sure we ll need some 
                  additional information. 

                                  BLAKE
                Of course. Thank you.

    Michael watches the Officers move off. He turns back as Blake 
    hurries to shut the door.

    Michael trails him from outside. Blake hurries past windows on 
    his way back to his office.

    Once there, Blake closes the drapes. But he is unaware of the 
    gap at the split of the curtains.

    Michael steals up to the window and works to look inside. He 
    gets only glimpses.

    Michael s POV: BLAKE AT HIS DESK. He rifles through a drawer.

    BLAKE stuffs his laptop in a bag. HE CROSSES to a closet door. 
    Has to unlock it with a key. A light goes on inside. There are 
    SOUNDS of file cabinets, papers rifling, etc.

    Blake emerges from the closet with several FILE FOLDERS and a 
    large trash bag stuffed with something. He leaves the office.

    Michael races to intercept him at the front path.

    He reaches the front path and starts randomly clipping as 
    Blake comes pounding out the door with his bundles.

    As Blake tries to hurry past, Michael surreptitiously jams his 
    clippers into the trash bag, splitting it open and spilling 
    it s contents to the ground.

    A quick glance reveals them to be INSURANCE RECORDS. 

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                God damn it. You idiot, what the hell 
                are you doing?

    Michael now adopts a thick, Mexican accent - the finishing 
    touch on his transformation to the character of  ERNESTO .

                                   ERNESTO 
                Lo siento. Lo siento. Sorry.

    Ernesto bends to help Blake gather his papers. Blake shoves 
    him back, hard.

                                  BLAKE
                Don t touch that. Who are you?

                                   ERNESTO 
                Ernesto, senor.

                                  BLAKE
                I don t know you. Where s Jorge?

                                   ERNESTO 
                Jorge necesito... another job. I 
                finish.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  38.

    Blake looks at the butchered hedges for the first time. 

                                  BLAKE
                Finish? You ve destroyed the goddamn 
                place. I should call those cops back 
                and have them lock you the hell up.

    ** As Blake fumes, he gesticulates wildly with his hands. 
    Michael, being a keen observer and mimic, notes that Blake 
    holds both his ring fingers in a peculiar way when he 
    gestures. The audience is unlikely to note it now, but they 
    will later.

                                   ERNESTO 
                Jorge tell me... como esta. He say to 
                make good. 

                                  BLAKE
                This is not good! Comprende? Not good!

    He gathers his fallen items.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                You get your tools and get the hell 
                off my property. You hear me? 

    Blake is moving quickly to his car, tossing the items in.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                I see you again, I m calling the 
                police.

    Blake climbs in his car and speeds off.

                                   ERNESTO 
                I sorry. Sorry. 
                       (then, as Michael)
                Sorry I didn t kick your ass, you son 
                of a bitch.

    Michael turns back toward the house.


    He lands and looks around the room for a second, then makes 
    his way towards the office.


    Michael scans the room. PHOTOS OF VANESSA are everywhere - the 
    walls, the desk, the shelves. Adoring or obsessive?

    Michael moves to the closet Blake had gone into. The door has 
    been left slightly ajar and the light on.


    A standard utility closet. But there are also shelves of 
    MEDICAL SUPPLIES: syringes, swabs, gloves, braces, etc. 

    In the rear of the closet is a FILE CABINET. Several drawers 
    are haphazardly open. Michael begins rifling through them.

    INSERT: MULTIPLE CLAIMS made to different insurance carriers 
    for the same individuals or companies. 

    Michael takes some cell phone pictures, then crams a few files 
    into his pockets. 

    As he does, he sees his BLOOD has stained the cabinet. He 
    swipes at the spot with his sleeve, leaving a streak.

    He turns to the shelves of medical supplies, pushing aside 
    boxes in search of a bandage, when he begins to notice all 
    kinds of PHARMACEUTICAL SAMPLES. 

    One package in particular catches his eye - Rohypnol. He 
    stuffs the sample into his pocket.  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  41.



    He moves back to Blake s desk. It s a mess of papers with an 
    ANSWERING MACHINE flashing in the corner.

    Michael hits the play button.

                                  ANSWERING MACHINE
                You have... no... new messages. First 
                saved message...

    Michael fast forwards through, stopping only for...

                                    VANESSA (O.S.)
                It s Vanessa. Look, I saw your car  
                tonight. And I saw you at the club the 
                other night. I want you to stop it, 
                Dan. Stop following me. Stop calling 
                me. I don t want to hurt you but we 
                both know I have more than enough 
                  information to do that. Don t make me 
                use it. 

    The message ends. Michael is stunned by the evidence. Unsure 
    what else to do, he TAKES THE MACHINE and goes.


    Michael  Ernesto  enters the outer office, drawing Harry s 
    attention.

                                  HARRISON
                Sorry, not open.

    Ernesto responds in a torrent of nonsense Spanish.

                                  HARRISON (CONT D)
                No, no... amigo, no en casa.

    Ernesto drops the accent and assumes Michael s regular voice.

                                    MICHAEL
                Really? What if I told you I ve 
                cracked this case wide open?

    Harrison lights up.

                                  HARRISON
                GET OUTTA HERE! GET OUTTA HERE. That 
                is UNBELIEVABLE! I thought you were... 
                holy Moses.

                                    MICHAEL
                Muchas gracias, Senor.

                the husband s house?

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah. He s the guy, Harry. Cops tell 
                him his wife is dead, he puts on some 
                dog and pony show of grief. They leave 
                - bang. He s pulling files into a 
                trash bag. He s way deep into some 
                kind of insurance scam. 

                                  HARRISON
                  Insurance?

                                    MICHAEL
                Vanessa knew all about it. She must 
                have been holding it over him and he 
                snapped. The guy s a lunatic. Comes 
                running out of his house, gets right 
                in my face.

    Michael does an uncanny impression, right down to Blake s odd  
    hand gestures. 

                                  HARRISON
                What s with your hands? 

                                    MICHAEL
                I don t know. That s what the guy 
                does. 

                                  HARRISON
                His ring fingers are bent in like 
                that?

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah, why?

                                  HARRISON
                It could make something make sense. 
                It s just... the time-line is weird.

                                  HARRISON
                LAPD checked his movements last night 
                based on cell phone pings. They put 
                him at the Oakwood Apartments. Only 
                not at the time of death. Coroner s 
                office says Vanessa was killed between 
                one and three a.m., this morning. But 
                they only have Blake there around 7:30 
                last night.

                                    MICHAEL

                The prime... the only suspect in this 
                murder illegally entered the husband s

                  EVERYTHING in his home that points to 
                his guilt, was planted there by YOU.

                                    MICHAEL

                Oh, Michael. (a laugh) Maybe we can

                We can blame it on me. I encouraged

                And he did.

    Ali still looks at him, unsatisfied.

                I used to play by the rules. I did

                                  ALI
                But if we get tied to this...

                                  HARRISON
                I ll keep you out of it. I ll say you 
                had no idea I was working for him. 
                They can t touch you.

    Ali is overwhelmed. Her heart tugged in every direction. 
    Finally...

                                  ALI
                Okay. I promised you a day, Michael. 
                So we keep going.

                I ll head back to CLB, see if 
                  Vanessa s girlfriends can tell me 
                  anything. I won t tell you what to do. 
                Because frankly, I don t know anymore. 
                      (to Harrison)
                I ll check back with you later.

                                    MICHAEL
                Ali --- thank you.

                                  ALI
                Don t thank me, because unless you can 
                find somebody to squeeze a confession 
                out of Dan Blake, I think you re in 
                for a very tough time.

    Ali heads out. Michael and Harrison exchange looks before 
    Harrison follows her out.

    Michael walks to the bathroom and stares at himself hard in 
    the mirror. 

    IN A SERIES OF SHOTS, he peels fake facial hair, nose, wig and 
    begins to wipe the pancake makeup from his skin. 

    What s left is a Michael more lost, yet determined than we 
    have ever seen him.

                I ll kill you.

                                    MICHAEL
                Too late. You should ve taken me out 
                when you killed Vanessa.

                                  BLAKE
                What? What did you say?

                                    MICHAEL
                I know all about your little insurance 
                scam, asshole. I have your files. I 
                have your phone machine. I know where 
                you were last night and I can prove 
                it. Wanna rip my head off now? Or do 
                we start talking?

    Blake stands, dazed and cornered.


      A cacophony of bodies, lights, haze, booze, sexuality - all 
    gyrating to a pounding, non-stop beat.

    Ali moves her way through the crowded dance floor, dressed to 
    kill. Suddenly, a young PRETTY BOY comes up behind her and 
    grabs her hips, pressing himself inappropriately close.

                                  ALI
                I don t believe you asked me dance.

                                  PRETTY BOY
                I don t believe I need to, mama.

    Ali turns around seductively and grabs the guy, hard, by his 
    nipple. It does not feel good.

                                  ALI
                Do I still remind you of your mama?

                                  PRETTY BOY
                I m sorry. I m sorry. Let go.

    She releases him.

                Damn. You don t have to go all 
                Angelina on me. I thought you were one 
                of Victor s girls.

                                  ALI
                Victor s girls?

                                  PRETTY BOY
                Yeah, I thought you were on the menu. 
                My bad.

    Ali takes it in, plays dumb.

                                  ALI
                Hey, it s all good. I m looking for a 
                  girlfriend of mine. Maybe you know her 
                  - Vanessa Blake?

                                  PRETTY BOY
                Amanda s friend?

                                  ALI
                Yeah, that s right.

                                  PRETTY BOY
                  I haven t seen her tonight. But her 
                crew are over there by the bar.

    Ali turns to see a GROUP OF UNBELIEVABLY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG 
    GIRLS, dressed to be seen. They are largely of Latino descent. 


    Little has changed.

                                    MICHAEL
                I know you were at my apartment last 
                night. The cops know you were there, 
                too.

                                  BLAKE
                I just wanted to talk to her. 

                                    MICHAEL
                Hard for her to talk with your hands 
                wrapped around her throat.

                                  BLAKE
                Are you insane? You murder my wife and 
                you re trying to pin it on me?

                                    MICHAEL
                DROP THE ACT! YOU STALKED HER! YOU 
                  THREATENED HER!

                And when she still wouldn t back down, 
                you choked her to death, you son of a 
                bitch.

                                  BLAKE
                Listen to me, you piece of garbage - 
                you want to play psycho games with me? 
                Fine. Let s call the cops. Have them 
                hook us up to a couple of lie 
                  detectors. You tell your story, I ll 
                tell mine. I loved that girl more than 
                  anything. I never raised a hand to 
                her, ever. And if I have to spend the 
                rest of my life in jail for the crap I 
                am guilty of, I ll do it -just to put 
                you away for what you ve done. 

    Michael is desperately trying to make sense of the man and the 
    story before him.


    Amanda is sitting with Harrison.

                                  AMANDA
                I didn t know her that long. She left 
                her husband, I needed a roommate...

                                  HARRISON
                Why did she leave him? Was she afraid 
                of him?

                                  AMANDA
                No, she was angry. He was into some 
                bad stuff. I don t know what. She was 
                so damn righteous all the time.
                            (full of emotion)
                She ruined everything.

                                  HARRISON
                How?


    Ali arrives at the circle of  Victor s  girls. These girls are 
    barely out of their teens.

                                  ALI
                Excuse me. I m looking for Amanda. 
                Have you guys seen her tonight?

    This elicits some giggles from the girls.

                                  GIRL#1
                She doesn t come here anymore.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  51.

                I do. I m her friend. 

    Ali is reading an odd vibe from the girls.

                                  ALI (CONT D)
                Are you her friends, too?

                                  GIRL#2
                     (stiff, tense)
                You should talk to Victor. Vanessa 
                doesn t come here anymore.

                                  ALI
                I know she doesn t.

    Ali takes out her cell phone. A PICTURE of Vanessa dead in the 
    bed. The girls stagger. Now there is fear, in all of them.

                                  GIRL#2
                Who are you?

                                  ALI
                  A friend. This shouldn t have happened 
                to Vanessa. I m trying to make sure it 
                doesn t happen to anyone else. So 
                maybe you can talk to me?

    The girls eye each other, looking for a response.


                                  AMANDA
                She wanted to be an actress. I took 
                her to the club. I thought... She 
                would meet people. Maybe they would 
                give her a chance. I didn t think he 
                would notice her.

                                  HARRISON
                He?

                                  AMANDA
                Victor. He wanted her. Like he wanted 
                the rest of us... for himself. And to *
                share.

    Ali is still with the girls.

                You re all illegals?

                Victor takes care of us. Whatever the

                But you don t have a choice. You can t 
                say no. You can t walk away.

    Their silence is the answer.


                                  AMANDA
                Victor started introducing Vanessa 
                around. He knew she was on her own, he 
                even gave her some money... told her 
                she could pay it back later.

                I don t know, maybe midnight. I was 
                scared. I ran. And God forgive me, I 
                opened the door for her killer. 

    Amanda dissolves in tears.


    The men are drained, sitting on the floor.

                                    MICHAEL
                You re not lying. Everything you did 
                today - you were just covering your 
                tracks. 

                                  BLAKE
                What are you talking about?

                                    MICHAEL
                It wasn t me, Blake. Whatever happens, 
                I want you to know that. It wasn t me.

    Michael heads out the door.


    INTERCUT between Michael and Harrison.

    **As Michael describes the action, we see it play out in 
    FLASHBACK.

                                  HARRISON
                Hello.

                                    MICHAEL
                It s not Blake. He didn t kill her.

                                  HARRISON
                Mike, last night, walk me through it.

                                    MICHAEL
                I told you what I remember. Vanessa 
                asked me to dinner. We left around 
                  seven-thirty.

                                  HARRISON
                How long do you stay at dinner?

                                    MICHAEL
                I don t know. We talked a lot. Three 
                hours, maybe.

                                  HARRISON
                  Ten-thirty, okay. You get up to go. 
                You feel okay?

                                    MICHAEL
                Yeah.

                                  HARRISON
                Whose idea to go to the club?

                                    MICHAEL
                  Vanessa s. I didn t want to go. She 
                said it would be good for both of us. 
                 We should be seen in that crowd . 
                Like she s trying to help my career. I 
                get us a couple of drinks.

                                  HARRISON
                From where?

                                    MICHAEL
                The bar. I go to the bar. She s 
                talking to this group of girls, for 
                awhile. Then a couple of guys came up 
                to her. Looked like they got into 
                  something for a minute. I thought they 
                were hitting on her. 

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  56.

                Then what?

                                    MICHAEL
                She comes back. I ask her if 
                  everything is okay. She says yes. 
                Then, she wants to go on the dance 
                floor. I don t want to. People are 
                looking at us. 

                                  HARRISON
                You said when you were there today you 
                saw tapes of you and Vanessa.

                                    MICHAEL
                Uh... yeah. We were kinda dancing and 
                then a waitress came with drinks...

                                  HARRISON
                You said it was a fan. A fan sent you 
                drinks.

                                    MICHAEL
                Maybe. 

                                  HARRISON
                You saw yourself toasting somebody. 
                Who, Michael? Think. Who were you 
                  toasting? 

    Michael struggles to remember. Then, it hits him hard.

                                    MICHAEL
                Galindo. The drinks came from Victor 
                Galindo. 

    A BEAT of realization for both of them.


    A dimly lit, ultra plush exclusive enclave. 

    Victor is present, entertaining a handful of guests. His 
    Bodyguard is beside him.

    Ali approaches Galindo. He is amused by her tenacity.

                                    GALINDO
                  Detective Jaworsky, I almost didn t 
                  recognize you. 

                                  ALI
                Well I m under cover as it were.

                Ah, and whom, may I ask, has the 
                pleasure of having you under their 
                covers?

    Galindo s guests enjoy a laugh.

                                  ALI
                The LAPD, actually. They find you 
                  fascinating, Mr. Galindo. Your 
                  connection to a number of Cuban gangs 
                and drug smugglers. That fact you are 
                  harboring illegal aliens whom you 
                  prostitute, or even better - barter 
                into sexual slavery.

    Galindo s mood changes readily.

                                    GALINDO
                Manuel, would you see our guests 
                  downstairs and set them up with 
                  complimentary drinks? Javier, please 
                remain here.

    One Bodyguard escorts the group away, leaving Ali alone.

                                    GALINDO (CONT D)
                You have become a very serious 
                  intrusion into my business, Detective.

                                  ALI
                Really? I paid for my drink.

                                    GALINDO
                I do not appreciate your accusations. 
                I have many acquaintances. Their 
                  affiliations or legal status is not my 
                concern. As for your claim of 
                  prostitution - they are ridiculous. I 
                have fostered careers, nurtured 
                talent. The girls I take an interest 
                in thrive. How can that be 
                  prostitution?

                                  ALI
                When you offer them up like candy as 
                one of the perks of elite club 
                  membership and they can t refuse for 
                fear of deportation or physical abuse, 
                that is prostitution.

                                    GALINDO
                I take nothing from them. I introduce 
                them to important, powerful men.

                What they do with those men - what 
                they get from those men, is their 
                  business. They are nothing when they 
                meet me. I give them lives.

                And Vanessa Blake... did you give her 
                a life, too? Or did you take it?


    Reese leans in.

                Come on scumbag...


    Harrison is walking through the club, making his way to the 
    bar. Beside him, is it? Yes - Cameron Douvassier.

    They approach the BARTENDER.

                                   CAMERON 
                Pardon. Late beyond forgiving. Mr.

                Is he expecting you, sir?

     Cameron  shows him Galindo s business card.

                Vanessa Blake - you keep insisting I

                                  ALI
                And you keep insisting I m stupid. 

                                    GALINDO
                A girl came into the club named 
                Vanessa. Perhaps, she is the one you 
                are talking about. And if it was her, 
                anyone would tell you I did everything 
                I could to help her.

                No, she was not. I do favors for my

                This establishment closes at 4AM. I

                  I noticed there are security cameras

                That is unfortunate. Do you know where 
                else they have security cameras? All 
                over the communal areas of the Oakwood

                camera than you do in person.

    The air is tight with tension.

    Reese tilts his head sideways. What is going on?


    Cornered and frantic, everybody moves fast. 

    Ali goes to grab a pistol from her thigh holster. Galindo 
    intercepts her, grabs the gun and pulls her into him. He s now 
    got the gun at her head.

    Harrison starts to move toward them as the Bodyguard slams him 
    back against the wall and pulls a gun to his head. 

     Cameron  is frozen between all of them.

                I ve never trusted clowns. They rarely 
                amuse. And why? Because they are silly 
                men beneath silly masks. But remove 
                the mask...

     Cameron  removes his wig and prosthetic pieces as he 
    speaks...

                                   CAMERON  (CONT D)
                And they re not so silly anymore. 
                Hello Victor, I m Michael Kass.

    Galindo and his guard are both stunned. 

    In that split second, Ali grabs at Galindo s gun and spins 
    away from him. But what she s holding onto is not his gun, BUT 
    HIS PROSTHETIC FINGER. 

    Galindo aims at Ali. 

    The guard has been distracted by all the action. Harrison 
    deftly deflects the gun from this head, grabs the Bodyguard s 
    arm and uses the weapon to SHOOT Galindo.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Kass & Makeup - "PILOT" - Ep. #1 -  62.

    CONTINUED:

    Galindo hits the ground as Harrison disables the guard.

    Reese and LAPD burst in, guns drawn.

                                  REESE
                  Everybody freeze!

                                  HARRISON
                Reese! Situation contained.

    Michael runs over to Ali. They stare at each other a moment.

                                    MICHAEL
                  I couldn t get that confession you 
                wanted.

    Ali pulls out the conceal wire.

                                  ALI
                            (glowing)
                I did.

    All they can do is smile at each other.
