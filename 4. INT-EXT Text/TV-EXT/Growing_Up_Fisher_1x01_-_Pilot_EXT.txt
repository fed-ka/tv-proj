      A father, MEL, carries a chainsaw in his right hand while 
      holding hands with his son, HENRY, with his left.  Henry is 
      way too old to be holding his father s hand.  

                                HENRY
                ...Well, if we re definitely getting a 
                dog, I call dibs on naming him.  

                                MEL
                We re not naming the dog Optimus 
                Prime.  He already has a name.  It s 
                Elvis.

                                HENRY
                Oh, I like that.  
                      (then)
                If we ever get a cat though...

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                When I was fourteen, my parents got 
                  divorced.  Which made me like fifty 
                percent of kids in America.  One kinda 
                huge difference was... 

      Henry stops walking.  And so does Mel.    

                                MEL
                Okay, Henry, tell me what tree to cut 
                down.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...my dad was blind.  As in  what the 
                hell s a blind guy doing with a 
                  chainsaw?!   

      Henry shakes his head -- are they really doing this?  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Mom gave me that haircut.  And despite 
                what it looks like, she can see fine.

                                HENRY
                This one right here.

      Henry takes his dad's hand and puts it on the trunk of a tree.  

                                MEL
                Got it.  Two quick things:  How tall s 
                the tree and where s our house?    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           2


                                HENRY
                Super tall and over your right 
                  shoulder.

                                MEL
                My right shoulder?!

                                HENRY
                You know what, why don t we just go 
                grab some Jamba Juice?  

                                MEL
                  Nonsense.  My kids want a pool, 
                they re getting a pool.  

      Mel takes off the cover, feels for the choke and pumps it.  

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Okay, this is now a Danger Zone.  Go 
                inside until I yell  Safety Zone.   

                                HENRY
                How  bout just a hot tub?  We could--

                                MEL
                Danger Zone!

      Mel fires up the chainsaw and Henry hightails it out of 
      there.  Just as Henry reaches the deck, he turns to see:

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Timber!

      CLOSE ON Henry s face in awe as his father takes down the tree.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                I met the most amazing man I ll ever 
                meet in my life when I was four and a 
                half minutes old.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL Henry s been joined by his sister, KATIE, 
      16, nose ring, texting on her phone, all attitude. 

                                KATIE
                      (still texting)
                Why is he wearing safety glasses?  

                                HENRY
                Safety glasses?  That's what s 
                tripping you up?  

      The two stand and watch in silent disbelief for a beat, then:

                                MEL (O.C.)

                                HENRY
                      (duty calls)
                I gotta go.

      As Henry runs back to point out the next tree, we cut to...

                          MAIN TITLES:  &THEN CAME ELVIS  


      A HUGE pile of fresh cut firewood lines the driveway.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                The craziest part of my parents 
                getting divorced was how I found 
                out...  

                                MEL (O.S.)
                Hike!

      PAN OVER to see Henry hike a football to Mel.  Henry goes 
      long, shouting the whole way.

                                HENRY
                      (announcer voice)
                Henry Fisher explodes out of the back 
                field.  He s fast, he s quick--  

                                MEL
                He s got one more play before clarinet 
                  practice.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...But in order to fully appreciate 
                the irony, you re gonna need a little 
                  backstory:  Dad went blind when he was 
                  eleven...

      Mel tracks Henry s voice and throws a perfect spiral.  Henry 
      catches the ball and runs towards Mel who now plays defense.  

                                HENRY
                He s got one more defender to beat.  
                He s at the thirty, the twenty...

      As Henry bobs and weaves, Mel chases after Henry s voice.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                  ...Before you picture a blind guy 
                selling pencils on the corner, my dad 
                never let the fact that he couldn t 
                see keep him from doing anything...

      Mel catches Henry and tackles him to the ground, a bit too hard.     ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           4



      Katie's in the driver's seat of the family's SUV, trying to 
      parallel park but the SUV is currently jerking back and 
      forth.  Lady Gaga plays from the car stereo.  

                                MEL (O.C.)
                Clutch, clutch, clutch!

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...Even when it probably should've.

      REVEAL Mel sitting shotgun.  Mid-lesson.  The SUV stalls.

                                KATIE
                I can't do this.  I'm gonna be the 
                only sixteen-year-old in California 
                without a license!

      Mel feels for the stereo and turns off the music.

                                MEL
                Katie, sweetie...  

                                KATIE
                Get ready, everybody, here it comes.

                                MEL
                ...I went to law school blind.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                It s like he went to law school just 
                so he could say that to his kids.

      Mel opens the passenger door and gets out. 

                                HENRY (O.S.)
                Oh, God.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Henry sitting with his mother, JOYCE, on the 
      curb.  She s SMOKING A PIPE lost in her iPad.  

                                JOYCE
                      (re: iPad)
                Button, do you think I d look sexier 
                if I had bangs like Zooey Deschanel?

                                JOYCE
                Which is why I trust your opinion.

      Joyce looks up to see Mel using his hands to feel around the 
      hood as he navigates his way to the driver's side.      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           5

                Mel!  You should not be--

                                MEL
                Relax, Joyce, there s no game today!
                      (sniffing)
                And why don t you just slap a patch on 
                like everyone else?

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Mom started smoking a pipe because she 
                thought it was better than smoking 
                  cigarettes.  Not sure  bout that.  A 
                lot of kids' moms smoked cigarettes...  

      Joyce cups her hand over the bowl of the pipe and relights it.

                This is brutal.  Can I just walk home?

                                JOYCE
                No.  You know I don t trust this 
                  neighborhood.

                                HENRY
                Ugh.  Because of Anthony Hooper?

                                JOYCE
                He disappeared right outside Pinkberry!

                That was like three years ago, Joyce!
                And they found him that afternoon!

                      (then, to himself)
                No one wants that crap.   

      Mel is now sitting behind the wheel.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                I should mention, before they got 
                  divorced, my dad actually hid his 
                  blindness from everyone outside our 
                family.  He wasn t embarrassed.  He 
                was just proud...

                  Constitutional law was hard, sweetie.  
                Parallel parking is easy.

      Mel gets out to resume the lesson...

                who knew Dad was blind was the coolest 
                kid I knew.  My best friend Runyen...  


      Henry exits the cab to find Joyce sitting on the front steps, 
      smoking her pipe.  She blocks his way.  

                                JOYCE
                Welcome home.  Take off your clothes.

      A beat.  She s serious.  Henry takes off his shirt.

                  apartment, you can stay with him as 
                much as you want.  Pants.  

      He does a quick look to make sure no neighbors are watching,

                I know there re a lot of changes going 
                on right now, but we re still going to 
                be the same family we always were.  

                                HENRY
                Did you... get braces?

      Joyce smiles, proudly displaying her new metal mouth.  Katie 
      appears at the screen door.

                                KATIE
                That s right, Button.  And apparently, 
                as a personal favor to you and me, she 
                turned down the Invisaligns.  

      Joyce dumps tobacco out of her pipe and crosses over to her.

      some crazy Korean dish out of tupperware.

      Henry stares out the window and sighs.

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                Are you gonna be like this the whole 
                field trip,  cause if so, I ll go sit 
                with Bobby Lacito.  I will not have you 
                wrecking the botanical gardens for me.


      Henry and Runyen are filing off the bus with the rest of the 
      students who are lining up on the sidewalk.  

                                RUNYEN
                I ll tell you what you gotta do.  You 
                gotta find something you can do that 
                Mr. Costello-- I refuse to call him 
                Elvis-- can t.  

                                HENRY
                Like what?

      Henry and Runyen exit the bus.

                                RUNYEN
                I don t know.  Like opposable thumb 
                stuff.  Open olive jars, fold socks 
                into balls, challenge Mel Baby to some 
                pretty intense thumb wrestling.  

      Henry spots something across the street.

                                HENRY
                Oh my God, that s it.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           15


                                RUNYEN
                Yeah.  Even your best trained dogs 
                can t thumb wrestle.  

                                HENRY
                No.  Look.  

      Henry points to a sign that says  Apartment for Rent. 

                                HENRY (CONT D)
                I m going to get my dad an apartment.  
                That s something a dog can t do.

                                RUNYEN
                That s also something a fourteen year 
                old can t do.

      Henry starts to walk towards the apartment.  

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                What are you doing?  You can t leave a 
                field trip.  We signed a permission 
                slip!

                                HENRY
                      (crossing off)
                Put away the spicy pork and cover for me!

      Runyen tries to psych himself up like a boxer about to enter 
      the ring as he walks over to the TEACHER.  Just as he gets 
      there... he takes off his backpack, undoes the strap and drops 
      to the sidewalk,  wailing  in a full Korean meltdown.

                                RUNYEN
                Puloju soyo!  Puloju soyo!  My 
                backpack broke!

      The teacher immediately puts all her focus on consoling him.

                                TEACHER
                It s okay, it s okay.  We can fix it.  
                Or we ll get you a new one!

                                RUNYEN
                Nega wha nasoyo!  Nega wha nasoyo!  
                Jansport doesn t make this one anymore!

      Runyen looks and sees Henry has made it to the apartment 
      building and, on a dime, pulls himself together.

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                Oh, wait, it just snaps back together.

      Mel and Ken celebrate with their client Bill.  Beers and 
      snacks are strewn on the GLASS COFFEE TABLE.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                So I got my dad a sweet apartment.  
                Where he could celebrate with his 
                  buddies... 

                                MEL
                They settled for the full amount.  Who 
                settles for the full amount?!

      They all clank beer bottles.  Elvis barks in camaraderie.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...and my archenemy...

      Mel rewards Elvis with a potato chip.  

                                MEL
                Bup, bup.  I can lick my own fingers.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Me, I was enjoying a two-week 
                  vacation... 


      Henry and Mel, arm in arm, quickly walk the street. 

                                MEL
                Elvis!  Elvis!

                                HENRY
                Elvis, where are you?!

      An attractive WOMAN, late 30s, is locking up her bike.  

                                WOMAN
                      (playful)
                Have you tried Graceland?

                                MEL
                      (to Henry, sotto)
                Is that a woman on a bike?

                                HENRY
                Yeah, late thirties, pretty cute--

                                MEL
                No, I m not talking about that-- But I 
                like where your heads at.  
                      (to woman)
                Miss, we need to borrow your bike.  

                                WOMAN
                Excuse me?

                                MEL
                  I wouldn t ask, but there s a little 
                boy who s lost his dog.  And he s 
                very, very sad.

      She looks at Henry who willingly plays the part.

                                WOMAN
                Ohhhh.

                                MEL
                      (with a smile)
                Little confession.  That boy is me.

      She smiles.

                                WOMAN
                Of course, take my bike.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           24


      She gives Henry the bike.

                                MEL
                Thanks.  Here s my card in case you 
                ever need legal advice.  Or want to 
                grab some sushi.  
                      (to Henry, sotto)
                I m trusting you on the cute thing.


      Henry pedals the BIKE.  Mel sits on the seat holding Henry s 
      waist.      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           25


                                MEL
                You re pedaling so slow.

                                HENRY
                You weigh like four thousand pounds!

                                MEL
                Switch.

                                HENRY
                What?!

                                MEL
                Switch!  If I can drive a car, I think 
                I can ride a bike.

      As Henry considers this...


      Mel PEDALS AND STEERS THE BIKE, as Henry sits behind him.      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           26


                                HENRY
                Look out, look out, look out!

                                MEL
                Be more specific!

                                HENRY
                Stop the bike!  Danger zone!

      Mel stops the bike.

                                MEL
                Why did we--?

      A giant FedEx truck speeds by, blowing back their hair.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Good call.

      Mel reaches back and tugs the strings on Henry s hoodie.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Thanks for doing this.

                                HENRY
                Of course.

                                MEL
                Mom said you were worried I didn t 
                need you any more.

                                HENRY
                I didn t tell her that.

                                MEL
                She s everywhere.  That s our burden.

      They share a laugh.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                I do need you, buddy...  I need you to 
                be my son.  

      A sweet moment... that is interrupted by a long car horn.  
      Henry looks up and sees a familiar SUV driving past.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Katie and Mom?

                                HENRY
                You made the right move getting out of 
                the house.

      As they chuckle, Mel starts pedaling again.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           27


                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                I'm ashamed to admit it.  But when 
                we were on that bike, just me and Dad, a 
                part of me didn't want us to find Elvis... 


      Henry lets Elvis do his business on a small strip of grass.  
      Fred waves as he walks into the building.   

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...The dog doesn't see for you, it 
                guides you.  Safely, in the direction 
                you're supposed to be heading...


      Katie and Joyce walk to the car.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...it would take far longer than 
                anyone could have ever expected...    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           30


      Katie takes off the belt she's wearing and wraps it around her 
      mom's waist.  Joyce delights in it.  Then eyes Katie s earrings.  

                                KATIE
                      (curt)
                Please just finish this phase of your 
                life as fast as possible.
