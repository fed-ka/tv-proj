Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun.
A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes!
Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light,
trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and
the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his
shoulder.
Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the
barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!
Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!
When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a
fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a
handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then
takes it and wipes his mouth.
Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the
boy will never forget before waving him away.
2.
Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older
than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old
mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets
nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him.
BUS H
Just a boy, that's all.
6 SERIES: 6
7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7
fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks
the road in both directions. All clear for now.
8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8
dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn
into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his
shotgun leaning against the shack.
The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees
Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation.
HORTON
Mornin', sir.
BUSH
Hard life if you can't read..
HORTON
Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus
Horton, sir, how you doing?
Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton.
BUSH
Don't need saving, preacher.
3.
HORTON
Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has
passed on, sir. His funeral is
tomorrow and I thought you might
want to know since..
BUSH
(SOFTLY)
What got him?
HORTON
Just got old, sir.
BUSH
Yeah, well..
Bush returns to chopping wood.
Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.
HORTON
Mr. Starke told me that you and him
ran away from home when you were 6
years old. Is that true?
BUSH
I talked him into it.
Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.
HORTON
Well.. anyway.. I.. alright..
Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves.
Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying.
Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush, soaked to the bone
and shaking with chills, rummages through an old hat box by
lamp light: Letters, news clippings and keepsakes. He finds
what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.
She smiles at us from happier days. Realizing that he is
raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to
collapse back on the bed.
11 OMIT 11/12/13 11
Somehow he has made it. Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in
bad shape and knows it.
Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises.
Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing
snatches his first meal in days.
Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to
the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush
doesn't make it. Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto
a pile of hay near Mule.
BUSH
Always thought you'd go first..
White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running
out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness. Thoughts
tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark
waters of memory.
5.
Reverend Horton, stoking the wood stove, hears FOOTSTEPS.
HORTON
Buddy?
6.
But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around.
HORTON
Oh! Hello..
Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
critically looking around.
HORTON
What can I do for you, sir?
Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20's) enter from the
vestibule with their new BABY. In their own world, and not
realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks
some lint from Buddy's jacket. He catches her fingers and
kisses them.
Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.
BUSH
I can wait.
Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods
to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to
give Bush and Horton privacy.
HORTON
It's alright, have a seat.
Bush sits down uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew
in front of him and twists around to face him. The wintry
light from the near window washes over them.
HORTON
What's on your mind, sir?
BUSH
Bout time for me to get low.
HORTON
Get what?
BUSH
Down to business
Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of
MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge.
BUSH
Need a funeral.
Horton looks up from the money.
7.
HORTON
For who?
BUSH
Me.
Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as
hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.
HORTON
For you?
(off Bush's impatient nod)
You want to buy a funeral for you?
BUSH
Am I not talking right?
HORTON
No, yes, I'm sorry. Are you sick
sir?
BUSH
Everybody dies.
HORTON
True, but..
BUSH
I don't take care of my bones it
won't get done, will it?
HORTON
All right, I see. Well the church
can help you get your affairs in
order, arrange a service..
Horton glances at the strange wad of money again.
BUSH
What would you say?
HORTON
About what?
BUS H
Me.
HORTON
A eulogy? I.. don't know. What do
you want me to say?
8.
BUSH
Say what you'd say right now to my
face.
HORTON
Well. I uh, I don't know much about
you, Mr. Bush. I mean, I've heard
stories but..
BUSH
What stories?
Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like
everything in the world stops dead.
Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too.
HORTON
Just stories..
(off Bush's intense look)
.you know, people talking.
BUSH
What kind of stories? Say one.
HORTON
Sir.. my mother used to say that
gossip is the devil's radio..
(UNFORTUNATE ASIDE)
.not that she didn't play that
radio at full volume now and then,
bless her heart, but..
(back to business)
.what matters when you come to the
end of your life is that you're
ready for the next one. Have you
made peace with God, sir?
BUS H
I paid.
Horton has no idea what Bush means. He looks at the money,
back at Bush.
HORTON
Well.. you can't buy forgiveness,
Mr. Bush. It's free. But you do
have to ask for it.
BUSH
Nothing in this world is free,
preacher.
9.
Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out. His hand bangs
into the pew and the money FALLS.
Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops
back into the vestibule.
Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind.
An EMPTY CASKET, awaits its passenger in a small but
serviceable funeral hall. Through the office door, FRANK
QUINN sits at his desk, his head completely buried behind a
paper that he shakes hard every few seconds. His feet are up
on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks.
Frank's hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a
drawer when he HEARS the front door open. But his face
remains hidden as Buddy enters. Buddy is troubled by the
fight.
BUDDY
Frank?
(off Frank's grunt)
There was a fight. It was..
FRANK
.let me guess. Hmm. Carl?
BUDDY
Well yeah but this time it was with
that old man Bush.
FRANK
Old man?
(DISTANTLY HOPEFUL)
Is there a body?
BUDDY
No, the old man did the beating.
Never seen anything like it.
FRANK
Social event of the year and I
missed it.
Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no
southern accent and doesn't look small town.
13.
FRANK
Read the paper today?
(off Buddy's no)
Something strange is happening in
the world right now.
BUDDY
What?
FRANK
People are dying in bunches.
(off Buddy's look)
Everywhere. But here.
He puts the paper down and studies his socks.
FRANK
I wonder what the odds are of a
funeral home going broke? I mean
you have a business everybody on
earth needs, you can't make that
work, it's got to be you right? And
yet.. I don't know.. what do you do
when people won't die?
BUDDY
Well..
FRANK
Onethingabout Chicago, people
knowhowto die; they drown, get
runover,shot, whatever it takes.
BUDDY
We get it done down here, we're
just not in a hurry about it.
FRANK
It's them or us.
Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket.
BUDDY
(QUIETLY)
I might know someone who is looking
for a funeral.
Frank's eyes crawl over to him.
25 OMITTED 25
14.
The Quinn Funeral Home Packard Hearse makes it way down the
road. Frank drives as Buddy searches ahead.
FRANK
How much did he have?
BUDDY
It was all wadded up.
FRANK
Ooo, hermit money. That's good.
Buddy sees Bush's signs.
BUDDY
There it is..
They stop at Bush's sign: 'No Damn Trespassing." Frank
squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at
all. Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't.
BUDDY
What are you doing?
FRANK
You've been wanting a shot at
sales..
BUDDY
But..
FRANK
As of right now, you're on
commission.
(off Buddy's look)
Remember; foot in the door,
establish trust, and drop the
hammer.
Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.
BUDDY
I'd feel better if you'd go too.
15.
FRANK
No doubt but if you don't do this
by yourself, you won't know if
you're any good. And you'll never
be any good if you don't know you
are. Go get him!
The shack is spare as a monk's chamber but has wonderful HAND
MADE FURNITURE in it.
BUSH
Sit down.
There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off
a small stool under the window and sits down low. The wonder
of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes.
On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE
emerging from a block of wood.
17.
Bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit
pieces covered with bacon and white gravy.
BUSH
It's how you put things together,
see? Some things go, some things
never will. Indians said that
everything spoke to them. That's
how they made medicine and knew
what to eat. Things talked to them
clear as we talk. You believe that?
BUDDY
I.. I don't know, sir.
BUSH
If you don't listen you won't hear
nothing.
Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down.
Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the
table legs run right into the top without screws or nails.
BUDDY
Did you make this furniture, sir?
Never seen any like it. Can't even
tell what's holding it up.
BUSH
Magic.
Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious. The word lingers.
Finally..
BUDDY
Alright. Well. Sir, if you do want
to plan for a funeral service,
which I hope will be a long long
time away, we'd treat you with
respect and offer a good..
BUSH
What'd everybody say about what
happened in town?
BUDDY
I don't..
BUSH
That crazy old son of a bitch tried
to beat a man to death for no
reason? That it?
18.
Buddy is caught off guard by Bush's lucid candor and finds
himself automatically responding differently to him.
BUDDY
There's two sides to every story.
As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate..
BUSH
People say that. But they don't
mean it. They think what they think
and they don't want to know
anything else.
BUDDY
Yes, sir, but I think people are so
scared of what they don't know that
they make things up to feel better
about it.
BUSH
Like life after dying. Heaven.
BUDDY
(THINKS)
I hope that part's true, don't you?
(BEAT)
But I don't think we know the
actual truth about much of
anything. I know I don't. I'm just
guessing most of the time.
Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the
rabbit. Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes
a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise..
BUDDY
Lord, that's good..
BUS H
You boys been coming out here to
throw rocks through my window for
20-30 years.
BUDDY
I never..
BUSH
Ya'll know lots of stories about
me?
19.
BUDDY
(SQUIRMS)
Yes, sir, I guess, but..
BUSH
Tell one.
BUDDY
I'd rather not.
Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back.
BUSH
I rather you did.
BUDDY
(startled/leans back)
Well. When I was kid I heard you
killed some men in a fist fight.
BUSH
Is that all?
Bush leans back stone-faced.
In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and
long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes
him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole
through him.
BUS H
What's your name again?
BUDDY
Buddy Robinson, sir.
BUS H
Well, if I need you -- I know where
you are.
It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops
eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that
he's been dismissed.
Frank is looking a little hung over. Buddy walks in. Frank
points at the phone and rolls his blood shot eyes.
FRANK
.state law requires.. No ma'am, we
can't bury him under the house..
There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to get it.
Frank is still on the phone and pouring himself a drink from
the flask into his coffee cup in the drawer.
FRANK
Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of
natural things that aren't decent.
(listens, eyes widen)
He did what?! Good God. No, Ma'am,
I didn't know that about your
husband. Well, yeah now I
understand why you want him under
the house but still..
The phone goes dead. FRANK sighs as Bush walks in.
BUDDY
Frank Quinn, Mr. Bush.
Frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself,
then jumps up, smiling, and goes to Bush with his hand out.
FRANK
Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee?
As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking
everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath
his suit, his breath. Frank feels downright naked.
BUSH
You from anywhere?
FRANK
A little bit of everywhere, I
guess. Get him a chair, Buddy!
Buddy stands behind the waiting chair.
22.
Bush scrapes up a different chair. Frank goes behind the
desk. Buddy pulls up a chair.
Bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit
money and lays it on the desk. Frank does something
phenomenal. He ignores the money.
FRANK
How can we help you, sir?
Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who
steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money.
BUSH
I'm after a funeral.
FRANK
Boy, are you in luck.
(GETTING UP)
Follow me.
Frank and Buddy stand with Bush in a room dedicated to sales.
Three caskets are lined up for display. All tanks.
Bush steps up to a cheap cloth covered box, bangs it with his
knuckles, and scowls. Frank points to a wooden casket.
FRANK
Solid pecan, steel handles..
Bush eyes it, repulsed.
BUDDY
Mr. Bush is an amazing carpenter.
BUSH
Forget the box. What else?
FRANK
Whatever you want, flowers..
BUSH
No.
FRANK
Burial plot..
BUSH
Got it.
23.
FRANK
A service?
BUSH
Party.
FRANK
A what?
BUSH
A party.
BUDDY
What kind of party?
BUSH
Funeral party.
Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then
years of honed instincts surge back to life.
FRANK
We can do that.
As they come back into the office..
BUSH
And I want to be there.
Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit..
FRANK
You will be, I guarantee it.
BUSH
I want to be there now.
BUDDY
You want to be at your funeral..
party.. alive?
(off Bush's nod)
But.. it's not a funeral if you're
not, you know, deceased..
FRANK
Hold on now, it's a detail, we can
look at it.
BUDDY
Pretty big detail.
24.
Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush.
FRANK
So you'd like to have a funeral
party while you're alive so you can
go?
BUSH
Yes or no?
FRANK
Yes.
Buddy is lost.
FRANK
Buddy, get some paper. We need to
make of list of who Mr. Bush wants
to invite..
As Buddy starts to get up.
BUSH
Sit down.
Buddy sits right down.
BUSH
I want everybody to come who's got
a story to tell about me.
FRANK
Say again.
BUDDY
That probably covers 4 counties..
Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks
about how great an outdoor life would be.
BUSH
Then I want 4 counties worth of
people at the party.
FRANK
Well, sir, the thing is, how would
you get people to come and tell
stories about you that I'm guessing
might get them, you know.. shot?
Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out. Now all Frank
can see is the money, leaving.
25.
FRANK
You know what, you go ahead, don't
worry about it, we'll think of
something. A couple of ideas just
came to me.
BUDDY
Like what?
Buddy and Frank are peeking out the window. They see Mattie
standing alone as Bush walks away.
FRANK
How would she know him?
KATHRYN (O.S.)
It's none of our business.
FRANK
So? We got to know.
Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has
another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back.
FRANK
See the size of that thing?
BUDDY
What?
FRANK
What do you mean, what? Goddamn
ball of money! He wants a party
with pink balloons on his ears,
we're gonna give it to him.
BUDDY
But..
FRANK
I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever
made one December, in Chicago, with
wind blowing so hard up my ass I
was farting snow flakes in July so
don't tell me we can't do this.
BUDDY
But..
27.
FRANK
That's the last "but" I want to
hear out of you. You're a salesman
now, sell!
FRANK
(looking out again)
She called him Felix.
Frank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse.
They are together but in very different worlds. They don't
even look at each other when they talk.
Buddy is lost in serious thought.
Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast.
Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster
than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda
doesn't.
BUSH
It moves, don't it?
FRANK
(DISTRACTED)
This is nothing.
29.
BUSH
Fancy car for the dead.
FRANK
Didn't buy it for them.
BUDDY
(out of nowhere)
We say that funerals are "For the
Living" but we forget what that
means sometimes, I guess.
(to Bush but almost to
HIMSELF)
I was thinking about your funeral
party before I went to sleep last
night and I think I understand it a
little now. When I was a kid, my
folks where killed in a bad car
wreck and the people at the funeral
home... they did the impossible as
far as I was concerned. I don't
know what I would've done without
them. And I remember wishing that
my mother and daddy were there to
see how beautiful they made
everything.
Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush
glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the
world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it.
Frank and Buddy enter the store and find MR. FELDMAN and a
PHOTOGRAPHER setting up a large camera and backdrop. As they
turn to show Bush what is happening they see him go by the
window outside.
FRANK
Where's he going?
49 OMIT 49
30.
A barber's drape falls over BUSH who is seated in a chair.
Frank and Buddy rush in. The barber, an anxious Mr.
Tollerude, pumps Bush's chair upward.
FRANK
(TO BUSH)
I wish you wouldn't do that yet.
Bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to Mr.
Tollerude, a clear threat.
BUSH
Don't leave me naked.
FRANK
Mr. Bush, you can get all the hairs
cut you want after we take your
picture, I'll pay for it.
Mr. Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not.
BUSH
Why you want my picture made?
BUDDY
That's what we're trying to tell
you. We're gonna run an ad in some
papers about your party and put up
posters of you.
BUSH
And you want me to look like this?
FRANK
Yes.
BUSH
Why?
FRANK
Why?
BUDDY
It's how people recognize you, sir.
FRANK
And you want as many people to come
as possible so..
31.
BUSH
So a crazy old nutter draws more.
FRANK
Basically. Don't you think?
BUSH
Do you ever say what you mean?
Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor.
Bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge,
a swan, and a pond. The Photographer is trying to tidy up
Bush without offending him. As he walks back to camera, Bush
roughs himself up and looks truly wild.
Buddy snickers. When the Photographer gets back to the
camera, he cocks his head, what?!
FRANK
Take it.
(leans in to Buddy)
I'd go see that.
Mr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his
reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror.
Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment.
It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks
into his own eyes.
Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him.
BUDDY
(GENUINELY SURPRISED)
Damn. You look pretty good..
Bush suddenly gets up and nods at Frank.
BUSH
He's paying.
As Bush blows out the door, Mr. Tollerude leans against the
chair with relief.
32.
Bush stands in front of a full length mirror. He has on a
decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white
shirt, open at the collar. It is a startling change. But we
still can't tell what he is thinking.
Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief.
Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price
for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush.
FRANK
Son of a bitch, it's almost worth
it.
BUSH
(TO BUDDY)
What do you think?
BUDDY
I wouldn't know you, sir.
BUSH
Maybe the Devil won't either. Might
work out.
(TO FRANK)
Where's the shoes?
FRANK
Well, normally people don't wear
shoes in a casket so..
(off Bush's scowl)
.what are you, about a 10D?
Buddy stands beside Frank who is still trying to get a deal
on the clothes. Bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two
new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard
look, and walks away. Frank looks down at the clothes, over
at Buddy.
FRANK
Pretty optimistic taking a change
of clothes to the grave.
(calls over his shoulder)
How you set for underwear?
BUSH (O.S.)
Don't wear none.
33.
FRANK
One question too many.
55 OMIT 55
Everyone is back in the hearse. Something is eating at Frank.
FRANK
I don't mean to be nosey but uh..
how do you know Mattie?
BUSH
She's a peach.
Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead.
BUSH
We had a go.
Frank nearly drives off the road.
Late night Poker. Cigarette smoke drifts into the air.
Frank, Carl, Rev. Horton, Mattie, and RAY, a banker, are at
the table. Ray has the untouchable presence of someone
privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree
tonight. Horton gathers up his winnings.
HORTON
"The Lord loves a cheerful giver.."
MATTIE
Oh please.. you think the Lord's
taking sides in a poker game in a
funeral home?
Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence.
FRANK
If He is, the Divine's cheating.
RAY
Exactly.
FRANK
Don't agree with me Ray, it makes
me doubt myself.
34.
Ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails.
RAY
I would have turned down your loan
if you were my own dear mother,
Frank.
FRANK
You made my point and don't even
know it.
MATTIE
Jesus, would you two stop it!
You're worse than two old women..
Ray shrugs, sweetly blase. Frank tries to rein in his temper
for her. The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who
has only a couple of dollars left.
CARL
(TO FRANK)
What were you doing with that old
bastard in town today, anyway?
RAY
Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting
him a haircut..on credit.
Frank shoots him a look.
HORTON
Took out ads in a bunch of papers
too, something about a party?
FRANK
God, I love small towns.
MATTIE
Who are you talking about?
RAY
That hermit, what's his name..
FRANK
(a knowing look at Mattie)
"Felix" Bush.
MATTIE
You're giving him a party?
FRANK
A funeral party.
35.
MATTIE
Whatever you're drinking is not
being good to you at all.
CARL
What the hell is a funeral party?
FRANK
Hey, the man wants to be at his own
funeral. What can I say? I'd like
to be at my funeral so I could tell
my ex-wife to kiss my..
MATTIE
What makes you think she'd show up
for you?
FRANK
Because, Dear, vultures are
constitutionally unable to ignore
the dead.
Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end.
Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank.
HORTON
It's that big wad of money of his
you're after.
There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide.
RAY
What money is that?
MATTIE
Felix has money?
Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards.
HORTON
He came to see me, wanting a
funeral, had a big old greasy ball
of money. Talked like he thought he
could buy his way to heaven with
it.
RAY
(SERIOUSLY)
How much has he got? Maybe he can.
Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
suddenly truly concerned.
36.
MATTIE
Is he sick, Gus?
Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it.
Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat.
CARL
I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't
nobody gonna go to a funeral for
that son of a bitch.
Mattie gives Carl a look
HORTON
Language..
FRANK
They might. He's inviting everyone
who has a story about him to come.
You could tell about him kicking
your ass, Carl.
Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.
RAY
Old man is going to ride the Weird
Train right into the ground, isn't
he?
FRANK
Wouldn't you like to know what
everybody says about you behind
your back, Ray?
(off his look)
Yeah, probably not.
HORTON
I already know way more about
people than I need to.
MATTIE
Or want to.
HORTON
Amen.
FRANK
Let's play some cards.
37.
RAY
Oh for God's sake, face it Frank,
you're broke.
This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to
embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes
on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off.
RAY
Please. I've won that 4 times
already.
FRANK
It's who has it last that counts.
CARL
Say what you want but if there
hadn't been anybody there the other
day he would've killed me. And I
guarantee you it wouldn't have been
his first time.
It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie.
MATTIE
Everybody knows you started it.
(off his glare)
Don't look at me like that. I
remember when you were born. You
were the sweetest little boy. What
is wrong with you?
Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a
better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but..
CARL
I made a mistake. But there's a
line.. and he crossed it.. and
everybody knows that too. Ya'll go
on and have a party with the devil
for his money but I'll dance on his
grave someday.
Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out.
HORTON
You kind of hate to admit it when
it comes to Carl but he's got a
point. You don't know what Bush is
doing. What if he just wants to get
everybody in one place so he can
turn his shotgun on them?
38.
MATTIE
He wouldn't..
HORTON
I looked in his eyes. The truth is
nobody knows what he's capable of.
Maybe even he doesn't know.
She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards.
RAY
Go ahead and lay your watch down,
Frank. But I am going to keep it
this time, alright, on principle.
FRANK
I got an idea. Let's try something
different.
(TO RAY)
The cards in your sock? Leave'em
there.
Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head.
RAY
What are you trying to pull now?
FRANK
You really think you're that good
that nobody sees?
RAY
Sees what?
FRANK
You cheat at everything you do.
Even at the bank, you loan people
just enough to get'em deeper in so
you can foreclose on them.
RAY
You are a pathetic man. And a
goddamn..
FRANK
Am I? Then stand up and roll down
your socks.
(a deep dark look)
Stand up or I'll stand you up.
Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is
irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair
scraping the floor makes him jerk up.
39
He walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and
failing. Everyone sits in uneasy silence.
Horton waves and walks out, leaving the door open. Frank
walks Mattie to the door, helping with her coat, trying to
work up his nerve to say..
FRANK
I'll walk you home.
MATTIE
No. Thank you.
FRANK
(HURT)
You sure?
(off her firm nod)
You're not going to play anymore,
are you?
MATTIE
Oh, I don't know. Thank you for
inviting me though.
FRANK
I'm sorry about the..we don't
always fight, okay, we do, but he's
had that coming for..
MATTIE
It's not that. I just..(trails off)
FRANK
You came because you don't know
what to do with yourself.
(off her look)
I slept on the same side of the bed
my whole life, right? But after my
wife left me, I switched sides,
just like that, and never been able
to go back.
MATTIE
When someone you love is gone, you
can pour everything, even a
lifetime of things into the place
where they were but it's still
always empty.
40.
He sees that her thoughts are not with him at all but a
million miles away. She hardly glances up when she says..
MATTIE
'Night.
He stares after her, wishing that she could see him the way
he sees her.
59 OMIT 59
Dim lamp light glows. We see Bush sitting on the edge of the
bed wiping the sweat from his face with a sheet. He looks up
at the picture of the beautiful woman.
Buddy sits in the dark, rocking his son who is asleep. A
small lamp casts a shadow across them. Kathryn comes in.
KATHRYN
I didn't hear him wake up.
BUDDY
He didn't.
KATHRYN
(KNEELING DOWN)
Everything's all right, hon.
BUDDY
I'm glad you don't know how quick
it can change.
She gently kisses his arm and the baby's head. Buddy looks at
her, haunted by the very possibility of their absence.
A tiny PLACE, cramped with radio gear.
Buddy and Frank peer through a glass window into a small
control booth.(We will cut back and forth between the glass)
Buddy is having misgivings about being here. But Frank gives
the thumbs up to the young WCGM ANNOUNCER in the booth, a
hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big-time.
The Announcer hands Bush a set of headphones. Bush is wearing
his new clothes and truly looks like a different man.
Bush is puzzled by the headset. The kid takes it and clamps
it onto Bush's head. He starts to yank them off then hears a
song playing inside his head and loves it. But now the
announcer cuts the record off and Bush scowls.
ANNOUNCER
Friends, we have a treat for you
today on WCGM. Our special guest is
going to tell us about an event
that everyone is talking about. And
here he is, Mr. Felix Bush, the
mysterious hermit of Caleb County!
How are you today, sir?
BUSH
I am.
Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice.
ANNOUNCER
So tell us, sir, exactly how did
you come up with the idea of having
a funeral party before you die?
BUSH
I dreamed it.
42.
ANNOUNCER
Really?
BUSH
Why would I make that up?
Two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet.
ANNOUNCER
Okay. Now I have to say that you
don't look quite like you do on the
posters.
BUSH
I got pruned.
ANNOUNCER
Well, you're a bit of a local
legend, sir. I was a little nervous
about our interview. I've heard
some pretty wild stories..
BUSH
Like what?
ANNOUNCER
Well uh, just.. from what I
understand, you want everyone who
has a story about you to come and
tell it. Is that right?
BUSH
You come and tell yours.
ANNOUNCER
Thank you. Now how long have you
been living out there by yourself?
Mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and
arranging them in a vase.
BUSH (O.S.)
40 some years.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
40 years with nobody to talk to?
BUSH (O.S.)
First 38 are the hardest.
43.
Mattie grins.
ANNOUNCER
But why would you do that, Mr.
Bush, shut yourself off like that?
Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear.
BUSH
Come to the funeral and maybe
you'll find out.
ANNOUNCER
You heard it here on WCGM, folks,
find out the answer to the mystery
February 16..
BUSH
One more thing, boy.
FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this?
Mattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice.
BUSH (O.S.)
Gonna be a drawing.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
What kind of drawing, sir?
BUSH
You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day
of the funeral we draw names. Then
when I die, the winner gets my
place, 300 acres of timber that
hasn't been touched in 40 years.
Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower.
Dead air. The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush.
ANNOUNCER
For 5 dollars?
44.
BUSH
Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home.
Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost
yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad.
ANNOUNCER
You heard him! If you want a chance
to win 300 acres of virgin timber
worth thousands and thousands of
dollars, send 5 dollars along with
your name and address to..
(off Frank waving and
pointing to himself)
Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home.
As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time
with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth.
FRANK
(TO BUSH)
I could almost kiss you on the
mouth!
ANNOUNCER
I'll take a ticket.
BUDDY
You're betting on a man dying..
ANNOUNCER
I didn't mean it like..
FRANK
Hey, it's his idea!
They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking
at it like he wants to take it home.
FRANK
It's what you want, right?
BUSH
(TO BUDDY)
Buy a ticket, son.
Mattie puts the vase of flowers on table with a group of
family photographs. The picture beside the vase is the SAME
PHOTOGRAPH of the beautiful woman that Bush has. Is it
Mattie? It looks a little like her.
45.
INSERT PHOTO: The BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN stares at us as we
PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are now looking at the identical
photo tacked to Bush's wall.
69 OMIT 69
They enter the dark room together. Bush lights a lantern,
gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her. She sits
and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and
put a log on the fire. She notices the beautiful table.
MATTIE
You always were good with your
hands.
He puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down.
BUSH
You still play the piano?
MATTIE
I teach a few girls.
BUSH
I got a good feeling when you
played. Remember that time you was
playing and the lamp burned out?
And you went right on in the dark?
I hear that song sometimes at
night.
She shrugs shyly and sips the tea. Seconds tick by.
MATTIE
Sure is quiet out here.
BUSH
(cocks his head)
What?
MATTIE
I said it's..
(stops/gets the joke)
I tried to write you at times but I
didn't know what to say.
BUSH
Well. I heard you married.
MATTIE
He was a Doctor; a real good man.
We lived in St. Louis for awhile.
He died unexpectedly about a year
ago. I came back here because.. I
have no idea why.
(sips tea/thinks)
(MORE)
49
MATTIE (CONT'D)
The list of people who are gone is
getting longer and longer and
sometimes I feel like all I'm doing
is waiting for my name to come up.
BUSH
You have a tender heart, always
did.
She gives him a curious look.
BUSH
You can't wait for anything,
Mattie. Close your eyes, hold your
breath.. stay in one spot your
whole life, but you're still
moving, like the world's moving
under you. There's no waiting.
MATTIE
And there's no getting over some
things either, is there?
BUSH
Reckon not, Little Bit.
MATTIE
Little Bit?! Oh my God, nobody's
called me that in..
But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong
ropes. She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush's bed.
Bush is stricken and white. He would stop her if he could but
it is too late.
She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp
light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will
disappear if she blinks.
Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured
mask. A strangled sob escapes her.
He gets up and stands there staring at the floor.
Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out
the door. Her shadow merges with the darkness. Bush stands
with his head down, staring into oblivion.

76 OMITTED 76
Buddy comes in frowning and lugging a heavy mail sack. What
the hell? He looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk.
Frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks
and each one has 5 dollars in it! Buddy looks down and sees
even more mail sacks on the floor!
FRANK
Jesus, kid!
BUDDY
Yeah! But, but it's not our money.
FRANK
Well yeah, no, but some of it's
gonna be! We're putting this thing
on!
Frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down
to the floor. He's beside himself. Buddy eyes him warily.
BUDDY
He should be here. I'm gonna go get
him.
They lock eyes. Frank finally tosses him the hearse keys.
79 OMITTED 79
Buddy, Frank, and Bush are staring reverently at the money
stacked across the desk and the full paper sacks all around
the desk. Bush eyes Buddy who is still quiet.
51.
FRANK
I don't know exactly how much your
land's worth but looks to me like
you could get maybe 10 times that
or more. I don't know what to do
with it. I mean it's yours to do
with what you want but I'm getting
a little nervous about it. Never
thought I'd see enough money to
make me nervous. We should probably
talk about the price for
everything, the clothes, the ads,
the food and drink for the party,
the music.. our fee for everything,
we'll be fair about that, I'm not
worried about it.
Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room.
BUSH
What do you think, boy?
Buddy jerks, looks at Frank, at Bush.
BUDDY
Money makes people do funny things.
Frank scowls.
BUDDY
I think you should probably put it
in the bank, sir.
FRANK
No! Ray is not..
(off Bush's look)
I mean, if it was my money I'd put
it in a bank out of town so
everyone didn't know my business.
This bank here, you can't trust,
that's all I'm saying.
BUSH
Can I trust you?
FRANK
Every name, every dollar, is right
there!
BUSH
Not what I asked.
52.
FRANK
I've done a hell of a job for you.
I don't see why..
BUDDY
Mr. Bush, I didn't mean to imply..
BUSH
Hush.
FRANK
I've sold horses, cars, houses,
hell, pocket watches pinned to the
inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed
of it. I don't rob banks, don't
cheat at cards, and I sleep all
right the nights I sleep. What was
the question..?
BUSH
They goddamn..
He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the "other" Bush.
BUSH
Take out for the expenses you've
already had and give me the
receipts. As the bills come in for
things, give them to me and I'll
pay them. Put this money in a box
and the boy and I'll take it
someplace in the morning. Whatever
new comes in, keep it in the bottom
of one of them ugly caskets in
there 'till I come get it. After
the party, name a fair price for
what you've done and we'll settle
up.
(WALKING OUT)
I'll be at the car.
After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other.
FRANK
Is it just me or is he extremely
fucking articulate when he wants to
be?
BUDDY
I don't know who's selling who what
anymore.
53.
FRANK
It's not clear, is it?
BUDDY
Not only that but something feels
really wrong.
FRANK
Hold on. I told you that you were
working on commission..
BUDDY
Yeah, but..
FRANK
So whatever our end of this is, you
get a piece.
BUDDY
A piece?
FRANK
Half. It could help set you up,
Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is
gonna feel right pretty damn
quick,okay? We just have to close
it out. From here on, watch me, do
what I do, and we'll be fine.
BUDDY
But..
FRANK
He wants you to go with him to take
this money somewhere which means
that it's you he trusts. And that's
fine because I trust you too. Just
don't trust him, okay?
BUDDY
I'm lost again.
FRANK
Look, that funny feeling you have..
I have it too. And it's not funny.
So go along, be friendly, but
that's it.
(BEAT)
There's a euphoria that comes with
closing a deal, Buddy, and the
bigger the deal, the higher you
get. It's better than anything.
(MORE)
54
FRANK (CONT'D)
But the critical time is just
before it closes. It's like a
witching hour and everything tries
to come apart. We're not going to
let that happen.
BUDDY
All right.
FRANK
Now go.
(as Buddy starts out)
You know.. I always wondered why
you wanted to work here. I thought
you could do a lot better.
(off Buddy's look back)
I didn't know about your folks, I'm
really sorry.
BUDDY
Thank you.
He goes on.
Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills,
hungrily entranced.
Buddy's son is crying his heart out. Kathryn comes in
unbuttoning her blouse, picks him up, sits down, slips her
blouse off her shoulder, brings the boy to her breast and
voila, his sorrow miraculously vanishes.
Buddy appears in the doorway, his eyes soft with love.
BUDDY
I might have a crying fit coming on
too.
KATHRYN
Is that right?
BUDDY
Feeling a little weepy.
KATHRYN
You boys..
BUDDY
(leans against door frame)
I can maybe do something really
good for us, Katy.
55.
KATHRYN
You already have.
BUDDY
I mean, money wise.
KATHRYN
About Mr. Bush?
BUDDY
Yeah. I'm getting half of whatever
we make off of him.
KATHRYN
So why aren't you happy about it?
BUDDY
Didn't know I wasn't.
(off her look)
I was happy for a minute. And then
the whole thing of making a
carnival out of a person's death, I
don't know if it's right.
KATHRYN
Is it what he wants?
BUDDY
He says it is.
KATHRYN
You are not responsible for what
other people do, Buddy, just you.
BUDDY
You're right. You're always right.
KATHRYN
At least I am when I'm half naked.
BUDDY
Right.
A very determined little GIRL is working her way through a
song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form, even
to her.
Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not
really listening. On the table beside the piano is a stack of
picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles.
56.
83 EXT/INT BUSH'S SHACK/HEARSE - MORNING 83
Sitting in the hearse outside of Bush's shack, Buddy watches
Bush get in the car with his shotgun. There is a big wooden
box of money on the seat between them. Bush props his shotgun
against it.
BUDDY
Where to, sir?
BUSH
North.
BUDDY
(starting the hearse)
How far?
BUSH
Till I say, son.
Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree-
lined path.
Buddy looks out at the highway. He is driving slow. Bush is
leaning against the money, thinking.
BUDDY
How much further now?
Bush waves him on. Buddy scowls then decides to get serious
about this. He presses on the accelerator and the hearse
takes off down the highway.
Frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes. The phone is
ringing off the hook, there are full sacks around him, and
some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front
window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds.
57.
Mattie leans against the door with her eyes closed. There is
no student at the piano.
89 OMITTED 89/90 89
Close on Bush and Buddy.
BUSH
Don't say nothing.
BUDDY
To who?
BUSH
You can say "hi".
Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out.
Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back
over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church.
93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93
sanctuary.
Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door
behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window
at the driveway, and then at Buddy.
BUDDY
Hi.
CHARLIE
Hello.
Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances
at the door but Bush is not coming in.
59.
BUDDY
Hi.
Charlie holds out his hand, Buddy shakes it.
CHARLIE
Are you sure you're in the right
place? Not expecting a funeral.
Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie squints over
then stares at Bush with utter disbelief.
CHARLIE
Felix?!
BUSH
Hey, Charlie.
They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush
would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the church rafters.
BUSH
Still standing.
CHARLIE
Yes.
Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy
again.
CHARLIE
Reverend Charlie Jackson.
BUDDY
Hi!
BUSH
That's Buddy Robinson, he don't
talk much.
CHARLIE
Someone better talk. A ghost pulls
up in the driveway in a hearse, you
expect a little bit of a story.
Bush, Buddy and Charlie, sit in pews near a lovely altar.
60.
CHARLIE
My hearing is not what it was. It
sounded like you said you want me
to preach at your funeral party
with you sitting there?
BUSH
Yes, sir.
CHARLIE
(shaking his head)
You know I've talked to God a lot
about you over the years and he
said he broke the mould when he
made you. Said you were sure
entertaining to watch but way too
much trouble.
Buddy grins.
BUSH
Well.
CHARLIE
What would you want me to say at
this funeral?
BUSH
Whatever you want to, Charlie.
CHARLIE
(TO BUDDY)
Could you give us a minute?
Buddy starts to get up.
BUSH
Sit still.
Buddy plops back down.
CHARLIE
What's the matter? You scared to be
alone with me?
BUSH
He can hear what's said.
Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie.
CHARLIE
All right. After you left here..
did you do the right thing?
61.
Felix looks up at the beautifully crafted pulpit.
BUSH
I did.. what I thought was right.
CHARLIE
You confessed? Asked forgiveness?
Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw.
CHARLIE
Did you tell her, Felix?
Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head.
CHARLIE
You came a long way for nothing
then.
Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot.
Buddy tenses.
BUSH
You self-righteous..
CHARLIE
Don't you dare..
BUSH
I built my own jail and put myself
in it! And I stayed in it for 40
goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no
friends! That's not enough?
CHARLIE
You know it isn't.
BUSH
(tears welling up)
Well. Why don't you come and say
that then, Charlie? Hell, say it
all! I don't care.
CHARLIE
Not on your life.
The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets
up and leaves. Buddy starts to follow. Charlie puts his hand
on him to stay. They sit in silence a moment.
CHARLIE
How much do you know about him?
62.
BUDDY
Almost nothing, sir. I just work at
the funeral home.
CHARLIE
Do you know he built this church?
BUDDY
No?!
(LOOKING AROUND)
How's a man like him make something
like this? I mean, I know he's a
good carpenter but this is..
CHARLIE
Magic?
(off Buddy's look)
Maybe it's the best of him, maybe
he put his soul into it, I don't
know.
BUDDY
What ya'll were talking about..
what did he do? Who was he supposed
to tell?
CHARLIE
(THINKS)
For him and God to know I guess. I
wish I'd never been put between
them, that's for sure.
(BEAT)
I will tell you that he showed up
here half dead. I had just started
preaching. Over the next 4 years we
built this.
BUDDY
Are you coming to the funeral?
Charlie sighs and looks around.
94A Omitted 94A
Buddy and Bush are both lost in thought. Finally..
BUDDY
Can I ask you something?
63.
BUSH
Do you have to?
BUDDY
Yes. What are we doing? Since the
day you came into the funeral home,
I don't think anything has happened
that you didn't want to happen. I
just don't know where it's going.
BUSH
There's a whole lot of things that
you don't know. Like what a dog
dreams. You can make up a story
about him chasing rabbits but you
don't know if there's rabbits in
there or not. And he can't tell
you, can he?
BUDDY
Not unless he's a very special dog.
They snort together.
BUSH
People don't say what they mean
either so you don't really know any
more about them then you do about
that dog's dream.
BUDDY
But what..?
BUSH
(LOOKING AWAY)
That time you left my house I saw
you stop and look back. You wanted
to know what could make somebody
like me.
(off Buddy's uneasy look)
Well here you are, son, here you
are.
Frank is putting money into a casket. He checks his watch.
FRANK
(MUTTERS)
Where are you..?
Lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go out.
64.
Buddy looks tired. Bush is sitting up ramrod straight,
thinking hard about something.
BUDDY
I better stop and tell Frank we're
back. He's probably had 2 or 3
hissy fits by now.
(looks out at the rain)
Why don't you stay the night at the
house and I'll take you home in the
morning?
The simple kindness seems to short Bush out. Buddy doesn't
notice, he's still looking ahead.
BUSH
Well, I... I ain't stayed with
nobody in a.. in a long while.
BUDDY
It's fine if you want to.
Bush looks as if he might say yes but he NOTICES where the
car is passing through and..
BUSH
Let me out.
BUDDY
What?
BUSH
Stop the car.
Bush starts to open the door. Buddy stops abruptly.
BUDDY
You can't walk. It's too far..
Bush climbs out with his shotgun.
BUSH
Put the money in a casket.
65.
BUDDY
You might as well get back in, I'll
follow you all the way.
BUSH
(snaps the gun closed)
Get the hell out of here, boy!
Buddy's eyes are defiant. Bush slams the door and walks away,
crossing over a fence and out into a dark field.
BUDDY
Not responsible. Not responsible.
Shit.
He slams the steering wheel.
99 OMITTED 99
100 OMITTED 100
Buddy is putting the money into the foot of a casket. A lit
candelabra sits nearby. There is NOISE, like the muted sound
of something breaking. Buddy jerks and listens.
BUDDY
Frank? Hello? Mr. Bush?
He stuffs the money into the casket, grabs the candelabra,
comes back, seals the lid, and starts into the office.
Frank enters with a flashlight. He sees that his desk and
files have been ransacked. He rushes into the casket room.
Several caskets have been thrown to the floor. He goes to the
one where the money is, finds that it is sealed tight, and
sighs with relief. Hearing something he whips the light
around and sees Buddy on the floor.
Frank examines a cut and bump on top of Buddy's head by
flashlight and dabs it gently with a cloth.
FRANK
The cut's not bad but how's the
head?
He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes.
FRANK
Follow it.
He looks him over carefully. He's had experience.
FRANK
Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous?
(off Buddy's no)
You'll be okay. Did you see who it
was?
BUDDY
No. I was putting the money in..
heard glass breaking.. locked up
the casket quick and.. boom..
FRANK
You did good.
BUDDY
Doesn't feel good.
Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil
lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up,
warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door..
67.
Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking
wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back
reflexively. He looks into her.
BUSH
Please, Ma'am.
Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering.
Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the
carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope,
and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls
out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the
bed, and walks out.
Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush
comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose.
Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire.
Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow
flowers on the table nearby.
BUSH
Thank you.
MATTIE
What are you doing here?
Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and
moves away.
BUSH
Can I sit a minute?
She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing
behind the other chair.
He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside.
BUSH
You want to know why I have your
sister's picture on my wall?
68.
MATTIE
I'm not stupid, Felix. No, I take
that back. How long was it going
on? She was already married when I
met you. Were you just making up to
me to get to her?
Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle.
MATTIE
If you're not going to talk, leave.
BUSH
Can you help who you love?
Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that
question many times.
BUSH
I've had 40 years to think about it
and I still don't know.
MATTIE
I don't know either, so..
Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her.
BUSH
I want to tell you how it was. If
you don't want me to, I'll go.
Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around
and sits down.
MATTIE
Don't lie to me. When did you take
up with her?
BUSH
I came to see you and she was
there, hanging clothes on the line
with your mama.
Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what
he is looking at..
BUSH
She turned around..
(as Mattie turns back)
.and.. I promise you that I did
not know that I had a heart till
right then.
69.
Tears well up in Mattie's eyes.
BUSH
You were a fine fine girl. I didn't
know why you wanted anything to do
with me but I was gonna keep coming
to see you 'till my luck ran out.
(BEAT)
And then I saw her.
MATTIE
She was married! And she wasn't
just my sister, she was my best
friend. We told each other
everything. I can't.. how long did
it go on?!
Bush's face is so white it looks like a death mask.
MATTIE
How long?
BUSH
It's still going on, Little Bit.
Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it
touches her in way that she is not prepared for. They sit
there in silence. She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.
MATTIE
Did you have anything to do with
her death?
The mug trembles. She sees it.
MATTIE
Tell me.
Like a fish jerked from the water, he mouth opens and closes,
but nothing comes out.
MATTIE (CONT'D)
Felix!
(off his haunted silence)
Get out of my house! NOW!
Bush stands up quickly and starts for the door.
MATTIE
And go to hell!
BUSH
Been there.
70.
He staggers, tries to catch himself but slides down against
the wall.
Despite her anger, Mattie starts toward him.
Bush sits on the floor, pale as moonlight. Mattie is beside
him with a stethoscope in her lap.
MATTIE
You need to see a doctor..
He raises his eyes to her but says nothing. They look into
each other for a long moment.
MATTIE
Just tell me, Felix. Did you hurt
Mary or not?
Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his
shotgun and goes out the door without a word.
Frank is putting the files back in the drawers when he hears
a NOISE. He reaches into the drawer and turns with a pistol
in his hand.
Bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun.
FRANK
What the hell?!
Bush glances at the pistol, at the open drawers of the
cabinet and desk.
BUSH
They get it?
FRANK
No. Buddy sealed it up in a casket.
Took a crack on the head, but..
BUSH
(cold dark look)
Is he all right?
FRANK
Yeah.
71.
BUSH
You sure?
FRANK
I was an army medic. He'll be fine.
But Bush is still dark.
FRANK
But you ought to take those clothes
back and get something in your
size.
BUSH
They get the whiskey?
Frank sits with his feet on the desk. Bush sits across from
him. They each have a cup of whiskey.
FRANK
Brought the money back, huh?
(off Bush's absent nod)
Listen, I've been thinking.. What
if we had the party at your place?
People are going to want to see the
land they're getting so..
BUSH
Don't know.
FRANK
Well, think about it, we could..
BUSH
Don't know that I'm doing it.
FRANK
What?!
BUSH
Thinking to call it off.
FRANK
You can't!
BUSH
Damn well can if I want to.
FRANK
No no no, it's in motion!
72.
BUSH
If I say no, it's no. Send the
money back.
FRANK
You're killing me! I bought things,
hired people.. promised money,
everybody in town is hoping to..
BUSH
I care about this town as much as
they care about me.
FRANK
It's what you said you wanted and
I've busted my ass for you. So why
don't you want it anymore? You owe
me that.
BUSH
(LONG BEAT)
It was the end of the line, tell it
all, get out of jail party. But I
guess I ain't got the goddamn guts
to open my own mouth and I can't
get nobody to talk for me so the
hell with it. And to hell with me.
Bush grabs his shotgun and goes. Frank sits, stunned.
Buddy sits at the breakfast table, holding his son. He opens
and closes his eyes, checking out his vision. Kathryn, at the
stove, sees him out of the corner of her eye.
KATHRYN
Are you having trouble seeing?
BUDDY
I see you're mad.
KATHRYN
I'm not mad. I'm concerned
She shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him.
BUDDY
(SQUINTS UP)
No, you're mad.
She tenderly touches his head.
73.
KATHRYN
If I could get my hands on whoever
did this, you'd see mad.
FRANK (O.S.)
Buddy! You up?!
Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a
chair, pulls on the baby's toe, and looks at Buddy.
FRANK
Trouble.
BUDDY
What's the matter?
FRANK
Bush is pulling out.
BUDDY
What?
FRANK
What happened yesterday?
BUDDY
I told you, we went up to Illinois
and met a preacher.
FRANK
But what happened?
BUDDY
He asked the preacher to come to
the funeral. He said no.
FRANK
Son of a bitch, that's got to be..
(TO KATHRYN)
Sorry.
(to the baby)
Sorry. Where's the preacher?
BUDDY
It won't do you any good.
FRANK
Why not?
BUDDY
He knows something about Bush,
something bad, I think.
74.
FRANK
What is it?
BUDDY
Wouldn't say but..
FRANK
Well if Bush wants him, by God,
Bush is gonna get him.
KATHRYN
(slams the skillet down)
You want eggs, Frank, or will the
skillet do?
FRANK
What? What's wrong?
KATHRYN
What's wrong? My husband has his
head bashed in and all you care
about is this party!
FRANK
It's not like that, Katie, this is
for all of us. You're like.. family
to me.. I..
KATHRYN
This is not how family acts!
FRANK
Well, I'm sorry. I've never had any
practice.
(gets up/to Buddy)
You okay?
Buddy nods. Frank leaves. Buddy mutters to the baby..
BUDDY
Stay out of her way today, partner.
Buddy is surrounded by bags. He is copying down names onto
raffle tickets and putting them in bin for the drawing. There
is a MAN standing guard by the front door with a rifle.
Mule stands with his ears back, upset. Bush, back in his old
clothes, is angrily planing a board. The box of his casket
minus the lid is on sawhorses behind him.
119 OMITTED 119
A blurred image becomes clear as a magnifying glass lowers
to a page of a stamp collection book. Fingers fill an empty
space with a prized addition. A LOUD KNOCKING startles him
and the stamp is placed slightly crooked..
Reveal Charlie Jackson scowling at the crooked stamp. He gets
up, does a double-take out the window. MORE LOUD KNOCKING.
Charlie opens the door, sees Frank standing there. The hearse
is parked outside.
FRANK
Reverend Jackson?
(Charlie looks at hearse)
Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home.
CHARLIE
How'd you find me?
Frank just smiles, takes off his hat, and offers his hand.
Charlie gives him a long look and reluctantly motions him in.
76.
Frank enters, noting the clean simple home of man with an
orderly mind. Charlie motions for Frank to sit down.
CHARLIE
I was going to play some dominos
this afternoon. But something told
me to stay home. I should have
played dominos. Is he out there?
FRANK
Bush? No, sir.
CHARLIE
You sure?
FRANK
Pretty sure.
CHARLIE
Did you check the back?
Frank snorts, liking Charlie immediately.
FRANK
You told Bush that you wouldn't
come to the funeral?
CHARLIE
If he got that, why are you here?
FRANK
To help you rethink it.
CHARLIE
I don't need any help.
FRANK
Have you rethought it?
(off Charlie's look)
So there is a need.
(BEAT)
First off, Bush doesn't know I'm
here.
77.
CHARLIE
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
(off Frank's look)
He's got a way of making people do
what he wants them to.
Frank squirms, knows it true.
CHARLIE
Is he really a hermit?
Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat.
Charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man.
FRANK
He came to see me after he'd been
here, wants to call the party off.
CHARLIE
I don't care.
FRANK
Said he'd meant it to be a.. end of
the line, tell it all, get out of
jail funeral but that he didn't
have the guts to open his mouth and
he couldn't get anybody to talk for
him. You know anything about that
part?
(off Charlie's sigh)
At first he said he wanted
everybody to come who had a story
about him. But he didn't want to
hear their bullshit stories, did
he? Pardon my language. He wants to
tell one, doesn't he?
78.
CHARLIE
About time.
FRANKFRANK
Whatever he did, it's been locked
up in him for 40 years and he can't
get it out.
(off Charlie's look)
I think he told you. You may be the
only person he told. And now he
wants you to tell it for him.
CHARLIE
Because he won't.
FRANK
Or can't.
CHARLIE
Or won't.
FRANK
Or can't.
(BEAT)
At least he wants the truth to come
out, give him that.
CHARLIE
(LONG STARE)
I'll think about it.
FRANK
Is there a boarding house around
here?
CHARLIE
I said I'd think.
FRANK
Yeah but if you're not coming, I'm
not going back. I made promises I
can't keep to people I care about.
This falls apart they won't blame
Bush. Bank will take my business..
If I'm gonna have to start over
again, might as well be from here.
Charlie scowls at him.
79.
Using a tool, Buddy unseals the casket to put the new money
in it and discovers that the rest of the money is gone? He
can't believe it. He yanks back the casket bed lining..
123 OMITTED 123
Bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket. It is
leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all
over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles
up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's
not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his
forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top
down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down
to the ground, and stares at the casket. Is this it?
Frank is lying in the back of the hearse, his head propped up
on an old suitcase. He sips from his flask and stares out the
window, thinking.
Bush is still on the ground propped against the ladder. His
eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face
that is as still as it can be. The sawdust makes him look
almost wooden. A shadow crosses then comes closer.
Buddy is sure he is dead but Bush's eyes open.
BUDDY
What are you doing, sir?
BUSH
Getting a suntan.
Bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder.
80.
BUDDY
Are you stuck?
BUSH
You have no goddamn idea how right
you are, son.
Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off.
BUSH
I'll sit here a minute.
Bush looks at the butterfly bandage on Buddy's head.
BUSH
We're a pair, ain't we?
BUDDY
Are you sick?
BUSH
Just going through the motions.
BUDDY
What does that mean?
BUSH
There's Alive and there's Dead.
And there's a worst place in
between them that I hope you never
know nothing about.
(DARKENING)
Do you know who hurt you?
BUDDY
No, sir.
BUSH
Sonsabitches.
BUDDY
It doesn't matter. Listen. Frank
went somewhere and the raffle money
is gone.
BUSH
You figure he took off with it?
BUDDY
I don't know. I don't want to think
that. But the money's not here and
I don't know where it is. He said
he'd call and he never did.
81.
Buddy glances into the shadows and sees the casket looming on
the sawhorses. He stares at it..
BUSH
Well.. what do you want to do?
Buddy looks back at Bush.
BUDDY
I don't..
(realizing just then)
I want to make this funeral for you
if you want it.
BUSH
(a long look)
Hell. Do it if you can.
(BEAT)
I guess for everyone like me,
there's one like you, son. I about
forgot that.
Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush forces
himself up on his own and walks out.
129 OMITTED 129
Charlie sits at his desk, staring blankly at his crooked
stamp. Suddenly Fate in the form of Frank Quinn looms at the
window. Charlie knows he is there but he won't look at him.
Buddy, Kathryn, and the baby are sleeping soundly. There is a
SCRATCHING NOISE. Buddy sits up, grabs a baseball bat and
falls back asleep. The scratching starts again. He opens his
eyes, surprised to see the bat in his hand. He hears the
scratching. He looks around, sees something at the window. He
slides to the floor, crawls on his knees, and looks out.
Frank is standing there, scratching on the screen. Behind him
is Charlie, looking very unhappy about standing in the near
dark in a small southern town, scratching on a screen.
Buddy realizes what he is seeing and starts to smile.
82.
Bush, dressed in his new suit, shirt, and shoes is a striking
figure. The old hermit is gone. He looks into the mirror.
Mattie stands staring out the window. She is not going.
Bush stands staring out the checkerboard window. He sees
Charlie approaching and opens the door for him. Charlie
climbs the steps, appraises the shack, and stares at Bush.
CHARLIE
Pretty nice jail.
Charlie enters and looks around the little room.
BUSH
Why did you change your mind?
Charlie just looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any
reason he could give.
BUSH
Thank you.
CHARLIE
How do you want to do this?
BUSH
I don't.
He gets a haunted look that catches Charlie off guard.
BUSH
I'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie,
I really am. But if I can't get it
done, would you do it? I want it
said. Please, sir.
Charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door.
BUSH
Tell'em the box is in the barn.
141 OMIT 141
Pacing the cage, Bush peeks out the window.
BUSH
You asked for it you old ornery
sonofabitch, now what are you gonna
do?
Frank, Buddy, and Charlie enter the barn and see Mule hitched
to the wagon. On the back of the wagon is a simple and
rustically elegant casket with the initials FB carved into
the center board. It sobers them all.
The Announcer hangs up the phone on the wall, rushes to the
turntable and lifts the tone arm from the record that is
playing.
ANNOUNCER
Folks, I've just received word of a
tragic turn of events at the Bush
Funeral Party. It seems that Mr.
Bush has been shot. I repeat, Mr.
Felix Bush has been shot. There is
no word of condition..
The radio is playing but we don't know where Mattie is.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
When I know more I will let you
know. I'm sure he would appreciate
your prayers..
Bush stands at the mirror, his shirt unbuttoned and pulled
back. The bullet caught the muscle just above his clavicle.
Buddy, Frank and Charlie rush in.
BUSH
Close the door.
Charlie slams the door. Frank examines the wound. Buddy
stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's
chest.
FRANK
Missed the bone. Got any alcohol
and clean rags?
Bush nods at the cabinet. Charlie finds an amazing assortment
of herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags.
BUDDY
Why don't you sit down, sir?
92.
BUSH
Boil some water and I'll tell you
how to make me a poultice.
Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie
FRANK
This is gonna hurt.
BUSH
Don't sugar coat it.
Frank has cleaned the wound. Buddy has made a poultice that
Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of
Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers.
BUS H
Pretty good prayer. Mighta been
wrong about that preacher.
CHARLIE
Why don't you lay down, Felix?
93.
Bush thinks about it, sees a way out. For a second he looks
like he might take it. Then he shakes his head, puts a rag
over the poultice and pulls his shirt up.
BUSH
Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve.
BUDDY
Are you sure?
Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at
Frank's white shirt. Frank just stares at him. Bush keeps
looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie.
Buddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet
tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to
Frank's relief.
Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush
starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie.
BUSH
You ain't nervous? All them white
folks out there?
CHARLIE
There's white folks here?!
BUSH
Stick with me, you'll be all right.
CHARLIE
You're the one they're shooting at.
As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings
flooding in with the light. He looks at Buddy.
BUSH
Pretty interesting day so far, huh
boy?
Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door.
94.
Bush sits on the edge his bed. His face is drawn and haunted.
The door open and closes. He doesn't look up.
Mattie sits down beside him. Tears are streaming down her
face. She lays her head gently on his shoulder.
MATTIE
Oh, Felix..
He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it.
BUSH
Wonder if her hair would be white?
