Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.
A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
INTERROGATOR
He says you stole his bread.
PETER
It is a lie. I caught him
stealing ours.
The lowlife jabbers some more.
The Interrogator debates.
INTERROGATOR
Cut off the infidel's hand.
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
(CONTINUED)
2.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
No!... I took the bread.
PETER
That's not true.
ROBIN
They're not interested in truth.
You are too weak, Peter. You
would not live through it.
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
INTERROGATOR
Sacrifice for the weaker? How
noble... As you wish... Cut off
this one's hand as well!... But
first...
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
INTERROGATOR
Show them the courage of Allah.
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
ROBIN
And this is English courage.
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming.
PETER
That's for five years of hell.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
VOICE (O.S.)
Behind you!
Warned, Robin ducks away.
Slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented.
ROBIN
You speak English?
SARACEN
The king's own. Set me free.
PETER
No, Robin.
SARACEN
For pity's sake. Mine is a
sentence of death.
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
PETER
Don't trust him.
Two more guards attack, yelling fury.
Robin eyes the
curved scimitar.
ROBIN
What I would give for an English
sword. This is a pruning hook.
A guard swings at him with a giant axe.
Robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.
ROBIN
Hmm!
Not bad.
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
Commotion outside.
RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
SARACEN
Free me and I will show you a way
out.
(CONTINUED)
4.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Why should we trust you?
SARACEN
If you don't, you are dead men.
ROBIN
He makes a point.
The door bursts open.
More guards rush in.
ROBIN
A good point.
He slashes the man free.
PETER
Robin!
ROBIN
Whatever blood is in his veins, he
does not deserve to die here.
SARACEN
This way!
He beckons them to the back.
A hidden door leads into a
tunnel.
They wade through foul water up to their waists. The
Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
lops off its head.
SARACEN
You are fast, my friend.
ROBIN
Five years I've waited for the
smell of free air. That makes a
man fast.
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.
Blocking
the way.
SARACEN
You will need to be yet faster.
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
SARACEN
Poison air.
Hold your breath.
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist.
PETER
(coughing)
Thanks. I misjudged you.
SARACEN
Save your breath.
Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works.
SARACEN
Allah be praised.
ROBIN
Amen, brother.
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating.
FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
VOICE (O.S.)
Enough of that din, Remus.
I
can't think.
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
LOCKSLEY.
Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores
over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself
for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the
vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances
at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
desperate, KENNETH.
KENNETH
My Lord!
Help me.
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
back.
DUNCAN
You must wait... I am sorry you
were disturbed, Master.
KENNETH
(high anxiety)
My Lord, please!
LOCKSLEY
It is alright, Duncan.
(to Kenneth)
You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
The peasant falls to his knees.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
KENNETH
They've taken my Gwen.
My
daughter.
LOCKSLEY
Who has taken her?
KENNETH
Men on horses. In masks.
(touches his wound)
We tried to stop them. My son is
dead.
CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.
GISBORNE
You owe the sheriff three bushels
of flax.
FANNY
You starve us. First the drought,
now you take what food we have
left.
GISBORNE
For starving people, you look
fat enough.
SOLDIER
(emerging from
the hut)
He's not here, sir. None but the
woman and children.
GISBORNE
(to Fanny)
Where is your mate? The man
they call Little.
FANNY
He died last winter.
GISBORNE
Is that so? We hear he
is very
much alive. Hiding out
in the
forest. He probably ran
away
to escape your scolding
tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
FANNY
Norman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
Gisborne's throat.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
FANNY
No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
make it worse.
Wulf backs off.
Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
GISBORNE
Seize him!
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
GISBORNE
This is Lord Nottingham's deer.
Is this how you repay the Sheriff
for his protection?
WULF (BOY)
Like a wolf protects sheep.
FANNY
I killed it.
We needed the meat.
GISBORNE
Poachers hang. Either he dies or
you die.
WULF
My mother lies to protect me.
FANNY
No, Wulf!
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.
GISBORNE
You have deprived us of a hunt,
boy.
He cups his hand in the deer's blood.
Smears it on
Wulf's face.
GISBORNE
The hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
GISBORNE
Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us
some pleasure before you die.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
GISBORNE
Unleash them!
Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving,
stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak
door.
SENTRY
Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to
be disturbed.
GISBORNE
Away, fool.
He shoves the Sentry aside.
The hall. Deer heads.
Boar heads.
Portraits of
ancestors.
OLD WOMAN
Wait here.
He waits.
CREAKING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony.
GIRL
Who are you?
Dim lighting.
Robin cannot make out who it is.
ROBIN
I am Robin of Locksley.
GIRL
You lie.
Robin is dead.
ROBIN
I may meet my maker soon from lack
of sustenance. But for now I am
real enough.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
GIRL
Step into the light.
Turn around.
ROBIN
By heaven, am I to dance next?
Who are you?
GIRL
I am the maid Marian.
ROBIN
Then show yourself, child.
For we
knew each other well.
GIRL
With the king away, these are
lawless times. There are outlaws
villainous enough to kidnap and
ransom a relative of his.
ROBIN
You know I am not one of them.
Besides, I am sworn to protect
you.
GIRL
(laughs)
Protect me? Robin of Locksley was
nothing but a spoiled bully.
ROBIN
Allow that years of war and prison
may change a man. Step forward,
Marian, so I may see how you have
changed.
She moves into the light... Fat.
Rotten teeth.
Ugly as
sin.
ROBIN
Er... the years have been kind.
GIRL
Thank you. Now remove yourself
from this household.
A figure steps behind Robin.
Sticks a sword in his back.
GIRL
(turning away)
As you can see, we are already
well protected.
ROBIN
Wait, Marian!
...ouch!
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man
-- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
ROBIN
You are truly courageous against
an unarmed man.
The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps.
Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the
floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts,
drawing a dagger.
Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head.
Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.
OUTSIDE
The SOUND of the fight indoors.
Aslan hurls himself at
the door. It doesn't give.
INSIDE
Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts.
The
horns get shorter. Robin retreats.
Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at
the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the
dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops.
Robin wrenches off the mask.
Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just
in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's
crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young
woman stands over Robin.
YOUNG WOMAN
As she was saying, we have
no need of your protection.
Robin croaks through clenched teeth.
ROBIN
Marian.
CUT TO:
Liquid tumbles into a goblet.
The three men at a table
in the kitchen.
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves.
Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin --
"Help!" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An
impish grin.
MARIAN
I trust Lord Locksley has
recovered from his indisposition.
Aslan laughs.
Robin glares.
Jesus hangs from the cross. A magnificent stained glass
window. In the ornate pulpit, the BISHOP OF HEREFORD,
bedecked in ermine.
BISHOP
We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on
all your people, but most
especially on our noble Lord
Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect our glorious
city.
Nottingham and Gisborne sit piously among the congrega-
tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.
BISHOP
Grant him also the strength to
bring to justice the lawless men
who threaten its safety. Help
him to stamp out the curse of the
dread Druids who would seize from
us our children, even as wolves
steal the lambs from their mothers.
The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the
poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children.
Among them, Robin.
The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are
galvanized. Begging hands reach out.

Alms!

Have mercy, milady.
3.
Pity, fine sir.
4.
For my baby.
5.
Etc.
The rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble.
Church officials roughly keep order. Marian passes some
coins to the mother of a small child. A hand grabs her
wrist.
ROBIN
Alms for a blind man. For one
who cannot see your beauty.
MARIAN
(recognizing him)
This is dangerous.
ROBIN
So you care for my safety?
MARIAN
No, for mine. I do not wish
to be seen with an outlaw.
ROBIN
Under the Sheriff's law, that's
a badge of pride.
MARIAN
He's put a price on your head.
ROBIN
How much?
MARIAN
A hundred gold pieces.
ROBIN
Is that all? I have not annoyed
him enough. Soon he will offer
ten thousand.
MARIAN
For ten thousand I would turn you
in myself.
(glances back at
the Sheriff)
Nottingham is mounting an army.
ROBIN
How do you know?
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
MARIAN
He has rounded up every blacksmith
in the county. He has them holed
up in the castle making swords and
armor.
ROBIN
What is he planning?
MARIAN
I don't know, but there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.
(as Sheriff heads
towards them)
Go!
ROBIN
If you need me, I will be with
the woodsmen. Send for me as
'Robin Hood.'
MARIAN
Robin!
Do something for me.
ROBIN
What?
MARIAN
Take a bath.
ROBIN
Care to join me?
With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham
arrives.
NOTTINGHAM
You shine like the sun, my lady.
He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle.
Kisses it.
NOTTINGHAM
You have been meeting with young
Robin of Locksley.
(as she tries to
hide her shock)
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.
MARIAN
(recovering)
Yes. A most disagreeable
experience.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
NOTTINGHAM
I deeply regret it, and I promise
you he will be brought to justice.
For subjecting you to such
treatment, I will hang him from
the walls with his own entrails.
That gleam of insanity.
Robin watches from a distance.
MARIAN
I would like to see that, my lord.
The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
NOTTINGHAM
My dear, a woman of your refinement
is not safe living alone. If you
would consent to bring your
household within the city walls,
I could give your needs my most
personal attention.
MARIAN
I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from
the heart, but for now I prefer to
stay in my family's ancestral home.
My cousin, King Richard, will be
deeply moved to hear of your
concern for my welfare.
NOTTINGHAM
Alas, the King has many enemies
both abroad and at home. I fear
for his safe return.
MARIAN
Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will
return. When he does, he will
wish to reward his faithful subjects.
The Sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. Marian
deflates with relief. The Sheriff walks alone towards
a side door.
BEGGAR
(Robin)
Alms, my lord.
Nottingham makes to shove the man aside. With a swift
move, the beggar grabs the Sheriff in a headlock.
Slides Nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags
him out of sight.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
A hundred crowns, Sheriff?
You
insult me.
Nottingham starts to struggle.
Robin draws blood.
ROBIN
Remember young Robin of Locksley,
Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your
nemesis. Your avenging angel.
NOTTINGHAM
If you kill me, you will hang.
ROBIN
If I kill you, I will hang happy.
NOTTINGHAM
What do you want?
ROBIN
I want to give you a chance. A
chance you do not deserve. A
chance to right your wrongs.
NOTTINGHAM
I'm listening.
ROBIN
From this day forward you will
cease to tax my people. You will
renounce the charges against my
father, and you will return his
lands to me.
NOTTINGHAM
Why should I?
ROBIN
Because for every harm you do,
I swear by God I shall visit on
you threefold in return.
NOTTINGHAM
Empty words.
ROBIN
I am here with a blade at your
throat. As long as I live, you
will always know that I could be
here again.
A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them.
Robin digs the knife a little deeper.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Your answer?
NOTTINGHAM
Never, fool.
ROBIN
Then it will begin..
Gisborne yells orders.
Robin hurls Nottingham against
the wall.
The walls shake with Little John's laughter.
LITTLE JOHN
Sure changed the color of 'is
britches, didn't 'e?
ROBIN
Thanks to our cannibal friend.
Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of
venison.
LITTLE JOHN
Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.
BULL
Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold
north o' the border?
ROBIN
To hire mercenaries. The Celts
are savage tribesmen, trained
to kill from birth.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
LITTLE JOHN
Aye, the Romans built a bleedin'
great wall to keep 'em out.
BULL
What does 'e want wi 'em?
ROBIN
Since he also has every Smith
in the country working in his
castle, we can assume he is
planning a little war.
LITTLE JOHN
Agin' who?
ASLAN
England.
Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon
factory. His eyes glint with the reflections of the
smithy's fires.
A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no
heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white-
hot.
GISBORNE
We were ambushed. In Sherwood
Forest.
Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.
NOTTINGHAM
Spanish steel, cousin. So much
stronger than our native blades.
Any losses?
GISBORNE
All the men are gone.
NOTTINGHAM
Yet again you are the sole
survivor, cousin? Interesting.
And the gold?
GISBORNE
Well, it er... disappeared.
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time.
NOTTINGHAM
Robin Hood?
GISBORNE
They were woodsmen, dressed in
green.
NOTTINGHAM
Robin Hood.
He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
NOTTINGHAM
Cousin, we must be strong. We
cannot allow this outlaw to make
fools of us.
Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's
belly.
NOTTINGHAM
And I cannot allow a lieutenant
to fail me.
(turning to the
horrified smithy)
It is indeed fine steel.
A globule of red liquid.
A signet ring.
Marian seals
a letter.
The letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the
Bishop of Hereford. A lavish office.
MARIAN
It is a personal matter, my Lord,
but one of vital importance.
BISHOP
I understand, my dear lady.
This is my most trusted emissary.
He hands the letter to a solemn courier.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
MARIAN
You will travel to France
immediately. You must give this
directly into the hands of the
King, and him alone.
The courier bows in acknowledgement.
Marian indicates
Sarah.
MARIAN
My lady-in-waiting will accompany
you.
Surprised, the courier glances at the Bishop.
BISHOP
My dear, I could not vouch for
her safety. The journey is fraught
with danger.
MARIAN
I appreciate your concern, my
Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished
rider. I must insist that she
goes along.
BISHOP

As you wish.
Fanny Little writhes in agony.
John rushes in.
Tuck
looks up from Fanny's side.
FRIAR
The child comes early.
Fanny screams.
John kneels beside her, taking her head.
LITTLE JOHN
Hush, m'lass.
Ya'll be fine.
FANNY
'S not like t'others, John.
Oh
God, it pains me so.
LITTLE JOHN
(angrily, to Tuck)
Ya're sittin' thar like a fat
sow. Help her, man, help her!
FRIAR
I am doing all I can.
Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the
blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming
creatures.
ASLAN
By Allah, leeches!
He starts to pull the parasites off.
Tuck jumps at him.
FRIAR
Get away from her!
Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work.
ASLAN
Blood is like air. If she loses
blood, she and the child will die.
John is paralyzed with confusion.
Tuck appeals to Robin.
FRIAR
He lies. He is the devil's seed,
sent to lead us astray.
ASLAN
Fool, both the Bible and the Koran
instruct us to preserve life.
Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the
blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.

ASLAN

savage?

If you will allow me, I can help
her. It will not be without
danger.
FRIAR
Do not listen to him!
He will
kill her.
ASLAN
If you do not listen to me, she
will certainly die. And the
child, too.
Fanny cries out.
John looks to Robin, pleading for
advice.
ROBIN
The good Friar has done all he
can. I suggest you let the Arab
try.
(as John is
undecided)
If I am wrong, and they die, then
you may take my life.
John's eyes meet his wife's.
She nods.
LITTLE JOHN
So be it.
FRIAR
Then it will be on your head.
I have warned you.
He storms out.
All business, Aslan speaks to Wulf.
ASLAN
Bring me a needle, thread, water,
a skinning knife, and burning
ashes.
Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases
him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They
whisper.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
What are you going to do?
ASLAN
The child must be taken out by
the knife.
ROBIN
The knife?
ASLAN
I have seen it many times with
horses.
ROBIN
Horses? By the Lord, what are
her chances?
ASLAN
After wasting so much blood...
not good.
ROBIN
Now you tell me!
Wulf runs back in.
Aslan holds up a piece of wood.
ASLAN
(to Fanny)
Are you ready?... Bite down on
this... Robin, hold her steady.
He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.
OUTSIDE
Little John paces. Wulf comes out of the hut.
Families
hover and wait. From inside, MUFFLED GROANS.
FRIAR

John moves to the hut.
Wulf restrains him.
INSIDE
The mother heaves, then drops.
ROBIN
Is she gone?

Aslan ignores him, keeps working over Fanny's body.
Robin cannot watch... a WAIL! Aslan mutters something
in awed Arabic.
ROBIN
What did you say?
Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.
ASLAN
It is a boy.
The mother revives.
Aslan places the child on her
breast.
ASLAN
Your son, my lady... Robin, hold
her skin together while I sew her
up.
He picks up the needle and thread.
Robin's eyes turn to
the woman's abdomen... He faints.
CUT TO:
LITTLE JOHN
marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn
child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one
side. Bloody and
exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut
door. Tuck jumps
to his feet, drawing his knife.
Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily,
behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares
at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across
his own wrist.
FRIAR
This day God has taught me a fine
lesson.
He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
FRIAR
I would be honored.
Aslan slices his own wrist. The two wrists clasp
together in the universal sign of brotherhood. Everyone
cheers.

Our God made this brew, brother.
I merely combined the ingredients.
Do you dare to insult his works?
Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A
sudden gust extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and
SHOUTING from a distant part of the house. Unnerved,
she calls out.
MARIAN
Who is there?
Duncan!
Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a
drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!...
A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She
shoos him down.
MARIAN
Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice.
She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.
A
masked SOLDIER.

SOLDIER
We meet again.
He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his
mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods
her with his sword.
SOLDIER
Drop your blade.
MARIAN
You are still overmatched, soldier.
She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table.
Lays his blade against her chest.
SOLDIER
You owe me favors, wench. Bare
your breasts... or I will do it
for you.
Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her
dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs
a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face.
Screaming, he grabs his
face. She reaches for her
dagger. He slashes with
his sword. She backs to the
fireplace, grabs a spit
of roasted chickens... drives
the point clean through
his chest.
He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the
cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked
soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging
the servants. Duncan
is shoved through the door.
DUNCAN
I am sorry, my lady.
There were
too many.
She stares at the invaders with studied calm.
MARIAN
Is there something you need,
gentlemen? I remember no masked
ball on my calendar.
CUT TO:
AERIAL SHOT
FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green,
intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING
AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in...
86.
The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model.
These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord
Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.
REDHEAD BARON
Forget about Locksley. He is no
threat.
NOTTINGHAM
How can we control all England if
we cannot control our own county?
The people are turning him into
a hero.
GREYBEARD BARON
It is impossible to attack him
in the forest. We have tried
everything. He is cunning.
NOTTINGHAM
Then we
will be more cunning. I
must be
rid of him. We may not
be able
to intercept his next
warning
to the King.
Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open.
Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor.
His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the
visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable
ferocity in his eyes.
CELTIC CHIEFTAIN
I want the heads of the men who
stole my gold.
NOTTINGHAM
Welcome, sir. We were discussing
how to rid ourselves of those very
men. The outlaws who band with
Robin Hood.
REDHEAD BARON
My Lord Nottingham, I must protest.
It is a mistake to ally ourselves
with foreigners.
GREYBEARD BARON
What can these Celts do that we
cannot?
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a
burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log
spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head...
and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking
at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full
three seconds.
An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the
demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.
NOTTINGHAM
This rat Hood has hidden out in
the forest.
He resists all our
assaults with traps and devices,
while he robs us blind. We must
bring him out and destroy him.
The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees.
The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches
the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT
SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its
escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and
again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated.
DISSOLVE TO:
Robin's eyes
-- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark
smoke-filled
recesses of the caves. The walls weave.
Eerie WATERY
sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men.
He tries to
stand.
VOICE (O.S.)
Robin!... Robin!
A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating
towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name.
Reaches out his hand.
MARIAN
Death is not to be feared,
Robin. Embrace it.
Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost
souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover-
ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
MARIAN
Drink this.
Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup.
Her hand
grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
MARIAN
Drink.
The liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus.
Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic.
MARIAN
Look at me. Listen to me. You
belong to me. Your soul is mine.
You will obey my every word. Do
you understand?
Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his
subconscious sounding alarms.
ROBIN
Why, Marian?
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
MARIAN
Because you love me. Say it.
You love me.
(as Robin struggles)
Say it!
ROBIN
(sinking)
I love you.
MARIAN
Kiss me.
He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something
changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face
starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of
Mortianna.
He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his
head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision,
we see he is surrounded by masked men.
ROBIN
(slurred)
Where is Marian?
MORTIANNA
She is with friends.
(cackles)
Your resistence is strong, but
useless. Sign this.
(as quill is forced
into his hand)
You are a Druid like your father.
You consort with the devil. Your
confession will be witnessed by
the Bishop of Hereford.
A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then
cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be-
tween his shoulders.
In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling
beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
MORTIANNA
(horror)
The painted man!
Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A
curved
scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in
the
other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked
guards
are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats,
scurry-
ing into the depths of the cave.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like
hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only
two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark-
ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet... and lunges.
ASLAN
Behind you!
Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan
grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks.
Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's.
Robin is slumped against a rock.
ROBIN
(groggy)
Marian?
Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is
crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
BULL
Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian
burial. Promise me, boy.
WULF
I promise.
Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be-
low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom,
hatred, fear -- then is gone.
A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol-
lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber
where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them
Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the
floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime.
Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile.
NOTTINGHAM
(wry smile)
Would you prefer pain or death?
FIRST WOODSMAN
Death.
Dignity masking his terror.
Nottingham appears to
consider.
NOTTINGHAM
Torture him.
The man is dragged away by guards.
The next PRISONER --
NOTTINGHAM
And you?
Pain or death?
SECOND WOODSMAN (PRISONER)
(pure terror)
... Er... pain.
NOTTINGHAM
Torture him... you see, it makes
no difference.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
NOTTINGHAM (CONT'D)
You will all be tortured. You will
all tell me all you know about
Robin Hood, and then you will all
be hanged. Then we will catch your
beloved Robin Hood and do the same
to him.
WILL SCARLET
I will kill him for you.
WULF
Will, no!
Nottingham strides up to Will, drawing his sword.
NOTTINGHAM
Why would I need you?
WILL SCARLET
All your attempts to kill him
have failed. Your army failed.
Your Celtic mercenaries failed.
Nottingham places his sword point against Will's throat.
NOTTINGHAM
And you can succeed?
WILL SCARLET
I am one of his men. He would
never suspect me.
WULF
He knows you always hated him,
traitor.
WILL SCARLET
He is a trusting fool. He will
believe me. If he doesn't, he
will kill me and you have lost
nothing.
Nottingham slides his blade between Will's teeth.
NOTTINGHAM
If you fail, I will personally
cut out your lying tongue.
He withdraws the blade.
Will tries to smile.
WILL SCARLET
And if I succeed?
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
NOTTINGHAM
His friends will..
(to a guard)
... torture him!
He turns back to Will.
A smile of mock apology.
NOTTINGHAM
It will look better.
The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone
walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings
in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light
high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He
fingers his wooden crucifix.
WULF
If it be your biddin' that this be
my last night o' life, Lord, gimme
the pluck to die proud. An' look
'ee kindly on my folks an' the
young 'uns.
The light in the cell melts to total darkness.
DISSOLVE TO:
BRANCHES
Sunlight glistens on frost-laden branches.
A COCK ROBIN
CHIRPS.
Boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. The
Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters...
... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul
things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet
unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked
by two armed guards.
NOTTINGHAM
How is my bride?
Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his
face.
NOTTINGHAM
Ah... You are overwhelmed with
happiness.
He slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
MARIAN
(calm, uncowed)
I will never marry you.
Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet
she used at the Druid ceremony.
MORTIANNA
Hold her!
Marian struggles against her bonds.
MARIAN
Get away from me, you disgusting
hag. I will not... augh!
The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth
open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her
throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the
drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham
watches with amusement.
NOTTINGHAM
(to Mortianna)
When we are married, thirty of the
northern barons will pledge me
their support as king. As you
predicted.
Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood.
Clasps the dice-like runes.
NOTTINGHAM
What do you see in the portents?
Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands
to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.
MORTIANNA
The union. The blood of the lion
and the house of Nottingham. New
faith. New power. New souls.
She stares at Nottingham, her red eyes demented.
MORTIANNA
If there is no union, there will
be darkness, despair, death.
Ours!
NOTTINGHAM
Di not give me riddles, woman. We
are to be married within hours.
How can we be in danger?
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
MORTIANNA
The blood does not lie.
NOTTINGHAM
(shouting)
Tell me how it will result.
MORTIANNA
I have told you what I know.
NOTTINGHAM
Confound you, crone. Without my
protection, the people would hunt
you down, rip out your black heart
and burn it.
Mortianna runs at him.
Points her bony finger at his
heart.
MORTIANNA
Without me, you are nothing. You
are straw, a fleabite, a speck.
(as Nottingham
laughs)
Laugh, fool. I birthed you from
this body. I stole a babe in this
very castle, and killed it so that
you might rise in its place. You
are my son.
(Nottingham is
too shocked to
react)
Together we are strong. Now is
not the time to doubt. Now is the
time to believe, to be bold. The
bold will prevail.
The Sheriff marches through, issuing orders.
(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:
NOTTINGHAM
Seal the entrance. Guard it with
your lives. ... Bring the bishop
to my chapel.
Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a
mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway,
lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs
the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The
Sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
NOTTINGHAM
Come!
It is time for the union.
The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet.
She is
oblivious.
Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed
to the
practice of black magic. The crucifix on the
altar is
upside down. Marian stands before it, between
the
Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged
in.
Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO.
BISHOP
They are rebelling. We must
escape.
NOTTINGHAM
Marry us. When I am declared king,
that rabble will not dare go against
us.
BISHOP
Is is madness to delay.
Mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the
Bishop's outstretched hands. Blood flows.
MORTIANNA
Face them, or face me.
Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier.
He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire.
Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the
head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at
Fanny with a knife.
A door SLAMS back. Robin bursts through. Alone, against
three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him
as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is
off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.
ROBIN
(grabbing a servant)
Where is she? Where is Lady
Marian?
(CONTINUED)
123.
CONTINUED:
The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor,
sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door-
way.
ROBIN
Ah!
There is my answer.
He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him.
Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage-
ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful
men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
FRIAR
(pious)
My son, there is a holy war being
waged outside. Release all these
wretches and God shall surely find
you a place in heaven.
JAILER
I'd rather go to hell!
WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
Flies back.
Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
BISHOP
...your bodies to be bound in
immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian
Dubois, take...
The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward.
Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
pew, taking down a third.
ROBIN
Marian, run!
It's me, Robin.
Run!
Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side.
Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the
Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin
prepares to fight him.
(CONTINUED)
124.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
I warned you, I would find you no
matter what.
NOTTINGHAM
No companions? No army? You rush
to your death for the sake of a
woman. Lust has turned you into a
fool... Recognize this, Locksley?
He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix
sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.
NOTTINGHAM
Appropriate I should use it to
kill you with, don't you think?
He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire
in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying
desperately.
Tuck picks himself up from the floor.
The jailer is
amazed.
FRIAR
The Lord helps those who help
themselves.
Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor
... and a miniature powder keg. He holds it to his
flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... Stupified,
the man catches the smoking bomb.
FRIAR
Give my regards to the devil.
The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall.
The chef raises his knife.
Fanny appeals to the whole
room.
FANNY
Listen! Outside, your countrymen
rise against the Sheriff.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
126.
CONTINUED:
FANNY (CONT'D)
Is there one man or woman here
who does not hate him? Who has
not suffered at his hand?
(to the chef)
Turn that on the Sheriff and his
bullies.
A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding
cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying
food and cutlery.
Nottingham slashes maniacally.
Robin is cornered,
weakening.
NOTTINGHAM
You should have stayed away,
Locksley. Fools like you never
learn.
A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his
grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back
to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan,
followed by Tuck.
ASLAN
Ali akbar!
FRIAR
Amen!
MORTIANNA
(seeing Aslan)
Agh... the painted one!
Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops
down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the
floor.
Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other
men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
(CONTINUED)
127.
CONTINUED:
The Bishop makes his escape.
Tuck blocks his path.
FRIAR
So! You sold your soul to the
devil?
BISHOP
No, I swear it, in God's name.
FRIAR
Blasphemer! You accuse innocent
men of Druid worship while you
practice the black arts yourself.
The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.
A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on
Aslan.
ROBIN
(glimpsing her)
Watch out!
Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
the floor.
Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.
BISHOP
(innocently)
I am sure you would not strike a
man of the cloth.
FRIAR
Think again!
Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so
hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.
Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the
altar.
NOTTINGHAM
What can your puny God do for
you now?
The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked.
Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the
temple.
The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
to squirm away.
ROBIN
This is for my father.
He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still.
Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside.
Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on
the edge of the steep parapet.
A VOICE ECHOES from the vaulted roof.
A wedding is in
progress.
(CONTINUED)
131.
CONTINUED:
FRIAR (O.S.)
By the power vested in me by
God's holy church, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.
Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple.
FRIAR
You may kiss the bride.
The husband draws back the bride's veil.
Robin and
Marian. They kiss... long.
FRIAR
(whispers)
Hurry. We waste good celebration
time.
They break
the embrace, turn to the congregation and
start down
the aisle. They pause at the front pew,
where KING
RICHARD and members of his court are sitting.
Robin bows,
Marian curtsies.
KING RICHARD
May I kiss the bride?
ROBIN
Who would dare refuse his king's
request?
KING RICHARD
(kissing Marian's
cheek)
You look radiant, cousin.
ROBIN
We are deeply honored by Your
Majesty's presence.
KING RICHARD
It is I who am honored, Lord
Locksley. Thanks to you I still
have a throne.
They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre-
gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin
embrace.
ASLAN
(whispers)
My friend, a word of advice...
Ride her better than your horse.
Robin laughs.
132.
