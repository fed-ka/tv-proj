It's raining...
Light strobes across the wet glass at a rhythmic pace...
Suddenly -- through the window a face -- JASON BOURNE --
riding in the backseat -- his gaze fixed.
A1
One minute later.
BOURNE moves out onto the veranda.
MARIE pads in. Watching him for a moment. Concerned.
Clearly it's not the first time this has happened.

In the car.
Conklin up front.

MARIE
I'll get the book.
BOURNE
No.
There's nothing new.
MARIE
You're sure?
(he nods)
We should still -- we should write it
down.
BOURNE
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --

MARIE
-- it hasn't been two years --

BOURNE
-- it's alwa

gone quiet)

You ever thi

She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him.
MARIE
We write them down because sooner or
*
later you're going to remember something
*
good.

BOURNE
(softens)
I do remember something good.
All the
time. I remember you.
She smiles.
Kisses him.
Leads him back in.

The

A busy market town. Fishing town. Hippie town. Lots of

CAMERA FINDS
BOURNE coming out of a store with a big bottle of water.
He's just finished his run. Standing there, chugging away,
checking the scene, when something catches his eye --
HIS POV
THE STREET. A SILVER CAR -- something newish -- pulling
down the block -- can't quite see who's driving, but --

BOURNE watching this silver car. So serious he's casual.

KIRILL, one eye on MARIE.

He arrives just as KIRILL looks up and sees them a

bends down --

BOURNE
We gotta go, Marie.
We gotta go, now.

BOURNE not liking this.
Eyes all over -- trying to decide.
MARIE
But you're sure?
BOURNE
He was at the campground yesterday.
MARIE
So...

BOURNE
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and

hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Trying to decide whether to pull out or back up --
MARIE
That's crazy.

BOURNE, eyes everywhere,

KIRILL slams into it. Quick, precise grabs into the bag.
Only a moment and he's got a SNIPER RIFLE.

An OLD WOMAN looking directly at KIRILL from a doorway.
Not quite sure what. But an old Indian woman in Goa? So
what.
KIRILL drills her with a look.
As she sinks back inside --

The surface of the water.
Unbroken.

KIRILL
Scans his perimeter. There's the old woman again. But
more people with her. People coming out of the woodwork.
KIRILL checks the surface one last time.
Nothing.
He breaks down the rifle in moments -- goes.

BOURNE -- up into an air pocket held by the jeep's canvas
top. A big gulp of air --
And he's back to MARIE. Frantic. Trying to unclip her

seatbelt. Pull her out. But it's all jammed up.
*
41
41
Bag chucked in the back. All he has left is the scope.

One last look to the unbroken surface. Then it's time to
go. KIRILL -- drifting away -- disappears.
42

The red halo growing bigger.
BLOOD.

BOURNE pauses.
MARIE'S face is blank.
She's dead.

PAMELA jumping out of A VAN the moment it stops. Seeing
it all. The crowd. The army of cops. The searchlights
playing across THE HOTEL FACADE. It's another disaster.

BOURNE coming around the other side of the hotel --
Stepping to the left before he spots the SWAT van --
BOURNE about-faces -- heads the other way --
A SIDEWALK COP looks over, checks the BOURNE PHOTO print-

TEDDY huddled with the HOTEL MANAGER and A GROUP OF HIGH-
RANKING BERLIN COPS, turning back as --
ABBOTT
(arriving breathless)
They missed him?
TEDDY
*
So far. But they found Nicky. She's
*
back at the Westin. Bourne let her go.
*
ABBOTT
He let her go? Great. Where's Danny?
*
He should head over there and debrief
*
her.
*
(the Hotel)
*
What's here? What was he doing?
*
TEDDY
We don't know. They're in a room
upstairs. I was told to wait down here.
ABBOTT accepting that. Because he has to.
Only we see
the fear. Turns to leave...
*
86.
ABBOTT
OK, if you see Danny tell him I went back
*
to the hotel.

ABBOTT steps out into the street as...

BOURNE striding away and -- Following --
*
SIDEWALK COP blowing a WHISTLE -- fumbling for his holster.
BOURNE running now, slowly at first, and --

A235
Now FASTER, as if he can gauge his speed and distance...

MOTION -- BOURNE tearing away and --
A237
A237
BOURNE slows to a walk -- TWO PATROL CARS heading his way --
no choice -- there -- a narrow passageway between TWO
MOVING TROLLEY TRAINS and -- SPRINTING through --
The PATROL CARS skidding into 180's.
B237
B237
THE RIVER SPREE lit by THE TROLLEY that's rumbling past and
the running lights of a DOUBLE COAL BARGE up the river.
BOURNE runs across the bridge -- going as fast as he can --
hearing THE POLICE SIRENS swirling behind him, when --
A THIRD AND FOURTH POLICE CAR AHEAD!
BOURNE turns hard for a STAIRWELL, jumps the walkway curb,
leaps up the stairs, two at a time, as --
All FOUR COP CARS SKID to a stop.
As doors open --
87.
238
238
A TRAM waiting as the LAST FEW PASSENGERS get on.
The
doors seem to stay open in slow motion as --
BOURNE appears -- makes a mad last dash --
And he's on!
And the doors don't close!
It's not scheduled to go yet.
And here come the COPS!
BOURNE off the tram -- GUNS appear --
BOURNE runs to his left -- stops short --
The other cops are coming this way -- SCREAMING at him --
Not a lot of options -- BOURNE looks over the rail --
DOWN BELOW
A COAL BARGE passing, the prow just emerging --
BOURNE
On the rail and JUMPING even as the FIRST SHOT is fired --
239
239
BOURNE lands hard -- stands -- voltage going up one leg --
And they're SHOOTING at him.
He can worry about the leg later.
He RUNS.
Back toward them!
The barge moving slow -- BOURNE disappears under the
bridge.

Guns aimed, POLICE waiting for a clear shot.
TWO OF THEM

Countering -- the barge going one way -- BOURNE the other --
dodging all the super-structure on deck -- all the while
keeping his cover overhead --
And LEAPING to the second barge!
And more of the same, until --
BOURNE running out of barge --
LEAPING back onto the BRIDGE FOOTING and --
242
242
THE POLICE watching the barge fully emerge -- continuing
down river -- SHOUTING IN GERMAN that he's either "in the
water" or "hiding on the barge".
Off they go -- down the stairs --
Leaving the PASSENGERS on the tram blinking out in shock --
And BOURNE -- climbing back over the rail --
Limping back on the tram just before --
The DOORS CLOSE -- and off it goes --

Very late -- ABBOTT waits on an isolated bridge -- a lone
*
figure in the shadow of East Berlin.

GRETKOV arrives by car. Walks through the darkness.
*
ABBOTT barely glancing over.
*
90.
ABBOTT
You told me Bourne was dead.
GRETKOV
There was a mistake.
ABBOTT
I'l
l say. You killed his goddam
*
gir
lfriend instead. Now they're onto
*
Nes
ki. They're at the Brecker Hotel even
*
as
we speak.
*
GRETKOV
Will it track back to us?
*
ABBOTT
No. The files are spotless. Whatever
*
they find, it's just going to make Conklin
*
look worse.
*
GRETKOV
And the Landy woman?
*
ABBOTT
She's done everything I wanted. She bit
*
on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She
*
even found his bogus Swiss account...
*
GRETKOV
*
Anything else?
*
ABBOTT shoves a piece of paper -- and ADDRESS -- into

GRETKOV'S hand.

ABBOTT

ABBOTT (CONT'D)
Neski was a roadblock. Without me,
*
there's no company, no fortune. You owe
*
me, Uri. One last push.
*
GRETKOV
One last push. One.

GRETKOV leaves.
ABBOTT watches him go.

Seconds later.
GRETKOV getting in slowly.

Late. ABBOTT walks.
A lonely figure.
Past someone in

the shadows --

BOURNE

Mr. Abbott?

He turns to answer when BOURNE firmly guides him into a

side street...

BOURNE'S ARRIVED.

As he continues for the

station --
*
250
256
Crossing the border into Poland -- Cold, desolate, snow --
257

A268
*
Speeding East through the Russian countryside. The forest
*
is gone, replaced by factories and refineries. A
*
wasteland of rust and gray that seems to go on forever --

There, in the plaza. BOURNE hobbling across the street,
when suddenly -- A CAR HORN! -- he turns and --
Look out!
A BIG BLACK BMW speeding past -- followed by TWO MORE --
all three cars with BLUE LIGHTS STROBING on the dashboards -
- a convoy -- whipping by like they own the place and --
TAXI DRIVER (OS)
(Gangster bastards don't care what they
do.)
BOURNE turns.
A grizzled TAXI DRIVER right beside him.
BOURNE pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.
BOURNE
(his Russian is basic)
(You know this address?)
THE TAXI DRIVER squints, finally grunts affirmative.
He motions to his cab.
As they get in and pull away --
273
276
KIRILL at the wheel. A guy in a hurry who knows what he's
doing. One more thing, on the passenger seat -- TWO BIG
AUTOMATIC PISTOLS --
277
277
MOSCOW COPS fanning through the crowd showing BOURNE'S
INTERPOL PICTURE. "Have you seen him?"
278
278
MOSCOW COPS with the picture.
Flashing it around, until --
YOUNG CABBY
(the moment he sees it)
(He was just here. They just left.)
279
280
Old Moscow. But not for long, there's new construction
metastasizing all around it. BOURNE crosses the street and
--
HIS POV
AN ABANDONED WOODEN HOUSE. Windows shattered and boarded
up. Paint all but gone. Roof and gables all failing.
BACK TO
BOURNE crestfallen.
Checking the address.
This is it.
104.
281
281
MORE COPS. Everything focused on ANOTHER TAXI DRIVER who's
making a call on a cell phone -- everybody waiting on it --
282
282
BOURNE off the sidewalk now, peering around the side,
trying to see if there's anything around back and --
OVER THERE
AN OLD WOMAN on the steps next door.
Watching him.
BOURNE starts over.
Finding the sweetest smile he's got --
283
284
BOURNE and the OLD LADY.
His Russian is limited, but she's
charmed nonetheless --
BOURNE
(A pen...to write...one minute...)
(searching his pockets)
285
285
286
THE OLD LADY scribbling on a piece of paper. BOURNE
reacting as the TAXI drops into gear. Pulls away.
BOURNE
Wait!
Hey!

back as POLICE SIRENS start rising behind him and --

BOURNE -- he's diving! -- rolling! -- pure instinct -- back
under the embankment and --

KIRILL with no shot suddenly -- leaning over the rail --

MOSCOW COPS jumping out with guns drawn and --

A labyrinth of stalls. Food. Hardware. Clothes. And
crowded. Even this hard-to-impress CROWD noticing --
BOURNE hobbling through. Nothing like a limping madman
with a fresh gunshot wound to get attention --
PEOPLE back off -- pull THEIR KIDS out of the way -- SOME
WOMAN STARTS SCREAMING and --

KIRILL running toward the market -- FIVE MOSCOW COPS behind
him, can't keep up and --

Bourne pivots -- casually -- like he doesn't know they're

coming until -- HE SPITS! -- VODKA -- into one of the cop's

THE G-WAGON in full pursuit now and --

THE TWO MOSCOW POLICE CARS starting to climb and --

KIRILL DRIVING and he's on the hill now --

BOURNE -- bad hand on the wheel -- holding on -- trying to

find something in passenger seat -- TUBE SOCKS?

THE TWO MOSCOW POLICE CARS splitting up! -- one on Bourne's

ass -- the other cutting hard into A SIDE STREET, flanking

him and --

BOURNE -- topping the hill -- two choices -- right or left?

RIGHT! -- No! -- wrong -- because down the hill there's A

POLICE CAR just about to angle in from THE SIDE-STREET and -

BOURNE -- no choice -- FLOORING IT! --

THE CAB -- it's a whale -- SLAM! -- knifing the front end

KIRILL -- right behind that guy -- swerving -- onto the

sidewalk -- SPARKS FROM THE WALL AS HE SCRAPES! -- hanging

JUST MISSING THE FIRST POLICE CAR bombing right past him!

BOURNE -- in pain as he packs his shoulder wound with the

socks -- Ahead -- the street banks downhill to left and --

THERE! -- A BOULEVARD -- wide ride -- lots of traffic and --

THE CAB rocketing into the flow and --

BEHIND HIM -- POLICE CAR #1 with THE G-WAGON right on his

ass and --

BOURNE -- Wrists flicking the wheel.
THE CAB screaming

through the slower traffic and --

KIRILL -- totally on it -- pedal down -- passenger window

DUCT TAPE to finish his triage --

Huge, awful Soviet-era housing towers fill the horizon.
A CITY BUS grinds to a stop. PEOPLE trundle off.
Working

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS
A GIRL. Trudging a man-made wasteland. Twenty. A proud
little waif. Sad eyes. Home from some job. IRENA.

Grimmer up close. Rusted steel mesh over the windows.
DRUNK TEENAGERS. A haze of cigarette smoke.

BOURNE trudging along.
Across the snow.
He's done it.
And he really can't take another step.
