               Mr. Garrison stands in front of the chalkboard. It reads 
               "Drugs are Bad". The students are in their seats.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, children, let's take our seats. 
                         This morning we're going to have a 
                         special lecture from your school 
                         counselor, Mr. Mackey.

               The counselor steps in front of Mr. Garrison.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Now, now who was that? That is not 
                         appropriate behavior. Okay?

                              (in Mr. Mackey's voice)
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, Okay?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, that's okay. Just don't let it 
                         happen again.

                         Mackey, Okay?

               The boys laugh merrily.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay, Okay that's fine.

                              (in Mr. Mackey's voice)
                         Okay?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay. Now, uh, as your counselor, 
                         I'm here to tell you about drugs and 
                         alcohol and why they are bad, okay?

               The kids just sit there and blink.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         So, first of all... Smokin's bad... 
                         You shouldn't smoke. And uh, alcohol 
                         is bad, you shouldn't drink alcohol. 
                         And as for drugs, well, drugs are 
                         bad you shouldn't do drugs. Okay, 
                         that about wraps up my introduction, 
                         now are there any questions? Yes, 
                         Stan?

                                     STAN
                         Why do dogs have cold noses?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh... I'm not sure.

                                     STAN
                         Oh.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Now, uh, let's focus our discussion 
                         first on Marijuana. Marijuana is 
                         bad. And it also has a very distinct 
                         smell, Okay? I'm going to pass around 
                         just a little tiny bit, and I want 
                         you all to take a smell, so you know 
                         when someone is smokin' Marijuana 
                         near you.

               He hands a small tray with a bud of pot on it to the first 
               kid on the end. (Pip). Pip smells it, grimaces, then passes 
               it on.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay, Just take a smell, pass it on, 
                         and when it gets back up to me, we'll 
                         finish talking about it. In the 
                         meantime, I want to get into alcohol 
                         a little... Okay, Uh, alcohol is 
                         bad... If you drink alcohol...

               As the counselor AD LIBs the rest of his speech, the boys 
               whisper to each other.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's

                                     COUNSELOR
                         ...and so that's why alcohol is bad. 
                         Has that marijuana made it back up 
                         here yet?
                              (no response)
                         No? Okay, let's talk about LSD... uh 
                         children, LSD is bad. it's a drug 
                         made famous by John Lennon and Paul 
                         McCartney...

                         Hey, are we supposed to get your

                         Sorry, Mr. Mackey, okay?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Okay. Now children, has that marijuana 
                         made it around yet?

               No response.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh, who has the marijuana now?

               Principal Victoria is sitting at her desk with a stern look 
               on her face, and her hands folded.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         I am VERY disappointed in you young 
                         man... You should be ashamed of 
                         yourself! What could have possessed 
                         you to be so stupid?

               Now we see who's sitting opposite the Principal: Mr. Mackey.

                                     COUNSELOR
                              (Looking down)
                         I'm sorry, Principal Victoria.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Well, sorry isn't going to cut the 
                         cheese, this time, mister. I'm afraid 
                         I'm going to have to suspend you 
                         from school.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         You mean I'm fired?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Well, I guess that's the grown up 
                         way to put it, yes.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         But it was an honest error of 
                         judgement, okay? I really thought it 
                         was important for the kids to know 
                         the smell of marijuana so that --

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         It was an error of judgement, Mr. 
                         Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let 
                         you go for it. We searched each one 
                         of those kids but came up empty. We 
                         had to let them go home, and one of 
                         them now has half a lid of Jamaican 
                         grass because of you.

                              (crying)
                         How am I going to make ends meet, 
                         okay? What will I do for money?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         There, there now, maybe this will 
                         all blow over someday and we can 
                         give you a job as a janitor cleaning 
                         up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.

                                     COUNSELOR
                              (crying harder)
                         Ohh, okay? Oh-woa, okay?


               Mr. Garrison is lit, and watching "tele-tubbies".

               Mr. Garrison just laughs.


               Mackey hops over to the bar and sits down.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey, I don't think I've seen you 
                         around here, before.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         No, I just, I had to get away. 
                         Okay?... I just lost my job...

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh, that's weak man. You know what 
                         you need? You need a good stiff drink.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, I don't drink. Okay?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Trust me, man, it'll make you feel 
                         better.

               The bartender pushes a beer in front of Mr. Mackey.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh... Drinkin's bad...

               Mackey looks at the glass... A deep, thinking gaze... Just 
               then, a little devil Mr. Mackey appears next to the 
               counselor's head.

                                     DEVIL MACKEY
                         Go ahead... Drink the beer! It'll 
                         calm you down.

               Then, a little angel Mr. Mackey pops up on the other side.

                                     ANGEL MACKEY
                         Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a 
                         beer. Don't be such a pussy. Okay?

               Mackey reaches out, takes the beer, and gulps down a large 
               sip very quickly.

                                     BARTENDER
                         How do you feel?

               The counselor belches.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         About the same.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh, you just need something a little 
                         stronger...

               The bartender pulls out a large bottle of scotch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         They ARE gonna cut off his fireman!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         It's Jewish tradition, boobie.

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Normally we do it right after the 
                         baby is born. But we had to do it 
                         later for Ike because he's a --

                                     KYLE
                         Aaahhhhh

               Kyle runs into his room.

               Stan, Cartman and Kenny are left alone with the parents.

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, 
                         will you go talk to him?

               The boys start to shake. From Stan's POV the parents mutate 
               into horrible monsters. They have huge, metallic claws for 
               hands.

                                     KYLE'S PARENTS
                         LET US CUT OFF YOUR PEE-PEE STAN!!!

                                     STAN
                         Aagh!!!

               Stan runs away too. The parents, who of course are just their 
               normal selves, look at each other with puzzled faces.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oi, What is the matter with them?


                                     KYLE
                         I can't believe my parents are 
                         cannibals!

                                     STAN
                         What are you gonna do, dude?

                                     KYLE
                         I have to save my little brother! I 
                         have to send him away until my parents 
                         come to their senses!

               Kyle opens his window and steps outside.

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, Ike!

                                     IKE
                         Baba mama simi sma!

                                     KYLE
                         Cover me for a while, I'll find a 
                         place to hide him and come back!

                                     CARTMAN
                         No way, dude! We're not staying alone 
                         in your house with your wee-wee 
                         chopping parents!!

                                     KYLE
                         Just give me thirty minutes! Come 
                         on, IKE!

               Kyle and Ike run off into the night. The boys swallow hard 
               and look scared.


               Kyle walks in the door with his dummy Ike.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Boobie, where have you been?! Dinner's 
                         been ready for five minutes.

                                     KYLE
                         Sorry, mom, I just had to deal with 
                         Ike. He's being cranky.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         How is my little jelly bean?

                                     KYLE
                              (throwing his voice)
                         Baba mimi sama.
                              (his own voice)
                         I'm gonna take him to the bathroom 
                         to get washed up.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Okay, but first let mommy give you a 
                         kiss.

               The boys look worried.

                                     KYLE
                         Uh, no mom, he doesn't want you 
                         kissing him.

               Mom walks over, Kyle tries to hold the Ike doll away. Just 
               then, the huge dog runs in the door and grabs the Ike doll 
               with his sharp teeth.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         AAGHGH!!

               In a split second, the dog rips the dummy Ike from Kyle's 
               grasp and starts shaking it violently around the room.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         OH MY GOD MAKE IT STOP!!

                                     KYLE
                         PUT IT DOWN YOU STUPID DOG!!

               But the dog tears the doll to shreds. Then runs outside with 
               it, and eats it in the road.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         MY BABY, OH GOD THE HORROR!!!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Get out of here you mutt. Let him 
                         go.

               Finally, a gas truck slams on its brakes, slams into the dog 
               and bursts into flames.

               Kyle's mother hides her head in Gerald's chest.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                              (weeping)
                         Oh he's dead! He's dead! My little 
                         boobala's dead!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         There, there, Sheila. There's nothing 
                         we can do.

               Kyle's father breaks out crying as well.

               Kyle just stands there, looking nervous.


               Kyle and his mom and dad walk into the crappy old bar and 
               look around.

               They see a few truckers, drinking and listening to a slow 
               country song.

               PAN along the room, slowly. It's pretty dead, nothing 
               unusual... Then the PAN does a double take --

               There's Ike. Holding up a table with his head. Somebody has 
               chosen to use him as a table post. Ike blinks, happily.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         IKE!!!

               Kyle's mother runs to him, takes the table off his head and 
               embraces him.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey lady! That's my table post! You 
                         can't have that!


                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Now you march to your room! And think 
                         about what you've done!!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         But first, apologize to your brother!

                                     KYLE
                         HE'S NOT MY BROTHER!!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         APOLOGIZE TO HIM!!!

                                     KYLE
                              (very insincere)
                         I'm sorry Ike.

                                     IKE
                         Baba toda nur!

               Kyle walks into his room and slams the door. Ike looks sad.


               Mackey struggles to get up in the back seat, and sees that 
               he is in the moving car with Jimbo, Principal Victoria, Mr. 
               Garrison, Ned and A big buff guy.

                         What the hell is going on?!

                                     JIMBO
                         Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking 
                         you to rehab.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't 
                         even done drugs in weeks!

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. 
                         Mackey and we apologize. We should 
                         have realized that you needed help.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure 
                         you get the help you need.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I don't want help!

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Believe me, you'll thank us later.

               The car speeds on.


               The party has started. Several people are conversing and 
               drinking merrily.

               Kyle's mother and father are standing by the door, welcoming 
               guests.

               A man and woman walk in, bearing Bris gifts.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for 
                         coming to Ike's Bris!

                                     IKE
                         Oh, oh.

               Another man walks in.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Look, Ike! It's your Uncle Murray!

                                     UNCLE MURRAY
                         Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         He's been sent to his room for being 
                         a bastard. He's decided that Ike 
                         isn't his brother, since he's adopted.

               Ike looks sad, and bounces off towards Kyle's room. Another 
               guest walks in.

                                     GUY
                         Hi there!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Hello... Do I know you?

                                     GUY
                         Oh no, but I never miss a Bris! Here, 
                         I brought some dip.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Oh... Thanks.


               Kyle is pouting on his bed. Stan and Cartman are on the floor.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well... I guess the chopping is about 
                         to commence.

               Just then, Ike comes running in, holding a photo album.

                                     IKE
                         A baba simi mama!

                                     KYLE
                         What do you want?!

                                     IKE
                         A baba simi

               Ike hands Kyle the photo album, and opens it up to a page 
               with a picture of a younger Kyle, with a younger Ike. Kyle 
               is holding Ike in his arms.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh no you don't... That isn't gonna 
                         work on me, Canadian!

                                     STAN
                         Maybe you're being too hard on him, 
                         dude.

                                     KYLE
                         No way. There's no real connection 
                         between us. It was all a big lie.

               Ike turns the page and points to more pictures. Then Kyle 
               looks up and sees that Ike has put on a green Kyle hat.

                                     IKE
                         Cookie monter!

                                     KYLE
                         Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through 
                         getting in trouble for you!

               Ike sadly bounces away.

               Kyle looks again at the picture in the photo album, and 
               actually looks sad himself.


               Mr. Mackey is in a room filled with other people getting 
               counseling.

                         You have to admit you have a problem 
                         before anybody can help you.

                         problem.

                         Nonsense. You did DRUGS. I suppose 
                         you forgot all about your family.

                         Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an 
                         adult. The problem with drugs is 
                         that people forget to stop doing 
                         them. There's a time and a place for 
                         everything Mr. Mackey, and it's called 
                         college.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Now I want you to repeat after me... 
                         Drugs are bad.

                         Uh....Drugs are bad...


               Kyle's mother answers the door. A Doctor makes his way in.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Hello, doctor Schwartz! Thank you so 
                         much for coming all this way to 
                         perform Ike's Bris.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought 
                         the normal cutting device...

               Doctor Schwartz holds up a metal tool.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         ...But then I remembered that Ike 
                         was Canadian. So I brought the right 
                         one.

               Doctor Schwartz holds up a completely different looking 
               device.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Where is the little rugrat?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Right over here...

               The doctor approaches Ike, who backs away slowly, looking 
               very scared.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Come here, you...

                                     IKE
                         AAAGHAGH!!!

               Ike runs away.


               Kyle is sitting on his bed, pouting. Stan, Kenny and Cartman 
               are standing next to Kyle as he looks through the photo album.

               Ike comes running in.

                                     IKE
                         Bo ham me!!

               Kyle looks at Ike, then at the door...

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Ike? Ike...

               Ike jumps into Kyle's lap. Kyle looks surprised.

                                     IKE
                         Kyle... Protect me.

               Kyle looks almost like he wants to cry. MUSIC SWELLS. Ike 
               wraps his little arms around Kyle's neck. Kyle is shocked.

               Just then, Kyle's door opens and the doctor walks in holding 
               his metal tool.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         There you are. Come on, Ike. It's 
                         time. Kyle stands, Ike is still 
                         holding onto him.

                                     KYLE
                         YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY LITTLE 
                         BROTHER!!!

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         But son, I just --

                                     KYLE
                         You aren't going to cut off his wee-
                         wee. Not today you sick ass weirdo!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Kyle, what are you talking about?

                                     KYLE
                         AND YOU! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF 
                         YOURSELF! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
                         US MALES ARE DEFINED BY OUR FIREMEN?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes, the fireman is very magical. If 
                         you rub his helmet he spits in your 
                         eye.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         Kyle... A circumcision is very common 
                         thing for Ike to have. His father 
                         had it... His grandfather had it... 
                         And... his BROTHER had it.

               Kyle's eyes grow wide.

                                     KYLE
                         No... No, it isn't true!

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         We're not going to cut it off. We're 
                         just going to snip it, so that it 
                         looks bigger.

                                     STAN
                         Oh... Hey that doesn't sound like a 
                         bad idea.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I wanna get a circumstition 
                         too!

               Kyle thinks.


               Everybody is gathered around Ike and the Doctor in a big 
               circle with wide eyed anticipation.

                                     KYLE
                         It's okay, Ike. I'm here.

                                     DOCTOR SCHWARTZ
                         And a one, and a two and a... BRIS! 
                         SNIP!

                                     IKE
                         ABA BABA!!

               Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny all pass out.

               The small crowd does a cocktail clap and then immediately 
               starts dispersing and conversing.

               Ike hobbles over to Kyle.

                                     IKE
                         Baba ama mama.

               Kyle wakes up.

                                     KYLE
                         Ike... You're okay.

               The boys all get up.

                                     STAN
                         Wow, dude. I guess having a Bris 
                         isn't all that bad.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, you know I've learned something 
                         today. Family isn't about who's blood 
                         you have. It's about who you care 
                         about.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                                     KYLE
                         And that's why I feel like you guys 
                         are more than just friends. You're 
                         my family.

               Everybody smiles and starts to wonder off.

                                     KYLE
                         Except for Cartman.

                                     STAN
                         Naturally.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Screw you guys! I don't WANT to be 
                         in your penis chopping family anyway!

                                         EPILOGUE

               Garrison shakes his head.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I was wasting my life, hiking in the
