      We don t see it yet -- only Bishop s wide eyes.  He lifts a 
      radio to his mouth -- still staring as --

      We see it now...

      An IMMENSE WIDE-BODY JETLINER -- sitting on the tarmac in 
      total fucking darkness.

                                  BISHOP
                    No lights.  Engines shut down. 

                                  ATC
                    Oh, Jesus.  All dark -- looks like 
                    a dead animal --

      ATC joins him, squinting at the dark plane.

                                  BISHOP
                    No movement.  All the window shades *
                    are pulled down.

                                  ATC
                    Not all of them...

      The ATC points at a window shade half open.

      Approaching SIRENS and multicolored lights.  Bishop turns.

                                  BISHOP
                    Scramble all emergency responders 
                    to Taxiway Foxtrot.

                                  ATC
                    SWAT, Homeland Security?

                                  BISHOP
                    Port Authority, FBI, TSA, CDC...  
                    No one on the tower calls home.  No 
                    one shares the news.  This is bad.  
                    Real bad.  We got ourselves a dead 
                    plane.

      When he turns back -- the window shades are ALL closed now.

                                        ACT ONE



      SUPER: 33RD STREET, ASTORIA, QUEENS

      DR. EPHRAIM GOODWEATHER (40), epidemiologist.  He parks his 
      Explorer in a  No Parking Commercial Loading Zone  spot in 
      front of a classic Queens brownstone.

      He sticks a  CDC OFFICIAL BUSINESS  placard on his dash and 
      rushes to the sidewalk, throwing on a sports jacket, 
      struggling with a necktie.

      A stranger (MATT SAYLES, 35, fit, blond, tall and bland) 
      leans against a green Prius, checking his phone while sipping *
      an iced cappuccino through a straw.*

                                  MATT
                    Is there really a medical 
                      emergency?

                                  EPH
                    Uh?*

                                  MATT*
                    The sign -- is there a real medical *
                      emergency?*

                                  EPH*
                    There will be if I can t get this 
                    tie on.  Know how to knot this?*

                                  MATT
                    I wear a clip-on, man.*

                                  EPH
                    Waiting for someone?*
                          (Matt nods)*
                    Do me a favor, tell the meter *
                    maid... CDC business, will you?

                                  MATT
                    Sure thing.



      Outside a cordon of lights shining on the dormant Regis Air 
      flight 753, anxious SAFETY OFFICIALS confer.

      DR. NORA MARTINEZ (35) is compellingly attractive.  A 
      biochemist with a social medicine background, she cares more 
      about people than the diseases that threaten them.

                                  NORA (INTO PHONE)
                    Bad.  I have -- oh, about twelve *
                    different agency officials about to 
                    have a dick measuring contest here.*

      Nora stands up to the various Agency Officials.



      Eph exiting, still smarting.

                                  EPH (INTO PHONE)
                    No, no, no -- don t let them take *
                    it.  International flight, vessel *
                    docking from Berlin, Germany, CDC 
                    has the first call.  I ll be there 
                    in less than twenty.  Can you keep 
                    the measuring contest going? 

                                  NORA
                    Only if I show them mine.*

                                  EPH*
                    Do it.  They ll wait.*

      Eph crosses to his Explorer.  He stops -- finding a PARKING 
      TICKET from under the wiper.  He pulls it out.  Then turns.

      Matt is standing there sipping the last drops of coffee.*

                                  MATT
                    Sorry, I guess the Meter Reader 
                    didn t see it as much of an 
                      emergency.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    THE STRAIN #101 10th rev. 09/19/13 (2nd Gold)   17.

      CONTINUED:2727

      Eph s takes a looks at Matt s plate:  SRS . MAN 

                                  EPH
                    Matt, huh?

      He picks up the parking ticket.

                                  MATT
                          (stands his ground)
                    That s me.

                                  EPH
                      Interesting.

      Eph drops the ticket on the dashboard next to two dozen more, 
      yellowing, faded. 

                                  EPH (CONT D)
                    Too bad I m in a hurry, Matt.  But 
                    I look forward to seeing you again, 
                    Matt.

                                  MATT
                    Anytime.

      He leaves.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Drive safe.



      Nora and JIM KENT (35), the savvy and trustworthy political 
      operative of the Canary Group, intercept Eph ahead of the 
      scrum of Agency Officials.

                                  JIM
                    Hey.

                                  EPH
                    Hey.

                                  JIM
                    All right.  Press starting to show *
                    up.  Sniffing around.  And Homeland 
                      Security s desperate to push the 
                    button on a terror alert, as 
                    always.  They want to go in the *
                    plane.  Now.

      Eph slows... taking in the sight of the MASSIVE AIRCRAFT.  
      Jim hands him a small 300ml CARTON of milk, opens it.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)            THE STRAIN #101 8th rev. 09/14/13 (Full 2nd Yellow)   18.

                                  EPH
                    Jim, Jim, terrorists usually crash *
                      airplanes, not land them and shut 
                    them down.  What are the 911 calls 
                    saying?

      Nora and Jim look at each other.  Eph drinks the milk.*

                                  NORA
                    There haven t been any.

                    None?  Shit.*

      Eph continues into the fray of Officials.

                    for takeoff, everybody was texting,

                    Surface of the plane is too cold.  
                    Blocks it all like a screen.  But

      The Homeland official gives Eph a small DIGITAL RECORDER WITH 
      A SCREEN SHOWING FREQUENCIES.  SUPER HI-TECH.  Eph listens.

      Eph hears a RUSTLING and a low, guttural VOICE.  Maybe a 
      laughter or a grunt.

                                  EPH
                    What do you think that is?

      He looks at Jim and Nora.

                    Sounds like something moving, a

      a CDC chauffeured VAN is DR. EVERETT BARNES (60), a genial 
      southern country doctor who used political wiles to rise to 
      the head of the CDC.  He is in civilian clothes.

                                  JIM

      Eph texts back:

       BIG NIGHT.  GO TO BED BUDDY.  CALL U TMRRW LV U - DAD 

      He sends and sighs.  A faint smile in his lips.

      Nora comes out --

                                  NORA*
                    Eph, let s go.  Barnes is waiting *

      She kisses him on the cheek.  He smiles.*

      SUPER: EAST 116TH STREET, HARLEM, MANHATTAN

      AUGUSTIN  GUS  ELIZALDE (21) is handsome, Mexican, and 
      dangerous.  GANG INK marks his arms and neck.  He takes zero 
      shit.  On his arm a SKULL AND BLACK HEART TATTOO.

      Next to him are TWO HOMIES (not Crispin or Short Homie).  
      They are all drinking from BEER BOMBS.

      Gus is shadow boxing there in the alley, and he s fucking *
      good -- got game.*

                                  GUS

      The Homes are impressed with his skills.*

                                  EICHHORST
                    You are avoiding me, Gus.

      Eichhorst looks at the Homies.  Gus gets it.

                                  GUS
                    Shit man, you just appeared there, 
                    uh?  Boom!  You an  my girlfriend -- 
                    you are one spooky bitch!
                          (beat)
                    How did you find me, Guerito?

      He signals his homies to go.  They obey.  Eichhorst shows Gus 
      an ENVELOPE.

                                  EICHHORST
                    As we agreed, you will pick up the 
                    vehicle at the airport.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  THE STRAIN #101 11th rev. 09/22/13 (3rd Blue)   47A.

      Eichhorst presses the envelope on Gus with his wax-like hand.

                                  GUS
                    Airport?  Pffft.  No, no, no,

      Gus rips open the envelope.  He pulls out five crisp $100 
      BILLS... and some DOCUMENTS, car KEYS and a JFK I.D. CARD.  *
      CDC PLACARD.*

                                  EICHHORST
                    You will enter through a service 
                      staircase, get the vehicle.  When 
                    you get to a barricade, you will be 
                    let through.

      Hands him a STONEHEART card.

                                  EICHHORST (CONT'D)
                    It s all arranged.

                                  GUS
                     It s all arranged.   Calm down, 
                    James Bond...
                          (beat)*
                    I ve never failed you, Guerito.*

                                  EICHORST*
                    This is different.  I need to make *
                    sure.*

      Gus sees that in the envelope there are more DOCUMENTS: the 
      first is Gus s rap sheet, his juvenile jacket, listing 
      convictions for theft and manslaughter.

      The second shows photocopies of his driver s license -- and 
      those of his mother, GUADALUPE, and his brother, Crispin -- 
      and we realize his brother is the same guy we saw trying to 
      sell a watch to Setrakian earlier.

                                  EICHHORST
                    Your brother s criminal record and *
                    your mother s immigration status.

      Gus glares at Eichhorst.

                                  GUS
                    If this is a threat -- you just 
                    made a big mistake, puto.

      Gus s hand drifts down near the side of his waistband, where 
      one might carry a handgun.  Eichhorst stays cool as a 
      cucumber.

                                  EICHHORST

      The prospect of $500 more in cash changes things.

                    I get picked up driving a stolen

                    It is not stolen.  You will be let *

                    I do this for you, this is the end.  
                    Lose my number.  I m trying to do 
                    right by my madre now -- 
                          (looks at the papers)
                    Anything happens to her, I ll find 
                    your waxy ass.

      Again, Eichhorst is unmoved.

                                  EICHHORST
                    The task is time-sensitive.  Three 
                    rules: You will not examine the 
                    cargo.  You will not make any 
                    stops.  And you will cross the 
                    bridge back into Manhattan before 
                    daybreak.  Do you understand?

      Gus feels abundantly bad about this -- should he cap this 
      motherfucker?  He really thinks about it... but finally nods.

                                  EICHHORST (CONT D)
                    In English, then.  The three rules.  
                    So I can hear them.

      Gus raises three fingers, counting...

                                  GUS
                    Screw you...  Suck my dick...  It 
                    will get done.

      Gus moves away.  Eichhorst smiles.  Unseen by Gus, his neck 
      engorges and the flesh fluctuates, undulating. 



      SUPER: JFK AIRPORT - TERMINAL 4

      Setrakian goes up an escalator and approaches a crowd of 
      MEDIA arriving for the press conference.  A pack of GOTHS 
      with  ECLIPSE SERENADE  T-shirts SIGNS and 8x10 GLOSSY 
      PHOTOS, both B&W and COLOR -- Bolivar s devoted fans -- 
      almost get past AIRPORT SECURITY before they are stopped.

      ...then slips down a side corridor.  Ahead -- a more 
      fortified security checkpoint.  Jim, nearby, spots him.  No

                    Only relatives.  Sir...

      Setrakian turns his back, studiedly, and we can see him 
      formulating a plan, quickly.

                                  SETRAKIAN
                    My grandson, he was in that

      He grabs the wall...  The old man points to his vest pocket 
      over his heart.

      The Cop wants nothing to do with a heart attack victim.  Jim 
      cuts in.

                                  JIM
                      Wheelchair!  We got a medical here!



      Eph steps outside --

                    Then stop it!!  Stop everyone!!  *

                    Remember that box?  The one with

      Jim is on the radio, nodding and walking fast.

                    Got it -- no big vehicles in or out 
                    of the security zone.  On it.



      Gus exits the garage, driving in the CDC van.  He turns 
      and...

      ...runs right into a security checkpoint up ahead.

      BACK TO GUS S VAN8080

      A SWAT CANINE HANDLER approaches the van from the rear with a 
      GERMAN SHEPHERD.  The dog HITS on something... then abruptly 
      SITS, refusing to obey its Handler.

      The SWAT Cop sees Gus s chest tattoo over his shirt collar.*

                                  SWAT TEAM COP

      Gus must make a stand.  He readies his concealed gun... 
      slowly opening the door...

      ...but someone on the outside shuts it before he can exit.

      It s Jim.  He shows the SWAT Cop his ID.

      The SWAT COP shows him the Stoneheart card.  Jim thinks long 
      and hard... and then, unexpectedly:

                    This vehicle is one of ours.  Let 
                    it through.

      The SWAT Cop hesitates...

                    I said let it through.

      SWAT Cop looks at the Handler in frustration... but has no 
      choice other than to follow orders.  He stands aside.  Gus 
      looks to Jim for some acknowledgement.

                                  JIM (CONT D)

                    done.

      Gus drives on through and away.

      Jim, in turmoil, steps away and answers Eph:

      Jim is in hell.  He looks at the Stoneheart card and rips it 
      to pieces.



      Jim catches up with an exhausted and flummoxed Eph and Nora.

                                  JIM
                    Anything on your end?

                                  EPH
                    Not much.  Just wondering how a 500 *
                    pound, nine foot tall coffin just *
                    walked away... vanished.

                                  NORA
                    You called it a  coffin. 

                                  JIM
                    We re bound to get a break.  We 
                    always do.*
                          (beat)
                    We just need a place to start.

                                  EPH
                    We got that.

    Eph holds up the acrylic sample box. 

                                  JIM
                    What the hell is that thing?

                                  EPH
                    Something new.

                                  NORA
                    Or something really, really old...

      Inside the soil, the thin, white worms are wriggling.



      SUPER: 59TH STREET BRIDGE

      The song grows on the soundtrack.

      The CDC van crosses the Queensboro Bridge over the East River 
      into Manhattan as the sun rises on the unsuspecting city...

      Gary moves to her -- overcome by emotion -- clutching her to *
      his chest, hugging her hard... sweeping her up in his arms.*

      Gary carries her into the house.  And closes the door.*

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
