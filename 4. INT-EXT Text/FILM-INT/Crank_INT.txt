We see him sitting on CHEV'S bed ... CHEV is visible in the
frame, unconscious behind VERONA. Pale nicotine sunlight
filters in through the blinds.
There are HOODS loitering
around the room. It was apparently shot only hours before.
(
The discernible sound of CHEV'S heartbeat will subliminally
increase in speed and volume throughout VERONA'S monologue -
the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.)
VERONA
What's shaking, douchebag? Thought I'd
give you the heads up. You're dead.
On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA.
VERONA (CONT'D)
Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ...
if you're watching this tape it means
that I somehow resisted the urge to
dismember you and shove the pieces down
the garbage disposal ... opting instead
to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you
heard me...
We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around
the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND
FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it.
VERONA (CONT'D)
... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep.
How sick is that?... for the satisfaction
of watching you squirm out your last
minutes knowing it was me that did it to
you, and there's nothing you can do about
it...
Cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; CHEV is 5

don't see his face clearly.

it is. All I know is once it binds with
your blood cells, you're fucked, baby...
and believe me, it's done binded. By now
you'll be feeling your joints stiffen
up... hard to breath...
CHEV puts his hand on the left side of his chest to feel his

heart. The BEATS of the heart grow louder still, but the
rhythm falters, begins to slow ...

The THUGS are into it; VERONA is rolling. One of them comes
up beside the bed and plants a big kiss on CHEV'S unconscious
head.
VERONA (CONT'D)
Hey, it's been real. Probably should've
thought twice before you whacked Don Kim.
Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? I
thought so. Have a nice death...
Finally the CAMERA reverses to reveal CHEV'S slack-jawed
6
face, staring at the TV. CHEV is in his late 20s, handsome
in an offhanded way. All of the background noise - the
HEARTBEAT, the CELL PHONE - cuts to dead silence... and
through the silence, a SINGLE WORD:

Finding a drunken man's strength, CHEV flips out. He rips
the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF
THE WALL. He launches it straight into the floorboards with
a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH.
He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system, JUMPS on
it and heads out of the room.
ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through the
apartment and down the hall.
By the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it:
his God-damned CELL PHONE. Of course it stops ringing just
as he picks it up. He pockets it, BANGS OPEN the front door
and is out.

moving RED SPORTSCAR as it backs out of it's parking spot,
walks right over it and hops off, clicking the keyless lock
button on his chain in mid-air ... the door to his BLACK AUDI
pops open ... he gets in.
RED SPORTSCAR GUY is the sort of classic intolerable LA
ASSHOLE we love to hate: platinum hair, suspenders, designer
shades, programming his Blackberry while driving, etc.

This is a eighty thousand dollar ride,

CHEV backs out, runs him right over. CH-KUNK, CH-KUNK.

He grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial.

coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better
dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of
BADASSES.
efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN PRESSED INTO

Clearly you are operating under a false
pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did
not "pull the Anselmo job together." In
fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the
Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes
me seventy five hunna dollars.
CHEV
That's not how I heard it.
ORLANDO
But that's the way it is. That's the way
it is. So you see, I don't know where
Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where
he is, I would probably be there right
now, beating his Gucci ass down.

ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating.

telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop.

amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit
away, crazy bitch ass mother ...
ORLANDO
Thank you. That's what I'm talking
about. That resembles civility.

the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.

tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading.
ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little
plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The
bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.
CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the
floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.
CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it
right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The
BROTHERS find this hilarious.
ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.

We hear CHEV'S heart rate start to build, increase in volume.
Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls,
steadies himself. A new man.

he face on the TV is his - more or less - an exaggerated
black and white POLICE SKETCH, simian browed and thick
lipped. He looks like a serial rapist.

A GUY standing next to CHEV glances sidelong at him. CHEV
turns to meet his eyes. The GUY regards him in a stupor,
then looks down: CHEV's hospital johnnie is sticking straight
out in front, ass hanging out the back, a gun in his left
hand, cell phone in his right.
he GUY looks back up at CHEV'S poker face, gulps, and turns
back to the wall of screens.

some bit of microwave programming, punching random buttons
and getting herself worked up.

Alright, alright, Jesus ...
She gives up on the microwave, goes to answer the door.
EVE (CONT'D)
... calm down, what the hell ...
It's CHEV. He's dressed in a blue Adidas JOGGING SUIT - long
sleeve jacket, warm up pants with buttons down the side, the
works. He couldn't look more out of place in EVE'S mellow
apartment. He's bathed in sweat, wild-eyed, hair slicked
back like GORDON GEKKO.

He pulls her toward him and kisses her. She accepts the kiss
gratefully enough with her mouth, but holds both hands out to
her sides as if touching the JOGGING SUIT would kill her.
Without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into
the apartment, looking around everywhere, paranoid.
EVE
Is this your new look or something?
CHEV
That's right. You into it?
EVE
It's ... completely appalling.

empty.

But ... I ...
CHEV

Confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change.
CHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window,
looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up
and punches two buttons.
EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the
clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18-

CHEV

Great, great ...
He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an
old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting
to smoke.
He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND
PRESSES THE THING CLOSED.
OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE.
e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in
agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out
his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping
up and down.
EVE (O.S.)
You're so stressed out, do you want some
pot?
CHEV
(fighting to get the words out)
Yes. No! ... thanks ...
The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it
out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a
ribbon in her hair.

She turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a

look.

office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the

cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and Koreans
while the SUPERVISOR, oblivious, continues screaming and
forcing the workers back into their chairs.
CHEV puts a finger to EVE'S lips, calming her momentarily...

Come on, let's finish what you started.
CHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He
grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP -
just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out
the front.
EVE'S head STAYS DOWN.
CHEV
Oh boy...
CHEV is straining against the seat, EVASIVE DRIVING as she
GOES DOWN on him.
CHEV (CONT'D)
Oh yeah, that's... that's really working
for me...
EVE'S head pops up. E
VE
(working him up)
You like that?
Shots whiz by.
CHEV
Stay down.
He pushes her head back down.
CHEV'S heart is POUNDING like a jackhammer. He's got himself
arched into a crazy position, making it happen.
CHEV (CONT'D)
That's it that's it that's it... just a
little...
EVE'S head quickly pops back up. She PUSHES AWAY.
CHEV (CONT'D)
(flustered)
What's the matter?
VE
(satisfied)
So you can fall asleep like you always
do? I don't think so.

CHEV loses his mind.
He SLAMS THE BRAKES to put the car into a SLIDE, exposing his
driver side to the pursuing sedan - punches his gun hand out
the window and BLASTS AWAY.
He NAILS THE DRIVER BETWEEN THE EYES... the window
DISINTEGRATES... The SEDAN full of HOODS skids into the
sidewalk. Steam pours from the radiator.
XT. CITY STREET - DAY
CHEV gets out and walks DIRECTLY UP TO THE SEDAN, one hand
holding his gun straight out in front of him, the other
PULLING UP HIS JOGGING PANTS, which are bunched up around his
knees.
CHEV unloads the entire clip into the SEDAN before any of the
HOODS can react.
e walks back to EVE'S CAR, cool as a cucumber, gets in and
pulls away.
NT. EVE'S CAR - DAY
EVE'S face has turned a distinct shade of PALE GREEN.
EVE
Are they... OK?
CHEV looks at her like she's nuts.
CHEV
They're dead.
EVE is overwhelmed.
EVE
How can you... how can you do that...?
CHEV barely hears her - he's become DISTRACTED, flexing his
left hand and feeling around his legs.
CHEV
I told you, baby... I quit.
He spots something, hits the brakes.
CHEV (CONT'D)
Wait here.
He jumps out.

EVE and CHOCOLATE are sitting cross-legged on the mattress,
staring blankly at the TV.
EVE
(no inflection)
I hate television.
CHOCOLATE looks sideways at her: the white girl is CRAZY.
NT. CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT - DAY
DOC shakes his head NO.
CHEV broods silently.
DOC MILES
f you want, I can load you up with
something, you'll go out in a beautiful
dream.
CHEV
A dream.
FLASH CUT: A RED GHOST, pulsing.
DOC MILES
(gently)
Can I do that for you, Chev?
CHEV
No... no, that's not what I want.
DOC MILES
Then ... what?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
CHEV'S moment of weakness passes. His face goes grim with
vengeance as the mean bastard inside him kicks in. He looks
DOC MILES in the eye.
CHEV
One hour.
DOC MILES regards him blankly.
CHEV (CONT'D)
I want one hour.

RICKY VERONA and his CREW are in the back, watching a noisy
satellite feed on dual plasma TV screens. A JAPANESE GIRL in
a red blazer, one of the TOURISTS from the bus, is being
interviewed in Japanese amidst a crowd of her semi-identical
friends. A TRANSLATION is overdubbed.
JAPANESE GIRL
The GIRLS giggle.
JAPANESE GIRL (CONT'D)
VERONA rolls his eyes.
VERONA
Give me a fucking break...
The BROADCAST cuts to a MONTAGE: The trashed restaurant, the
burning Police motorcycle, the car crashed into the mall
escalator, POLICE sifting through wreckage, finally the
sketch of CHEV'S face.

Oh ... you think?

His cell phone rings.
He checks it.
VERONA (CONT'D)
(shaking his head in disbelief)
It's him. Alright, shut up.
He answers.
VERONA (CONT'D)
What's up, corpse.
CHEV
Hey douchebag, thought you might be
interested in a little deal.
ERONA
A deal?
You're mental, dude.
CHEV
I want the antidote.
VERONA
Oh, the antidote, huh?
VERONA makes eye contact with his CREW, covering the
mouthpiece of the phone; they all try to keep from breaking
up.
CHEV
That's right.
VERONA
And what are you prepared to give me.
Asshole.
CHEV
How about the jewelry I got off your
faggot brother, you cocksucker?
This stings VERONA. He pulls the phone away from his face,
looks at it like he wants to smash it into bits, then pulls
himself together and puts it back to his ear.
VERONA
(holding back, tight lipped)
Hmmm.
CHEV
Thinking about it?

VERONA pantomimes jacking off for the boys.
VERONA
Alright.
CHEV
You like that deal?
VERONA
Whatever.
CHEV
I'll be at Downtown Standard in twenty
minutes. You know the spot?
VERONA
Of course.
CHEV
Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing
to some whore for a hand job ...
VERONA
(cutting him off)
I'll be there.
He clicks off, then sits there, seething.
VERONA (CONT'D)
(to the BOYZ)
What the hell are you looking at?
They turn back toward the plasma screens. VERONA takes a
deep breath, then speed dials a number on the cell phone.

From a distance, in a locked off TELEPHOTO frame, we see CHEV
walking toward the CAMERA in slow motion, 100 f.p.s.
Dialog from an UNSEEN CONVERSATION is layered over the image.
EVE (O.C.)
But... you said...
CHEV (O.C.)
I know. But things have changed. There's
an antidote. I can make a deal for it,
but I've got to go alone.
He's well dressed in a sportcoat, slacks, button down shirt
and tie, flapping in the wind ... sunglasses, and look of
brutal determination on his face ...
VE (O.C.)
I'm scared.
CHEV (O.C.)
Of course. But you'll be safe now. And
I'll be back.
In a series of dissolves he comes straight at the CAMERA til
his face fills the frame ...
END MUSIC.
