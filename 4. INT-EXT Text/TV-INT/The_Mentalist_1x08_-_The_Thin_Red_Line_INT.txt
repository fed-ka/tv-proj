      JOE PURCELL S a handsome white male, late 20 s, with a thin 
      wiry frame, sinewy arms with several little scabs like 
      mosquito bites scratched raw.  He has a PISTOL still clutched 
      in one hand.  There s a bullet-hole in his forehead.

      PATRICE MATIGAN is a baby-faced twenty-year-old in jeans, 
      sneakers and a T-shirt.  A hoop pierces her lip and a dyed 
      streak of red hair runs across her bangs.  A keyring in her 
      open hand.  Shot through the heart. 

      A bag of spilled groceries lies between them.  

      Clothes are draped about the place, there s a CD player and 
      speakers set up, plates of half-eaten food.  A bag of white 
      powder on a counter.  A plastic scoop.  Another gun.  A 
      hunting knife.  Over in the corner, Jane notices an electric 
      kettle, a baby s bottle.

                    Davis PD had it covered.  That is 
                    until Purcell went awol a few weeks 
                    ago.  Didn t want to testify I 
                    guess.
                          (beat)
                    With Purcell dead, the case against 
                    Carris dies too. He walks.   
                    So obviously guys, for all our 
                    sakes, this is a must close.    
                    Davis PD is still running the 
                    Carris case so we have to work with 
                    them by the way.  Don t freeze  em

                    That s not cocaine.

      Lisbon dips her finger into the powder to test it.  At the 
      same time, Jane takes the keys out of Patrice s hand and 
      exits the room.  Van Pelt catches this and follows.

                    Joe called her really late.  
                    He s mad hungry, but he s paranoid. 
                    Won t leave his room.  Thinks Rick 
                    Carris  boys are everywhere.  Begs 
                    her to bring him food.  Which she 
                    agrees, like a fool.  And that s 
                    the last I saw her and Kaylee.

                    Nah, it was my drugs.  She didn t

                    She wasn t the hooker type?  
                    So I figured she had a rich

                    of times, an older dude would come

                    She s right.  Those Davis cops are 
                    crazy.

                    They ve been trying to bust this 
                    man Carris for several years.  And 
                    their star witness against him is 
                    shot dead?  A little anger is 
                      understandable.  You couldn t have 
                    handed Carris over to them?

                    If we hadn t kept him in our 
                    custody, I think they might ve 
                    killed him.

      Lisbon and Cho question Rick Carris.  Carris is in his late 
      30 s, a career criminal with the weathered face of a hard 
      life lived.  He s smug, arrogant, almost bored with this.


      Jane watches.


      Rick yawns, theatrically relaxed.

                    Very good.  Not an Aztec.  
                    That s right.  Carris isn t 
                      responsible for these murders.

                    Carris told you himself.  This is 
                    not his style.  He wouldn t have 
                    had the patience to watch and 
                    follow Patrice until she led him to 
                    Purcell.  If Carris had found her, 
                    he would have just jumped right in 
                    and hurt her until she gave up 
                    Purcell.

      He puts down the sandwich and offers his hand to Preciado.  
      Preciado had been on his guard, but distracted by the simple 
      expedient of a sandwich, he lets Jane take his hand in both

                    I was at my partner s house.  We 
                    watched the game and I was too 
                    drunk to drive so I slept on the

                    you were going back East to your 
                    brother s house.  I knew you

                    days home alone, watching old 
                    movies and eating ice cream.

                    Hard to describe pulses, but a 
                    dishonest pulse feels different 
                    than an indignant pulse.  In this 
                    case, hard to say what he was lying 
                    about exactly.  He was signalling 
                    deception from first to last.  
                    There s something off about his 
                    whole story.

                    What s happened?

      Katherine bustles around cleaning up the broken glass and 
      tea.  

                                  KATHERINE
                    Nothing.  Nothing.  Little 
                    accident. 

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    What did you say to her?  What have 
                    you done?

                                  KATHERINE
                    He s done nothing.  Your father...

      She sits down, head in hands.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    My father what?  
                          (to Jane)
                    What did you tell her?  

      Off this, Katherine looks up at Sam with sudden new insight.

                                  KATHERINE
                    You knew.  You knew that s who she 
                    was, didn t you?  That s why you 
                    and him have been whispering in 
                    corners and acting so strange.  

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                          (anguished)
                    Mom, no.  You have it wrong.  You 
                    don t understand.  Dad wasn t 
                    cheating on you...

      The SCREECH OF BRAKES makes all turn, and takes us to:


      Rigsby and Van Pelt enter flanking Dale Blakely, and lead him 
      toward the INTERROGATION ROOM.  Watched by Minelli and 
      Lisbon.

                                    MINELLI
                    Now we re arresting them.  Hooray.

                                  LISBON
                    We have the right.  He assaulted 
                    Jane.  And he looks good for the 
                    murders.  

      Minelli sighs.

                                    MINELLI
                    Before you charge a cop with 
                    murder, he better look better than 
                    good.  He better look like the damn 
                    Mona Lisa. 

                                  LISBON
                    Yes --

                                    MINELLI
                          (cutting her off)
                    Because if you re wrong, we ll have 
                    no murder suspect.  The Attorney 
                    General will have no narcotics case 
                    against Carris.  And we ll have 
                    wrongly arrested a distinguished 
                    veteran officer in his home 
                      jurisdiction.

      As he slouches away.

                                  LISBON
                          (to his back)
                    Yes, boss.


      Cho and Blakely stare at each other.

                    What was the nature of your 
                      relationship with Patrice Matigan? 

                                    BLAKELY
                    I was helping her out.

                    Helping her with close to a 
                    thousand bucks a month.  That s a 
                    lot of help.  What did she give you 
                    in return?

                                    BLAKELY
                    Nothing.

                                  CHO
                    Okay.  What story did you tell your 
                    wife about the money?

                                    BLAKELY 
                    I have nothing else to say.

                                  CHO
                    But how on earth were you making 
                    ends meet?  Did you maybe take a 
                    little drug money now and again? 

                                    BLAKELY
                          (ferociously)
                    I ve never taken a penny.  Not a 
                    penny!  

                                  CHO 
                    So I guess if Patrice started 
                    asking you for more money, you d 
                    have been hard pressed, right?

      Blakely restrains himself.

                                    BLAKELY
                    I want a lawyer.

      Cho rises.

                                  CHO
                    I ll arrange that for you.
                          (turns to go, comes back)
                    Oh yes.  Where s your service 
                    revolver, Detective Blakely?  Agent 
                    Rigsby tells me you didn t have it 
                    with you.

                                    BLAKELY
                    It was stolen.  

                                  CHO
                    Oh?

                                    BLAKELY
                    From my car.

                    Okay.  No problem.  Happens.  
                    A .38 was it?  

                                    BLAKELY
                    Yes.

                                  CHO
                    I ll get you that lawyer. 


      Jane and Lisbon watch Blakely, who stares bleakly at the 
      glass, like a condemned man.

                                  JANE
                    He s not going to talk.  Poor soul. 

                                  LISBON
                    He made his bed.  He has to lie in 
                    it.

                                  JANE 
                    Never understood that one.  Why 
                    does anyone have to lie in a bed 
                    just because they made it?  What s 
                    to stop them from sleeping in 
                    another bed, or on the floor if 
                    they like?  

      Van Pelt comes to the door.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Sam Blakely s here.


      Sam Blakely is waiting, in Davis PD uniform, looking very 
      unhappy.

      Rigsby, smiling and laughing, walks by with Rick Carris, 
      offering him a stick of gum as they go.  Sam watches puzzled.  

      A beat later, Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt appear.

                                  LISBON
                    Officer Blakely, thank you for 
                    coming.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    I had no choice.  You have my 
                    father locked up.

                                  JANE
                    Is your mother okay?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     42.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    You don t worry about my mother.
                    My father is innocent.  

                                  JANE
                    We know that.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    You people are making a terrible 
                    mist -- What?

                                  JANE
                    We know your father didn t do it.


      Van Pelt zips through A GRAINY SURVEILLANCE TAPE on a 
      COMPUTER SCREEN.  It s shot at night and it shows the ALLEY 
      behind a LIQUOR STORE and the DAVIS MOTOR INN PARKING LOT in 
      the BG.

                                  LISBON 
                    This is from the security camera at 
                    the liquor store in front of the 
                    motel.  We finally got to look at 
                    it today.  

      ONSCREEN at high-speed, cars and people coming and going.  
      Van Pelt switches to normal speed. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    This is 12:40 AM.  That s Patrice 
                    Matigan. 

      Patrice Matigan s hatchback pulls into the motel entrance and 
      goes out of sight when she parks.  Then we see her walk 
      across frame headed toward the stairs to room 222, both just 
      out of view.  (What we don t see is the little jump cut in 
      the tape.)  Then, a SMALL ND CAR pulls into the motel 
      entrance. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    And that is Rick Carris  man.  

      The ND CAR parks in view in the motel entrance.

                                  JANE
                    We misjudged Carris.  He found 
                    Patrice, and had a man follow her.  
                    Watch now.  

      A MAN IN SUNGLASSES -- far too grainy and small to tell who 
      he is -- gets out of the ND Car and walks toward the stairs 
      to room 222 and out of view.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     43.

                    Bang bang bang.

      ONSCREEN: A PASSER-BY outside the motel seems to duck 
      instinctively as if at the sound of Jane s pretend gunshots 
      then exits frame.

      Then the man in sunglasses reappears, runs back to his car, 
      gets in and makes a quick exit. 

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    You can see his plate right there.  
                    Can you make it bigger?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yes, we can.  We have it.  

      She demonstrates, ZOOMING IN ON the plate...

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    We know who he is.  A thug who 
                    works for Carris name of Q-Tip.  

                                  JANE 
                    But get this.  Carris says Q-tip 
                    didn t kill Patrice and Joe.  He  
                    says Q-Tip was there to kill Joe,
                    but he got there too late.  Someone 
                    else got to him first.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    That s got to be a bunch of bull.

                                  LISBON
                    Carris says his man Q-Tip saw who 
                    actually killed Joe and Patrice.  
                    Saw the whole thing.  So Carris is 
                    offering us a deal.  If we let him 
                    out, his man Q-Tip will tell us 
                    exactly what he saw, and ID the 
                    real killer.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                          (incredulous)
                    And you believe him? 

      Lisbon and Van Pelt smile, amused.

                                  JANE
                    Of course not.  It s a transparent 
                    con.  Q-Tip killed Joe and Patrice 
                    alright.  Carris is trying to save 
                    his skin by laying the blame 
                      elsewhere. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST     "The Thin Red Line"     CHERRY 11/10/08     44.

                    On your father probably.  We figure 
                    he must know about his connection

                    Facts.  Okay.  Mom suspected that 
                    Dad was having an affair.  He was 
                    spending too much money, and acting 
                    strange.  I said no way.  My dad?  
                    Cheat?  Never.  She said that one 
                    time a long time ago he already 
                    did.  So why not again.  I asked 
                    around on the street, and pretty 
                    soon I hear he s keeping this girl 
                    Patrice Matigan on the side.  I was 
                    mad as hell.  You got to

                    banged into me my whole life.

                    keeping some whore?  No way.  I 
                    went and I asked him if it was 
                    true, and he said no.  I knew he 
                    was lying.  Knew it.  But when I 
                    went to talk to Patrice Matigan, 
                    she d disappeared.  Then last week 
                    I was on a domestic call and I saw

                    -- The name Kaylee doesn t really 
                    suit her if you ask me.  But if you 
                    want to change it, I don t think 
                    anyone will make a fuss.  Goodbye 
                      Katherine.  Goodbye, Dale.

      Jane walks away.  Katherine and Blakely look at Kaylee and 
      Kaylee smiles back, and gurgles.  Katherine smiles.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                        THE END
