Monty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a
leafy street on the Upper East Side.
Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People
are always looking at Monty.
Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before
crushing them out and entering the school.
A four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville.
NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps, reading a book.
Naturelle, in her early twenties, has the lean body of a
runner. It's cold outside but she doesn't seem to mind. When
she sees Monty coming she closes the book and stands.
NATURELLE
How long have you guys been walking? I
woke up at seven and you were already
gone.
_
_
Monty, digging in his pocket for his keys, kisses her for an
answer. Naturelle closes her eyes and tries to embrace him
but Monty abruptly ends the kiss and climbs the stairs.
Doyle wags the stump of his tail.
NATURELLE (CONT'D)
How you doing, Mr. Doyle?
She bends down to scratch him behind his mangled ear.
MONTY
Why you waiting down here?

' NATURELLE
I had my book. It was a beautiful day.

Monty smiles.
MONTY
Of course it was a beautiful day.
He holds the door open for her and Doyle.
Kostya sits on the top step of the stoop, sipping from a
silver flask. A female JOGGER runs past and Kostya calls
after her.
KOSTYA
 Hello ,--teeauti-f-uA~ woman!
-
She doesn't look in his direction. He takes another swig from
his flask.
A young MOTHER pushes a baby stroller past the stoop.
KOSTYA (CONT'D)
Hello, beautiful mother! Hello, little
baby!
The mother doesn't look at him, but the two-year old GIRL,
fascinated, stares at him.
KOSTYA (CONT'D)
(calling after mother)
You look like Julia Roberts. They tell
you this, yes? Come back! I make you a
new baby. I make you a boy!

Monty opens the front door. He stares down at Kostya.
MONTY
What are you doing here?
KOSTYA
So many beautiful women, this
neighborhood. I like very much.
Kostya stands and grips Monty's arm.
KOSTYA (CONT'D)
You are okay?
MONTY
I'm having the time of my life.
KOSTYA
Uncle Blue wants me talking with you. He
wants you coming to Velvet tonight.
MONTY
Yeah, three other people already told me .
He's really dying to say goodbye, huh?
Kostya releases Monty's arm and nods sadly.
KOSTYA
It seems.
MONTY
What does he want?
KOSTYA
I don't know.

MONTY : "-" " """"
~

You came all the way up here to tell me
this? You heard of telephones?
KOSTYA
Yes, I heard, but you don't return my
calls. And Uncle wants to make sure.
MONTY
I'll be there. I'm bringing Naturelle and
some friends.
KOSTYA
You bring her? Why?
MONTY

Why wouldn't I ?

Kostya shrugs.
KOSTYA
We have this conversation one time,
remember? You get angry.
MONTY
Oh , Jesus. She didn't dime me out, man .
KOSTYA
No?
MONTY
Why would she?
Kostya shrugs again.
KOSTYA
Maybe her aunt is illegal alien.
MONTY
What if she is?
KOSTYA
Maybe the Federals threaten her.
Monty shakes his head and walks down the stairs.
MONTY
.
You're insane. She wouldn't do that.
KOSTYA
No? Did you ask her?
Monty--stares--up--at- Kostya for a few seconds before-walking --
away.
Kostya stands at the top of the stoop. He feels something and
raises his palms to the air. The snow has begun to fall.
He looks up into the sky. Something catches his eye -- in one
of the fourth floor windows, Naturelle is staring down at
him.
Kostya watches her. She lets the curtain close. Kostya takes
another slug from his flask.
The snow is falling faster. We watch the flakes spin through
a yellow cone of streetlight.
We see the bar from the street.. The name "Brogan's Bar &
Grill" is written in gold script on the storefront window.
From the outside it looks like any other Bensonhurst bar,
neon beer signs hanging in the window.
Monty walks down the snow-covered street, hands in the
pockets of his camel's hair coat. He watches everything
intently: the passersby, the cars swerving through the slush,
the stores and restaurants.
He stops in front of a fashionable shop. Beyond the plate
glass window, bald mannequins wear the latest styles.
CUT TO:
Monty and Naturelle, hand in hand, stare through the window
at the elegantly attirejl manneguins_ ,,The shop appears to be
closed for the night.
NATURELLE
This is my favorite store.
'
MONTY
I know. Let's go in.
NATURELLE
It's closed.
MONTY
Not for you it's not.
He raps on the window. A SALES CLERK (25) walks over to the
window, peers out and sees Monty. He goes to the door,
unlocks it, holds it open for Naturelle and Monty.
.

CONTINUED:
Naturelle stares at Monty, who smiles and beckons for her to
enter. She raises her eyebrows and goes in. Monty nods to the
clerk as he enters the store.
MONTY (CONT'D)
How you doing?
CLERK
Pretty good, Monty, how you been?
Monty, still remembering, stares through the window. His
reflection stares back at him.
Monty trudges down the sidewalk, followed by Slattery and
Jakob. The snow continues to fall, and lies thickly drifted
on the crookedly-parked cars, on the parking meters, on the
spears of the church gate they pass.
They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the
stairs, disappearing from our view.
CLOSE ON FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW
We slowly follow their path backward. In the yellow shine of
the streetlights the footprints fill with snow, until finally
(the camera still moving backward) they disappear.
Monty, Slattery and Jakob wade through the snow to the stoop
steps.
The snow has finally stopped falling.
(CONTINUED)
101
CONTINUED:
The parked cars lining the avenue look like scoops of vanilla
ice cream, glistening below the streetlights. The awnings of
the buildings, fringed with icicles, creak beneath the weight
of the snow.
Doyle, off his leash, charges down the middle of the avenue,
carving a trail through the foot-deep powder, a drop of ink
rolling down a blank page.
Monty follows behind, twirling circles with the leash.
Slattery and Jakob bring up the rear, slogging through the
snow like weary soldiers.
The only vehicle on the road is a snow plow half a mile
south, its yellow lights flashing.
They cross into the park, past the fenced-in gingko trees,
climbing the stairs that lead to the esplanade.
Doyle spies a squirrel and chases after it, but the squirrel
is quicker, makes it to a red maple and scrambles up the
trunk to safety.
Doyle squats at the foot of the tree, staring sadly up
^\
through the branches.
11W7
Across the river is Queens, and Queens before sunrise is
beautiful: red antennae lights winking to warn pilots; the
Pepsi sign glowing in neon script over the bottling plant;
white clouds rising from the smokestacks like genies.
Behind Queens the sky is beginning to brighten.
-

Jakob brushes snow off the iron balustrade, leans against it
and stares into the river. A string of yellow lights quivers
beneath the waters, reflections from the Queensboro Bridge.
A red tugboat chugs south.
MONTY
It would be good to work a tugboat. Be
out on the river all day.
He turns to face Jakob.
MONTY (CONT'D)
So what do you think? You ready for Mr.
Doyle?

Jakob looks at Doyle, who is rolling on his back in the snow,
kicking his feet in the air like a puppy.
JAKOB
He likes the snow.
Monty whistles for Doyle and the dog jumps to his feet and
runs over, wagging the stump of his tail, his muzzle dusted
with snow.
MONTY
I need a favor, Frank.
SLATTERY
Anything.
Monty refastens the leash onto the dog's collar and ties the
cord around a baluster, knotting it twice, checking to make
sure it's secure.
MONTY
I'm not going in there like this. The
minute they get a look at me, I'm gone.
Monty straightens up and looks directly into Slattery's eyes.
-
MONTY (CONT'D)
Make me ugly.
Slattery looks dumbfounded. He turns to glance at Jakob, who
is equally confused.
Monty clears the snow off the nearest bench, unbuttons his
camel's hair coat, and lays it down.
MONTY (CONT'D)
You just said you'd do anything. So this
is what I need.
SLATTERY
I can't do that. What are you thinking, I
give you a black eye and people won't
fuck with you? It won't change anything.
Monty steps closer.
MONTY
You think I deserve it, don't you?
Slattery holds his hands up and backs away.
SLATTERY
I can't hit you.
(CONTINUED)
103,
CONTINUED : (2)
MONTY
I think you can. I think you want to, a
little bit. I think you've wanted to for
years.
SLATTERY
I'm not doing it.
Monty steps closer again.
MONTY
You want to. Come on, Frank, you're
afraid?
SLATTERY
Listen --
MONTY
What are you afraid of, Frank? That I'll
hit back? You're afraid I'll hit back?
That would be embarrassing, huh, big
tough guy like you getting his ass
kicked?
JAKOB
Come on, this is crazy.
on, t
i.JSh
Come
Monty points at Jakob.
MONTY
Who the fuck is talking to you?
SLATTERY
Forget it. Come on, forget all this.
Let's get some breakfast.
MONTY
This works out pretty well for you,
doesn't it? You're gonna take good care
of Naturelle while I'm gone?
SLATTERY
What?
MONTY
You think I don't see you staring at her
all the time? You've wanted to fuck her
for years.
He shoves Slattery hard. Slattery's eyes narrow for a moment,
but he shakes his head.

SLATTERY
All right. Al l right.
He turns stiffly and walks away.

JAKOB
Come on. Come on , Monty, what are you
doing? Tell him you're kidding.
Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek, the crack
of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade.
Jakob falls back against the balustrade, clutching his face.
JAKOB (CONT'D)
Monty I
Monty steps closer and punches Jakob again, this time in the
gut, and Jakob sinks to his knees, gasping. He covers his
face with his hands, to protect himself.
Slattery tackles Monty, pinning him to the ground.
For a moment everything is still. Doyle, leashed to the
baluster, whines, unsure if his master is playing or
fighting.
Jakob, stunned by the violence, watches. Slattery stares at
Monty and Monty stares back . All :of them in the snow, their
breath coiling and rising into the sky.
Finally Slattery looks away, looks past the East River , past
Queens. He clenches his eyes shut. When he opens them, we see
the first tears forming.
Slattery grabs Monty's throat with his left hand and punches
him in the face with his right, again and again and again.
Doyle howls. He tries to jump on Slattery bu t the leash keeps
yanking him back. He strains forward, fangs bared , bu t his
master is three feet too far.
Jakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers: no blood.
Doyle, barking madly, keeps jumping for Slattery, keeps being
yanked back by the leash.
Jakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himsel f to his
feet.
JAKOB (CONT'D)
Frank... Frank!

CONTINUED : (4)
The bloo d puddles by Monty's head, melting through the snow
and steaming in the air. Slattery, lost in hi s anger , his
frustration, continues swinging.
Jakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him.
JAKOB (CONT'D)
Stop!
Slattery looks up , his face wet with tears , a webbin g of
saliva between his lips .
JAKOB (CONT'D)
Okay. Enough.
Jakob grabs the bi g man under the armpits and help s hi m rise .
Slattery looks down at Monty, who is not moving .
SLATTERY
Oh Jesus .
Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach . Monty
coughs, a thick ribbon of blood falling from hi s mouth .
Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gentl y pressing
it to Monty's brutalized face.
Doyle continues to bark, the collar digging into his throat
as he struggles to reach his master.
Slattery watches , speechless, his bloodied hand s by his side.
Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins
crawling forward.
Hold still for a minute. Hold still .
When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneat h him.
Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls an d lowers
him to the snow.
JAKOB (CONT'D)
Don't try to move yet.
Monty pushes himsel f off the ground again and thi s time
manages to keep hi s balance, though he sways lik e a drunk.
MONTY
(slurring)
It's okay .
106,
CONTINUED : <5)
Blood leaks from his nose, from his mouth, from a deep gash
bisecting one eyebrow. The entire left side of his face is
bright red, already swelling.
Slattery looks at him and moans , sits down heavily in the
snow, his chin tucked against his chest, his right hand,
slick with blood, covering his face.
SLATTERY
Oh Jesus.
JAKOB
Hospital.. We need to take you to the
hospital.
MONTY
No .
He staggers toward them. Doyle is mewling now, stomping his
paws, confused. Monty bends down unsteadily and scratches
behind the dog's ear.
MONTY (CONT'D)
(to Doyle)
Be a good boy.
He walks over to Slattery, wh o sits in the snow, sobbing.
Monty leans over and kisses his forehead.
MONTY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry.
Slattery rocks back and forth, hands over his face, his
forehead marked with blood.
Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder.
MONTY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Jake.
Jakob is stunned by what's happened in the last few minutes .
He has no idea what to say.
JAKOB
Okay.
MONTY
Take care of my dog.
He grabs his coat from the park bench and walks away from
them.

(
Naturelle, in her down parka, sits on the stoop steps. She
sees him when he's a block away, and we see him from that
distance, limping through the snow.
Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply. She starts walking
toward him but stops after a few steps. She can see his face
now.
His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesn't notice her
until he's almost upon her. When he does see her he smiles,
and Naturelle has to look away for a moment.
He tries to say something but chokes, leans over, hands on
his knees, and spits up blood.
Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps.
Mr. Brogan's car is double-parked. The roof of the old Honda
is crowned with snow but the windshield and rear window have
been swept clean.
Slattery sits on a park bench overlooking the river. It's the
same bench Monty sat on the day before. Slattery is alone on
the snow-covered esplanade.
His knuckles are covered with dried blood. His forehead is
marked with blood.
He watches the sun rise over Queens.
Jakob and Doyle walk south along the western edge of Carl
Schurz Park. A SKIER, an attractive young woman in her mid-
twenties, schusses toward them on cross-country skis.
She smiles at Jakob as she passes.
SKIER
Cool dog.
JAKOB
Thanks.
He turns and watches her glide down the hill toward 86th
Street. He looks down: at Doyle. Doyle looks-iap- at ~hifff. TM
-
JAKOB (CONT'D)
Cool dog.
Jakob shakes his head and smiles, and they continue walking
south.
As Mr. Brogan speaks, we watch the car driving west. The
voice-over tracks with the images on the screen.
MR. BROGAN (V.O.)
Head out to the middle of nowhere.
CUT TO:
The car speeds along a desert highway now, past the pitchfork
cacti and towering mesas.
CUT TO:
The car drives slowly down the main street of a one stoplight
town.
MR. BROGAN (V.O.)
Find a nice little town.
CUT TO:

Mr. Brogan parks in front of a small bar with an old-
fashioned BAR sign in front. Mr. Brogan and Monty (his face
unmarred) step out of the car.
CUT TO:
Monty sits on the steps in back of the bar, looking out past
the gravel lot toward the distant mountains.
MR. BROGAN (V.O.)
And then you wait. People get caught when
they come home. But you're never coming
home.
Monty, a few years older, waits as a Greyhound bus pulls into
the station.
MR. BROGAN (V.O.)
And maybe -- and this is dangerous-- but
maybe after a couple years you send word
to Naturelle.
Naturelle steps off the Greyhound bus. She sees Monty. They
stare at each other, twenty feet apart.
Finally he goes to her, threading through the other
travellers, the other waiting families. He takes her in his
arms.
