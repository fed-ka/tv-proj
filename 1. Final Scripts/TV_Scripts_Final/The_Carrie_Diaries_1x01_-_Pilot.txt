                                        ACT I


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - CARRIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING - 
      FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

      Modern English s  I Melt with You  blares on a nearby boom 
      box. CLOSE ON a stack of INTERVIEW Magazines, as THE CAMERA 
      PANS across the messy room of a teenage girl, and LANDS ON 
      SAID GIRL dressed in a sweet a nightgown. We can only see her 
      from the back as she tears through her closet - clothes and 
      shoes being tossed with wild abandon.  She is clearly looking 
      for something.

                                  SAID TEENAGE GIRL (V.O.)
                    They say the key to being a 
                      successful writer is finding your 
                    voice.

      With a loud frustrated scream, she turns and WE SEE our YOUNG 
      CARRIE BRADSHAW, quirky, beautiful in an interesting way, 
      race to her chest of drawers opening and closing them.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Well, I had found my voice.  I just 
                    didn t know how to use it.

      As she slams the last drawer shut, a sudden realization dawns 
      on her.

                                  CARRIE
                          (shouting out)
                    Dorrit!  

      She rushes out of her room into...


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      ... and collides with DORRIT BRADSHAW, her gawky fourteen-
      year-old sister, dressed in all black and sporting some very 
      intense black eye make-up, as she comes out of the bathroom.

                                  CARRIE
                            (accusatory)
                    Where s the purse?

      Dorrit doesn t stop walking.  She heads into her room.

                                  DORRIT
                    What purse?                                                                         2.


                                  CARRIE
                    Give me a break, Dorrit.  You know 
                    exactly what purse I m talking about.  
                    Mom s purse.

      As they enter Dorrit s room...


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - DORRIT'S BEDROOM

      ...A strange combination of the childish - stuffed animals, 
      girly bedding - and burgeoning teenager - posters of the 
      Smiths, Depeche Mode, etc. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I know you took it.

                                  DORRIT
                          (couldn t care less)
                    I didn t take it, Carrie.

      Carrie starts to look under Dorrit s bed and in her drawers.  

                                  DORRIT (CONT D)
                    You can t go through my shit.

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh yes, I can.

      She opens a drawer.  Reacts.  Takes out a bag of pot.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    You have pot?  

                                  DORRIT
                    Your friends smoke pot.

                                  CARRIE
                    You re fourteen!

                                  DORRIT
                    So? 

                                  CARRIE
                    So, if Dad finds out he s going to 
                    kill you.

                                  DORRIT
                    So you better not tell him.

      As the girls begin to argue in full...                                                                         3.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    The year? 1984.  Danielle Steele s 
                    romance novels were all the rage, we 
                    had an actor for a President and most 
                    people could say they were better off 
                    now than they were four year ago.  
                    Except us - the Bradshaws.  Four 
                    years ago we had our mom.  And three 
                    months ago we lost her to cancer.  
                    Things were definitely not better.

      As their screaming turns into hitting and hair pulling...

                                  CARRIE
                    Where is the purse?

      Dorrit bites her arm.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Owwwww!

      Her dad, TOM BRADSHAW, traditionally handsome with a whiff of 
      vulnerability and sadness, rushes in.

                                  TOM
                    What the hell is going on in here?

                                    CARRIE/DORRIT
                    She bit me./She s going through my 
                    stuff.

                                  TOM
                    We don t have time for this.  You 
                    both have to be at school in a half 
                    hour. Go on Carrie.  Get dressed.  
                    You can t be late on the first day.

      Carrie rubbing her arm where Dorrit bit her, heads out.  She 
      glares at Dorrit.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                          (heading out)
                    And Dorrit...that is way too much eye 
                    make-up.


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - CARRIE'S BEDROOM

      Tom catches up with Carrie and heads into her room.

                                  TOM
                    Carrie.  You re the older one.  You 
                    can t take the bait.

                                  CARRIE
                    I have teeth marks on my arm.                                                                         4.


                                  TOM
                    I know Dorrit can be... difficult.  
                    But your mom would want you two to 
                    get along.

                                  CARRIE
                    I know.

                                  TOM
                    You re like me, Carrie. Practical and 
                      level-headed.  That s why you re 
                    going to make such a great lawyer.

      Carrie preens a bit hearing her father s compliments.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    So whatever you were fighting about, 
                    know it s not worth it.

      Carrie hesitates.  Should she tell him about the pot?

                                  CARRIE
                    She stole Mom s purse.

                                  TOM
                    You don t know that.

      She gives him a look.  They both know it.

                                  CARRIE
                    I can t go to school without it, Dad.

      Carrie plops on her bed. 

                                  TOM
                    You re going to school, Carrie.

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t have anything to wear.

                                  TOM
                    You have an entire closet filled with 
                    clothes which now seem to be mostly 
                    on the floor.

                                  CARRIE
                    Mom used to take me shopping for an 
                    outfit.  It was a thing we did.  Back-
                    to-school clothes.

                                  TOM
                          (nervous)
                    Ok...

      Tom sits down next to her on the bed, uncomfortable.  This is 
      bigger than just back-to-school jitters.                                                                         5.


                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Did you want me to take you?

                                  CARRIE
                    No.  It s supposed to be mom.  I just 
                    want it to be mom.

                                  TOM
                    I see.

                                  CARRIE
                    I need the purse.  I need a piece of 
                    her.

                                  TOM
                    I have an idea.


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - MOM'S CLOSET

      Tom and Carrie step up to the doors of her mother s closet.  
      Tom opens them as if cracking open a precious vault.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    My mother left us on Memorial Day.  
                    And that is what this closet felt 
                    like.  A memorial. A still life of 
                    our life without her.

      All of her mother s clothes hang exactly as they have since 
      her death. Carrie enters and gently brushes her hands across 
      a rack of undisturbed clothes.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    As if leaving it untouched might 
                    somehow bring her back.  We had been 
                    forbidden to enter.  Until now.

      She breathes in the scent of her mother's clothes - a whiff 
      of her maybe still there.  She drinks it in.  As she reaches 
      for a dress, her father comes in and stops her. 

                                  TOM
                    Not that dress.  She wore it on her 
                    last birthday.

      Off Carrie s look.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    You could spill something on it, or 
                    rip it.

      He walks over to a dresser, also untouched.  There are 
      perfume bottles, jewelry, and loads and loads of prescription 
      pill bottles.  The dresser of a sick woman.  He picks up a 
      pair of Jackie O sunglasses and hands them to Carrie.                                                                         6.


                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    You can have these.  Just make sure 
                    they don t get broken in your back 
                    pack.

                                  CARRIE
                    Really?  I ll be super careful. 

      Carrie takes the glasses and steps in front of the dresser 
      mirror.  She puts on the sunglasses, fixing her hair and 
      looking at herself in the mirror.  These glasses feel like 
      armor, in a good way.  AS THE CAMERA PUSHES IN...

                                                                        MATCH CUT:


      EXT. CASTLEBURY HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

      CLOSE ON Carrie's face in her mother's glamorous sunglasses 
      as she looks up at her high school - a place so familiar, yet 
      almost foreign with every thing she has been through.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    The first day of school was something 
                    I usually found exciting. A new 
                    beginning with endless possibilities. 
                    But the last time I had stood on 
                    these steps, my father had come to 
                    tell me my life as I knew was about 
                    to come to an end.   I was afraid to 
                    walk through those doors.  So much 
                    had changed for me.  But in those 
                    halls so much remained the same.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL Carrie - insecure, hesitant - surrounded 
      by laughing, giddy students rushing up the stairs, ready to 
      start their new year.  Carrie takes a breath and walks up the 
      stairs.  Hesitant, she opens the door.  It creaks, loudly.  
      She takes a breath and enters.  WE SEE...


      INT. CASTLEBURY HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - SAME DAY

      A high school hallway with all its cliques and cliches.  As 
      Carrie walks through the hallway, She checks out all the 
      different types of kids and crowds - the jocks, the hot 
      freshman girls, the D&D dorks, the Goths.  Carrie keeps walks 
      down the hall with the distinct feeling that all eyes on her.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    But this first day of school was 
                      different.  As I watched everyone 
                      whispering and passing around the 
                    news of the day like mono after a 
                      Homecoming dance, I realized that I 
                    was the virus. The freak who had lost 
                    her mom.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                         7.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It was as if people were almost 
                    afraid to make contact.  Like I was 
                      contagious.

      We see DONNA LADONNA - very pretty with a sexy laugh and an 
      insane amount of confidence in her star power.   She is 
      dressed like Madonna and pulling it off.   The Jens are plain 
      girls making the most of it with perms and gobs of eye make-
      up, looking like poor copies of Donna LaDonna.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Except Donna LaDonna and her minions, 
                    The Jens.  The popular girls.  Donna 
                    was just twisted enough to think a 
                      connection to tragedy would make her 
                    just that much more compelling and 
                    she wouldn t be wrong.

      Donna looks straight at Carrie.

                                  DONNA
                    Carrie, you poor girl.  Are you doing 
                    okay? 

      The Jens nod, empathy in connection to Donna comes easy.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m fine. 

                                  DONNA
                    If you need anything -- a shoulder to 
                    cry on, some fashion tips or maybe 
                    even a wand of mascara. I m here for 
                    you.

                                  CARRIE
                    I ll keep that in mind.  Thanks.

      Carrie walks off, not eager to be in Donna s crosshairs.  She 
      lands at her group of friends, never more happy to see them 
      than today.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    And then there were my people, who 
                    loved me even though I was a freak.  
                    Or maybe because of it.

      JILL THOMPSON aka THE MOUSE, intense, extremely bright and 
      loyal, hugs Carrie hard. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Mouse.  

                                  THE MOUSE
                    You re my scarecrow.  I love you most 
                    of all.                                                                          8.


                                  CARRIE
                    I know.  And I need it.

      As they break apart MAGGIE LANDRES, overtly sexy and working 
      it, goes to hug her tight.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Boob to boob, baby. What did Donna 
                    want?

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t know and that s what makes it 
                    so scary.

      WALT REYNOLDS, stylish preppy, puts an arm around Carrie with 
      a warmth befitting their very close bond.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Nice sweater. Is that the...

                                  WALT
                    The one Rob Lowe was wearing in 
                      Interview? Yep. Got it at I. Magnum.  
                    Half-off.  How you holding up?

                                  CARRIE
                    I d be a lot better if I didn t feel 
                    like everyone was staring at me.  
                    Poor little orphan Carrie.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Oh please.  No one s even paying 
                    attention to you.

                                  WALT
                    Believe it or not, I think Mags meant 
                    that as a compliment. 

                                  MAGGIE
                    There s way bigger news today.

                                  CARRIE
                    I already heard Diet Coke replaced 
                    Tab in the vending machine.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Better!

                                  THE MOUSE
                    I have to agree.  New kid.

                                  MAGGIE
                    New guy.  A junior. Like us.                                                                         9.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    This was big news.  Nothing and 
                    nobody new ever came into Castlebury, 
                      Connecticut.  This was a place you 
                    left.  Not a destination.   

                                  CARRIE
                    Does new kid have a name?

                                  MAGGIE
                          (gleeful)
                    Sebastian Kydd.  

      Off Carrie, remembering...


      EXT.  CASTLEBURY SWIM CLUB - TWO YEARS BEFORE - FLASHBACK

                                  MAGGIE (V.O.)
                    Even his name is cool.  

      An Olympic size pool.  Kids running everywhere.  CARRIE 
      stands on the high dive.  HER POV SEBASTIAN KYDD, already 
      handsome with an edge of cocky, watching her.  Their eyes 
      lock, she breaks the moment by leaping gracefully off the 
      board&

                                  MAGGIE (V.O.)
                    Kicked out of three boarding schools. 
                    His parents are totally rich.  He 
                    drives a Corvette.  Super fox.


      INT. CASTLEBURY HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - PRESENT

      BACK TO SCENE...

                                  WALT
                          (he doesn t care)
                    Mags, you do realize I m standing 
                    right here, and I m your boyfriend?

      She playfully swats at him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    One of the Jens said she heard he got 
                    kicked out of school for having sex 
                    with a teacher...

      Suddenly a hush comes over the hallway.  SEBASTIAN KYDD 
      strides down the hall and everyone stops to stare at him.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    There he was. The New Kid.  Sebastian 
                    Kydd.  The kind of guy who deserves 
                    to have a hallway hush for him.                                                                       10.


      He walks straight up to Carrie.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Hey Bradshaw.

      Walt, The Mouse and Maggie react.  He knows her name???

                                  CARRIE
                    Hey.

      Everyone in the school watches their exchange.  ANGLE ON 
      Donna LaDonna and The Jens not liking this.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Heard about your mom.

      Carrie nods, feeling exposed.

                                  SEBASTIAN (CONT D)
                    Real bummer.

                                  CARRIE
                    Thanks.

      The BELL RINGS.  Breaking the moment.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I should go. 
                          (with a wink)
                    Don t want to get kicked out of 
                    another school.  See you around?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, see you around.

      Sebastian walks off.  She turns to Maggie, Walt and The Mouse 
      who stand with mouths agape.

                                  MAGGIE
                    You have a lot of explaining to do.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    The Barn, at lunch?

      Carrie nods.


      INT. BARN - LUNCH TIME

      The Barn - a cavernous old space which abuts the high school 
      property.  Outside, there is a place for a bonfire. Inside 
      are picnic tables and beat up old couches.  This will be our 
      group's proverbial  coffee shop.  Carrie, The Mouse and 
      Maggie sit at a junky old picnic table.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    I can t believe you know him.                                                                       11.


                                  MAGGIE
                    Uhh, more shocking?  He knows you!  
                    No offense.

                                  CARRIE
                    None taken.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I need to know everything. I can t 
                    believe you hid this from us.

                                  CARRI
                    I m not hiding anything. I swear. A 
                    couple summers ago he hung out at the 
                    swim club.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    Why don t I swim?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Because you d have to get your hair 
                    wet and your make-up would run.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Raccoon eyes is not a good look for 
                    me. Is that why you re wearing no 
                    make up this year?  Because of 
                    swimming?

                                  CARRIE
                    That and I never know when I might 
                    burst in to tears.

      A moment of uncomfortable silence.  Carrie s vulnerability is 
      palpable.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    You look prettier without it anyway.

                                  CARRIE
                          (shaking it off)
                    Whatever.  Why isn t Walt here?

                                  MAGGIE
                    I told him I wanted it to be just us 
                    girls.

                                  CARRIE
                    Are you two fighting? Again?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    When aren t they fighting?  

                                  CARRIE
                    It s true.  You love your drama, 
                    Magwitch.                                                                       12.


                                  MAGGIE
                    This time it s different.

      The Mouse and Carrie look at each other.  This again.

                                  THE MOUSE 
                    Oh come on.  You guys will never 
                    break up. You re forever. 

                                  CARRIE
                    That s right, and The Mouse and I 
                    will be a couple forever too.  

      The Mouse looks coy but is about to explode with happiness.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Why do you have that look on your 
                    face?

                                  CARRIE
                    Mouse, did you meet someone? Are you 
                    breaking up with me??

      She nods, smiling.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                          (so happy for her)
                    No way!  How?  Where??

                                  THE MOUSE
                    At the Page Program in DC. I ve been 
                    dying to tell you guys.

                                  MAGGIE
                    So start talking.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Seth. Seth Kirstein. He s from 
                      Washington. Started Princeton this 
                    year. He s a freshman.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    I should be with an older guy.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    He s amazing. So smart. We d stay up 
                    all night in the dorms talking about 
                      everything. And I d wake up in his 
                    arms and just think...

                                  MAGGIE
                    That you got laid!!!

                                  CARRIE
                    Just because all you think about is 
                    losing your virginity doesn t mean 
                    The Mouse does.                                                                       13.


      The Mouse says nothing but looks both embarrassed and happy.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    You lost your virginity to Seth?


      INT. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY - DORM ROOM - FLASHBACK

      Exactly what you think - a tiny room with two single beds.  
      In one of the small beds SETH KIRSTEIN, cute-in-a-nerdy-way, 
      is on top of The Mouse. Both are under the covers.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Is it all the way in?

                                  SETH
                    Just the tip.

      The voices of other teenagers can be heard in the hallway 
      outside.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    I m afraid. I don t think it s gonna 
                    fit.

                                  SETH
                    Do you want me to stop?

      She shakes her head no.

                                  SETH (CONT D)
                    Maybe it s better if I just put it in 
                    real fast.

      He thrusts.  The Mouse s eyes bulge wide!


      INT. BARN - PRESENT

                                  CARRIE
                          (reacting to what she s 
                            heard)
                    Owwww!

                                  THE MOUSE
                    It hurt so bad, and there was so much 
                    blood.  And I just kept thinking when 
                    is this going to end.  Luckily, it 
                    did.  He came in like two seconds.

                                  CARRIE
                    Did he wear a condom?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Of course, Carrie.  Like I want a 
                    baby.                                                                       14.


                                  CARRIE
                    Or AIDS.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    It wasn t like that for me at all.  
                    There was barely any blood.  And I 
                    loved it.

                                  CARRIE
                    Wait? You and Walt had sex??

                                  MAGGIE
                    Shit. I wasn t supposed to tell you 
                    guys. Walt will be really mad. You 
                    can t say anything.  

                                  CARRIE
                    When did this happen?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Fourth of July.  

                                  CARRIE
                    So there were literal and figurative 
                    fireworks on July 4th.

      The Mouse giggles.

                                  MAGGIE
                    You said it not me. Sex is awesome. 

                                  CARRIE 
                    So I m the last virgin.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    It s no big deal, Carrie.  Sex isn t 
                      everything.

      Carrie nods not believing that for one minute.

                                  CARRIE
                    So do you regret doing it?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    No.


      INT. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY - DORM ROOM - FLASHBACK

      CLOSE ON The Mouse and Seth's faces as they have sex doggy-
      style - all we can see are their faces but we get the 
      picture. It s good, passionate, orgasm-producing sex.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Oh god. Seth. Oh god.                                                                       15.


                                  SETH
                          (as he is about to come)
                    I love you, Jill. I love you!

      The Mouse reacts.


      INT. BARN - PRESENT

                                  CARRIE
                    Are you in love with him?  

      The Mouse nods, overwhelmed with her feelings.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    We should go on a double date.  Is he 
                    going to come up and visit?

      Carrie looks to her friends wrapped up in their love lives.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    While I had spent my summer grieving 
                    and letting go of my childhood, my 
                    friends were falling in love and 
                    letting go of their virginity. Maybe 
                    a lot more had changed than I 
                    thought.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Maybe we go on triple date.  
                          (to Carrie)
                    You should ask Sebastian out.

                                  CARRIE
                          (shaking her head no)
                      I wouldn t know what to say around a 
                    guy that cute.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Please, you re so smart you can talk 
                    about anything.

                                  CARRIE
                    I think you re talking about the 
                    Mouse.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Oh come on, you do practically as 
                    well as I do but study half as much.

                                  CARRIE
                    Guys like Sebastian don t like smart 
                    girls.  They like pretty ones.

                                  MAGGIE
                    And you re both.                                                                       16.


                                  THE MOUSE
                    He walked right up to you, Carrie.  
                    Like he couldn t wait to see you.

                                  MAGGIE
                    It s true. If you saw Donna s face 
                    you would know.  He s into you.

                                  CARRIE
                    You think?

                                  MAGGIE
                    It d be so cool if you dated him.  

                                  CARRIE
                    At least I d stop being known as the 
                    girl whose mom died.

                                  MAGGIE
                    That s right.  You d be the girl who 
                    snagged Sebastian Kydd.  Ask him to 
                    the New Beginnings Dance.

      The Mouse and Carrie roll their eyes.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Ucch...
                          (as if quoting)
                     A new year, a new beginning. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Wish it was that simple.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Yes, it s lame but you know you re 
                    going.  There s going to be nothing 
                    better to do. 

                                  THE MOUSE
                    That s true.  You should ask him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Maybe you ll get your cherry popped.

                                  CARRIE
                          (reacts)
                      Delightful. Maybe that s how I ll ask 
                    him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    If you do, he ll definitely say yes.


      INT. CASTLEBURY HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

      Carrie scans the crowded hallway looking for Sebastian.                                                                          17.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Virgin: a sexually inexperienced 
                    woman, a blank slate unchanged by any 
                    past intimate connection or 
                      experience.  The uninitiated. 

      She sees him, makes eye contact - so similar to their gaze 
      all those years ago at the swim club - and begins walking 
      towards him.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Yep.  That pretty much described me.  
                    But not for long if I had anything to 
                    say about it.

      Donna LaDonna and The Jens watch Carrie s progress towards 
      Sebastian, not liking what they see.  But for Carrie, it's as 
      if no one else exists.  Sebastian sees her and smiles.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    When I got here this morning I wasn t 
                    sure I would make it through the day 
                    much less the year, but looking into 
                    those eyes I realized I might be 
                    okay.  Maybe even saved.

                                  CARRIE
                          (nervous)
                    Hi.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                          (not nervous)
                    Hey, Bradshaw.

                                  CARRIE
                    Why do you call me by last name?

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Does it bother you?

                                  CARRIE
                    Not really.  I kinda like it.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Cool.
                          (beat)
                    Bradshaw.

      She smiles.  He smiles.  This is going to be good.  

                                  SEBASTIAN (CONT D)
                    So what s up?

      As Carrie looks away for a moment, getting her courage 
      together, she sees her father entering the building. He seems 
      nervous. Carrie reacts.                                                                       18.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    And there he was... my father,   
                    looking worried, confused.  The last 
                    time he had shown up here unexpected, 
                    I lost the most important person in 
                    my life.  Why was he here now?

      IN SLO-MO, Carrie's anxiety begins to rise, she starts to 
        hyperventilate.  As if her dad's voice is in her head, Carrie 
      hears snippets of the last conversation she had with him in 
      these hallways.  

                                  TOM (V.O.)
                    You need to come home.  Not too much 
                    longer.  

      AS THE CAMERA SWIRLS AROUND CARRIE...

                                  TOM (V.O.)
                    She s unconscious.

      As Carrie becomes more and more disoriented and woozy, people 
      began to stare and whisper.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Carrie? Are you okay?  Carrie?

      She's not okay.   Carrie blacks out and falls to the floor 
      with a surprisingly loud crash.  People shout, calling out 
      for help.  

                                  SEBASTIAN (CONT D)
                    Someone get the nurse!!

      Tom sees his daughter on the ground and runs at top speed.  
      Sebastian leans over her. 

                                  SEBASTIAN (CONT D)
                    Carrie!  Carrie!

      Tom pushes him aside.

                                  TOM
                    Get away from her.  Give her air.
                          (to Carrie)
                    Kiddo, Kiddo, can you hear me?

      Everyone starts to crowd around her, whispering, reacting.  
      Sebastian backs away, thrown.  Donna and The Jens gawk, 
      shocked.  Walt, The Mouse, and Maggie grip each other, 
      terrified.  As Tom scoops up his unconscious daughter and the 
      school nurse comes to assist him, the whole school watches... 
      worried and yet titillated at the same time.

                                        ACT II


      INT. CASTLEBURY HIGH SCHOOL - GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

      Tom sits in a small office across from KAREN MORNINGSTAR, the 
      school s guidance counselor, pretty, warm, earthy. 

                                  TOM
                    A couple years ago I came home from 
                    work to three screaming women.  
                      Apparently, my wife had opened up a 
                    drawer and a mouse had jumped out.  
                    My wife and both girls were standing 
                    on a bench, terrified... unable to 
                    move until I came home.  When I 
                    opened the door they just started 
                      screeching. It was so loud. You know 
                    what I did?

                                  KAREN
                    What?

                                  TOM
                    I walked out. It was too much. I just 
                    thought, why couldn t I have had 
                    boys?  And now I m raising two girls 
                    without a mother.

                                  KAREN
                            (reassuring)
                    She fainted, Mr. Bradshaw.  She s 
                    going to be fine.

                                  TOM
                      Physically.

                                  KAREN
                    I hope you don t mind I checked in on 
                    Carrie a few times this summer. She s 
                    a tough kid but she s going through a 
                    lot. That s why I called this 
                    meeting. Losing her mother means that 
                      everything familiar to Carrie, 
                    including school, has become loaded.  
                    Fraught. Does that make sense?

                                  TOM
                    Our whole house feels like a ticking 
                    time bomb. I can t even look at my 
                    wife s closet. How am I supposed to 
                    help her?

                                  KAREN
                    I think it would be great if Carrie 
                    could try something new. Something 
                    away from here.                                                                       20.


                                  TOM
                    Like a hobby? Or a sport? She likes 
                    swimming.  Reading magazines.

                                  KAREN
                    I was thinking something different. 
                    Something she s never done before.  
                    Like a special class or even an 
                      internship.

                                  TOM
                    Like a job?

                                  KAREN
                    Very part-time. One day a week.
                    As the school counselor, I could 
                    arrange for her to get school credit.

                                  TOM
                    I don t even know what she would be 
                      interested in.  I know, she wants to 
                    be a lawyer.  Like me.

                                  KAREN
                    She talks about New York.

                                  TOM
                    The city?

      Karen nods.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    I don t know... if she spent any real 
                    time there she d see it for what it 
                    is. Dirty, broken down, too crowded.

                                  KAREN
                    Or she might see it as a place to 
                    make new memories.  A blank slate.  A 
                    new beginning.


      INT. CASTLEBURY HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRANCE

      Tom and Carrie stand at the exit of the school.

                                  TOM
                    Are you sure you re okay? 

                                  CARRIE
                    Dad, passing out in front of the 
                    entire school was humiliating enough.  
                    Having you hang around?  Nail in the 
                    loser coffin.                                                                         21.


                                  TOM
                    I get it.  I wasn t always someone s 
                    dad, you know.

                                  CARRIE
                    Thanks.  And no hugs, please.

                                  TOM
                          (good-natured)
                    I ll see you at home.

      As he heads out Carrie walks back toward her locker and is 
      intercepted by Donna LaDonna.  Groups of kids mill about.

                                  DONNA
                    Carrie... hi.

      Carrie looks at her, wary.

                                  CARRIE
                    Hey, Donna.

                                  DONNA
                          (loud)
                    That was so scary. You okay?

                                  CARRIE
                    I m fine.

                                  DONNA
                    I mean it was crazy. Watching you 
                    fall. You like starting babbling... 
                    and then it was like timber!  I 
                    didn t realize someone so small could 
                    land that hard. Your arm must hurt.

      Donna grabs her arm and looks at it.  There s a bruise.

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    Oh my God, is that from where you 
                    fell?  Gross.

                                  CARRIE
                    It s from where my sister bit me.  
                          (a bit threatening)
                    We Bradshaws, are biters when we feel 
                    cornered.

      Donna recoils, a bit afraid of her.

                                  DONNA
                    You re weird.

                                  CARRIE
                    You say that like it s a bad thing.                                                                       22.


                                  DONNA
                    Being weird doesn t make you special. 
                    It just makes you...weird.

                                  CARRIE
                    Clever retort, Donna.  You are super 
                    witty.

      Carrie walks away, eyes, down, afraid to make eye contact 
      with anyone.  So WE SEE what she doesn't - a glimmer of 
        appreciation in Sebastian's eyes.


      INT. SWIMMING POOL - EARLY MORNING

      Carrie is safe, things are simple as she swims quiet laps in 
      the pool. Everything but the sound of her breath, washing 
      away. 


      INT. BARN - BEFORE SCHOOL

      Carrie, with wet hair, sits with The Mouse at a picnic table.  
      The place is empty except for them.

                                  CARRIE
                    Day two.  The only thing that could 
                    make it worse than day one is if I 
                      internally combusted.  And now Donna 
                    and The Jens are gunning for me. Feel 
                    it was a good year. I should end it 
                    now.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Donna wouldn t be being such a bitch 
                    if she didn t think you had a shot 
                    with Sebastian.  But I m not sure 
                    it s going to matter.

      The Mouse nudges Carrie. She looks up to see Sebastian 
      looking around, checking out the Barn.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    There you are, Bradshaw. I was 
                    looking for you.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    And I was just leaving.

      The Mouse gets up and leaves. Carrie sits on the table, 
      waiting, nervous. Sebastian sits down next to her. Close.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    You hang out here a lot?

                                  CARRIE
                    It s a pretty good escape.                                                                       23.


                                  SEBASTIAN
                    You got a lot to get away from.

                                  CARRIE
                    If only I could escape my brain.  Do 
                    you ever sit there and... the words 
                    and thoughts are happening so fast in 
                    your mind, you can t even understand 
                    them?

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Not really.

                                  CARRIE
                    I wish I hadn t just said that.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I think it s cool you have so much 
                    going on in your head.  You ve been 
                    through stuff.  Not many people here 
                    can say that.

                                  CARRIE
                    Can you?

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Who me? Poor little rich kid whose 
                    mom left for the tennis instructor? 
                    I m just a cliche.

                                  CARRIE
                    Your mom left?  I didn t know...

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Don t worry our maid, Luisa, still 
                    gets dinner on the table. Nothing s 
                    really changed.

                                  CARRIE
                    No one s better off without a mom.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I m sorry, Carrie.

      He puts his hand over hers.  An intimate beat.


      EXT. CASTLEBURY SWIM CLUB - FLASHBACK - TWO YEARS AGO

      Carrie and Sebastian sit side-by-side, feet dangling in the 
      pool.  It's the end of the day--everyone else is gone.

                                  CARRIE
                    I can t believe you don t know Atari 
                      Adventure.                                                                         24.


                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Space Invaders.  That s my game.

                                  CARRIE
                      Seriously? Adventure is so cool. You 
                    have to get this magic chalice to the 
                    gold castle and there s these dragons 
                    that want to kill you.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    So you re the princess who slays her 
                    own dragons, huh?

                                  CARRIE
                    Somebody has to. Might as well be me.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I d slay a dragon for you.

      He leans toward her.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I knew he was going to kiss me. So I 
                    did what any scared fourteen-year-old 
                    girl would do. 

      She pushes him in the water. As he falls he grabs onto her 
      leg taking her with him.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Now you re in for it.

      Carrie laughs, as he scoops her up into his arms to toss her 
      across the pool. They are both aware of the their proximity 
      to one another.  He puts her down gently, arms still wrapped 
      around her waist.  They are now face to face.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I wasn t sure who leaned in first.

      They begin to kiss--a  deep, tender kiss.  Carrie wraps her 
      arms around his neck as the kiss deepens.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    But there we were. Kissing.  My first 
                    kiss.

      They break a part. Just a little bit.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    My parent s are putting in a pool.  
                    It s almost done.

      Carrie nods.                                                                       25.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I knew in that moment, once he had 
                    his own pool, I would never see him 
                    again.  And I was right...


      INT. BARN - PRESENT

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    ...until now.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Do you still swim?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah. I like the quiet.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I never swim.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Kind of a waste since you have a pool 
                    in your backyard.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    You should come over.  

                                  CARRIE
                    That d be cool.  Thanks.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I wanted to ask when.  But I didn t 
                    know how.

                                    CARRIE/SEBASTIAN
                    Would you.../We should...

      They both stop.

                                  CARRIE
                    No you go.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    We should get going.  Class starts in 
                    like two minutes. Can t get in 
                    trouble this early in the year.

                                  CARRIE
                    Right. Right. 

      Off Carrie, disappointed. An opportunity missed. 


      EXT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -NIGHT

      Tom grills hamburgers. Carrie sets the table while Dorrit 
      listens to her Walkman, super loud.                                                                       26.


                                  TOM
                    So how was school today, you guys?

      Dorrit bops to her music not hearing her dad.

                                  CARRIE
                    I didn t pass out. If that s what 
                    you re asking.

      Tom puts down his tongs and walks over.  The phone rings.

                                  DORRIT
                    I got it.

      She runs off.

                                  TOM
                    She can t hear me, but the phone no 
                    problem?

                                  CARRIE
                    It s a teenage thing. We have special 
                      phone-hearing powers.

                                  TOM
                    Notice you didn t jump up for it.

                                  CARRIE
                    No one to jump up for.

                                  TOM
                    So...

                                  CARRIE
                    So?

                                  TOM
                    I talked to one of my buddies at the 
                    law firm I used to work for...

                                  CARRIE
                    Are you giving up your practice?

                                  TOM
                    No, sweetie.  I was talking to him 
                    about you. Your guidance counselor 
                    and I thought it might be good for 
                    you to take on an internship.  For 
                    school credit, of course.

                                  CARRIE
                    Like, work in a office?

      Tom nods.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    That could be cool.  Where?                                                                       27.


                                  TOM
                    At my friend s firm. In Manhattan.

      Carrie jumps up, practically hyperventilating.

                                  CARRIE
                    No way! No way!

                                  TOM
                    So you like this idea?

      She squeals and hugs her dad hard!


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - CARRIE'S ROOM

      Carrie goes through her closet while on the phone.


      INT. THE MOUSE S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CROSSCUT AS NECESSARY

      The Mouse lies on her bed, talking on a Mickey Mouse phone.

                                  CARRIE
                    Every Friday. Every Friday, I ll be 
                    in New York, working at a law firm.  
                    How cool is that?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    So cool.  I would kill to do that.  
                    Do you think you ll get to see a 
                    trial or something.

                                  CARRIE
                    Who cares? I ll be in Manhattan.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Does that mean you re missing the 
                    dance this week?  How will you ever 
                    show your school spirit?

                                  CARRIE
                    I know it s pathetic but I kinda want 
                    to make it back for it.  Maybe 
                    Sebastian will be there.
                          (digging into her closet)
                    I still can t find my mom s purse.

      They both hear a click.  And then silence.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Dorrit?  Dorrit? I know you re 
                      listening.  Don t say anything, 
                    Mouse. Dorrit s on the line.                                                                       28.


                                  THE MOUSE
                    I have to go anyway. Almost time to 
                    call Seth.

                                  CARRIE
                    You are so in love.

      Carrie hangs up and races into Dorrit s room.


      INT. DORRIT S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Dorrit hides the phone under the bed. Carrie sees the cord.

                                  CARRIE
                    Stop spying on me.

                                  DORRIT
                    Like I care about your loser life.

                                  CARRIE
                    I know you stole Mom s purse.

      She reaches for a big Teddy Bear, surrounded by other stuffed 
      animals on the floor, and picks it up to see if the purse is 
      under the pile of stuff.  The bear is heavy. Dorrit rushes 
      over to her, suddenly very nervous.

                                  DORRIT
                    Don t touch my shit.

      Carrie shakes the bear. It jangles. She turns it over, sees 
      that the bear has been badly resewn together and rips it 
      open. The purse, a few scarves and some costume jewelry fall 
      out the teddy bear.

                                  CARRIE
                    You re such a klepto.

      Carrie looks down at the pile and realizes everything is 
      splattered with dry pink nail polish.  Carrie looks stunned.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    It s ruined.  Why did you do that?

                                  DORRIT
                    Oh my God, Carrie.  I didn t mean 
                    to... the bottle must have broke.

                                  CARRIE
                    You wanted to destroy it.

                                  DORRIT
                    No. I wanted something of Mom. And 
                    you got everything.                                                                       29.


                                  CARRIE
                    No. I didn t.

                                  DORRIT
                          (beginning to cry)
                    You got the purse.  Your sixteenth 
                    birthday.  The start of high school. 
                    I got nothing.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    She was right.  I never thought of 
                    myself as the lucky one. But I had 
                    three extra precious years with our 
                    mom that Dorrit would never have.  

      Carrie goes to Dorrit and puts her arms around her.

                                  CARRIE
                    You re okay, Dorrit.  You re okay.  
                    Mom loved you. So much.

      Dorrit pushes Carrie away, furious. 

                                  DORRIT
                    I don t need your pity.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I m just trying to...

                                  DORRIT
                    Act like you re my mom.  Screw you, 
                    Carrie.

      Dorrit storms off, leaving Carrie confused and alone, holding 
      the destroyed purse.

                                    END OF ACT II                                                                       30.


                                        ACT III


      INT. TOM BRADSHAW S CAR - MORNING

      Tom drives Carrie through the streets of Manhattan.  Carrie 
      looks out, stunned by what she sees.  An older woman lies on 
      the sidewalk in a tattered bra and underwear using an album 
      cover with tinfoil as a sun reflector to lap up the rays.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I had arrived.  To the place where 
                    Dorothy Parker sipped her first side 
                    car. And Annie Hall found her first 
                      therapist.  

      A man on roller skates with a boom box skates by, dangerously 
      close to the car.  The car stops at a light. A pair of 
      HOMELESS GUYS converge on the car.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    And apparently where every shade of 
                    crazy now came to roost.

                                  TOM
                      Goddamnit!  

      CARRIE S POV two HOMELESS GUYS, directly in front of her - 
      super close, squeegee the windshield of the car. 

                                  CARRIE
                    What are they doing?

                                  TOM
                    They want money.  
                          (re: the stoplight)
                    Come on.  Turn green.

      The light turns green and Tom steps on the gas, the SQUEEGEE 
      GUYS back away from the car used to this.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Now let s go over the schedule again.

                                  CARRIE
                    I get on the train at six.

                                  TOM
                    Are you sure you don t want me to 
                    pick you up?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yes. You said Pat s secretary will 
                    take me to the train. I ll be fine.

      They pull up in front of a big, beautiful art deco building.                                                                       31.


                                  TOM
                    I expect you to call me before you 
                    head to the train tonight. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I know. And don t forget I m going 
                    straight from the train to the dance.  
                    Remember?

                                  TOM
                    And you ll be home at curfew. 

      Tom nods as Carrie gets out of the car.  Tom rolls down the 
      window for last minute instructions.

                                  CARRIE
                    Midnight.  No later.
                          (she strikes a pose)
                    How do I look?

      She stands in front of him, young but surprisingly adult, 
      holding her ruined purse in front of her.  We now see she has 
      totally reinvented it.  The bag has  CARRIE  written in the 
      same bright pink nail polish that splattered it. It s cool, 
      au courant and original. She displays it on her hip, proudly.

                                  TOM
                    Like a young woman.  How did that 
                    happen?  
                          (beat)
                    Are you sure you don t want me to 
                    walk you in?

                                  CARRIE
                    Dad, young woman, remember? I got 
                    this. It s okay. You can go.

                                  TOM
                          (nodding)
                    I love you, kiddo.

                                  CARRIE
                    Me too, Dad.

      He drives off.  Carrie waves, watching him disappear. Once he 
      is out of sight she looks around, taking in the hustle and 
      bustle of 1980's Wall Street with all the big-shoulder-padded 
      assistants and the Masters of the Universe getting out of 
      their town cars.  She takes it in, excited, loving it.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Manhattan was a lot like my purse.  
                    Damaged and had seen better days, but 
                      I wouldn t have traded that purse, or 
                    this moment for anything.

      An AGGRESSIVE PASSERBY pushes past her causing her to fall.                                                                       32.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Right until I fell.

      She gets up, a bit shaken. It s NYC in the 80 s--no one stops 
      to help her.  She looks down at a huge rip in her panty hose. 


      INT. WALL STREET LAW FIRM - LOBBY

      CLOSE ON a pair of great legs with no panty hose as ZZ Tops 
       Legs  plays. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Carrie heading through the 
      grand lobby of a beautiful art deco skyscraper.  A few women 
      look down at her bare legs, disapproving. Carrie, in her 
      excitement, doesn t notice. She steps, big smile, on to the 
      elevator.  The doors close. The music stops. 


      INT. WALL STREET LAW FIRM - LARGE WINDOWLESS ROOM

      Carrie sits at a small desk stacked high with files and 
      surrounded by huge filing cabinets.  She is receiving 
      instruction from BITCHY BARBARA, a bitter secretary.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    Blue files are cases that were 
                      litigated.  And green are out of 
                    court settlements.  It s very 
                    important they are filed separately 
                    but alphabetically.

                                  CARRIE
                    Great. I can do that.  Is this a big 
                    new case or something?

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    These are files from old closed 
                    cases.  After you file them, they 
                    will be taken to cold storage.

                                  CARRIE
                          (deflated)
                    Oh. Okay.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    You get a half hour for lunch.  And 
                    may I suggest you go get a pair of 
                    stockings during that time.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Of course.  I fell... and well... 
                    anyway... Where would I...

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    Try Century 21.  And hold on to your 
                    purse.  People get robbed in there 
                    all the time.                                                                        33.


      Bitchy Barbara looks at the Carrie Bag with disdain.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA (CONT D)
                    Although, having that thing disappear 
                    would be a blessing.

      Bitchy Barbara heads out, leaving Carrie all alone.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I didn t know what cold storage even 
                    was, but if it was boring and lonely, 
                    I was already in it.


      EXT. CENTURY 21 - LUNCH TIME

      Carrie looks up at what will become her fashion mecca.


      INT. CENTURY 21- DESIGNER FLOOR

      The most amazing discount store for all things glamorous and 
      designer. Carrie wanders through the endless racks of 
      clothes. It s a wonderland of chiffon, silk, wool, lace.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    In my years of playing dress-up as a 
                    child I had realized that what you 
                    wore could help define who you are.  
                    Not just to the outside world, but to 
                    yourself.    

      She picks up a slinky dress ala Linda Evans in Dynasty and 
      holds it up to herself.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    But in this store, I realized you 
                    might even be able to change who you 
                    are.  Maybe you could walk in here 
                    one person... a kid from Connecticut 
                    and walk out...

      A loud shriek breaks her reverie. 

                                  HUSKY WOMAN S VOICE (O.C.)
                    Your bag!

      Carrie turns and sees LARRISA LOUGHTON, a fabulous force of 
      nature, rushing towards her.  As Larissa goes to grab the 
      bag, Carrie instinctively clutches it and pushes Larissa 
      away. Larissa stumbles backwards into a rack clothes almost 
      knocking it down.

                                    LARISSA
                          (laughing)
                    What the hell? Why d you do that?                                                                       34.


      Carrie stands, ready to defend her purse.

                                  CARRIE
                    Aren t you trying to steal my purse?

                                    LARISSA
                    No. Though I do want to get my hands 
                    on it. But not to steal, to shoot it.

      Larissa gets herself up.

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t understand.

                                    LARISSA
                    For a photo shoot I m doing.  For 
                    Interview Magazine.

                                  CARRIE
                          (in awe)
                    You work at Interview Magazine??

      Larissa puts out her hand.  Carrie shakes it.

                                    LARISSA
                    Larrisa Loughlin. Style editor.

                                  CARRIE
                    Carrie Bradshaw. Mortified.

                                    LARISSA
                    I m doing this fashion shoot that s a 
                    cross between Midsummer Night s Dream 
                    and Scarface. That purse would be 
                    perfect.

                                  CARRIE
                    My bag? In Interview? That would be 
                    so cool.

                                    LARISSA
                    You like the magazine?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. CENTURY 21 - DRESSING ROOM

      Carrie stands outside the curtain talking to Larissa who we 
      can see arms and legs of.

                                  CARRIE
                    And the one with Rob Lowe on the 
                    cover.  He s so hot.

                                    LARISSA (O.C.)
                    I get it, you re obsessed.                                                                       35.


      Larissa almost naked opens the curtain and drags Carrie in. 

                                    LARISSA (CONT D)
                    Just come in.

      As Larissa gets completely naked, Carrie tries to look 
      anywhere but directly at her.

                                    LARISSA (CONT D)
                    So do you work around here?

                                  CARRIE
                    At Long and Whitney?  The law firm.

      Once Larissa is out of her clothes she begins to pull on a 
      Norma Kamali jumpsuit. 

                                    LARISSA
                    I hooked up with a guy from there 
                    once. Kevin something or other.  He 
                    was hot. In a suit-tie kind of way. 

      Carrie nods.  She has no idea what she s talking about.

                                    LARISSA (CONT D)
                    You re not hooking up with your boss 
                    or anything, are you?

                                  CARRIE
                          (thinking about Bitchy 
                            Barbara; almost laughing)
                    Ummm, no.

                                    LARISSA
                    Smart girl.  Don t shit where you 
                    eat, Carrie.

                                  CARRIE
                    That doesn t seem very appetizing.

                                    LARISSA
                    You re funny. I can t believe you 
                    made that purse. How d you come up 
                    with the idea?

                                  CARRIE
                      Necessity.  It s the mother of 
                      invention.

                                    LARISSA
                    You re quoting Plato?  I love you.  
                          (turning her back to 
                            Carrie)
                    Zip me.

      She turns to Carrie showing off the new look.                                                                       36.


                                  CARRIE
                    You look amazing!

                                    LARISSA
                    Want to help me with something?

      Carrie nods.


      EXT. CENTURY 21 - LATER

      Carrie, with a small bag from the store, exits with Larissa 
      close behind her.  The alarms go off.  Larissa keeps moving 
      but Carrie stops, nervous.  Is she the reason the alarm is 
      going off?  A SECURITY GUARD comes out of the store.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Miss.  Miss.

      Carrie looks at him.

                                  CARRIE
                    Me?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Yes.  Can I look in your bag?

      Carrie hands him the bag.  He looks in it.

                                  CARRIE
                    Umm, sure.  Here s my receipt. One 
                    pair of nude panty hose.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Sorry.  Must have been a false alarm.  
                    Happens all the time.


      EXT. DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN STREET 

      Larissa hugs Carrie.  She unbuttons her jacket, revealing the 
      jumpsuit.

                                    LARISSA
                    That whole innocent, young thing you 
                    have going.  You could come in handy, 
                    Miss Carrie Bradshaw. I might have to 
                    keep you around.  I collect people, 
                    you know.

                                  CARRIE
                    What does that even mean??

                                    LARISSA
                    Some people collect art or like my 
                    mother...
                          (she shudders)
                                  (MORE)                                                                       37.

                                    LARISSA (CONT'D)
                      ...porcelain frogs.  I collect 
                    people.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I guess we re less creepy.  Do you 
                    need money or something?

                                    LARISSA
                    No, why?

                                  CARRIE
                    Because you just stole...

                                    LARISSA
                    The jumpsuit?  When I was a teenager, 
                    I used to steal lipstick from 
                      Woolworth s and as an adult I ve just 
                    upped the ante a little bit.  I like 
                    the thrill.

                                  CARRIE
                    I ve never stolen anything before.

                                    LARISSA
                          (loves her)
                    You have to come out with me tonight.  
                    We re starting at Odeon.

                                  CARRIE
                    As in the restaurant your magazine 
                    did a write up of down in Tribeca. 
                          (quoting)
                     In the hinterlands of lower 
                      Manhattan... 

                                    LARISSA
                       ...exists a place so magical.  I 
                    wrote that piece. Mostly so I could 
                    get free champagne and frites.  How 
                    have you never been there? 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                      I couldn t decide whether to admit I 
                    was a high school student from 
                      Connecticut who had never been 
                    anywhere.  Or create a life for 
                    myself.  The life I wanted.  

                                  CARRIE
                    There s this guy I hooked up with 
                    from my office and he always hangs 
                    out there so...

                                    LARISSA
                    So screw him.  He doesn t own Odeon.  
                    We do.  Meet me at my office at six.                                                                       38.


      INT. WALL STREET LAW FIRM - WINDOWLESS ROOM

      Carrie is on the phone, moving files from the desk into a 
      filing cabinet.  The piles are significantly smaller.

                                  CARRIE
                    She gave me her card and everything. 


      INT. THE MOUSE S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CROSSCUT AS NECESSARY

      The Mouse sits on her floor with books around her.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Stop for one second and take a 
                    breath.  Because when I tell you this 
                    you might start hyperventilating.

                                  CARRIE
                    Is it good or bad?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Sebastian called here.

                                  CARRIE
                    For you?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    For your number!

                                  CARRIE
                    Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

                                  THE MOUSE
                      Apparently, my mom knows his mom or 
                    something like that.  Anyway he had 
                    my number and he called for yours.

                                  CARRIE
                    What did he say?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Not much.  He asked if you were gonna 
                    be back tonight.  He must want to ask 
                    you to the dance.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Maybe he needs math help.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    I m in that class too.

                                  CARRIE
                    Good point.                                                                       39.


                                  THE MOUSE
                    So you have to come back for the 
                    dance.  For Sebastian.

                                  CARRIE
                    I need to call my house.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Call me back and tell me what he 
                    said.

      They hang up as Bitchy Barbara enters holding a garment bag.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                          (handing it to her)
                    This came for you.

                                  CARRIE
                    For me?

      Carrie unzips it.  Inside is a fabulous poof dress in neon. 

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    This must be a mistake.

      There is a card attached.  She opens the card. CLOSE ON CARD: 
       A hot dress for a hot night.  Don t worry I didn t steal it 
      from a store just from our style rack. Larissa. 

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    You could buy a dress but not 
                      pantyhose?

      She looks down at Carrie s still bare legs.

                                  CARRIE
                    It s a gift...from my dad.  I have a 
                    dance tonight.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    Right.  I promised your father I 
                    would have you on the six thirty 
                    train back to Castlebury.  So we ll 
                    leave by 5:45.    

                                  CARRIE
                    I ll let my dad know.

      Carrie picks up the phone and dials.

                          (yelling out)
                    Dorrit, can you answer that?

      ...Sebastian.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Can I help you?  

      ANGLE ON DORRIT who picks up the phone and sets it down on 
      the table without answering it.  She looks quickly at her 
      father who is engaged in conversation at the door and quietly 
      slips out the back door.
 

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Oh hi, I m here to see Carrie.
                    I m a friend from school.

      Sebastian puts his hand out.  Tom shakes it.  Firm.

                                  TOM
                    Nice handshake.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Thank you, sir. My grandfather taught 
                    me the handshake tells you who the 
                    man is.

                                  TOM
                    So did mine.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Is Carrie okay?  She wasn t in school 
                    today.


      INT. WALL STREET LAW FIRM - WINDOWLESS OFFICE - SAME

      Carrie dials her house again.  The phone now rings busy.  She 
      looks at it, confused, as Barbara walks back in.  

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    My kid just got injured at soccer 
                    practice.  I have to leave now.  

                                  CARRIE
                    But it s only five.

      Carrie has the dress laid out on the desk. It s bright 
      glamour in stark contrast to the drabness of the room.  

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                          (judgy)
                    You re wearing that to a school 
                    dance?
                                  (MORE)                                                                       41.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    So you ready to head out?

                                  CARRIE
                    I think I m going to finish up here.  
                    And head out in a bit.

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    But I promised your dad I d take you.

                                  CARRIE
                    I just spoke to him. He s fine if I 
                    go by myself

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                          (please no)
                    I could wait...

                                  CARRIE
                    Don t be silly.  

                                  BITCHY BARBARA
                    Just promise me you ll take a cab to 
                    the station.  No subway.

                                  CARRIE
                      I promise.  I ll take a cab. 


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

      Tom and Sebastian still at the door.

                                  TOM
                    I think she s heading straight from 
                    the train to some school dance.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    New Beginnings.

                                  TOM
                    Yes. That s it. Maybe you can find 
                    her there.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Thanks.

      Sebastian starts to walk towards his car.

                                  TOM
                    What did you say your name was?

                                  SEBASTIAN
                          (turning back)
                      Sebastian.  Sebastian Kydd.                                                                       42.


                                  TOM
                    Garret s son?

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    The one and only.

      Tom takes this in as Sebastian heads to his car.  What 
      Sebastian sees and Tom doesn t is Dorrit getting into a car 
      with a group of kids.  The car peals off, fast.


      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Carrie hails a cab in the fabulous neon poof dress. She looks 
      amazing.  It s magical, just like a movie.  A taxi screeches 
      to a halt in front of her.  She opens the door...

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    As my head buzzed with the 
                      possibilities of the night, I 
                    wondered where this chariot would 
                    take me.  To the New Beginnings dance 
                    and Sebastian? Or to Larissa and a 
                    new world?  


      INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS

      And climbs in.

                                  CAB DRIVER
                    Where to?

      Carrie bites her lip, debating. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    It was a good question.

      Off Carrie, what will she decide?

                                  END OF ACT III                                                                       43.


                                        ACT IV


      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

      A taxi pulls up and the door opens.  A leg peeks out, it s 
      Carrie.  She gets out of the car and looks up in awe.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I had kept my promise to take a cab.

      THE CAMERA SPINS from Carrie s face to the object of her awe.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Bitchy Barbara was right. This dress 
                    didn t belong at a dance. It belonged 
                    here in this city.  And so did I.

      The neon sign for Odeon is like a beacon for Carrie.  She 
      walks up to the door, takes a deep breath and heads inside.


      INT. ODEON - LATER

      Carrie enters and looks around, expectantly.  The restaurant 
      has the patina of an old french bistro.  

                                    LARISSA (O.S.)
                    There you are!!  

      Larissa swoops in, grabbing Carrie s hand. She walks her over 
      to a booth filled with absolute individuals.

                                  CARRIE
                    This place is amazing.  Is it true 
                    that Janice Dickenson rode around on 
                    John Belushi?

                                    LARISSA
                    I was here that night. Strapped a 
                    saddle on and everything.  
                          (landing at the table)
                    Carrie, this is everybody.  Everybody 
                    this is Carrie.

      As the group moves over to allow Carrie to squish in, Larissa 
      whispers in her ear who all these people are.

                                    LARISSA (CONT D)
                    That s Dominick, he s an artist who 
                    works with found objects and wax...

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    They were artists, musicians, 
                    writers.  But mostly they were 
                      distinctly themselves. Living their 
                    lives with complete confidence.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    In a place that celebrated it. It was 
                    such a stark contrast to the world I 
                    came from...


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DANCE

      Donna LaDonna is on the dance floor dancing surrounded by the 
      girls who want to be her and the boys who want to do her.  
      There are streamers, a disco ball and a lame sound system. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    ...where conformity is celebrated and 
                    the Donnas of the world rule.

      THE CAMERA PANS to Maggie and Walt.  She s drunk.  

                                  MAGGIE
                          (very tipsy)
                    Let s go back to the car and get more 
                    Bartles and James.

                                  WALT
                    I think you ve had more than enough.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    You re not my dad.  

      She leans in to kiss him and stumbles a bit. Walt rights her.

                                  WALT
                    Careful there, Mags.  If a teacher 
                    sees you, we ll get in big trouble.  
                    Maybe we should head out.

                                  MAGGIE
                    To the Barn so we can screw around.

                                  WALT
                    Or home. To sleep this off.

      As Walt walks Maggie towards the door they pass Sebastian 
      walking in.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Hey new kid.  We ll be right back.

      Walt shakes his head.  No they won t.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Good luck with that.

      Sebastian looks around.  THE CAMERA PANS TO Donna LaDonna who 
      spots him and makes a beeline for him.                                                                         45.

                    You re here right on time. This is my 
                    favorite song.

      She pulls him onto the dance floor as Sheila E s  The 
      Glamourous Life  blares through the auditorium.  


      INT. ODEON - SAME

      Carrie is truly living the Glamourous Life.  With Larissa on 
      one side and AN EFFETE BLACK GUY on the other who refills 
      Carrie s champagne glass. She s already tipsy.

                    godsakes.  She doesn t need to have 
                    gone to college.   She should write 
                    something for us.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not really a writer.  My mom 
                    wrote a little.  In a journal.

                                  EFFETE BLACK GUY
                    You re funny.

                                    LARISSA
                    Still has her innocence. Still talks 
                    about her mom.

                    Please, you re with us.  All you need 
                    is an attitude.

                                  CARRIE
                    Okay. I should make a quick call.


      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - PAY PHONE

      Carrie holds the phone as it rings.  And rings.

                                  CARRIE 
                    Come on, Dad.

                    While I was getting no answer, The 
                    Mouse was getting an answer she 
                    didn t like.


      INT. THE MOUSE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM

      The Mouse sits in her room on the phone.  Someone picks up.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Oh, hi.  Is Seth there. Room 215.
                          (beat)
                    Yes, I called ten minutes ago.  Could 
                    you check again?  It s kind of 
                      important.
                          (long beat)
                    Okay.  Thanks. I ll try back later.

      The Mouse hangs up, very disappointed.


      EXT. DANCETERIA - SAME

      Carrie and her crew fall out of a taxi.  It's like the most 
      glamorous clown car ever.  Carrie looks up, amazed.

                      Danceteria??

      There s a line of people around the block but Larissa and her 
      entourage walk right up to the front. The velvet rope lifts.  
      Larissa puts her arm around a star struck Carrie.

                    Stick with me, kid.                                                                       47.


      INT. DANCETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

      Carrie takes the place in - the lights, the music, the 
      glamour.  Madonna's  Holiday  pulsates through the club as 
      the most interesting people Carrie has ever seen dance.

                                  CARRIE  (V.O.)
                    It was loud, it was overwhelming.    

      Larissa grabs two champagnes off a passing tray.

                                    LARISSA
                    To new friends.

                                  CARRIE
                    To new friends.

      They clink glasses. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    And for the first time in my life, I 
                    felt like I truly belonged.  Like I 
                    was home.


      INT.  DANCETERIA - LATER

      Carrie is dancing, sandwiched between two of the hottest guys 
      she has ever seen.  It is sexy, hot.  The two guys lean over 
      her and start making out.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, I...sorry...I didn t...

      She begins to giggle a bit.

                                  HOT GAY GUY 
                    Know we were gay?

                                  CARRIE
                          (nodding)
                    Can I tell you a secret?  I ve never 
                    met anybody gay before.

                                  HOT GAY GUY #2
                    Of course you have.

                                  CARRIE
                    Nope.  No one I know is gay.

                                  HOT GAY GUY
                    Oh honey, someone you know is very 
                    gay. They re just hiding it.

                                  HOT GAY GUY #2
                    Or don t know it yet.  Look for the 
                    hot guy who loves fashion...                                                                       48.


                                  HOT GAY GUY
                    And hates sports.

      The guys kiss again.  Carrie twirls, dancing with abandon.


      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL BLEACHERS

      Sebastian and Donna sit on the bleachers. It is only them.

                                  DONNA
                    Well, that dance was lame.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    You looked like you were having a 
                    good time.

                                  DONNA
                    I m always having fun.  Even if I 
                    have to make my own.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Oh really? And how do you do that?

      She stands up, taking his hand and pulling him up.

                                  DONNA
                    Come with me.  I ll show you.

      Sebastian smiles.  He s game.


      INT. DANCETERIA - 11:22 PM

      Carrie, sweaty from dancing, pushes through the crowd looking 
      for Larissa. She finds her grinding up against two hot girls.

                                  CARRIE
                    I have to go.

                                    LARISSA
                    It s not even midnight. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I have a thing at my dad s in the 
                      morning... anyway I have to go.

      Larissa blows dramatic kisses at her. And then begins to 
      grind hard against the beautiful woman behind her.  Carrie 
      heads to the exit, turning around one last time to take in 
      the amazing world that welcomed her.                                                                       49.


      INT. SEBASTIAN'S CORVETTE - 11:39 PM

      Sebastian and Donna smoke a joint in his car. She inhales and 
      then turns to him blowing smoke in his mouth.  As he chokes 
      in surprise, Donna laughs her sultry laugh.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I am so high.


      INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - 11:42 PM

      Carrie, like Cinderella, runs to her chariot/train.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I was high.  Maybe it was the 
                    champagne or the dancing or that I 
                    was out of breath racing for the last 
                    train. Or maybe it was the 
                      realization that...


      INT. TRAIN - 11:59 PM

      Carrie sits on the train, head pressed against the window 
      watching the skyline of Manhattan get smaller and smaller.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I might have just lost my virginity, 
                    my innocence, and not to the guy I 
                    had hoped, but to a different 
                      man...MANhattan.  And maybe it 
                    wouldn t respect me in the morning, 
                    or even remember me, but it was good 
                    for me.


      EXT.  PARKING LOT - 12:35 AM

      Maggie is throwing up in the bushes while Walt holds back her 
      hair.  She wipes off her mouth.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m sorry, Walt.  You re so good to 
                    me.  I m an asshole.

                                  WALT
                    It s okay.  You re my asshole.

      A police car slowly drives into the parking lot, shining it s 
      lights in Maggie and Walt s eyes.  Both are nervous.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Just act normal.

      The police car pulls up next to them and the window goes 
      down.  A YOUNG POLICE OFFICER looks at them suspicious.                                                                       50.


                                  YOUNG POLICE OFFICER
                      Everything alright here?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Fine.  

                                  YOUNG POLICE OFFICER
                            (recognizing Maggie)
                    Very good.  You kids be careful.

      He drives off, leaving a very relieved Walt and Maggie.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Pays to be the police chief s 
                    daughter.

                                  WALT
                    I ll say.

      Walt watches the tail lights of the police car fade away as 
      he does he sees Donna slipping out of Sebastian s Corvette. 


      EXT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - LATER

      Carrie walks down her leafy, suburban neighborhood street, 
      practically sashaying to her house.

                                  CARRIE
                    You must be my lucky star.  Cause you 
                    shine on me...

      She swings several of Larissa's necklaces around.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                      ...wherever you are.  I just think of 
                    you and I start to...

      As she rounds the corner, she sees her house with two cop 
      cars in the driveway.  She starts to run to the house, 
      panicked. Her dad is outside.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    I m here. I m here.  I m sorry I m 
                    late!

                                  TOM
                    It s Dorrit.  She s missing.

      OFF CARRIE, filled with fear as she looks at her father s 
      worried face.


                                    END OF ACT IV                                                                       51.


                              ACT V - THE NEXT DAY


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE -  LIVING ROOM - DAWN

      Carrie and Tom wait, nerves are raw.

                                  TOM
                    It s 10 AM.  

                                  CARRIE
                            (reassuring)
                    She s okay, Dad.

                                  TOM  
                    She s not with any of her friends.  
                    This would never have happened if 
                    your mom were here.

                                  CARRIE
                    You can t blame yourself.  Dorrit s 
                    just Dorrit.  

                                  TOM
                    I ll kill her when she gets home.

      And then suddenly, Dorrit is waltzing through the door, 
      drunk, acting as if her disappearance is no big deal.

                                  DORRIT
                          (defensive)
                    Hey.

                                  TOM
                    Dorrit.

                                  CARRIE
                    Where have you been?

                                  DORRIT
                    Whatever.  With friends.  I tried to 
                    call. The phone must ve been off the 
                    hook.

                                  CARRIE
                    Because you took it off.

      Tom grabs her in a bear hug. His relief dissolves all his 
      anger.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Are you drunk? Do you know how 
                    worried we ve been? You had better 
                    start explaining yourself.

      Dorrit breaks out of her dad s embrace.                                                                       52.


                                  DORRIT
                    Or what? You ll ground me? You re not 
                    my mom.

                                  CARRIE
                          (losing it)
                    I am done. Done!!!! Do you think I 
                    like this? Worrying about you? Having 
                    to be the mature one?  I would do 
                    anything to have Mom back.  To just 
                    be your sister and not have to worry 
                    everyday what might happen to you.  I 
                    can't take it!

      Carrie storms off to her room. Tom and a shocked Dorrit watch 
      her go. They both startle when they hear her door slam.  


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - CARRIE'S BEDROOM - A BIT LATER

      Carrie sits on the bed, calm.  Tom tentatively enters.

                                  TOM
                    Okay if I come in?

                                  CARRIE
                          (embarrassed)
                    Sorry about that.

                                  TOM
                    Don t be.  You know, I ve always 
                    thought you and I were cut from the 
                    same cloth.  But I saw a lot of your 
                    mother in you today.

                                  CARRIE
                    Because I lost it?

      Tom sits down next to her on the bed.

                                  TOM
                    When you were little and you d do 
                    something awful, I would just look at 
                    your tear stained face and melt.  I 
                    couldn t punish you.  But your mother 
                    was tough.  

                                  CARRIE
                      I remember.  I had to scrub every 
                    window in the house after I finger 
                    painted the dining room.

                                  TOM
                    She wanted you girls to be 
                      accountable for your actions.  Said 
                    it would make you good people.  And 
                    now that s my job.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                       53.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    I haven t wanted to do it. You girls 
                    have had it hard enough as is.  But 
                    also, taking on your mom s role means 
                    I have to admit...

      He stops. It s too hard to even say.

                                  CARRIE
                    That mom s really gone.

                                  TOM
                          (nodding)
                    But I have to.  No matter how much it 
                    hurts.  Your mother would want that.  
                          (beat)
                    She would also want me to ground you 
                    for missing your curfew by almost two 
                    hours.  No going out the next two 
                    weekends, got it?

      Carrie nods, smiling.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    It was funny, but I think I was happy 
                    to be punished.  It felt like things 
                    were going back to normal.

                                  TOM
                    Were you out late because of that 
                    Sebastian Kydd?  I have to say 
                    Carrie, I know his family and I d 
                    rather you not spend time with him. 

                                  CARRIE
                    How do you even know him?

                                  TOM
                    He stopped by yesterday.

                                  CARRIE
                    He came by the house?

                                  TOM
                    Didn t he tell you?  

                                  CARRIE
                    I never saw him last night.

                                  TOM
                    But you were at the dance, right?

                                  CARRIE
                            (hesitating)
                    Yeah, course.                                                                       54.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    It was the first time I lied to my 
                    Dad.


      EXT. BARN - LATER 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I wasn t sure if I was growing up, 
                    growing apart from him, or just 
                    acting my age. But in that little 
                    lie, I knew things were changing.

      Carrie spots Walt sitting outside at the picnic table, 
      reading Interview magazine.

                                  CARRIE
                    Hey.

      He shuts the magazine. So excited to see her.

                                  WALT
                    I want details. Every last one.

                                  CARRIE
                    It was amazing.

                                  WALT
                    How amazing?

                                  CARRIE
                    I m grounded for life.  

                                  WALT
                    That good?

                                  CARRIE
                    My dad thinks I was at the school 
                    dance so...

                                  WALT
                    Cover for you? Of course.

                                  CARRIE
                    I met a girl who works at Interview 
                    magazine.  She took me to Odeon and 
                      Danceteria.

                                  WALT
                    No way. Did you see anyone famous?  
                    What were people wearing?

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I looked at Walt as if for the first 
                    time. His love of fashion, his desire 
                    to escape this town, his family...                                                                       55.


                                  WALT
                    Ucch, all we did here was pretend to 
                    care about a stupid football game.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                      I wondered in that moment if Walt was 
                    telling lies, too.  If there were 
                    secrets he was keeping from me.  Or 
                    maybe didn t even know himself.

                                  CARRIE
                    How was the dance?

                                  WALT
                    How do you think it was?  Maggie got 
                    wasted. And Donna hooked her claws 
                    into the new kid.

                                  CARRIE
                      Sebastian?

                                  WALT
                    Saw her sliding out of his car late 
                    night. She s such a ho.

                                  CARRIE
                          (disappointed)
                    He stopped by my house yesterday.  I 
                    thought maybe...

                                  WALT
                    He likes you? Just  cause he hooked 
                    up with Donna doesn t mean he doesn t 
                    like you.  It just means he ain t 
                    worthy of you.

                                  CARRIE
                          (fishing)
                    Like Maggie is of you?

                                  WALT
                    I m not sure she is. That s why I 
                    don t want to have sex with her. 

                                  CARRIE
                          (confused)
                    You guys haven t?

                                  WALT
                    No.  I must be the only seventeen 
                    year old guy who is saying no to his 
                      girlfriend.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.) 
                    I didn t understand.  If Maggie was 
                    no longer a virgin and Walt had said 
                    no, who had said yes?                                                                         56.


      SFX the roar of Corvette pulling up to the Barn.  Walt and 
      Carrie look over at the sound.

                                  WALT
                    Oh look, it s the new kid.

      They watch Sebastian and Donna LaDonna get out of the car.

                                  CARRIE
                    And Donna.  I should go.

      Sebastian looks over, sees Carrie.  Their eyes lock.

                                  WALT
                    Don t go  cause of him.

                                  CARRIE
                    No, I promised my dad I d be home to 
                    help with something. 

      She gives him a kiss on the cheek and heads off, walking 
      right past Sebastian and Donna, head held high. 

                                  SEBASTIAN (O.C.)
                          (calling out)
                    Carrie. Carrie! Wait.

      Carrie stops and turns to see Sebastian heading towards her.

                                  CARRIE
                    What s up?

      As Donna and Walt look on...

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Look, I just want to explain... this 
                    isn t what you think.

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, it s exactly what I think.  

                                  DONNA
                          (calling out)
                      Sebastian, are you coming? 

      He looks at Carrie.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You should go.  See you around.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    That s it?

                                  CARRIE
                          (confident; smiling)
                    For now.                                                                       57.


      Carrie walks off, feeling surprisingly in control of the 
      moment. Sebastian watches her leave.  Donna takes in the 
      situation.  Not liking what she sees.  Her animosity towards 
      Carrie is growing.  


      INT. CARRIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

      Carrie enters to find The Mouse is waiting for her, teary. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I had never seen The Mouse cry. 
                    Except for the time she got an A 
                    minus on an advanced trig quiz.

                                  CARRIE
                    What s wrong?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    I think Seth is breaking up with me?

                                  CARRIE
                    Don t be silly...

                                  THE MOUSE
                    He hasn t called in two days.

                                  CARRIE
                    That s nothing.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    I called a bunch.

                                  CARRIE
                    No, Mouse.  How many times?

                                  THE MOUSE
                    Too many.

                                  CARRIE
                    Maybe he s studying?

      But they both know better.

                                  THE MOUSE
                    How could he have had sex with me and 
                    treat me like this?  He told me he 
                    loved me.

      Carrie hugs a tearful Mouse.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Love is something we wait for.  We 
                    imagine our first kiss, our first 
                    sex, our first 'I love you.                                                                          58.


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S HOUSE - MOTHER'S CLOSET

      Carrie, a contrite Dorrit, and Tom stand in front of her 
      mother s closet.  A frontier they are now ready to enter. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    But we never imagine our first heart 
                    break.  Maybe because it s too 
                    painful to even imagine.  But in a 
                    way, the pain of love is what truly 
                    changes us.  Defines us. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Are you sure, Dad?

                                  TOM
                    I m sure, kiddo.

      Carrie takes the  Last Birthday Dress  out of the closet.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    You should take that, Carrie. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I think Dorrit should have it.  Mom 
                    always loved her in green.

      Dorrit takes it, touched.


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW S HOUSE - TOM S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

      As a soulful, slow rendition of  Girls Just Want to Have Fun  
      begins to play, Carrie, Tom and Dorrit in the green dress, 
      are boxing some stuff, placing some in piles to keep, etc.  
      It is a powerful and important moment for this family. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    It s the losing of love that makes us 
                    who we are.  The loss of a parent. 


      INT. THE MOUSE S HOUSE - BEDROOM 

      The Mouse looks at a collage she made of her and Seth.  Her 
      heart break is palpable.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Of your virginity.  


      EXT. THE BARN  - AFTERNOON

      Walt sits with his Interview magazine - the one with Rob Lowe 
      on the cover.  He lingers on the inside photo spread of the 
      actor and then quickly shuts it as if caught.                                                                       59.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Of who you thought you might be.  


      EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

      A police car sits at the end of the street.  Maggie looks 
      around and then gets into it.  She sits down in the passenger 
      seat next to the YOUNG POLICEMAN who checked on her and Walt 
      at the dance.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Of your innocence.

                                  YOUNG POLICE OFFICER
                    No one saw you right?

                                  MAGGIE
                          (shaking her head no)
                    No one.

      They start passionately kissing.


      EXT. SWIM CLUB - AFTERNOON

      Carrie swims.  She stops, sensing someone s gaze.  She looks 
      up.  It s Sebastian.

                                  CARRIE
                    I thought you didn t like swimming.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                          (with meaning)
                    I don t.   

      He smiles at her.  She smiles back.  And then he canonballs 
      into the pool, splashing her.  She squeals and splashes him 
      back AS THE CAMERA PANS to the Jens watching their every 
      move.  The Jens look at each other.

                                  THE JENS
                    Donna is going to be so pissed.

      Carrie doesn t notice them.  Blissfully unaware that the most 
      popular and vengeful girls in the school now have their 
      sights on her.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    If you re lucky, you ll find new 
                    paths, even if you don t know where 
                    they ll take you.  


                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                       60.


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT

      Carrie, with wet hair, lies on her bed, smiling - the smile 
      of sixteen-year-old infatuation.  Her dad walks in holding a 
      beautiful journal/diary.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    People and passions that help you 
                    move on.  Start again.  Open your 
                    heart to new beginnings.  

                                  TOM
                    I thought you might like this. Your 
                    mom wrote in a journal every day. 
                    Said it helped her sanity.  I just 
                    figured she used it to complain about 
                    me.  Thought you should have it.

      Carrie opens the journal.  It s a blank canvas.  One she 
      wants to fill.   As our slow, soulful tune morphs into the 
      fabulous anthem of 1984, Cyndi Lauper s original  Girls Just 
      Want To Have Fun. 


      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

      WE FIND Carrie, a younger version of her SATC self but 
      definitely our Carrie Bradshaw, strutting down a vibrant, 
      pulsating Manhattan street in a fabulous, all-her-own outfit.  
      She smiles the kind of smile that comes from those first 
      giddy moments when you know you're falling in love. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    ...And even cities.  Places to create 
                    new memories -  where you can find 
                    yourself, make yourself, BE yourself.  


      INT. CARRIE BRADSHAW S HOUSE - BEDROOM

      WE SEE Carrie writing in that journal (her diary - Carrie's 
      Diary) for the first time. 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Figuring out how to use my voice 
                    wasn t going to be easy, but for the 
                    first time...in a long time...I 
                    thought it might be fun.

      OFF CARRIE, smiling, knowing the journey is just beginning.



                                        THE END
