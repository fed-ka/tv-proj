Rex is trying his key in the front door of his house. Finding
it doesn't, work he rattles the knob, then leans on the
doorbell.
We hear distant chimes.
REX
Honey! ...Honey?!
Finally, through the intercom:
MARYLIN
Rex. Get away from the door.
REX
Look, Marylin, can't we have a
civilized discussion about this?
MARYLIN
We are. And it's winding down.
REX
But Marylin, you know a divorce would
ruin me right now. Everything I have --
everything we have -- is tied up in
my business. The business is my entire
life.
MARYLIN
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson,
Topeka and the Santa Fe?
REX
Marylin?
MARYLIN
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have
to sic the dogs on you.
REX
Dogs?
From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE
DOGS BARKING.
LETTERING
On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN &
GURALNICK.
A pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a
receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth.
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Massey will be right with you.
Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her
friends SARAH SORKIN and RAMONA BARCELONA. It's early, but
the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power
walkers, wheelchair racers etc. Ramona pushes her infant in
a baby jogger.
SARAH
You want to come out to the beach
house tomorrow?
MARYLIN
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
SARAH
Neither did I until my lawyer found
it -- quite a paper trail -- he had
it in the dog's name.
RAMONA
(To Marylin)
So who'd you hire?
MARYLIN
Ruth Rabino.
SARAH
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis
or a Pearlman? She definitely did a
Factor.
MARYLIN
She did a Harriman.
SARAH
Wow.
MARYLIN
In the words of my Private
Investigator, we're going to nail
his ass.
RAMONA
I've been trying to nail George's
for years, but he's very careful.
I'll just keep having children. I
think I'm pregnant, by the way.
SARAH
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
RAMONA
Three is not Farrow.
SARAH
Who's Rex's guy?
MARYLIN
Miles Massey.
SARAH
Of Massey Myerson?
MARYLIN
Do you know him?
SARAH
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey
that cute little island of George's.
RAMONA
George was so impressed he hired him
when he divorced his second.
SARAH
Muriel Rumsey.
MARYLIN
Who's she?
SARAH
Now? She's a night manager at
McDonalds.
RAMONA
You should have tried to get pregnant
Marylin -- solidify your position.
MARYLIN
No.
RAMONA
You like kids.
MARYLIN
I can't have a baby with a man I
don't love... And I can't submit a
child to divorce.
SARAH
It's not so bad these days. Kids
like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
RAMONA
Maybe next time.
MARYLIN
Maybe.
SARAH
We do have a man for you.
RAMONA
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just
separated from his third. He's in
fish. He is fish.
SARAH
She's keeping his name. And one of
his planes. And all seven of his
children
RAMONA
And only two are hers.
MARYLIN
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until
this is over. One husband at a time.
SARAH
I wish I had your discipline.
A COURTROOM
We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in
her 60's.
LAWYER
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified
that you were your husband's sexual
slave for thirty-six years, ever
since you were married --
WITNESS
Except for two years when he was in
the Navy, in Korea.
LAWYER
Prior to your marriage, what was
your profession?
WITNESS
I was a hostess. For Trans-World
Airlines.
LAWYER
What is your husband's profession?
WITNESS
He manufactures staples and industrial
brad-tacks. He's very successful.
JUMP BACK
At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice
lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate.
Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing
her testimony.
WRIGLEY
Wait... He wants to give her...?
MILES
Nothing.
WRIGLEY
And she has...?
MILES
Video.
WRIGLEY
What the fuck...?
Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation. He gestures
to their surroundings.
MILES
Wrigley!
WRIGLEY
Sorry.
MILES
Sometimes I have serious doubts about
you.
WRIGLEY
I am very sorry.
MILES
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
WRIGLEY
No. You're not.
MILES
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer
clerked for Scalia.
Wrigley looks suicidal.
BACKGROUND LAWYER (O.S.)
Couldn't you simply walk away from
this abusive relationship?
WOMAN
No, he had the videos...
MILES
Anyway, I need a challenge. This --
He waves dismissively at the courtroom.
MILES
-- is not a challenge. I need
something I can sink my teeth into,
professionally speaking.
WOMAN
He would invite these girls home
from the staple factory to our
condominium in Palm Springs. He had
a device he called the Intruder.
JUDGE
Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have
any questions for the complainant.
MILES
I'm sorry, your honor, I was just
conferring with my associate...
He rises.
MILES
Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know
a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?
MRS. GUTTMAN
Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.
MILES
(sadly)
Accountant.
He reaches back and Wrigley puts a manila file in his hand.
MILES
We would like to offer these
photographs into evidence...
WAITING ROOM - MASSEY MEYSERSON
The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin
and her attorney Ruth Rabinow. Ruth is a sturdy woman in her
late 60's. If Mrs. Guttman had gone to law school...
RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Massey will see you now.
CONFERENCE ROOM
In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a
large fruit and pastry plate.
The door swings open. Miles rises.
MILES
...Ruth!
They shake hands.
MILES
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth.
And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
MARYLIN
And you must be Mr. Massey.
They appraise each other for a beat. They are impressed and,
they are impressive. As they settle in:
MARYLIN
(Sadly)
Hello, Rex.
REX
Marylin.
MARYLIN
Are you alright? You lost weight.
REX
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and
smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.
MILES
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
RUTH
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly
fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
MILES
A yert.
(To Rex)
Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a
time when most women are in Boca,
having early bird specials -- she's
working so her husband can be in
Montana. In a yert.
REX
What's a yert?
RUTH
(Dryly)
I ran into your mother at the
radiologist last week.
MILES
What?!
RUTH
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She
said to say hello. She's going to
Positano with your brother's family.
A tight, terse smile from Miles.
MILES
How nice.
MARYLIN
Positano is beautiful. Remember when
we were there, Rex? We stayed in the
Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
REX
Yeah.
They drift for a moment.
RUTH
So, Miles. If you have a proposal,
let's hear it.
MILES
At this point my client is still
prepared to consider reconciliation.
RUTH
My client has ruled that out.
MILES
My client is prepared to entertain
an amicable dissolution of the
marriage without prejudice.
RUTH
That's delusional.
MILES
My client proposes a thirty day
cooling off period.
RUTH
My client feels sufficiently
dispassionate.
MILES
My client asks that you not initiate
proceedings pending his setting
certain affairs in order.
RUTH
Ha Ha.
MILES
(conceding the point)
Heh heh.
REX
What's so goddamn funny?
Miles lays a hand on his arm.
MILES
Please -- let me handle this.
He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth.
MILES
-- So much for the icebreakers.
What're you after, Ruth?
RUTH
My client is prepared to settle for
fifty percent of the marital assets.
MILES
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why
not ask for a hundred percent?
RUTH
Oh brother. Here we go.
MILES
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
RUTH
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe
we're being too conservative. Seventy
five percent.
Rex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and
whispers to him.
MARYLIN
Do you need a Tagamet?
REX
You have some?
She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with
several vials of prescription drugs.
MARYLIN
These are yours.
MILES
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
She hands the pills to a grateful Rex. Their hands touch for
a moment.
MARYLIN
Have you been taking your digestive
enzymes?
REX
(Contrite)
Sometimes I forget.
She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth
watch the interaction.
MARYLIN
(To the attorneys)
I'm sorry. Where were we?
RUTH
We were about to request the primary
residence, and thirty percent of the
remaining assets.
MILES
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
RUTH
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner
was in Kentucky.
REX
What's Kirshner?
MILES
Please -- let me handle this. Okay,
Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your
bottom line?
RUTH
The primary residence and FORTY
percent of the remaining assets.
You're becoming tedious Miles.
REX
Aren't we going in the wrong
direction?
MILES
Shhh. Please. Let me do my job.
(To Ruth)
Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten
about Kirshner?
Ruth stands and closes her attach case.
RUTH
See you at the preliminary.
Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.
MILES
Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.
Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin
following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a
smile.
Rex swallows two more tablets. He sits, looking despondent.
MILES
I think that went as well as could
be expected.
REX
She always looked out for me.
MILES
And she had private investigators
assisting her.
REX
(Sentimental)
She brought my digestive enzymes.
MILES
In anticipation of making you sick.
REX
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.
MILES
A superficial display of marital
solicitude, and you lose your resolve?
Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm
your attorney, and if you choose to
reward her for that mediocre charade
of spousal concern...
He shrugs, helplessly.
REX
You're right. Screw her.
From behind the bower, RABBI BOLENSKY emerges, strumming his
guitar and singing:
BOLENSKY
Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme --
Remember me to one who lives there...
A pullback reveals Howard D. Doyle before the altar with
Marylin. He is in a tuxedo and yarmulke. She is dressed in a
simple, Kennedy-type gown.
BOLENSKY
-- she once was a true love of mine.
The last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone
sits.
As Miles and Wrigley seat themselves, Wrigley is sniffling.
Miles is irritated.
MILES
What the hell is wrong with you?
WRIGLEY
I can't help it. Even with the
business we're in, I -- it gets me
every time. It's so -- optimistic.
MILES
Is she going through with it?
As the crowd quiets with the end of the song, Wrigley murmurs:
WRIGLEY
If she's not going through with it,
she's cutting it awful close.
RABBI BOLENSKY
Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme.
Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients
for the banquet we call -- life.
Marriage is like a Great Feast.
Courtship is the Appetizer. A small
mixed green taste of things to come.
The Early Years -- The First Course --
a carefully poached fish dish
dependent on freshness and delicate
handling. Or perhaps a light pasta --
a tortellini stuffed with cheese and
hope.
WRIGLEY
(Whispers, to Miles)
You have any gum or mints?
RABBI
The main course -- Mature Love -- a
hearty stew, cooked slowly in the
oven of companionship until the meat
falls off the bone. And then --
dessert. The reward for years spent
together -- the sweetness of a Life
Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren,
followed by the decafe demitasse of
retirement.
There is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and
the restlessness of a hungry audience.
Finally:
RABBI BOLENKSY
Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin
to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang
though the lean years as well as
those that are heavily marbled?
DOYLE
I do.
RABBI BOLENSKY
And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take
Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel?
The stock in your sauce?
MARYLIN
I do.
MILES
Argh.
Heads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter.
RABBI BOLENSKY
Then, by the power vested in me by
the state of California, and as the
maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star
Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce
you -- man and wife...
A kiss. Cheers. Applause.
A RECEPTION ON THE GROUNDS
Rabbi Bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping
platter of smoked salmon.
Miles is darkly brooding as Wrigley opens a Tiffany box to
show him the contents.
WRIGLEY
What do you think?
MILES
What are they?
WRIGLEY
Berry spoons.
MILES
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm
surprised at you. What is this? Some
Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are
the most cockamamie things I've ever --
WRIGLEY
Miles -- why so angry?
Miles sounds wistful:
MILES
Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?
Ding Ding -- Howard D. is tapping a knife against his wine
glass. The crowd quiets.
DOYLE
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:
I have something to say to my bride.
Howard D. turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one
of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him.
DOYLE
-- Darling, like the rabbi said...
life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe,
and Marylin, darling... I just want
you to know that I am IN the kitchen
and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!
Laughter from the gallery.
DOYLE
And I'm going to start this marriage
by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot
hors d'oerve of this love story is --
Pre-nup Primavera!
He reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of
paper.
DOYLE
Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!
A Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of
Doyle. Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused.
DOYLE
-- This is for you, darling.
He starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping
them into the sauce, and eating them. His mouth stuffed with
paper, Doyle repeats:
DOYLE
-- this is for you, Darling.
The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a
smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild
cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand
together, nodding comprehension.
MILES
Brilliant.
Next to him Wrigley is puzzled.
WRIGLEY
Why is he doing that?
Miles' hand-clapping accelerates.
MILES
Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating
the pre-nup.
Wrigley's eyes widen. He looks back at Doyle eating the paper.
DOYLE
This is for you, Darling!
Wrigley bursts into tears.
WRIGLEY
That's -- the most romantic thing
I've ever seen -- in my LIFE!
DOYLE
THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!
LATER
Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations.
Miles approaches and draws her aside.
MILES
I'd like to offer my congratulations.
That was a beautiful gesture of
Howard's.
MARYLIN
Howard is a beautiful person.
MILES
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough.
And I have a feeling that someday
soon you'll be taking that diamond
and leaving the rough.
MARYLIN
Miles. Miles. Miles.
MILES
I am thrilled for you, but tell me
this... How'd you get Howard to do
it? I've addressed enough juries to
appreciate the power of suggestion,
but it seemed like he thought it was
his own idea.
MARYLIN
It was his idea. It was a gesture of
love and trust. Be happy for me,
Miles.
MILES
Well, when this goes south -- promise
you'll have dinner with me?
MARYLIN
(She holds a plate of
food for him)
Have you tried the duck?
MILES
I figure a couple of months. That's
how long it should take for the ink
on the settlement to dry.
He takes the plate of food from her.
MARYLIN
It has bones. Be sure to swallow
one.
MILES
Although knowing you as I do -- there
will be no settlement. This time it
will be complete and total
annihilation.
With a ROAR we CUT TO:
Miles is addressing the young associates.
MILES
For the first time in my life, I
stand before you naked...
vulnerable... and in love. Love. A
word matrimonial lawyers shy away
from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have
been frightened of this emotion which
is, in a sense, the seed of my
livelihood. But today, I am here to
tell you: Love should cause us no
fear. Love should cause us no shame.
Love... is good.
(He lets it sink in)
Let me ask you a question. When our
clients come to us confused, angry,
hurting because their flame of love
is fluttering and threatens to die --
should we seek to extinguish that
flame, so that we can sift through
the smoldering wreckage for our paltry
reward? Or should we seek to fan
this precious flame -- this most
precious flame -- back to loving,
roaring life?
The young associates look confused. Wrigley raises his hand.
WRIGLEY
Extinguish?
MILES
Should we counsel fear -- or trust?
Should we seek to destroy -- or to
build? Should we meet our clients'
problems with cynicism -- or with
love?
MILES
(another raised hand)
Kramer?
KRAMER
Build?
MILES
The decision of course, is each of
ours. For my part, I have made the
leap of love, and there is no going
back --
Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room. He watches,
breathing heavily.
Massey exits the car. He clutches a can of mace.
We hear a SMASHING -- BREAKING.
Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but quickly
prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one
end of the yard to the other.
