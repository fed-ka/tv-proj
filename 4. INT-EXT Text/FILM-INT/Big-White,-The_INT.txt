A police car, nothing more than a speck on the landscape, is intermittently
visible through the blowing snow.
A CORPORAL (20s), behind the wheel, with a bored DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s)
at his side.
CORPORAL
So his hand is like, off, right.
So he puts on a
tourniquet, puts the hand in his pocket, walks five
miles through the bush til he gets to the highway,
where he passes out, on the road, right.
Then this
logging truck comes along...
DETECTIVE BOYLE
(looking ahead)
Hey.
The Corporal looks forward.
CAR'S POV: Through the windshield of a WOMAN (40s), dressed in her
pajamas and a parka, skipping down the middle of the road.

The dumpster lid opens on a bitterly cold, gray winter's day in an Alaskan city.
A
chunky, shivering HAIR STYLIST with jet black bangs shakes out a box of
conditioning samples.
HAIR STYLIST
(to someone O.S.)
She says "I haven't eaten all day," then, right there on
the bus she pulls out this, like, salmon steak and
I'm...

The dumpster lid BANGS shut, reopens a beat later. A moment of calm until
two garbage bags SLAM against the inside of the lid. It falls shut with a CLANG.

The lid reopens.
SIRENS off in the distance...
MEN'S VOICES (O.S.)
One, two, three... up.
The lifeless body of a fair-sized man comes CRASHING into the garbage.
SIRENS closer.
A man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull some garbage
over the corpse.
A second man looks in, then pulls the first man away.
MAN'S VOICE
We'll get him later.
C'mon.
The lid drops.

A group of office WORKERS look on, very much impressed, as a stunned
Howard stares at the camera.
TED (O.S.)
Howard, you seem like a reasonable kind of guy.
Lets you and me talk.
TIGHT ON: WATTERS at his nearby cubicle, typing frenetically on his computer.
At first, he appears to be working, until we realize that on his computer screen
pixilated Zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail of bullets.
A
Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration.
As the tape finishes, a smattering of APPLAUSE from his colleagues.
Ted
gives a small wave over the cubicle wall.
TED (cont'd)
Thank you.
Just happy to give something back to
Liberty Capital...
(to himself - bitter)
After all they've done for me.

CAM (30s), Native-American Alaskan walks over. Ted immediately hits a key
that turns the screen to a spread-sheet.
CAM
That was really cool.
It was like... watching "Cops".
TED
He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc.
CAM
You know, I don't want to bitch or anything, but you
were supposed to take me along on that one.
TED
Couldn't find you.
CAM
I know you know this, but the sooner they think I can
handle calls on my own, the sooner they'll kick you
back down south.
TED
I've been hearing that for 13 months and six days,
Cam.
After a while, it gets a little old.
(off Cam's look)
Next time, okay.
Good enough.
Cam moves off.
Back to the zombie blood bath.
The phone
RINGS.
Ted picks up, his eyes never wavering from the gore intensive
computer game.
TED (cont'd)
Claims, Ted Watters.
Sure.
A final key stroke separates one last zombie from its entrails.

TIGHT ON: A MOUNTED SALMON
We PULL BACK to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life spent on the
edge of the wilderness; citations from the Rotarians, pictures of sponsored
hockey teams... We are --
FRANK BRANCH (50s), a mid-level management type sits across from PAUL
BARNELL (40s), a mild-mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit.
Paul
takes in the display.
The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.
PAUL
That's... quite the fish.
Branch is about to answer when Ted enters with a slim file.
BRANCH
Paul Barnell, Ted Watters.
Handshakes.
Paul makes steady eye contact.
Ted notices.
BRANCH (cont'd)
Mr. Barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life
insurance policy.
Ted sits and flips open the file.
TED
Raymond, isn't it?
PAUL
Yes, Raymond.
You see, as I've already explained to
Mr. Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and I
thought it might be time to... move on.
TED
By move on you mean...?
BRANCH
...cash in Raymond's policy.
Ted smiles to himself.
PAUL
I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive.
My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after
each other if anything should ever happen.
And to
be frank, money's a little --
TED
I understand Mr. Barnell, but here's the thing. With no
actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must
be missing for seven years before he or she can be
legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an
investigation period where concerned parties can
take up to another year to file interventions
concerning the motion.
So, even though your
brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's
really very little we can do for you.
Ted flips the file shut.
Case closed.
Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's
demeanor, forces a smile.
BRANCH
Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.
Branch looks at Ted.
Ted turns to Paul.
TED
Oh, absolutely.

Paul driving, talking on his cell phone and balancing a big non-spill metallic
travel coffee mug at the same time.
PAUL
Hang on, hang on.
First off, how did you get my cell
number?
(Beat)
Because it's for mechanical and
medical emergencies only.
Paul, wound up, taps his brakes too hard.
His mug falls, the lid pops and the
coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers.
PAUL (cont'd)
Great.
(back into phone)
No, I'm not...
I just... give me a second here.
Paul parks his car, gathers the soggy papers and gets out.
13
A15
Paul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the
dumpster.
He can't take his eyes off it.
Behind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and
walking toward the door.
He's oblivious.
At the sound of a TRUCK, his head snaps around.
It's a garbage truck, but
instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road.
That's all it
takes.

Black.
The fridge door opens, the light revealing several cans of pop and beer
in the foreground.
Behind the
beverages, a garage where Paul struggles with the lifeless body.
He props the
man against the hood of his car, gives him a quick once over, pockets, obvious
wounds.
Nothing.
Paul moves to the fridge, starts to pull things out.
17

Jodie, an annoyingly small dog, enters the garage from the house and starts
sniffing around the body.
A new chew toy!
PAUL
(at the sound)
Jodie, no!
Not for dogs!
He SHOOS the dog back into the house.
Paul moves back to the fridge, opens
the door and, with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him
inside.
Only problem...
The man's legs don't want to fit.
Paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative
appendage.
He grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee.
It SNAPS
sideways.
Paul fights nausea.
But with the leg now out of joint, the man fits.
Paul,
breathing heavy, leans against the door.
PAUL (cont'd)
OK then.
OK.
He packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles.
Then, just before
he shuts the door, Paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9
(the coldest setting).
A padlock and chain come from the base of a propane BBQ.
It goes around the
fridge, the lock SNAPS it in place.
Paul spots some leftover drink cans.
He
kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.
PAUL (cont'd)
Hey Honey.
Any mail?

Ted checks out various radio stations, hating everything.
He lands on one
playing "Escape (The pia Colada Song)" when he looks up and suddenly
jams on the brakes.

Paul tries to open the front door, but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow.
Three good yanks and it finally opens. He enters the shop.
Faded travel posters cover the walls.
AVIS (40s), a career office gal, smiles at
her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha
Airlines.
It features a
dark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell.
The shell juts out of
the display giving it a 3-D quality.
AVIS
Morning Mr. Barnell.
Coffee?
PAUL
Thanks Avis.
Looks good.
Paul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air
surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back.
PAUL (cont'd)
Was November this bad last year?
AVIS (O.S.)
Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk
about?
Did you send the computer back?
Paul moves to his desk.
PAUL
Yeah, it was not working.
Any calls?
AVIS (O.S.)
Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric.
I
told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some
people don't like to listen.
Paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot, then at a photo of his
wife Margaret on his desk.
He mentally gathers himself.
PAUL
Something... strange happened last night Avis.
AVIS (O.S.)
What was that?
PAUL
Did... you ever meet my brother Raymond?
AVIS (O.S.)
The one who went missing?
PAUL
Uh huh.
Well anyway last night there's a knock on
the door and there's Raymond, just... standing there
on the doorstep.
Avis arrives with the coffee and the mail.
AVIS
Didn't you have him declared...?
PAUL
Dead?
No.
I mean, they said he hadn't been gone
long enough.
AVIS
(smiling warmly)
Good thing in hindsight.
Paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it.
Lots of bills,
most marked past due.
He finds a "pre- approved" credit card application, sets
it to one side.
AVIS (cont'd)
So where was he all these years?
PAUL
Lower 48.
Said he wanted to get away from the cold.
AVIS
Where 'bouts?
PAUL
(looking up)
Sorry, what was that?
AVIS
Where was he living?
Paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the Hawaii display.
He keys on the shell.
PAUL
Florida.
AVIS
I've got an aunt down there.
Where 'bouts?
PAUL
(blanking)
A uh... small place.
By the beach.
AVIS
Well that's great.
You and Mrs. Barnell will have
some company for a bit I guess.
How is she?
PAUL
Better, a little better.
Some days are better than
others.

MARGARET BARNELL (early 40s) stands in a plush bathrobe and slippers.
Despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the
front door, opening it on -- a young wholesome PAPERBOY smiling through the
cold.
PAPERBOY
Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.
MARGARET
Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.
I'll get my purse.
The paperboy, unfazed, smiles as Margaret walks off.
PAPERBOY
It's 12 dollars.
I missed you last time.
MARGARET (O.S.)
Jerk off... OK, jerk off, uhhuh...
Margaret gives the paperboy his money, the stamp card plus a dollar tip, then
tweaks his nose.
Twice.
MARGARET (cont'd)
You say hi to your slut Mom for me?
PAPERBOY
Sure will.
Thanks.
He trots down the walk as Margaret shuts the door.
24
25
Margaret, still in her bathrobe, walks to the fridge.
As she puts her hand on the
latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor.
She tugs on the door.
It opens just a crack before the chain stops it.
The
frozen head peeks through the slight gap.
Margaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way.
She gives the door a hip check.
The door latches shut while something frozen
and brittle inside CRACKS.
Margaret, oblivious, walks away.

A chicken sits in a pan, the rest of the room visible behind it through the oven
door window.
MARGARET (O.S.)
Paul?
Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut?
PAUL
How's my Angel tonight?
MARGARET
Blow me.
Dinner's almost ready.
You feel like some
wine?
I feel like some wine.
Paul walks to the oven, opens the door and pats the chicken.
Stone cold.
PAUL
Sweetie, here's a crazy thought... I don't feel like
chicken tonight, why don't we order in?
MARGARET
Fuck it, okay.
PAUL
There's actually something we need to talk about.
It's about Raymond.
He's back.
Paul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door.
Behind the chicken, Margaret
doesn't look happy as Paul starts to explain.
She rushes from the room.
27/28 TIGHT ON: TV SCREEN
27/28
Home video of RAYMOND (then early 30s), fat, physically imposing and the only
person not in festive tropical gear, standing in a VFW hall decorated in a
Caribbean theme. (He is definitely not the same person Paul has cooling in the
fridge.)
A large banner behind him proclaims "HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY -
BON VOYAGE."
RAYMOND
(a little drunk)
Okay, I never thought it would last this long, but
seeing as how it has... There ya go.
Let me just say
that my brother, old "Puddles McBarnesy" did better
than he should have.
A younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his
brother and smiles.
PAUL
What'cha saying there Raymond?
Wha'cha saying
'bout me?
Raymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder.
RAYMOND
Enough, OK?
PAUL
(sing-songy)
Ray's a little jeallllllllous.
This is the one that got
away, right Ray?
The crowd LAUGHS as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair.
Raymond, furious, grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to
the floor.
The laughter stops.
MARGARET (O.S.)
Leave him alone, ball licker!
RAYMOND
And shut that thing --
The screen turns to snow.
We are...
Paul at his desk, watching the video on a small TV in the wall unit.
He turns his
attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents, souvenirs, old report
cards...
On the TV playing behind him (the second part of the tape), Margaret is pictured
on a cruise ship, sunning herself.
Paul, obviously behind the camera, watches
as Margaret takes a tropical drink from a WAITER'S tray, who promptly dumps it
all over her.
But instead of the expected burst of profanity, Margaret just
LAUGHS.
MARGARET
That's okay, don't worry about it.
(as the waiter walks off)
I'd like the next one in a cup, please.
Paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from Hawaii and digs out an insurance
policy out of the box.
On the last page is a list of the payouts.
Loss of a limb:
$100,000.
Loss of thumb: $5,000. Accidental death: $1,000,000.
And, as an extra bonus, Raymond's birth certificate.
Perfect. Paul takes out the
credit card application from work, and starts to write...
PAUL
(to himself)
Raymond... Barnell.

Gary and Jimbo sit in their car in the parking area.
JIMBO
Which one's your sister's kid?
GARY
See the one on the little bike-thing?
Him.
JIMBO
(hesitant)
You been alright with this?
GARY
The thing with the guy?
Ya know, I thought it might
kinda mess me up...
JIMBO
First time for both of us.
GARY
...but I've been sleeping really well.
JIMBO
Yeah.
'Course, you didn't actually...
Jimbo mimics snapping someone's neck.
It's clearly not a gesture he enjoys.
As Gary looks at him, a Cadillac pulls up beside them.
Behind the wheel is
DAVE (50s) well dressed, in a thuggish kinda way.
Jimbo and Gary share a
nervous look.

A 33
HIGH ANGLE ON:
Paul and Margaret in bed.
Margaret takes up more than her
share of the bed, her arm tossed over her husband.
Paul, on his third of the
bed, looks as if he's lying in state. But Paul's not sleeping.

GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Paul has the "Morning News" on the hood of his car.
He looks over at the
fridge, still padlocked.
PAUL
(to himself)
Let's see if anyone's missing you.
He flips through each section.
There's nothing.
Paul walks to the fridge.
PAUL (cont'd)
(to the corpse)
I don't know what kind of man let's himself just
freeze to death in the trash, but I was never one to
preach.
Way I see it, you've probably got family
somewhere and they'd probably appreciate seeing
you get a decent funeral, even if it's not really... yours.
Paul, somewhat befuddled, gently pats the fridge door.

Margaret pushes the vacuum across the floor, humming to herself.

He notices that the vacuum isn't plugged in.

Margaret doesn't flinch.

Paul walks in from the garage, pulling off his blue parka.
Margaret enters from
the living room.
(Paul still has the pillow taped to his front, which Margaret
happily pokes with a finger but never mentions.)
MARGARET
(nervous)
He's not here, is he?
PAUL
Sweetie, don't you worry about Raymond.
MARGARET
When he's around, it just brings back... Fuck.
PAUL
I know.
He, he said he's probably gonna head back
down South soon.
Margaret smiles, relieved.
The phone RINGS.
Paul picks up.

Mrs. Wherry talks on the phone in her kitchen.
The head of a large antelope is
mounted on the wall behind her.
MRS. WHERRY
Paul?
Thank you so much for clearing the drive way.
That was most considerate.
PAUL
I'm afraid I don't understand Mrs. Wherry.
MRS. WHERRY
You were out at the cabin this morning.
Nice to see
you getting some use out of that thing.

Paul shakes off his boots.
PAUL
Oh I see.
No, you see that must have been
Raymond.
(beat) Very much so.
No, no one was
more surprised than we were. (beat)
No, he's...
indisposed right now, but I'm sure you'll see him
again.
He's going to stay at the cabin for a while
until he... leaves.
And bless you too.

PAUL'S KITCHEN
- DAY

Jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy, jumping up and down at the feet of Paul
who stands over a SIZZLING frying pan full of bacon.
He checks the bacon's
consistency with a fork.
Still pretty raw.
He takes the bacon and lays it on a
plate.
Beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler.
Paul carefully
takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap.
He holds it
up.
The bacon hangs down like fringe.
Margaret appears in the doorway.
MARGARET
Paul?
PAUL
(startled)
Holy-- Margaret, you scared the wits out of me.
Margaret lifts up Jodie, who's desperately trying to get at the hat.
MARGARET
She just wants that bacon.
PAUL
Such a little puppy.
How late is "Rudys" open?

The second level of a large indoor driving range/mini golf course.
The sound of
clubs SMACKING golf balls echo as an intense Ted "waggles" before his shot.
On his back-swing, Tiffany throws her arms around him from behind.
TED
I take it you're done?
TIFFANY
Yup.
TED
Wanna hit some of mine?
TIFFANY
(hugging him harder)
Nope.
He turns, LAUGHING.
They kiss as she playfully starts to grope him.
TED
Now this is definitely a violation of Golf Dome policy.
TIFFANY
Must be all this talk about using your wood.
TED
Woods.
So maybe later I can... check your grip?
TIFFANY
Secret?
TED
My dirty talk sucks?
TIFFANY
I like it when you try, though.
Tiffany gives him a peck and flits back to a nearby chair.
He hits one, skying it
into a low hanging light.
TED
You know in some states they actually do this
outside?
Tiffany looks over at one of the tacky tropically-theme'd mini-golf holes.
TIFFANY
So how many insurance companies are there in the
United States?
Like, a billion.
TED
That's not the point, Tiff.
I've busted my ass for
Liberty Capital.
I don't want to quit.
I deserve to be
promoted out of this ice bound backwater.
TIFFANY
And when it happens, I guess I'll just be another
notch on your briefcase.
TED
I can't believe you said that.
You know you are...
He looks around.
Embarrassed, he lowers his voice.
TED (cont'd)
...the most important thing in my life.
TIFFANY
(smiling/shouting)
Sorry, what was that!
You want to take me right
here?
As other GOLFERS look over, Tiffany and Ted share a warm smile, the moment
only broken by the ringing of a CELL PHONE.
She SIGHS, unzips Ted's gym
bag and answers his phone.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
Psychic... Uhm, sorry, hello?
Yeah.
Look, is this a
matter of life and death, because right now he's...
Suddenly concerned, she hands the phone to Ted.
TED
Hello? (beat)
You're kidding me.

Yeah, I'll hold.
TIFFANY

Million dollar life policy just checked.
TIFFANY

What about the first annual golf, sex
and pizza triathlon?
TED
Look, if this is... who I think it is, I may have found us
a ticket out of here.
TIFFANY
We don't need a ticket.
Tiffany stands, knowing it's no use arguing, she pulls on her coat.
Ted tries to
give her a hug.
She falls into his embrace, but doesn't hug him back.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
Don't be late, OK?

Boyle moves toward the head and pulls back the covering.
Ted recoils.
Cam
leans in for a closer look.
CAM
Ouch.
That's gotta hurt.
TED
So what's your line on this?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Just what it looks like.
Wolves got him. Maybe a
grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks.
TED
Would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to
cash in his policy two weeks ago?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell chewed off his
brother's leg?
TED
Doesn't that make you the least bit suspicious?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple ending.
We like
nice simple endings.
TED
But shouldn't you--
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but
I'm guessing it's your job
to find a way not to pay these poor people.
CAM
Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down
whatever leads we can find.
Ted walks down to the head of the victim, pulls out a camcorder and starts to
tape the body.
TED
Detective, we're an insurance company, not the
Salvation Army.
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Mind telling me what you're doing?
CAM
They gave every claims team a video camera last
quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on
litigation.
We had this case two months ago where
this mother of six was claiming...
DETECTIVE BOYLE
I've got my own war stories, thanks.
You mind
stopping that?

Yes, I caught that.

Branch, very unhappy, flips through some papers then looks up at Ted and

TED
This isn't a standard case.
You were there when
this guy came in looking to cash in.
C'mon, it stinks.
BRANCH
Secondly, if the police say this guy was...
CAM
Eaten by wolves.
Sir.
BRANCH
(incredulous)
Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case.
Did you
see Mr. Barnell on the news last
night?
Last thing we need is bad P.R.
I don't want
this thing Valdeez-ing on us.
TED
Mr. Branch, I'm sure head office would take a rather
dim view of our --
BRANCH
Corporate's view will be whatever I tell them.
Cam, seeing his partner is about to get himself into a heap of trouble, hustles
him toward the door.
CAM
Yes Sir.

PAUL
That's right, yes.
TED
Any idea what he was doing out there?
PAUL
He'd go for walks.
Hikes, I mean.
Hiking.
TED
How sporty.
Was he a big hiker?
PAUL
Not sure I follow.
TED
Did he hike more than once a week?
Or was this a...
one time thing?
PAUL
Can I ask why you need to know all this?
TED
Just trying to tie up a few loose ends.
PAUL
You know the police... they say Raymond died in the
attack.
You do cover that sort of thing don't you?

Trust me. Something's not right.
I can smell it.
Help
me buy a week.
CAM
We're gonna get in such trouble.
TED
I promise from now on you can come along on
everything.
CAM
No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted
disappears for three hours?
TED
I'll try.
CAM
And you'll work on your interpersonal skills?
TED
(a long beat)
Yes.
CAM
Good.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go start covering
your ass.

Paul sits beside his desk, flipping through travel brochures. Margaret enters,
teetering in the doorway.
Paul looks up.
PAUL
Hey.
How's my Princess?
MARGARET
OK.
I took some Adavan.
And called my psychic.
PAUL
(picks up the phone bill)
Honey, you know how expensive that is.
I thought we
agreed that...
She moves to him, runs her hand through his hair.
MARGARET
Don't be mad.
It's just... this week has been so...
well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and
someone trying to steal the fridge.
PAUL
I know.
Why don't you --
MARGARET
We got another letter from the HMO today.
PAUL
Have you opened it yet?
Margaret starts to CRY, holding the letter up to her face the SOBS building to a
full blown breakdown.
PAUL (cont'd)
Oh hey honey, come on now.
MARGARET
I'm sorry.
It's just, fucking cocksuckers.
Paul takes the letter, unfolds it and reads...
PAUL
"As we have stated previously... usual onset before
the age of 18... coupled with no genetic history..."
MARGARET
I'm sick!
I'm really, really sick!
PAUL
Shush, now.
(reading again) "We hasten to add,
Tourette Syndrome is not..."
MARGARET
Fuck them.
Paul is about to say something, but returns to the letter.
PAUL
"As well, please reference our previous decisions
regarding your claims for ADD, ODO, OCD,
ADHOPHI...
(treading lightly)
Honey.
I know you don't like to talk about it, but
maybe it's not... what we might think it is but... maybe
it's just stress?
Remember that cruise?
I saw you.
You were happy.
Margaret looks at him, crestfallen.
PAUL (cont'd)
I'm sorry.
I'm just really tired.
MARGARET
They say you can't get it all of a sudden but I did.
I
really, really did.
PAUL
I know.
They just don't --
MARGARET
I'll kill myself.
Then they'll see.
PAUL
That is nonsense talk.
MARGARET
Then you can go off and...
(sobbing again)
...marry someone normal.
PAUL
You're the most normal girl I know.
MARGARET
I'm not crazy, Paul.
Something's really wrong with
me.
He takes her to a small sofa, cradles her in his arms.
PAUL
I know, Sweetie.
I know.
And we're gonna find you
the best specialists in...
(a second, then confident)
...what you have that we can.
MARGARET
Promise?
PAUL
I really think things are going to turn around.
Call me
cr... I just have a feeling.
You just leave everything to
me, OK?
Is that OK?
Leave everything to me?
I
promise.
MARGARET
(gently)
Shit bag.
PAUL
That's my girl.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON : TV SCREEN
70/71
Where Edward G. Robinson (as the character Keyes in "Double Indemnity")
grills a man about a fake insurance claim.
EDWARD G. ROBINSON
"Every time one of these phonies comes along it ties
knots in my stomach... I can't eat.
That's how I knew
your claim was crooked..."
At the sound of DOORBELL, the whole scene freezes.
We are --
Tiffany at her desk, working on the computer.
Ted has paused the DVD, puts
down the Barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered PIZZA GUY, soggy
pizza box in hand.
TED
Hey.
PIZZA GUY
Hi there.
That'll be $12.97.
Ted looks at his watch.
TED
What about thirty minutes or free?
PIZZA GUY
Doesn't apply when it's snowing.
TED
(digging out his wallet)
So nine months of the year your guarantee is
worthless?
PIZZA GUY
It doesn't snow every day.
TED
They should really tell people when they order.
TIFFANY
Would you just give him the money already?
PIZZA GUY
It's not my decision.
TED
I know that.
I'm just saying.
PIZZA GUY
Sure.
TED
You understand though?
PIZZA GUY
Absolutely.
TED
It wouldn't take much.
PIZZA GUY
Full disclosure to the pizza consumer. I'll be sure to
pass that along.
The delivery guy leaves.
Ted walks back into the living room.
Tiffany comes over, grabs a slice.
TIFFANY
Why you gotta argue with the service industry?
TED
The problem with people today is they don't expect
anyone to tell the truth.
We've just come to accept lying as acceptable.
TIFFANY
If this is another passive/aggressive shot at Psychic
Buddies, all our ads state "for amusement purposes
only."
TED
Tiff, it has nothing to do with... look, just forget it.
TIFFANY
You remember being amused, don't ya, honey?
What is with you anyway?
TED
Want to know what's "with" me?
I'm on the verge of
cracking the biggest case of my career, one that
corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap.
Not my boss, and not even my girlfriend.
TIFFANY
So this is my fault?
TED
No, it's not your fault. I just want to live somewhere
where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza
doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled.
Tiffany storms off as Ted flops onto the couch, swipes the snow from the top of
the pizza box and hits play on the DVD.
EDWARD G. ROBINSON
"What kind of outfit is this, anyway?
Are we an
insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted
amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that?"
Tiffany turns from the bedroom door, almost in tears.
TIFFANY
You know, even though Edward G. Robinson wins,
everyone like Fred MacMurray better.
She SLAMS the door.
Ted doesn't move, lost in his own world.

Ted and Mrs. Wherry sit on plastic covered furniture.
The mounted heads of
several dozen dead animals, foxes, wolves, elk, surround them.
Ted takes
notes.
MRS. WHERRY
It was terrible.
Just terrible. Raymond should have
known better.
TED
(re: the mounted heads)
All these yours?
MRS. WHERRY
Greatest sport on earth.
Moved to a compound bow
two years ago.
(whisper)
Arthritis.
Less draw weight.
She mimics pulling back an imaginary bow with her bony hand.
MRS. WHERRY (cont'd)
Coffee OK?
TED
I'm fine.
Did you talk to Raymond at all when he
came home?
Was he getting along with his
brother?
MRS. WHERRY
No.
Only saw him the once.
Never spoke.
Waved to
him.
TED
Waved?
MRS. WHERRY
He was clearing my driveway.
Raymond was a real
hellcat when he was younger.
But like they say, time
mellows even the hardest soul.
TED
Was he much of an outdoorsman?
MRS. WHERRY
I thought it was Paul at first.
Have you met Paul's
wife?
Now there's a story.
Not that I'm much for
gossip, but I think Raymond used to have a --
TED
Mrs. Wherry, I'm sorry, but --
MRS. WHERRY
Sorry.
Did Raymond like the outdoors.
Not so
much, no.
Liked living out here at the cabin, though.
I think he had some friends on the police force.
Have you talked to them?
They'd pull up here day
and night, always looking for --
TED
I'm sorry, did you say you thought it was Paul who
did your driveway?
MRS. WHERRY
Well in a ski mask you can hardly tell who's who.
Now, how 'bout some jerky?
I've got it drying out
back.
73
73
Ted at his cubicle, thinking hard as he chews on some jerky as he works the
phone.
Snow whips by outside the window.
TED
(just waiting to cut in)
That's really super, Simon.
Now how'd you like to
run some names for me?
Ted sees Cam reflected in his dark computer screen.
Annoyed, he puts his
hand over the receiver.
TED (cont'd)
You mind?
CAM
Now, now.
Let's not forget who's pulling double duty.
TED
(hanging up)
Simon, I'll call you back.
(to Cam: forced)
Sorry.
CAM
Much better.
So?
TED
Turns out our Mr. Barnell is mortgaged to the nuts.
His business is about one step
away from chapter 11.
Plus it's like his brother
Raymond never existed.
He's got no credit history,
no nothing for the last five years.
CAM
Ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a
crime.
People around here have been known to
swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison.
Doesn't exactly leave a paper trail.
TED
Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace.
Plus, the
only thing he did after his recent "reappearance" was
get some new ID and a new credit card.
Didn't
charge anything.
CAM
Wow.
Less than nothing.
TED
It's something.
CAM
No it's not... in my humble, junior investigator's
opinion.
The phone RINGS.
Ted picks up.
TED
Watters, claims.
Yeah, hang on...
(to Cam)
It's personal.
I promise.
Cam shrugs, walks off.
Ted waits 'til he's gone...
TED (cont'd)
Mr. Barnell... Your ears must have been burning, I
was just -- sure, what time?
Ted is scribbling down something on a pad of paper.
74
75
Gary and Jimbo sit in their vehicle, watching as Ted gets out of his car and is
swallowed in a white out.
He reappears a moment later farther up the hill.
GARY
We should have checked the funeral
announcements right away.
JIMBO
Shoot.
76
A76
JIMBO
That's your plan?
GARY
How tough can it be?
JIMBO
You ever try digging through six feet of half frozen
sod?
We'd need a back hoe.
Can you operate a
back hoe?
Do you know where we'd get a back
hoe?
We don't even know for sure...
GARY
Oh please.
Don't you think it's a pretty neat
coincidence?
JIMBO
Maybe we just go explain it to Dave.
GARY
He won't take it well.
JIMBO
Then I'm all for new options, here, Gary. (beat)
If we
give the money back--
GARY
Hey, wait a minute, now.
We did the job.
We
deserve the--
JIMBO
I did the job, Gary.
I know, because I haven't been
sleeping for the last week.
GARY
I don't know why you're letting it get to you like this.
Look, let's just not rush into anything.
It's my turn to
step up.
I know that.
I'm on it.
They look on as Paul is interviewed by the reporters.

Margaret washes down some pills with her morning coffee as she looks at a
fawn in the backyard, nibbling on a bush.
MARGARET
Hey little, Bambi.
Where's your Mommy?
Gettin' it
from some ten point buck.
Yes she is.
Yes she is.
Just then, a THUMPING sound from the garage causes the fawn to bolt.
Margaret turns, suspicious.
She picks up the portable phone as she moves
toward the door.
79
79
Gary sticks his head inside the now unchained fridge, grabs a can of soda
from the door rack and closes the door.
A moment later, he reopens the door...
There, hanging off the frosty inside, is a chunk of the dead man's hair and
scalp.
Gary pulls it off, not sure what it means, but sure it means something.
Unseen behind him, Margaret steps into the garage.
She quickly assesses
the situation.
MARGARET
Stay away from our fucking appliances.
Gary spins, shocked to see Margaret.
GARY
Lady, just calm down.
Margaret, eyes wide with fear, unleashes a hailstorm of soda cans,
knickknacks, gardening implements and anything else she can lay her hands
on.
GARY (cont'd)
Hey!
Would you... Lady... I have a--
He tries to close in on her, but the torrent of stuff (a rake, a Whipper-Snipper,
an old pair of skates...) keeps him pinned down.
Finally, he manages to grab his
gun from his pocket.
But even as he raises it...
A Bissel Handvac catches him flush in the face.
GARY (cont'd)
Sud of a bit!
He drops to his knees, grabbing his nose, which is now gushing blood.
Margaret reaches for her portable phone and starts punching numbers.
MARGARET
You are in so much trouble.
Gary stands, pissed off, gun aimed at Margaret's head.
GARY
Lady, so help me I --
Gary ducks as the phone whizzes over his head and smashes against the
garage wall.
He stares at her.
Game over.

A standard corrugated metal storage facility.
Snow falls in from a large hole
that's been cut in the roof.
Cam and Ted, clipboard in hand, stand by the
owner, MR. SPELLMAN (50s).
CAM
So you're a souvenir wholesaler?
SPELLMAN
For the cruise ship trade, mostly.
Usual stuff, stuffed
animals, your huskies, your moose, your baby seals,
your whales, your walrus --
TED
They came in through there?
SPELLMAN
(looking up/duh!)
Yeah.
Through that... big hole in the roof.
I got a list
of all the things that are missing.
Ted stares up at the sky through the ceiling.
TED
How much?
SPELLMAN
Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof.
Now I know you guys are gonna bust my --
TED
Fax over your estimate.
We'll have you a check by
Friday.
CAM
(taking Ted aside)
Ted.
Maybe we should take a look at their inventory
list first?
TED
This is a simple case, Cam.
Bad guys, through roof,
stole stuff.
Let's clear it and get going.
SPELLMAN
I should tell you... we also had some VCRs we were
holding for another company.
That could run
another couple of...
TED
Cam?
You wanna wrap this up?
(off his look)
Gotta go primary some time.
Cam shrugs-- "sure."
Ted hands him his clipboard and walks out, the door
closes behind him with a loud BANG.
CAM
Mr. Spellman?
Now I noticed a nice looking
computer in your office.
Why do you think they left
that?
81

Margaret sits taped to a Lazy-Boy recliner.
Gary, who's still bleeding from the
nose, sits across from her.
MARGARET
You try and rape me, I swear to Christ I'll bite it off.
Gary looks confused.
The doorbell CHIMES, playing "Tiny Bubbles."
(We stay
in the living room as Gary answers it.)
JIMBO (O.S.)
What's going on?
GARY (O.S.)
Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind.
They both enter the room.
Jimbo looks at Gary, is about to smack him when...
MARGARET
So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both
ends?
Gary and Jimbo have no idea how to react.
Margaret senses their discomfort,
starts to relax.
GARY
I just came to look around, but she started yelling
and hitting me...
MARGARET
Oh please.
JIMBO
How the hell is this solving our problem?
How is
this stepping up?
GARY
Just listen, okay.
MARGARET
Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck hasn't stopped
up your ears.
Jimbo looks confused.
Gary ushers him into the other room.
82
82
Gary and Jimbo sit at the table, talking.
Jimbo's not happy.
JIMBO
This is not what we do.
GARY
It is now.
JIMBO
Where would we stash her?
Your place?
GARY
Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out
without anyone seeing.
And I've seen that sty you
call an apartment.
JIMBO
See, it's just a bad idea.
GARY
Yeah.
Maybe.
(a possible idea)
You see the whirlpool tub?
JIMBO
You can't be serious.
GARY
It could be like a little getaway.
Off Jimbo, considering this.
83
84
Paul walks in from the garage, pulls off his jacket.
PAUL
Hey Maggie-magster.
How ya --
Paul stops short as he sees Margaret, Gary and Jimbo sitting around the table.
Margaret's mouth is taped shut.
Paul is about to lunge at the men when Gary slides his gun into view.
He
stops.
PAUL (cont'd)
What are you people doing in my house?
GARY
Mr. Barnell.
You have something that belongs to us.
PAUL
I, I don't know what you're talking about.
JIMBO
Do you remember a dead man you found in the
dumpster behind your office?
Paul, shocked, tries to hold it together.
PAUL
No, I can't say that... I mean that would probably stick
in my mind a... dead body.
GARY
Think hard Mr. Barnell.
He tosses the frozen lock of hair onto the table.
GARY (cont'd)
Think hard.
Paul realizes he's screwed, gestures to the living room.
85
85
Gary sits on the sofa as Paul paces.
GARY
I thought it might be some weirdo sex thing, ya
know?
But you look like a pretty straight arrow.
So
then I'm thinking, maybe it's a scam.
Maybe
somehow our friend is worth some money to you.
Paul face lets Gary know he's dead on.
GARY (cont'd)
So what'd you collect?
PAUL
We, we had a life insurance policy
on my brother.
It was for... 100,000 dollars.
GARY
You know, it's always you quiet guys.
Here's how it's
going to work.
We stay here with your wife, you go
get our guy.
PAUL
Here?
GARY
We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead.
Plus you'll have to explain
how you scammed the insurance people out of their
hard earned money.
We'll call you in three days.
Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our
trouble.
Screw with us, we start mailing your wife
back to you.
Gary pauses for dramatic effect.
GARY (cont'd)
Starting with her feet.
86
86
Gary walks in on Jimbo and Margaret, still gagged.
JIMBO
He gone?
Gary nods, well pleased with himself.
GARY
He was scared.
Really scared.
JIMBO
You used the feet thing, didn't you?
GARY
No.
87

Tiffany comes through the door carrying a sack of groceries.
TIFFANY
Hey, little help here.
I got Pop Tarts.
She sees the living room wall -- it's covered with charts, diagrams and
theories.
Ted on the floor, remote control in hand, replaying the shots of the
body over and over...
TIFFANY (cont'd)
(re: the screen)
Don't tell me, "Sound of Music"?
(no reaction)
Honey?
You OK?
TED
Shhhh.
This is the important part.
Ted rewinds the tape, hits play, rewinds it again as -- Tiffany watches, quietly at
first, then with growing frustration.
Finally, she walks over and grabs the
remote control.
TED (cont'd)
I was watching that.
TIFFANY
This stops now.
This case is making me and you
crazy, especially you.
No response.
Tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through Ted's files.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
Ya know, I am trying to be supportive.
Leading
experts agree that's the number one complaint men
have about their mates.
TED
I don't have any complaints about my... you.
TIFFANY
(re: the file)
Dead guy's got a record?
Cool.
TED
Yeah. He beat the hell out of some guy in bar fight.
Broke the guy's eye socket.
Tiffany scans the file, then looks up at the screen.
TIFFANY
Honey?
TED
Yeah?
TIFFANY
I think you should read this again.
He looks.
She tosses him the file.

Margaret, still taped to a chair, sits at the kitchen table.
By the stove, Gary is
cooking, an apron tied like a bath towel around his waist.
MARGARET
We don't have any money, you know.
GARY
Lady.
Please.
MARGARET
If you want Raymond's fucking insurance money...
we don't have that either.
GARY
It's none of your business what we want.
Gary goes back to his cooking.
Then...
GARY (cont'd)
So how come you talk like you do?
I mean, cursing
all the time.
MARGARET
It's a disease.
It's called Tourette Syndrome.
I can't
control what I say.
Turnip.
GARY
Really?
MARGARET
You've taken a handicapped person hostage.
I hope
you're proud of yourself.
GARY
I saw this thing on TV where they said people with
that don't usually curse.
MARGARET
They must have got it wrong.
GARY
I don't think so.
It was a movie of the week based on
real events.
Don't most of Tourette's people twitch
and stuff?
Margaret just glares.
GARY (cont'd)
(knowingly)
Oh, I get it.
You got a spice rack?
MARGARET
Over the sink.
And what's that supposed to mean?
GARY
Nothing.
Cumin?
MARGARET
On the left. (beat)
And I'm not... crazy, it's a physical
disease.
Sometimes I can control it, and
sometimes --
GARY
You can't?
Want to know what I think?
I think this
"syndrome" is something you
read about somewhere and figured, hey, works for
me.
MARGARET
Ass-rimming ball-sucker.
GARY
You can completely abdicate your societal
responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever
you want, and slough it off on a illness.
Maybe I
should catch this thing. "Gee, sorry Your Honor, I
have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s."
It's
called really need a Slurpee disease.
MARGARET
You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life you shit
eating fuck-weasel.
What kind of man threatens a
woman with a gun, anyway?
GARY
You are so faking it.
MARGARET
Oh, I'm faking it?
Is this how you get your kicks, you
over-compensating pussy little fart sack?
Gary, suddenly tense, puts down his spoon and picks up his gun.
GARY
Hey!
Keep your voice down or the gag goes back.
MARGARET
You don't scare me.
If something bad was going to
happen, my psychic would have told me.
Gary awkwardly chambers a round, starts gesturing with the gun, trying to look
tough.
MARGARET (cont'd)
You put that down now you little bitch, or so help me,
I'll start yelling so loud you'll have to shoot me.
Gary, confused and embarrassed, doesn't know what to do.

Paul walks in, survey's the interior of the mobile home.
PAUL'S POV:
A 7 year old time capsule of a party that was never cleaned up;
beer bottles, ashtrays and general garbage.
PAUL
(to himself)
Would it have killed you to clean up before you left,
Raymond?
Paul picks up a small box from the floor, looks at the label.
Edible Panties.
He
puts them on top of a stack of porno mags, neatens the pile, then heads out.
HIGH ANGLE ON: Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position
we've seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret.
An electric heater glows
beside him.
91
92
There's a KNOCK on the door.
Paul heads to the door.
PAUL
Who is it?
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
State Police.
Is there a Mr. Barnell here?
PAUL
(as he unlocks it)
Yes, is there something wrong--
As he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open.
The force of the
blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall
where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head.
RAYMOND BARNELL (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws
him through the serving kitchen serving hatch.
Raymond leans through the
hole.
RAYMOND
Hello brother.
He walks around, takes a copy of "USA Today" and throws it at Paul.
PAUL
Raymond?
Is that...
RAYMOND
Page 16, Paul. That's why I love "USA Today", news
from every fuckin' state.
Don't you want to read it?
I
was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.
But ya know,
despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper.
Paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond
right on his heels.
PAUL
Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.
We
all thought you were...
RAYMOND
Dead?
Yeah, I got that impression.
PAUL
But you had dropped off the face of the earth.
RAYMOND
And you just decide to make it permanent?
PAUL
But there were no records of you anywhere.
I
checked.
With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs.
Paul doubles over,
gasping for breath.
RAYMOND
In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using
your actual ID can be a hinderance.
But despite the
reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth
certificate to fall back on.
Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was
pretty pissed.
Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging
him to stop.
Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a
sitting position.
RAYMOND (cont'd)
But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot.
He woulda
told 'em it's not me.
Unless...
Paul can only sit there and WHEEZE.
Raymond sits beside him on the floor,
pulls out a cigarette and lights it.
RAYMOND (cont'd)
So what is it?
Frame job, lawsuit...
PAUL
Life insurance.
RAYMOND
Figured.
So where's my money?
PAUL
Your money?
(a beat)
They're still... investigating.
RAYMOND
What you get?
Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember.
PAUL
Fifty thousand.
RAYMOND
(with a shrug)
Almost worth coming back for.
What's the split?
I
get half?
PAUL
(not quite trusting him)
Okay.
Sure.
(changing the subject)
You look good.
Lost some weight?
RAYMOND
Gave up carbs.
So what are you doing out here?
She not go along with it?
PAUL
Who?
Margaret?
RAYMOND
How she hold up, anyway?
PAUL
She's fine.
Actually, we're not doing so good right
now.
RAYMOND
Any kids?
(off his look)
Still can't get one by the goalie, huh.
93

Gary and Margaret sit in silence, Gary taking Margaret's pulse.
Jimbo walks in,
grocery bag in hand.
JIMBO
Hey.
GARY
(snarky)
Hey.
JIMBO
Talked to our friend.
We're okay for now.
How's
everything here?
GARY
Oh, just great.
(to Margaret)
Seventy six, perfectly normal.
What a shock.
Gary jumps up and storms into the bathroom just off the kitchen.
MARGARET
He's a little over tired.
JIMBO
It's been a rough week.
MARGARET
(for Gary's benefit)
Really?
Why?
You and your life partner in the shitter
having trouble picking a China pattern?
JIMBO
(shocked)
Um, um... Gary?
GARY (O.S.)
Your turn to deal with it.
If I come out of this
bathroom I'll put a bullet in her head, swear to God.
MARGARET
I have a psychiatric disorder.
(to Gary, in the bathroom)
And so do you!

Raymond pours whiskey into a 7-11 specialty cup as Paul
pulls off his coat.
RAYMOND
He give you the check?
PAUL
No.
He thinks I...
It'll be fine.
RAYMOND
Maybe I'll pay him a little visit.
See if we can speed
up the process.
PAUL
You don't have to... I figured out a way to take care of
things.
RAYMOND
Yeah, I was watching from the window.
Paul, agitated, pulls the blinds shut.
PAUL
You can't do that, Raymond.
If someone sees you...
RAYMOND
Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie.
PAUL
About what?
Raymond walks over to Paul.
Paul tenses, expecting to be hit.
Raymond
moves right by to refill his drink.
RAYMOND
After we get her back from these guys who grabbed
her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth
shut?
PAUL
I don't think I...
RAYMOND
Crazy people talk a lot.
And I think if you tell your
therapist something, they can use it in court.
PAUL
She's not...
she doesn't have a therapist.
RAYMOND
(taking a slug)
Still, might wanna think about it.
PAUL
Think about what?
RAYMOND
You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie.
Fraud.
Consorting with felons.
Got to "cowboy up."
PAUL
Cowboy up?
RAYMOND
Get tough, ya suck-hole.
I'm just saying sometimes
a man has to make problematic decisions.
Cull the
heard, so to speak.
(off his look)
Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here.
Don't be
such a fuckin' stick.
Raymond, an enigma, looks at Paul, then grins -- just kidding.
Paul relaxes.
Raymond tenses -- not really.
Paul's not sure how to read his brother as they
shoot looks at one another -- sibling rivalry ad absurdum.

Ted walks in, throwing his coat over the wall of his cubicle and is about to sit
down when he notices Paul in his boss' office.
Ted moves closer.
PAUL (MUFFLED)
I haven't called the police yet, but I'll tell you it was
certainly tempting.
Ted opens the door to his boss' office.
Paul doesn't notice.
PAUL (cont'd)
I've had some dealings with, diseases of the mind,
and I can tell you he is not well.
Branch, obviously worried, stands.
BRANCH
Watters.
Glad you're... Mr. Barnell was just telling
me about the... meeting you two had.
TED
I caught that, yes.
BRANCH
As you can see... well, Mr. Barnell has some...
concerns.
Paul turns to look at Ted.
He has a large band-aid on his forehead, scratches
and bruises on his face.
It takes a second for the dime to drop.
TED
You don't think I did this?
Paul gets up and moves to the other side of the office.
TED (cont'd)
Oh come on.
I never laid a hand on him.
BRANCH
Ted, his neighbor says... otherwise.
TED
Now just hang on here.
Let me show you
something...
Ted digs into his briefcase.
He takes out a video tape, the police file on
Raymond and the photo of Raymond Paul dropped in the snow.
98/99
Paul and Branch listen intently as Ted paces, the TV/VCR plays shots of the
dead body in the background.
TED
See?
Where's the birthmark?
Your brother's police
report listed it...
(reading from the report)
"...large purple birthmark, upper left thigh..."
(leaning into the screen)
But I don't see it.
Not on this body.
You can see it in
the picture.
See?
Ted points to the photo;
Raymond, in the summer, wearing shorts with a
blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg.
TED (cont'd)
So what, Mr. Barnell?
Did it just disappear?
Did it
just... get better.
Ted grins.
His moment.
Finally.
Seconds feel like minutes.
PAUL
It... did get better.
TED
Did it now.
Well how in the world did that happen?
PAUL
Raymond was always... bothered by it. When he
came back from... Florida, he'd
had it fixed.
Laser surgery... like removing a tattoo.
Paul looks at Branch.
It's an excuse Ted hadn't thought of before.
TED
He did not.
PAUL
You taped my brother's body, in the morgue?
Paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk.
PAUL (cont'd)
And this?
You stole pictures of my family?
And
taped his naked body?
What kind of sick company
are you running here?
TED
Oh for... he's lying.
It's obvious he...
Paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner.
TED (cont'd)
This is crazy.
All we have to do is dig up the body...
check the leg for scars...
(bingo)
Dental records!
Paul goes white.
He hadn't thought about this.
BRANCH
That will be just about enough of that. Mr. Barnell, I'm
sorry it's all come to this.
We'll have a check brought
over to you tomorrow morning.
Paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out.
After a
moment...
TED
Sir, with all due respect, he's --
BRANCH
Jesus, we're lucky he's not suing.
Now tomorrow,
you deliver the check to Mr. Barnell with a complete
apology.
TED
Fine, I understand how this looks --
BRANCH
It looks like you beat the hell out of one of our policy
holders.
Now send Cam in here.
TED
Why?
BRANCH
Well, while you were off on your little Easter Egg
hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse
robbery.
Head office is bumping him a level.
TED
(fuck me naked)
I'll go get him.
BRANCH
They're very keen on him.
They want me to feel him
out on a transfer --
Ted has left the office, SLAMMING the door behind him.

The door CLANGS shut behind Paul as he dials his cell phone.
PAUL
Hello... yes, I'm wondering what city department
would be in charge of... sure, I can hold.
(to himself)
Hang on Mag Pie, just hang on.
Paul puts a hand to his chest.
Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts
to RETCH.
Tears well up in his eyes.
After a few moments, the storm passes.
Still on his knees, the person on the line comes back.
PAUL (cont'd)
Yeah, hi.
I was wondering if you could.... but I was...
sure.
He sits there, on hold again, waiting...

Ted walks to his car.
As he opens the door -- WHAM!
A fist to his face drops
Ted.
Raymond in a ski mask, picks him up, opens the car door and lays Ted's
head on the door jamb.
RAYMOND
Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of
this.
You get me?
Raymond leans onto the door, Ted SCREAMING as his head is squashed in
the vice.
RAYMOND (cont'd)
So let's just settle this right now, OK?
We want
what's coming to us.
Ted tries to say "yes."
Raymond releases his grip on the door, leans down and
grabs Ted's wallet and walks off.

PAUL (cont'd)
Richard!
What in the blazes are you doing?
RAYMOND
Hey Paul.
Took care of our little problem today.
We

PAUL
Could... I have a word with you?

Paul pulls the sliding door closed behind Raymond.
PAUL

Are those...?
RAYMOND
(serious)
Prostitutes?
(laughing)
I sure as hell hope so, cause Jehovah's Witnesses
won't lick your lolly no matter how much you pay
them.
PAUL
How did you get them here?
Raymond pulls out the credit card Paul got for him.
RAYMOND
Put it on my plastic.
See, got my name on it and
everything.
It's every where I want to be.
PAUL
You can't use that.
You're supposed to be dead!
They'll track us down.
RAYMOND
You think they give a shit who pays the bill?
Think for
a minute, will ya?
Paul turns, trying to compose himself, when he notices
a handgun sitting out
on the counter.
PAUL
What... Raymond, what is... this?
Paul pokes at the gun, sending the barrel spinning around to face him.
Raymond grabs it and stuffs it into his pants.
RAYMOND
That's "muh gun," Paul.
Paul's cell phone RINGS.
RAYMOND (cont'd)
Don't be long.
The little spinner's yours.
Paul picks up the phone as the party revs back up.

Yes, hello.

Jimbo is on the wall mounted phone.
JIMBO
You having a party, Mr. Barnell?
(embarrassed for Margaret)
That's... that's not right.
Margaret, now gagged, sits where we last saw her.
She tries to talk through
the gag.
Gary's staring at his watch, calling out seconds.
GARY
Thirty, sorry, startinnng... Now!
Paul pulls the kitchen door closed with his free hand.
PAUL
There's no party...let me talk to my wife.
JIMBO
Hang on.
He hands the phone to Margaret.
Gary leaps up and stops him.
GARY
Twenty-five!
Jimbo pushes past him, pulls down Margaret's gag and holds the phone to
her.
PAUL
Why are you counting?
MARGARET
Paul?
Are you entertaining?
PAUL
(a wave of relief)
Oh God, oh Jesus... Margaret, are you okay?
RAYMOND (O.S.)
Paul, we got any more chips?
GARY

The body. Have you -- (beat) No, I'm the other guy.
Have you got the body?
MARGARET

Paul, the carrot little weasly one wants to carrot

And he's

Carrotcarrocarrot...
Jimbo, annoyed, puts the gag back in Margaret's mouth.
PAUL
You sick... Don't you hurt her!!

Yes or no.

PAUL
Yes! It'll... it'll happen tomorrow.

Gary lunges for the phone cradle like it's the finish line in the 100 meter dash,

He keeps his

Avis stands to greet him.
AVIS
Hello.
Can I help you?
PAUL (O.S.)

Mr. Watters?
Paul comes around the corner.
He extends his hand, shocked to see the
bruises on Ted's face but knowing exactly where they came from.
TED
Mr. Barnell.
I have your check.
PAUL
Thank you, I appreciate that.
(an awkward pause)
Please, sit.
Ted sits at Paul desk, reaches into his brief case and pulls out an envelope
and several forms.
PAUL (cont'd)
Have a little accident, there?
TED
I was mugged.
The cops say it was just a random
act of violence.
But who knows, right?
(re: documents)
You'll have to sign.
Ted slides the papers across to Paul, then gets up and moves around over
Paul's shoulder.
TED (cont'd)
Where I've marked it with an X.
And... I'd also like to
apologize for my --
PAUL
No, please.
You don't have to...
Paul, at a loss, starts to read the paperwork. He pulls open his desk drawer to
grab a pen.
Ted looks down, sees the Sea Shell in the drawer.
TED
That's quite the shell.
PAUL
(picking it up)
It was a gift from Raymond.
He bought it for me from
Florida.
It's all we have to remember him by.
Paul puts the shell down on the desk.
TED
That and a million dollars.
Things really worked out
for you, didn't they? lots of cash, newly single guy...
PAUL
I'm not single.
TED
...so you gonna head down to Club Med?
See how
much fun a big bank roll can buy?
PAUL
Mr. Watters, I love my wife.
Very much.
Ted can't help but look confused by this simple, yet sincere declaration.
TED
Can we level with each other for a moment?
(Paul nods)
Did you --
Before he can finish his question, a DELIVERY DRIVER entering the office with
a large box.
PAUL
Avis!
Avis?
There's no answer.
She's in the back.
PAUL (cont'd)
Will you excuse me?
Paul gets up to deal with the delivery.
Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns
it over in his hands.
Avis enter from the back.
She smiles at Ted, then sees
the shell.
AVIS
Oh, that's where you went.
She takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for Aloha Air.
Ted,
confused, walks over as Avis snaps the shell back into place.
TED
That's quite the display.
AVIS
They do some very nice in store promotions.
Paul walks back, shocked to see the shell now back on the display.
Ted just
stares at him.
AVIS (cont'd)
Here it is Mr. Barnell.
(to Ted)
I thought someone might have walked out with it.
It's
not the best neighborhood.
Avis walks back to her desk.
Ted and Paul hold their look.
Finally, Paul walks
back to his desk and the paperwork.
PAUL
So, right here, by the X.
Ted nods.
Paul signs.
Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul
but doesn't let go.
Paul tries to pull it free.
He looks at Ted who looks right
through him.
Just then, the lights go out.
They're all in the dark.
PAUL (cont'd)
We, uh... Avis?
Call Municipal Light and Power and
let them know I'll... stop by in a bit.

An overwrought Paul is on the phone with Tiffany, sitting in the dark.
He's got
his home phone bill in front of him.
PAUL
I have a situation.
My wife...
do you think it's okay to
do something kinda bad to someone if you think
they're gonna do something really bad to someone
else?
TIFFANY
Sure.
PAUL
What if it's a really bad thing?
TIFFANY
Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can
help it.
Are you really sure they're going to do this
other thing?
PAUL
I'm... I... I don't know.
He said some things.
He said
he was joking, but I... I think he might.
TIFFANY
Don't think, know.
How close are you to the other
someone else, the one you're trying to protect?
PAUL

I just, I just...
Have you ever felt like that?
Like your

TIFFANY

Listen to me, Carlos.
Your wife is an incredibly lucky
woman.
I know, relationships are tough, but you do
what you gotta do to keep it together, okay?
Remember, love is sacrifice.
Ted can't help but SNORT at the mention of this familiar phrase as he looks at
Tiffany.
Tiffany glares back at him.
PAUL
(sniffling)
I guess you're right.
TIFFANY
Now you get tough.
And remember, this call is for
entertainment purposes only.
Call me back and let

She was in the bedroom with the big

Not the first time, either.

With other men, not kidnappers.
RAYMOND
For real?
PAUL
Her therapist.
And some guy she... hardly knew.
RAYMOND
Wow.
Sucks to be you.

Shut up.
Raymond, a momentary flash of anger, sits on the bed beside his brother.
Paul does his best not to flinch.

I always knew she was a fucking tease.
PAUL
Yeah.
Guess you were right.
RAYMOND
Well, you want my opinion...

I don't trust her, Paul.
Never did.
PAUL
You think she'd... really mess things up?

Only one way to make sure she doesn't.
PAUL
Not sure what you're saying?

Crazy little

No one comes in here, unless they're

ARNITH
I appreciate that, Sir.
But I'm on a union specified

Okay, "Puddles."

Huh, "Puddles?"

Raymond is passed out on the sofa.
Paul sits, gun in hand, the barrel pointed

His finger grazes the trigger...

Paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again.
Not wanting to
be sprayed by Raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head...
Another idea
comes to him.
Paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the
blow back.
He gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at Raymond.
Maybe it's the light... maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he
looks almost angelic.
Paul stares at his brother.
In the kitchen, Paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into

As they continue to squabble, the phone line connects.
911 RECORDING
You have reached 9-11.
All our operators are busy,
but your call will be handled in the order in which it
was received.
If this is a --
Margaret, using her nose, hangs up.

Paul, quiet as a mouse and dressed in his money-lined parka, picks up his
cell and his car keys, drops them quietly into his pocket.
Just as he finishes...
RAYMOND
(half asleep)
What's going on.
PAUL
We're out of coffee.
But I'll be right back.
Still early.
Not to worry.
Raymond has already rolled over.
133
133
Margaret has just dialed another number.
It RINGS on the other end... And
RINGS... And connects.
MARGARET
Paul?
AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.)
The number you have dialed is no longer in service.
If you think you have --
Margaret disconnects the call, then dials again.
134
134
A woozy Ted is trying to keep Tiffany's phone from RINGING.
Finally, he puts on the headset and hits a computer key.
It connects.
TED
Yeah?
Hello?
(coughs)
Hello?
He hits a few keys on the computer keyboard.
The screen pops to life.
The line
connects.
MARGARET
Oh thank fucking Christ.
Is Tiffany there?
TED
No, she's...
He pulls off a yellow Post It note stuck to the computer.
It reads:
"Coffee made.
Don't touch my computer.
Back in 10."
Unseen on the computer screen beside him, the name "Margaret Barnell"
pops up, along with all her pertinent information like pet's name, husband,
delusions...
TED (cont'd)
She'll be back in a few minutes.
You want to try
later?
MARGARET
Well you should know, fuck-wit.
You know there's a
man with a gun in my shower, right now?
Ted, distracted, turns as he hears the doorknob turning.
TED
Hang on, she's on her way --
Finally he notices the computer screen.
Holy shit.
TED (cont'd)
(tentatively)
Mrs. Barnell?
But before she can answer, Tiffany walks in carrying a laundry basket, pulls the
headset off Ted's head and holds it up to her ear.
TIFFANY
I'm here, Margaret.
How you feeling today?
TED
Give me the headset.
Ted grabs for the headset, Tiffany resists.
TIFFANY
(to Ted)
What is wrong with you?
135
135
Margaret sits in the same position on the bed by the phone.
Gary, in the
shower, belts out some SHOW TUNE.
MARGARET
Christ, where do you want to start?
136
136
Tiffany shoves Ted, who loses his balance and stumbles backward.
She puts
on the headset.
TIFFANY
Sorry about that.
Mrs. Barnell?
Could you speak up
a bit?
Ted is at her side, trying to listen in by pressing his ear to the outside of the
headset.
TED
What's she saying?
TIFFANY
Something about the gay mafia taking her to a park
to kill her.
Can you hand me my Help Line list?
TED
What... Wha...
Ted's throat seizes up again.
He stumbles to the kitchen, gulping water from
the faucet. Tiffany watches with some amusement.
TIFFANY
Margaret, are you sure these are real people in your
house?
TED
Find out where she...
His voice locks up again.
More water.
TIFFANY
(listening to a profane ramble)
Well then it's a good thing you called.
Nope, not
seeing any problems, but hang on, let me really
concentrate.
TED
Ask her...
Ted's not doing much better.
137
137
Margaret hears the shower stop running.
MARGARET
Shit on toast.
She hangs up, places the gag back in her mouth and hustles back into place.
138
TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
138
Ted, pulls on his boots and his jacket.
In his hand, an address scribbled down
on a piece of note paper.
Tiffany watches, not happy.
TED
You're sure this is it?
TIFFANY
She specifically mentioned the cock-sucking turnout
up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out.
TED
I'll call later.
TIFFANY
I won't be here.
TED
Excuse me?
The phone RINGS.
Tiffany lets it.
TIFFANY
I know relationships aren't all sunshine and roses,
but I'm really not having fun anymore, and I don't
think you are either.
TED
God, now's so not the time, Tiff.
TIFFANY
Maybe you have to be like this right now, and I'm just
not in a good space to deal with it.
But...
TED
But what?
TIFFANY
Maybe we shouldn't be like this together.
Tiffany gives him that look every man who's ever crossed the line for the last
time is all too familiar with.
Ted stares.
Words fail him.
Finally, his only recourse is to hurry out the door
which shuts with a BANG.
Tiffany lets the phone continue to RING as she
stares at the door.
Sadly, she hits the computer key that picks it up.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
Psychic Buddies.
How are you Mr. Bennett?
I think
she'd be fine with you remarrying, but hang on, let
me concentrate.
Ted opens the door, steps back inside.
TED
OK.
Come on.
TIFFANY
(to Ted)
Really?
TED
I've been cutting you out of my life and as a result our
normal communication channels have been
blocked.
I think you coming with me would... would...
He's reaching, but Tiffany looks cautiously hopeful.
TED (cont'd)
...further the development of our relationship and
allow us to both... realize the potential of our...
interpersonalism.
TIFFANY
If you're going to be sarcastic.
TED
I'm not being anything.
Swear to God.
TIFFANY
Okay.
Why do you want me to come?
TED
(total sincerity)
Cause if you don't, then I'll have to stay, and I'll be
mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and
as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a
million times worse.
Tiffany smiles, genuinely touched.
TIFFANY
(into the phone)
Mr. Bennett, she's totally cool with it.
but listen,
you're gonna have to call back... I gotta go help my
boyfriend.

Paul drives, smiling for the first time in a long time.
He listens to the
beautifully wrenching Iz-Kamakawiwo'Ole's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"
on the radio.
(The music continues over the next two scenes.)
141
142
Gary and Jimbo, with Margaret, hands bound, walk into the garage.
Jodie (the
dog) runs out after them.
Margaret looks at Jimbo, who takes the dog and
gently puts him back inside.
143
TED'S CAR / CITY STREETS - LATER
143
Ted and Tiffany drive in silence.
Then...
TIFFANY
Okay, it's called the listening game.
You talk, I listen,
and I can't interrupt.
Then we switch.
TED
Doesn't sound like much of a game, but...
I can talk
about anything?
TIFFANY
Yes.
Ted smiles, and launches in...
144
144
Gary leans into the backseat and holds a magazine in front of Margaret's face.
GARY
See the little box down there?
Lists all the
symptoms of that Tourette's thing, and you don't
have half of them.
MARGARET
And?
GARY
And?
And you're faking it.
MARGARET
Magazines don't prove anything.
JIMBO
Gary, can we just try and get there in peace?
GARY
Magazines prove everything!!
145
JIMBO'S CAR /
HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
147
Margaret in the back, Jimbo and Gary in the front.
GARY
You can't be serious.
JIMBO
I'm still not sleeping.
GARY
Jimbo.
Come on.
JIMBO
It's a thought, okay.
With hard work, you can live okay
as a civilian.
GARY
After all this...
JIMBO
Yeah, after all this.
GARY
Don't you go soft on me, Jimbo.
Margaret LAUGHS through
her gag in the backseat.
Gary and Jimbo pretend
not to hear her.
They drive on in silence.
148
150
Tiffany and Ted drive.
Ted has just finished.
Tiffany has been paying rapt
attention.
TIFFANY
So this is kind of like a really weird "Law and Order"
episode?
TED
Sure.
I guess.
TIFFANY
And if Paul Barnell already killed his brother...
TED
Maybe his wife is next.
TIFFANY
Cool.
My turn?
(Ted nods)
Now a healthy relationship is...
TED
Hey, here we are.
Ted takes the turnoff to the parking area.
151
- MOMENTS LATER
151
A young, bored female CLERK (18) is behind the counter as the door CHIMES
go off.
She looks up to see Raymond walking in, gun in hand.
Raymond lays it
on the counter.
GIRL
Calibre?
152
153
Ted looks at Paul's car, too far away to see much.
He's about to get out when
Tiffany stops him.
TIFFANY
(gently)
So, do you have a plan here?
TED
I'm gonna go talk to him.
You mind staying here?
TIFFANY
I guess.
So when do we call the cops?
TED
Soon as I... if he actually is doing... something.
I'll
wave, alright?
Tiffany gives him a quick kiss.
TIFFANY
That's a very good plan.
Ted's about to jump out of the car, but has to pull back his door as another
vehicle slides in beside them, the driver locking his brakes and sliding into the
snow embankment.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
Tourists.
Ted, a confused look on his face, looks over as Raymond gets out of his
vehicle.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
What?
TED
That was...
TIFFANY
Who?
Ted, too excited, fumbles with his seat belt as he tries to jump out of the car.
154
CORPSE'S POV: FROM PAUL'S OPEN TRUNK
154
Black.
The lid opens.
Jimbo, Gary and Paul look in at the frozen body.
Jimbo
recoils at the mangled mess before him.
Gary reaches down and touches the
well-chewed body.
GARY
How do we know it's him?
PAUL
Come on!
Where would I get another one?
Good point.
Paul hands him the ransom money.
155

156
157
Tiffany is busy fiddling with the radio, missing the fight just outside her window
as she tunes in the Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice."
158
159
Tiffany finally looks over at Ted, who's just getting to his feet.
She bursts out
of the car...
160
163
The car is still in the parking area.
Paul and a bloody, beaten Ted sit up front
with Margaret and Tiffany in the back.
No one speaks, until...
TIFFANY
They call this the listening game.
Mr. Barnell, you
get to go first.
Ted glares at Tiffany, but her look instantly softens him.
Ted looks at Margaret,
who looks expectantly at Paul.
Ted shrugs.
TED
Knock yourself out.
Paul starts to talk, and Ted starts to listen...
164
A168
Paul, sitting alone, reads a postcard from Margaret.
MARGARET (V.O.)
Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you so much!
Wish you could have come.
Saw some dolphins
today.
Frisky little buggers.
They were even playing
our song in the bar.
Have been pondering about
your question, and I think my answer is "yes."
After
all, it's no fun in the sun without...
MARGARET (O.S.) (cont'd)
Paul, you ready?
Paul looks up to see Margaret.
Dressed in a coat, she is standing in the
middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor
lamp.
Paul flips Margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded Hawaiian Hilton
postcard from the box in his den.
Paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his
arm.
Margaret picks up Jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over.
A CAR HORN sounds from outside.
It's their cab.
As they walk to the door...
PAUL
How you feeling?
MARGARET
Pretty damn good.
PAUL
I can tell.
MARGARET
Can you?
Paul takes her hand and gives it a squeeze.
They head out.
169
171
As they pull down the driveway.
DAVE
Why don't we go there after?
(off her look)
Fine.
We'll do it now.
DAVE'S WIFE
Watch the curb.
Dave keeps backing up.
As he takes the corner and bumps over the curb, the
momentum sends the half-eaten body (that Gary and Jimbo stuffed into the
backseat) to an upright position.
They drive on, oblivious.
DAVE
Looks like weather.
FADE TO WHITE.
