      TEASER/ACT ONE


      INT. PRISON - DAY

      CHYRON:  FishkillCorrectional Facility -- Beacon, N.Y.

      Cons play cards, lift weights, buy drugs.  Everyone s just 
      riding out their time.  Everyone except...


      INT. PRISON CELL - SAME TIME

    ... AUGUST TILLMAN (28).  We re TIGHT ON this bad-ass con s 
      face as it grimaces, sweats, becomes a shade of CRIMSON.

      REVEAL: from the bottom bunk he grips the bars of the bed 
      frame above -- holding himself parallel like a gymnast.  
      After he can t hold on any longer, he drops to his mattress.  

    He checks his watch, then removes a pencil stub and piece of 
      paper from under his bunk.  We get a good look at the STAR 
      TATTOO on his neck.  He unfolds the paper to reveal a list of 
        increasingly-longer times.  This one... 3 mins.45 sec.


      INT. PRISON INDUSTRIES - DAY

      Tatted-up cons work for 12 cents an hour.  Tillman punches 
      license plates.  On the QT, he uses a sheet cutter to slice 
    off the corner of a plate.  He approaches a GUARD, shows the 
       defective  plate.  Guard eyeballs it for a sec, then nods to 
    a Recycle Bin behind him.  Tillman approaches it, but doesn t 
      toss the plate away; he slides it into a small, imperceptible 
      slit in the drywall.   A stash spot.    


      EXT. PRISON REFUSE COLLECTION - DAY

      CHYRON: One Month Later

      Tillman exits the Prison Industries building to empty a scrap- 
      metal bin in a dumpster.  As soon as he s outside, he looks 
      over at a FOOD SERVICE TRUCK across the area.  

      ANGLE ON: Two food service EMPLOYEES bullshittingwith the 
      three GUARDS on duty.  This is it.  Tillman reaches inside 
    the bin and removes a thick stack of 30 license plates.  

    He hustles to the service truck.  Once there, he unfolds the 
      licenses.  They ve been hinged together and painted dark grey.                                                                                      2.


      Shoulder/ankle straps enable him to slip on this crudely-
      fashioned half-suit of armor.  He hits the ground and slides 
      under the truck.  TIME CUT TO:


      EXT. PRISON FRONT GATE - DAY

    The food service truck slows at the gate.  A GUARD uses an 
      extended mirror to inspect the truck s undercarriage.  

      ANGLE ON Tillman, holding himself parallel under the truck, 
      just like he practiced.  But the Guard sees nothing but metal.  
    He waves the truck on.  The driver beeps goodbye, drives off.


      EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY - 4 MINUTES, 12 SECONDS LATER.

    The truck stops at a light.  The MALE DRIVER whistles 
      pleasantly.  His FEMALE COWORKER rides shotgun.  They hear a 
      loud CLANG outside, look at each other curiously.  

                                  MALE DRIVER
                    What the hell was that?

    He reaches for the door handle to check it out just as the 
      grease-covered Tillman busts through the window.  As the 
      female employee SCREAMS we MATCH CUT TO:


      INT. U.S. MARSHAL SITUATION ROOM - DAY

      Tillman s MUGSHOTis front and center on a wall-sized screen.  
      REVEAL 10 frustrated U.S. MARSHALS of varying rank staring at 
    the image.  DIRECTOR KNOX, 50, addresses the room.

                                  KNOX
                    Nothingon this bottomfeeder? 

      Deputy Director CRAIG BOLANDER, 40, steps forward.

                                  BOLANDER
                    We ve got every local law 
                      enforcement agency on alert --

                                  KNOX
                          (pissedoff)
                    -- He s broken through the initial 
                    perimeter, Craig.  He s down the 
                    road by now. 
                            (toeveryone)
                    Room full of U.S. Marshals who 
                    can t find their asses with both 
                    hands and a flashlight --
                          (points to Tillman photo)
                    This guy is Omahaall over again.

                                  CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    I can get him.                                                                                    3.


    ALL HEADS TURN TO CHARLIE DuCHAMP, 32, Black/Latino.  As 
      evidenced by his spit-shined shoes and perfect knot in his 
    tie -- he s an ex military man -- no nonsense.  

                                  BOLANDER
                    Not now, DuChamp.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Then when?  After he kills somebody?  
                    In Omaha, that fugitive took out 
                    five coeds because we were chasing 
                    leads instead of takingthe lead.  
                          (turnsto Knox)
                    I ve got a plan - but someone in 
                    this department s gonnaneed to have 
                    the nuts to approve it, or we can 
                    just sit around all day waiting for 
                    housewives to call in 1-800 tips.

    As a seething Bolander grabs Charlie s elbow, tries to move 
    him to the door...

                                  BOLANDER
                    Let s talk in the hall, Charlie.

                                  KNOX
                    Hold on.

      Beat, Knox looks at Charlie - as does the whole room.

                                  KNOX (CONT D)
                    Let s hear it.

    AS WE PUSH IN on Charlie, we know that his plan better be a 
      damn good one.  HARD CUT INTO:


      INT. PRISON - LAUNDRY SERVICES - DAY

      CHYRON:  Sing SingCorrectional Facility - Ossining, N.Y.

    We move past the cacophony of the laundry facility to the 
      back area -- where SEAN  SHEA  DANIELS, 28, Black, has his 
      feet up on the desk, mid-sales pitch to a YOUNGER CONVICT.

                                  SHEA
                    -- see, all the short cuts and ins 
                    and outs I ve perfected to make 
                    working here the most desired slot -
                    - those tidbits are what they call 
                        intellectualproperty.  So if you 
                    job-up here, I need compensation.

                                  YOUNGER CON
                    But three dollars a week is more 
                    than half what I make.

                                  SHEA
                    Okay, now it s three fifty.

    A GUARD approaches.  Shea doesn t take his feet off the desk.                                                                                    4.


                                  SING SINGGUARD
                    Shea.  

                                  SHEA
                    I m conducting business.  

                                  SING SINGGUARD
                    You re being transferred.

    Off Shea.  That got his attention.


      EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

      CHYRON:  Rahway State Prison - Avenel, N.J.

      Four TOUGH CONS play cards while a SLIGHTLY-BUILT CON acts as 
    a cabana boy.  Emptying their ashtrays and filling their 
      drinks.  One con taps his ash onto the slight con s forearm.

                                  TOUGH CON #1
                    Raise you two.

    The slight con shakes his head.  Bad bet.  A GUARD approaches.

                                  RAHWAY GUARD
                    Lowery.

      ANGLE ON the SLIGHT CONVICT: LLOYD LOWERY, 38, White, former 
      child prodigy.

                                  RAHWAY GUARD (CONT D)
                    Pack it up.  You re shipping out.

                                  LLOYD
                    Out of here?

    The guard nods.  A beat, then Lloyd DUMPS the bucket of sand 
    and cigarette butts in the middle of the poker table.

                                  LLOYD (CONT D)
                    Ciao, bitches.

    The TOUGH CONS jump up, pissed.As Lloyd is escorted off by 
    the Guard, we PRE-LAP a rough but enthusiastic rock band--

                                  CHRISTIAN PRISON BAND (O.S.)
                    This train don t carry no gamblers...


      INT. PRISON - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

      CHYRON:  Coxsackie Correctional Facility - W. Coxsackie, N.Y.

      Five CONVICTS bash away at their instruments.  KERRY 
      GUNDERSON, 35, white, shifty, plays bass and  sings. 

                                  GUNDERSON
                    ..liars, thieves nor big shot 
                    ramblers, this train is bound for...                                                                                    5.


    A DOOR OPENS O.S. andthe band immediately LURCHES to a stop.

                                  COXSACKIE GUARD
                    Gunderson.

    The Guard beckons with his finger.  Off Gunderson, perplexed.


      INT. PRISON - CELL - DAY

      CHYRON:  MuncyCorrectional Institution - Muncy, PA.

        PHILOMENA PHILLY  ROTCHLIFFER, 30, White, a Siren if there 
      ever was one -- is packing up her belongings.  A MALE GUARD, 
      slightly panicked, enters the open gate.

                                  MUNCYGUARD
                    I just heard.  Where are they 
                    sending you?

                                  PHILLY
                    I don t know.

                                  MUNCYGUARD
                    But... when will we see each other?

                                  PHILLY
                    Every night when we close our eyes.

    As she finishes packing...

                                  MUNCYGUARD
                    You forgot the perfume.  The one I 
                    risked my jobsneaking in for you.

    She stares at the perfume near the toilet.

                                  PHILLY
                    Right.  I wanted you to keep that.

    She turns to move out.

                                  MUNCYGUARD
                    Philly, if this is it, can I please 
                    -- finally -- kiss you?

    He leans in -- as Philly deftly slips to the side.  

                                  PHILLY
                    It would just make it harder, Eric.

    She heads out.  The Guard is left empty-handed -- once again.


      INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

      CHYRON:  New York, N.Y.

      Shea, Lloyd, Gunderson and Philly stand, cuffed in 4-pieces, 
      still in prison blues.                                                                                      6.


      Four vans -- with waiting drivers -- in the background.  
      Charlie stands in front with GRAHAM WESTON, 36, White -- a 
      cop s cop, and Charlie s partner.

                                  CHARLIE
                    This is your lucky day, turds.  Since 
                    you four were the toughest runners 
                    Graham and I ever caught -- that 
                    qualifies you for this offer --

                                  GRAHAM
                    -- which you don t deserve.

                                  CHARLIE
                    But necessity being the mother of 
                    all evil --

                                  GRAHAM
                    -- Invention --

                                  CHARLIE
                    -- Whatever.  We ve decided to use 
                    fugitives to help us catch 
                    fugitives.  Dirty, no-good, nothing-
                    to-lose, broke-out-of-prison 
                    fugitives.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Just like you douchebagswere.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Deal s simple.  You ll be 
                      transferred to MaybelleMinimum 
                    Security Prison.  Twenty minutes 
                    north of the city.  Each fugitive 
                    you help apprehend gets you a month 
                    off your sentence.  One of you tries 
                    to run -- you allget sent back - 
                    your sentence doubled.  Any takers? 

    A beat as the cons take all this in.  Then:

                                  GUNDERSON
                    This seems risky.  Like, my-neck s 
                      on-the-line-type risky.
                          (beat)
                    Two months or no go.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Take care, Gunderson.

      Before Gunderson knows what s going on, Graham grabs him and 
      starts moving him into an open van door.  Gunderson pleads -- 

                                  GUNDERSON
                    C monguys, you know me --

                                  GRAHAM
                    -- Not anymore.

      Graham SLAMS the van door closed.  ANGLE ON Charlie.                                                                                    7.


                                  CHARLIE
                    This offer expires in 5 seconds.  
                    Now who s in?

      Philly, Shea and Lloyd raise their right hands-- as far as 
    the four-piece irons will allow.  SMASH TO:


      INT. TASK FORCE OFFICE - BULLPEN - MORNING

      Tillman s MUGSHOTis up on The Board in this old warehouse in 
      NYC s Meat Packing District.  Scores of unpacked boxes denote 
      that they re still moving in.  The whole gang has files on 
      Tillman - the cons, now uncuffed, peruse the documents.  

                                  CHARLIE
                    August Tillman.  Six months into a

                    bitch, or Tillman swife a bitch?

                                  GRAHAM
                    Yeah, Tillman went around the 
                    country killing guys who insulted 
                    their ownwives.  
                          (beat)
                    It was Tillman s wife you idiot.  
                    Y know, I d forgotten what a pain 
                    in the ass you are.

                                  LLOYD

                    Yesterday Tillman hid under a food

                    commit bodily harm -- not to

      They turn to see JULIANNE SIMMS (28, White, pretty); she s 
    the  funnel  of the group - allinformation, tips and data go 
      through her.  She s hesitant, anxious to have everyone s eyes 
    on her.  Philly looks at Julianne, dressed in normal clothes.

                                  PHILLY
                    Like her.  How comes she s got new

                    they re acting like they re still 
                    back in the yard.

      Charlie gives Graham a  relax  gesture; turns to Julianne...

                                  CHARLIE
                    What do you have, Julianne?                                                                                    9.

    Off Charlie and Graham sharing a look.  


      EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

      Squad and unmarked cars parked in front -- police tape holds 
      back the neighbors.  A rentalSUVpulls up.  Our team hops 
    out -- Shea, Lloyd and Philly now dressed in ND clothes.

      CHYRON:  Baltimore, Maryland


      INT. PHELPS  HOUSE - DAY

      Charlie leads the pack. DET. BENZYK, 35, spots Charlie 
      approaching and meets him -- palm first -- at the entry way.  

                                  DET. BENZYK

                    You gotta wait a half hour.

    A beat, then Benzyk points at Shea, Lloyd and Philly. 

                                  DET. BENZYK
                    Alright... but don t tell me 
                      they reU.S. Marshals.

      Charlie considers the cons a 1/2 beat, then...

      INT. PHELPS  HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      It s been ransacked.  Our Team looks at the blood-smeared 
      linoleum where Phelps expired as Benzyk refers to his notes.

                                  DET. BENZYK
                    Neighbor lady heard some yelling.  
                    In particular of note was the name 
                     Shirley.   She also noticed a 
                    black pick-up truck parked in front

                    But we ll get the perp crossing 
                    into Mexico.  A description of the 
                    truck, along with a partial plate 
                    number are out to the U.S./Mexican 
                    Border agents.

                                  CHARLIE
                    What makes you think he s headed 
                    there?

                                  DET. BENZYK
                    The dead guy told us.

      Benzyk reaches out, slams a cabinet door shut.  There, 
      scrawled on the door in Phelps  own blood, is P.Vallarta.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Why not write the assailant s name?

                    Goin out on a limb here, but maybe 
                    he didn t know it.

                                  GRAHAM
                    He did.  They went to school together.

                                  DET. BENZYK
                    Who cares why he wrote it?  We got the

      (with extended battery attached) duct-taped under an end 
      table.SMASH TO --


      INT. TILLMAN S TRUCK - MOVING - SAME TIME

      Tillman - having cleaned up since we saw him - has his cell 
      phone on speaker as it rests on the console.  A jamming 
      device is attached to thwart detection.

    He listens to everything they re saying, and he s not happy 
    his Mexico misdirect didn t take.

                                  DET. BENZYK (O.S.)
                    Well...  we got an alarm out on his 
                    plate number, regardless.

      Hearing this, Tillman checks the rear-view mirror for cops, 
      then pulls off onto a side road.  SMASH TO --


      EXT. SIDE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

      Tillman reaches behind the front seat, pulls out the license 
      plates he used to escape.  They serve a second purpose.  He 
      clips one free with tin snips, grabs a screwdriver, then 
      replaces his license plate with a  new  one.


      EXT.  PHELPS  HOUSE - BACK PATIO - LATER

      Graham reviews the police report at an outdoor table.  Charlie 
      paces, on hold with Julianne.  Lloyd reclines on a chaise, 
      searching Phelps  laptop.  Philly exits the house ...

                    Might be right.  Nothing on his 
                    laptop shows any kind of employment.

                    You get all that, Julianne?  

      Shea takes a small plastic sleeve of cookies from the top of 
    the box, pops one in his mouth.

                                  GRAHAM

    All four turn to Charlie, who holds his finger up for them to 
      wait for more as he listens to Julianne on the line.

                                  CHARLIE (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    I m going to put you on speaker.

      Charlie puts the phone on the table.  Silence.  Graham snaps 
    his fingers twice.

                                  GRAHAM
                    You re on, Jules.

                      ...right.Tillman used his debit 
                    card to buy gas in Shirley, New York 
                    six months before he was arrested 
                    for that bar fight.  This was a year 
                    and a half ago.  Right around the 
                    time of an unsolved bank robbery in 
                    Shirley for 100 thousand dollars.  
                    Three suspects.  Never caught.

      CLICK.  After a beat --

                                  PHILLY
                    Three suspects in the robbery.  We 
                    know two are high school buddies.  
                    We need a yearbook.  
                          (beat)
                    But you were about to say the same 
                    thing, right Graham?

    She takes one of Shea s cookies, bites it with a flourish.

      INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - DAY

    The whole team.  Post-meal.  Charlie has his briefcase open -- 
      reviewing Tillman s rap sheet.  Graham s at the next table 
      over, on the phone, staring at his laptop screen.  Lloyd 
      points up at the wall-mounted TV where a news channel is on.

                                  LLOYD
                    Another shooting at the Hip Hop 
                    awards.  Strange that there always 
                    seems to be a firearms mishap at this 
                      particularawards ceremony, Shea.

                    Keep it up white shoes, you ll see 
                    what the variable is.

    A WAITRESS drops the bill right in front of Charlie, 
      continues on.  He glances at it, looks to Philly...

                                  CHARLIE

                    If you d ever been to the Four

      Philly yanksa hair from Lloyd s head -- which earns a wince 
      from Lloyd -- and drops it in her soup.  Philly signals to 
    get the waitress s attention.

                                  PHILLY
                    That s someone else s hair.

      Waitress shoots her a skeptical look.

                    I ll take it off the bill, Ma am.

      WAITRESS walks off.  Philly looks at Charlie and winks.

      ANGLE ON Graham on the phone with Julianne.  

                                  GRAHAM
                    What s taking so long?  We re 
                    burning minutes we don t have.

                                  JULIANNE (O.S.)
                    I, uh, had them scan the yearbook 
                    and emailit to me... 

                                  GRAHAM
                    Why didn t you go get it?


      INT. TASK FORCE HQ - JULIANNE S OFFICE - SAME TIME

    As a Progress Bar fills on her computer monitor signaling the 
      download of the yearbook data, Julianne has her forehead on 
    her palm.  She doesn t answer Graham s question.

      INTERCUT THEIR CONVERSATION.

    A beat, then, Graham exhales, softening...

                                  GRAHAM
                    C mon, I recommended you for this 
                    because you re great at what you 
                    do.  Remember, you were top of your 
                    class at Glyncofor a reason.

                                  JULIANNE
                    They threw me out for a reason too.                                                                                    16.

      SMASH TO - ONE MINUTE LATER.  Charlie, Shea, Philly and Lloyd 
    all stand over Graham as they view the yearbook images.

                    Nice mullet.

                                  LLOYD
                    Nice quote: A good plan, violently 
                    executed now, is better than a 
                    perfect plan executed next week.

                                  CHARLIE
                    A coward like Tillman quoting 
                    Patton.  Makes me want to puke.

                                  LLOYD
                    He fancies himself an Alpha Male.  
                    And if there s one thing Alpha s 
                    don t like; it s when Beta s defy

                    Says here his only activity is Auto 
                    Club.

      Graham quickly scrolls through pages; comes across...

                    There, Auto Club.  Threemembers.

      been knocked around and he s terrified. 

      CHYRON:  Atlantic City, New Jersey

      Curtains are pulled.  The TV is on O.S. Jimbohas his wrists 
    and ankles tied to the arms and legs of a wooden chair. 
      Tillman enters from the garage, lugging a tool box.                                                                                    17.


                                  TILLMAN
                    I rubbed elbows with some sick 
                      individuals in there, Jimbo. Hoo! 
                    Thank God for prison, that s all I 
                    gotta say.
                          (beat)
                    Did learn a thing or two, though.

      Tillman opens the toolbox, takes out a hammer.

                                  TILLMAN (CONT D)
                    Now where is it?

                                  JIMBO
                    I don t know.  I swear to God.

                                  TILLMAN
                    You do know.  And either you fess up...

      Tillman pulls out a large nail from the tool box and places 
    the nail spike on Jimbo sforearm.  Jimbo seyes go wide.  

                                  TILLMAN (CONT D)

                    Auggie, this is me.  I m your friend.

    A maniacal grimace as Tillman raises the hammer.  As he brings 
    it down to the nail and JimboSCREAMS and we SMASH TO --

      Charlie, Graham and Shea exit the SUV.  Philly and Lloyd are 
      still in the car.

                    it past the first slot machine.


      EXT. JIMBO S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Graham rings the door bell and knocks.  Charlie and Shea are 
      trying to get a peek inside, but no dice, shades are pulled.  

      ANGLE: a neighborhood kid watches from the sidewalk.  After a 
      beat, he bolts away on his skateboard.

                                  SHEA
                    The TV s on.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Really?  You re sure he s not just 
                    friends with Pat Sajak?

                                  SHEA
                    Didn t think it was possible, but in 
                    the three years since you busted me 
                    you ve become an even biggerprick.  

      Charlie hands Shea a lock pick.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Door was open.  We let ourselves in.

      Shea starts to work the front door lock.                                                                                    19.


      INT. JIMBO S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

    The door pops open.  Charlie, gun out, enters slowly; nods to 
      Graham to go around through the living room.  Graham peels 
      off; as Charlie and Shea cautiously move down a hall...

                                  CHARLIE
                    James Cantrall.My name is U.S. 
                    Deputy Charles DuChamp.

    No answer. Charlie steps into the kitchen archway.  He finds 
      Graham standing next to Jimbo, nailed to the chair, a huge 
      knifesticking from his chest, blood pool under him. As 
      Graham kneels near the dead body...

                                  GRAHAM 
                    Blood s shiny.  Tillman s been gone 
                    at least an hour.

    OFF Charlie - damn it, they just missed their guy.


      INT. RENTAL CAR - SAME TIME

    As Philly and Lloyd wait for the others, Lloyd rummages 
      through papers in Charlie s briefcase...

                                  LLOYD
                    Slot machines?  What kind of dollar-
                    buffet rube does Charlie take me for?  
                    Before they popped me, I d be comped
                    in any suite in Vegas.  Five grand a 
                    hand on Blackjack, 10 on a roll on 
                    craps.  And not even think twice 
                    about... PhilomenaRotchliffer?

      Lloyd pulls her special deputy credentials from the 
      briefcase, eyes wide.  Philly snatches it from him.

                                  LLOYD (CONT D)

                          (dead serious)
                    I won t tell anybody if you let me 
                    see them.

    She looks at him, disgusted.  Ring.  Lloyd looks at his cell s 
      display, grimaces.  He quickly answers, turning to the side a 
      bit, trying to  hide  the conversation.                                                                                     20.


                                  LLOYD (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Hello... yes... yes... Well, I m 
                    working... I don t know when I ll 
                    be done... 

      Philly watches.  Lloyd whispers ever softer, more intense.

                                  LLOYD (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    I m not supposed to be on the 
                    phone, Mother...
                          (beat)
                    Are you drinking?... I heard ice 
                    cubes.  We ve talked about this --

      Click.Clearly, Lloyd was hung up on.  He turns to find 
      Philly just staring at him - all she can say is...

                                  PHILLY
                    Wow.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Don t move an inch!

      A GUNis pointed through the window at Lloyd.  He looks up in
      terror to see a YOUNG LOCAL COP aiming his piece at him.

    OFF Lloyd and Philly, hands up.


      INT. JIMBO S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Charlie takes photos of Jimbo.Graham enters from the garage.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Car was parked and ready to go.  He 
                    almost made it out of here before 
                    Tillman got him.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hands where I can see  em!

      Charlie and Graham turn to find Philly and Lloyd being led 
    in, cuffed, by...

                                  YOUNG LOCAL COP
                    Don t move!

                                  CHARLIE
                    Easy, pal.  Charlie DuChamp, U.S. 
                    Marshals.  Let me reach for my ID --

                                  YOUNG LOCAL COP
                    I said don t move --

      CRACK!  Shea lungesfrom a back hall, PUNCHES the cop, then 
      SMASHES him face-first into the wall.  As the cop collapses --

                                  LLOYD
                    We re gonnaget in trouble for that.                                                                                    21.


      INT. JIMBO S HOUSE - DAY - LATER

      Through the window, we can see Charlie (with Shea next to 
      him) talking down a group of local cops on the front lawn -- 
    as the young cop holds an ice pack to his swollen face.

      Philly and Lloyd step forward -- gingerly -- for their first 
      good look at what happened to Jimbo. 

                                  PHILLY
                    My god...

                                  LLOYD
                    I ll be in the car.

                                  GRAHAM (O.S.)
                    Keep your ass right there.  

      Lloyd turns, sees Graham enter with a crowbar.  As Graham 
      steps to Jimboand slides on latex gloves...

                                  GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    Take a good look.  Both of you.
                          (beat)
                    The next one might not be an  
                      accomplice.  Maybe just some poor 
                    schmuck who gets in Tillman s way. 

      Graham kneels next to Jimbo sbody, grabs the crowbar.

                                  GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    Remember this.

    As Graham wedges the claw of the crowbar under the nailhead 
      protruding from Jimbo sthigh...

                                  LLOYD
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  GRAHAM
                    Cell phone s in his back pocket and I 
                    need to check his call history.  And 
                    there s no time to wait for the M.E. 

      Lloyd and Philly wince as Graham leans in to put some muscle 
      behind the nail-removal.  But before he does, he double-takes 
    at something O.S... 

    We follow his gaze to UNDERNEATH AN END TABLE where something 
    is taped down tight.  Graham slowly approaches, quietly turns 
    the table over.  Lloyd and Philly see this, approach.

      They stand over the table, looking down at a cellphonetaped 
    to its bottom, with a device plugged into one of its ports.

      POVof phone LOOKINGUPat the three LOOKINGDOWNat it.

                                  PHILLY
                            (whispering)
                    That s a jamming device so we can t 
                    track his phone s location.                                                                                    22.


      Graham looks out to Charlie in the front yard.  Charlie would 
      probably advise him against what he s about to do.  FuckIt. 
    He slowly leans in toward the phone, pissed.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Hey Tillman, you hear me you son of 
                    a bitch? ...


      INT. TILLMAN S TRUCK - DAY - SAME TIME

      August Tillman drives and listens.

                                  GRAHAM (OVER PHONE) 
                    ... We re gonnaget your ass.

    A beat, then Tillman leans in, turns off the phone.  WE PAN 
      OVER to an open notebook on the passenger seat.  Written on 
    it is Charlie DuChamp.U.S. Marshall.  

                                  BOLANDER (PRELAP)
                    Assaulting a police officer in 
                    Atlantic City?


      INT. CHARLIE S OFFICE - DAY

      Bolander tosses a REPORT onto Charlie s desk.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Daniels thought we were in danger.

                                  BOLANDER
                    I do notwant those convicts going 
                    out in the field again.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Then there s no point in having 
                    them.  Trust me, Graham and I have 
                    a handle on this.  

                                  BOLANDER
                    Oh, the great Graham Weston.  How s 
                    oldWild West enjoying this set-up? 

                                  CHARLIE
                    I ll send the cop in A.C.a fruit 
                    basket.  But now we re done.  

      Charlie moves to head out, but Bolander stops him with...

                                  BOLANDER
                    Listen Charlie, I know some people 
                    pussy-foot around you on account of 
                    what you ve been through 
                      personally.  Me?  I don t care.  
                    Especially after you went over my 
                    head to the Director.  So 
                    congratulations pal, now it s your 
                    ass on the line.

                                    BOLANDER(CONT'D)
                    Cause when this little circus 
                    you re running blows up, I m gonna
                    have your badge.    

      Bolander exits...


      INT. TASK FORCE - BULLPEN - DAY - LATER

      ...and storms out.  The rest of our team is huddled around a 
      monitor and The Board.  They watch Bolander go for a beat, 
      then Charlie exits his office, approaches.

                                  GRAHAM
                    He just find out he got cut from 
                    the department softball team?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Please tell me you have something.

                                  GRAHAM
                    We might.  Julianne got the FBI 
                    file on the bank robbery today.  
                    Turns out 400grand was taken, they 
                    just told the media it was 100.

                                  CHARLIE
                    And that means what?

                                  SHEA
                    Means maybe Tillman hasn t gotten 
                    all the money yet.  Think about it - 
                    Jimbo scar was packed - so odds 
                    are the money was in there when 
                    Tillman arrived, but he still 
                    tortured the guy.  He wanted 
                    information.

                    high school pals don t pull off a 
                    perfect, one-time heist for 400K 
                    without some inside help.  

                                  GRAHAM
                    Check this out.  Jules?

      Julianne presses some keys.  A bank surveillance videocomes 
    up on the screen.

                                  GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    That s gotta be Tillman.

    On the film, they watch a masked Tillman order a female 
      teller to get money.  She hesitates.  A male teller 
      approaches to calm Tillman down and gets cracked across the 
      skull with the gun.

    The male teller crumples to the ground -- then the female 
      teller finally complies.  Graham points to the female teller.                                                                                    24.

                    from an untraceable cell phone.

                    Cool, so while you and Graham are 
                    doing that, maybe I can have my wife

                    the bridge and I haven t seen  em in

      Charlie steps to Shea.

                    She s running!

    As Graham and Charlie move to the front door -- they hear a 
      guttural scream.  They turn just as the hulking Caz blind-
      sides Graham and drives him into the wall-- denting the 
      sheetrock and knocking two framed pictures to the floor.

    As Charlie jumps in, landing some punches on Caz -- 


      EXT. BREAKOUT KINGS SUV - SAME TIME

      Philly, Shea and Lloyd -- who points at Sarah s passing car.

                                  LLOYD
                    That s the teller!  

      Philly looks up at Sarah s house.

                                  PHILLY
                    Where the hell are they?

      Just then, the entwined mass of Charlie, Graham and Caz bursts 
      through the front window and onto the lawn.

                                  LLOYD
                    Who are we rooting for?

                                  PHILLY
                    Shea, dosomething.

                                  SHEA (O.S.)
                    I am.

      ANGLE:  Shea s hot-wiring the car.  As it roars to life --

                                  SHEA (CONT D)
                    They can handle themselves.
                          (throwingit in gear)
                    We need that chick.

      SCREECH-- as Shea peels out.


      EXT. STREETS OF ASTORIA- MOMENTS LATER

      Shea s a sickdriver.  He spots Sarah ahead, floors it, 
      weaves through traffic.  Philly holds on tight as Lloyd curls 
    up in the fetal position in the backseat.                                                                                    27.


      SARAH O LEARY, 27, spots Shea giving chase - cuts through a 
    gas station.  Shea jerks the wheel, slicing through 3 lanes 
    of traffic to keep up.  Philly buckles herself in.

      Shea soon pulls alongside Sarah, both going at least 75.  He 
      wedges her between his car and concrete construction barriers
      lining the shoulder.  Sarah has nowhere to go.  

                                  SHEA
                    Where ya goin now?!

      Philly looks - they re racing toward the massive steel 
      abutment of Hell Gate Bridge which spans the East River.

                                  PHILLY
                    We re gonnarun into the bridge!

                                  SHEA
                    We won t.  Shewill!

    The cars race closer and closer - only 50 yards away now.

                                  PHILLY
                    You re gonnakill her!

                                  SHEA
                    Or she ll stop!  Her choice!

    The bridge gets closer.  Philly closes her eyes tight, then: 
      SCREECH!  Sarah slams on the brakes.  So does Shea.  Both cars 
      smoke to a halt, just feet from the abutment.  Shea hops out 
    of the car, approaches a spent Sarah.

                                  SARAH
                    I hate you cops.

                                  SHEA
                    Oh, I ain t a cop.

    OFF Sarah, confused.


      INT. BREAKOUT KINGS OFFICES - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Sarah is grilled by Charlie and Graham -- both scraped up.  
      Philly and Lloyd watch via the two-way window in the bullpen.  

                                  CHARLIE
                    You re gonnabe a hell of a lot 
                    safer if you get straight with us.

                                  SARAH
                    I ve been as straight as the GW
                    Bridge.  I didn t rob any bank.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Of course you didn t.  That s why 
                    you Grand Theft Auto dyour way 
                    across Queens -- and your boyfriend 
                    Bigfoot s in County right now.                                                                                    28.


                                  SARAH
                    Yeah, cause I was already locked up 
                    and questioned over this crap, when I 
                    didn t do anything.  So you can all 
                    kiss my Irish ass.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Tillman s after you, darling.  He s 
                    hell-bent on getting the rest of the 
                    money.  So if you don t help us find 
                    him, he s gonnafind you.  And you ll 
                    be in a spot much worse than this.

                                  SARAH
                    I already told you, I don t know 
                    who the hell Tillman is.  

      Graham rubs his face, looks to Charlie; they re not sure what 
    to believe.  Charlie walks to the door, beckons Lloyd with a 
      finger.  Lloyd approaches the room, cracks his knuckles.


      EXT. BREAKOUT KINGS OFFICES - DAY

      Shea s in a private nook outside the offices. On his cell.

                                  SHEA (INTO PHONE)
                    They say a month for every 
                    fugitive, so we catch twelve
                    runners and I only get a year off.

                                  TIA (O.S.)
                    That s right.  So bust your ass for 
                    these guys.


      INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

      Shea s wife, TIA, 27, Black.  INTERCUT THEIR CONVERSATION.

                                  SHEA
                    Or...

                                  TIA
                    Or what?

                                  SHEA
                    I don t know.  It s nice getting 
                    fresh air again.  And knowing you 
                    and Drew are so close...

                                  TIA
                    No more running Shea.  I won t go 
                    back to that.  So don t even joke.

                                  SHEA
                    This ain t a slam dunk, baby.  If 
                    one of the other guys runs, I end 
                    up doing double my time.  It s --                                                                                    29.


                                  TIA
                    -- our last chance.  This works, 
                    you can get home to us years 
                    sooner.  Years.

    A beat, then --

                                  SHEA
                    Yeah.  Alright.

                                  TIA
                    I love you, baby.

                                  SHEA
                    Love you, too.

      Shea disconnects the call.  Off him, conflicted.


      INT. TASK FORCE - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

      Pick up mid-questioning; Lloyd sits across from Sarah, loves 
      being the center of attention.  He speaks quickly.

                                  LLOYD
                    And on the day of the robbery, what 
                    did you have for breakfast?

                                  SARAH
                    What?I don t know... a bagel.

                                  LLOYD
                    Okay, and when the gun was produced 
                    what did you see?

                                  SARAH
                    A gun pointed at me.

                                  LLOYD
                    And behind the gun?

                                  SARAH
                    A man?

                                  LLOYD
                    Behind him?

                                  SARAH
                    I was looking at the gun.

                                  LLOYD
                    Scary stuff, huh?

                                  SARAH
                    Yeah.                                                                                    30.


                                  LLOYD
                    That morning, after you got up, got 
                    dressed, ate your cereal, brushed 
                    your teeth, left for work - you 
                    never thought anything like that 
                    would happen, did you?

                                  SARAH
                    No... and I had a bagel.

      Lloyd nods, Sarah didn t fall for the trap.

                                  LLOYD
                    My mistake.  Back to the robbery, 
                    what was the first thing that went 
                    through your mind when you saw the 
                    who farted?

    The room goes still.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Excuse me?

                                  LLOYD
                    Was it you, Charlie,  cause someone 
                    cut the flounder and it s coming 
                    from your general direction.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Are you --?  No.  

                                  GRAHAM
                    Just do your job.

                                  LLOYD
                    Hard for me to do my job -
                          (waving his hand)
                    - in what s now basically a hostile 
                    work environment --

                                  SARAH
                    -- then crack the damn door.  Let s 
                    just get this over with cause I 
                    didn t help rob any bank!

      Lloyd looks at Sarah, a glint in his eye - success-- as he s 
      yanked out of the room by Graham.  


      INT. TASK FORCE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

      Outside of the room, Graham and Charlie get in Lloyd s face.

                                  GRAHAM
                    You think this is a game?  
                          (toCharlie)
                    Just send his ass back to prison.                                                                                    31.

                    A guilty person LOVES when 
                    attention shifts away from them to 
                    someone else.  If she was involved 
                    in this crime, she d be happy to 
                    sit here all night talking about 
                    bodily functions.  But she wanted 
                    to get back to convincing you she s 
                    no criminal.  So much for your 
                     inside man  theory, Philomena. 

                                  PHILLY
                    No.  We just have the wrongbank 
                    employee.  

      Philly, who s been at her desk waiting to hear the verdict on 
      Sarah, now presents her back-up theory.

                                  PHILLY (CONT'D)
                    Those  red-flag  calls into Sarah?  
                    Another Tillman misdirect.  She 
                    answers, he hangs up, instant 
                    suspicious call.  Wanted everyone 
                    to look at her, so they wouldn t 
                    look at someone else.

      Philly moves to the monitor, taps a frozen image of the bank 
      heist, specifically the male teller who got pistol-whipped.

                                  PHILLY (CONT'D)
                    And who would ever think to look at 
                    the hero teller who comes to a

                          (beat; refers to report)
                    Kyle Ferro.  Left the bank two 
                    months after the robbery.  No 
                    current address.

      Charlie moves over to The Board, points to Kyle Ferro.

      INT. AUGUST TILLMAN S TRUCK - DAY

    Off the interstate, Tillman, on the phone has a curling iron 
      plugged into his truck s cigarette lighter.

    He hangs up, then spits on the curling iron.  The sizzle 
      confirms it s hot.  He takes a deep breath, brings the iron

      INT. TASK FORCE - JULIANNE S OFFICE - DAY

      Lloyd studies Kyle Ferro s Bank ID photo, blown up on one of 
      Julianne s monitors.  Julianne, uncomfortable, sits nearby.  
    The printer spits out the last page of a chosen document.  
      Lloyd takes it, but stares at Julianne.  She hasn t made eye 
      contact since he s been in her office.

                                  LLOYD
                    Minimal interaction, no eye

                    I m guessing, a twistof 
                      depression?

      Julianne stares straight ahead.

                                  LLOYD (CONT'D)
                    Let me guess:  family history, you 
                    were diagnosed around 18 or 19, and 
                    it really reared it s ugly head 
                    about 5 years ago.

                    to get out of here.

                                  JULIANNE
                    That s because you ve been looking 
                    down my blouse this whole time.

                                  LLOYD
                    Correct.  But that s because I 
                    suffer from Matriarchal Dependency 
                    with tangential Mammary Fixation...  
                    See?  I know what s wrong with me.

                                  JULIANNE
                    Did you get all you need?  Because 
                    if so, you can leave now.

      Lloyd gathers his printouts, and is about to head out, but 
      stops, softening.

                                  LLOYD
                    Group therapy and shrink visits, it s 
                    hogwash.  It s in their financial 
                    interest for you to stay afflicted.  
                    Walk one block out of your safe zone, 
                    sit on a park bench, and ask a 
                    stranger for the time.  Do that 
                    twice.  Next week?  Three times.
                          (beat)
                    Quit waiting for a wrecking ball to 
                    knock this down.  A crack in the 
                    dyke will do.                                                                                    33.


    The door opens and Graham enters.  He looks at Lloyd, then 
      Julianne -- who s wide-eyed and breathing heavily.

                                  GRAHAM
                    What are you doing in here?

                                  LLOYD
                    My job.  Isn t that the idea?

      Graham motions for Lloyd to follow him out.


      INT. TASK FORCE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

    As soon as the door closes, Graham puts his palm on Lloyd s 
      chest -- bringing Lloyd to an immediate halt.

                                  GRAHAM
                    What did you say to her?

                                  LLOYD
                    Just gave her some pro bono advice.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Lemme return the favor.  Don t ever 
                    talk to her about anything other 
                    than work.  Understand?

      Lloyd stares at Graham, then looks at Julianne s office door.  
      A sly smile forms on his lips --

                                  LLOYD
                    Awfully protective; wanna talk 
                    about it?

                                  GRAHAM
                    Y know, for a child prodigy, you 
                    think you d be smart enough to know 
                    when to shut the hell up.

      Graham slaps Lloyd s cheek a few times, Godfather-style.  
      That simple move takes the cockiness right out of Lloyd. 

                                  GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Move your ass.

      Lloyd nods and heads into the bullpen.


      INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      TILLMAN sits, sips a glass of milk.  A fresh burn on his neck 
    -- no more tattoo.  Staring directly ahead -- he sets the 
      milk down on the coffee table -- right next to his GUN.

    HIS POV:  A woman, KATRINA, 35, sits on the couch next to her 
      12-year-olddaughter, ALYSSA.They re terrified.                                                                                    34.


                                  KATRINA
                    I could try Kyle on his cell, and 
                    you could talk to him.

                                  TILLMAN
                    Yeah thanks, but then Kyle might 
                    call the authorities, and I can t 
                    have that.
                          (beat)
                    We re gonnawait till he gets home 
                    and settle this in-house.
                          (toAlyssa; smiling)
                    Thanks for the milk.

    OFF the mother and daughter.


      INT. TASK FORCE - BULLPEN - DAY

      Graham, Lloyd and Philly review the documents pertaining to 
      Ferro.  Charlie runs the room.  Shea doodles at his desk.

                                  CHARLIE
                    So Ferro just falls off the grid?

                                  SHEA
                    It s easy if he s cash heavy.  
                    Don t renew your driver s license, 
                    no credit cards, rent or shack up 
                    with someone else.  Hell when I was 
                    on the run I was living in the open 
                    as Joe Civilian -- government 
                    didn t know me from a load of wood.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Until I busted your door down in St. 
                    Paul.  At which point I definitely
                    knew you from a load of wood.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Lowery - you re the one with more 
                    degrees than a thermometer - where 
                    is he?

                                  LLOYD
                    This is a guy who needs a lifeline.  
                    Three clubs in high school, trainer 
                    for the football team -- that s 
                    probably how he got lured into the 
                    heist, the desire to be a part of 
                    something.  Dependent Personality 
                    Disorder -- very common amongst 
                    Latinos, FYI. Believe me he s not 
                    going to pull a Unabomberand move 
                    to Montana and eat turnips.  

                                  CHARLIE
                    But he s got no wife, no kids, 
                    parents are dead...                                                                                    35.


                                  PHILLY
                    Right here:  He has a brother named 
                    Frank.  Frank opened a bar six 
                    months after the heist.

      Without looking up from his doodle...

                                  SHEA
                    A good place to launder money.

                                  PHILLY
                    That s right.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Where s the brother live?

    She scans the piece of paper, finds it.

                                  PHILLY
                    Richmond, Virginia.

      Charlie checks his watch.

                                  CHARLIE
                    We can be there in an hour.

      Moving past Shea s desk, Graham glances down.

                                  GRAHAM
                    What the hell s that?

                                  SHEA
                    Look, if we re gonnado this then 
                    we need a nickname for our crew.  

    He holds up his offering in the way of company logo:  
        PhugitivePhindersis written in graffiti-style font.

                                  PHILLY
                      PhugitivePhinders?

                                  SHEA
                    Bask in it.

                                  LLOYD
                    How about Manhattan Misspellers?

      Graham takes it, looks at it, smiles and nods.  Then he 
      crumples it up and tosses it in a waste basket.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Less arts and crafts.  More kick 
                    and ass.  

                                  CHARLIE
                          (to all)
                    Our window s closing.  Not only on 
                    catching Tillman, but on allyou 
                      asswipes.We don t get him; this 
                    is over; you reover.  Understand?                                                                                    36.


    PAN the team - it s clear they understand the stakes.  All 
      business, he turns and walks out.


      EXT. BAR - DAY

      Charlie and Graham approach this working-class, non-trendy 
      pub.  The TowneLounge.

      CHYRON:  Richmond, Virginia


      INT. THE TOWNELOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

      Charlie/Graham enter, look around at the sparse afternoon 
      crowd.  They approach the bartender (White, 35) no-nonsense.

                                  CHARLIE
                    U.S. Marshals.  Frank Ferro?

      Frank suddenly turns into comedian.  He holds his hands up.

                                  FRANK
                    She said she was eighteen!  Swear 
                    to god!
                          (biglaugh, then --)
                    What can I do for you guys?

                                  CHARLIE
                    We re looking for your brother, Kyle.

                                  FRANK
                    What s wrong?  Is he in trouble?

                                  GRAHAM
                    No no no.That bank deal up in New 
                    York?  We ve got some more 
                      information that his co-worker 
                    might vebeen in on the robbery.

                                  FRANK
                    He s been back-packing through Asia 
                    the past 6 months.  That robbery 
                    really threw him for a loop; he s 
                    been trying to clear his head.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Back-packing through Asia.  I wish.

                                  FRANK
                    Ain t that the truth.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Alright, well if you hear from him.

      Charlie puts his card on the bar.  Frank picks it up.

                                  FRANK
                      Absolutely.                                                                                      37.


      Graham and Charlie head out.  Frank watches them go.  REVEAL 
      Sheaat the end of the bar, nursing a beer.


      INT. RENTAL SUV - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Philly and Lloyd are in the back seat.  Charlie and Graham 
    get in front.  Graham s on the phone with Julianne.

                                  PHILLY
                    Well?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Says he doesn t know where his 
                    brother is.

                                  LLOYD
                    Wow.  We kind of knew that back in 
                    New York.  Great idea coming here.

                                  CHARLIE
                    He was too friendly.  He knows.

    The back side door opens and Shea hops in.

                                  SHEA
                    Soon as you left he made a call on 
                    his cell.

                                  GRAHAM (INTO PHONE)
                    Alright thanks.

    He disconnects the call.

                                  GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    Frank s cell must be disposable 
                    because Julianne says he doesn t 
                    have one registered in his name.  
                    There s no records to dump.
                          (beat)
                    We need his physical phone.

                                  SHEA
                    Hell, I can get you his cell and 
                    his fillings in five minutes.

                                  GRAHAM
                    And as soon as you re gone he calls 
                    his brother and alerts him.  

                                  CHARLIE
                    Plus, our director says you re 
                    limited to one assault per case.

                                  PHILLY
                    I can get his phone, but...  
                          (points at her clothes)
                    I ll need 500 for a new outfit.

                                  CHARLIE
                    You can buy it yourself.                                                                                    38.


                                  PHILLY
                    You guys froze all my accounts when 
                    you caught me.  I don t have two 
                    nickels to rub together.  And no 
                    offense to your fashion taste, but 
                    the clothes you picked out make me 
                    look like an 80-year-oldlesbian.

      Charlie peels off some bills.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Two hundred.  Make do.

    As he fires up the SUV and drives off.


      EXT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY 

      POVof a TRUCK idling in the parking lot; REVEAL Shea watches 
    the truck from the railing.  He scans the parking lot -- he s 
      contemplating it. THEN, Lloyd steps into frame behind Shea, 
      observes him for a beat, then...

                                  LLOYD
                    Let me tell you about a study I did 
                    when I was teaching at the 
                    University - I gave five-year-olds
                    a choice between a nickel today or 
                    a dime tomorrow. They all took the 
                    nickel.  Point is, children have a 
                    hard time delaying gratification. 
                    And, if we re being intellectually 
                    honest, so do your people.

                                  SHEA 
                    What s that now?

                                  LLOYD
                    Come on - Hey, just got my 
                    government check, lemme go get some 
                    blingand new rims.

                                  SHEA
                    You re a straight up racist.

                                  LLOYD
                    I m a factist, and the factisI 
                    see in your eyes that you re 
                      contemplating jumping on that truck 
                    and making a run.  Don t take the 
                    nickel dummy.Let s ride this out, 
                    finish our time; then we can all be 
                    free at last, free at last.

                                  SHEA
                    This how you wanna spend the next 
                    10 years?  Charlie and Graham 
                    keeping you on a leash?  

      Lloyd steps to Shea, actually gets up in his face a bit.                                                                                    39.


                                  LLOYD
                    I want a shiny dime, pal! And I 
                    didn t get 10 years - I got 25. And 
                    it s a helluvalot different inside 
                    for a guy like me than it is for 
                    you. And I m not going back.

      Beat - Shea s taken aback by this information.

                                  SHEA
                    25 years?What the hell dyou do?

      Lloyd looks away, his demeanor changes.

                                  LLOYD
                    None of your business.

    The sound of the truck pulling away makes them look back.

                                  LLOYD (CONT D)
                    And there goes your ride.

                                  SHEA
                    Yeah, well the kids thought the 
                    nickel was worth more  cause it s 
                    bigger than a dime.  Your study was 
                    garbage.

      Lloyd takes this in a beat, then the sound of Philly exiting 
    the bathroom makes them turn. She s all sexed up and HOT AS 
      HELL. Shea and Lloyd stare, speechless.

                                  PHILLY
                    I m ready ... and you can close 
                    your mouths now.

    OFF Philly, smoking hot.


      INT. BAR - DAY

      Lloyd and Philly at a corner table.  Philly looks over at the 
    bar and smiles coquettishly at Frank.  Frank looks at Lloyd.  
      Unthreatened, he looks at Philly and smiles back.

                                  LLOYD
                    We need to show somekind of 
                    affection if we re going to 
                      effectively convey being a couple.

                                  PHILLY
                    You can put your hand on my thigh 
                    for five seconds.

      Lloyd swallows the cotton in his throat, then gently places 
    his hand on her thigh.  As he moans... 

                                  PHILLY (CONT'D)
                    Any further north and you re 
                    pulling back a stump.                                                                                    40.


    A beat as Lloyd enjoys the touch, then --

                                  LLOYD
                    Unpleasant childhood... maybe some 
                    daddy issues?  Beyond that, I can t 
                    figure you out, Philly.

    She leans in close.

                                  PHILLY
                    You never will.

      Frank looks over at Philly from behind the bar.  They lock 
      eyes.  Philly removes Lloyd s hand and moves to the bar where 
      Frank gives her the once over.

                                  FRANK
                    What reya drinking?

                                  PHILLY
                    So-co, rocks.

    As Frank pours the drink...

                                  FRANK
                    Your husband s staring at us.

                                  PHILLY
                    I know.  

      Philly takes out an ice cube, pops it in her mouth, sucks it, 
      then pulls it out with her fingers - gulp.

                                  PHILLY (CONT D)
                    He likes to watch.

    OFF Philly - regrettably -- as we TIME CUT TO:


      INT./EXT. OUTSIDE MOTEL/CAR - DAY

      Charlie/Graham in the front seat; Shea in back, writing on a 
      notepad.They stare across the parking lot at Philly s room.

                                  SHEA
                    And this llwork? Some dude s gonna
                    watch his old lady get tagged by 
                    another dude?  I mean, that 
                    actually goes down?

                                  GRAHAM
                      Apparently.

                                  SHEA
                    Said it before and I ll say it 
                    again: White people are crazy.
                          (then)
                    Alright, if we re gonnado this, 
                    let s do it right.  Ready?                                                                                    41.


      Shea tears out the paper he s been writing on, displays his 
      handiwork -- the latest group nickname nominee, once again 
      done in elaborate graffiti style:  BREAKOUTKINGS.  Graham 
    and Charlie look at it, then look at each other. 

                                  GRAHAM
                    It doesn t make any sense.  We re 
                    not breaking out.  

                                  CHARLIE
                          Breakout-ApprehensionKings, maybe.  

                                  SHEA
                    See, this is why I was clearin 
                    seven figures while ya llwere 
                      clippin coupons.  I got vision. 

                                  GRAHAM
                    Doesn t make any sense.

      Shea, undeterred, leans back in the seat and spreads his 
      hands out, like envisioning it on a t-shirt...

                                  SHEA
                    Breakout Kings...


      INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

    On Frank, leaning back in his chair...

                                  FRANK
                    Slower.

      ANGLE ON Philly who slowly unbuttons her blouse to reveal a 
      black, lace bra that is distracting me as I type this. Frank 
      motions with his finger for her to drop the pants. She does.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    I saw what you could do with an ice 
                    cube... let s see if it translates.

      Philly moves in like a lion on a zebra, grabs the back of his 
      head, wraps a leg around him, nails him with a knee-buckling 
      kiss. Her hands move down his back, over his ass... we SEE 
    HER LIFT FRANK S CELL PHONE and slide it into her panties.

                                  PHILLY
                    I ll go tell Mortywe re ready...

                                  FRANK
                    Don t be long,  cause I m locked 
                    and loaded, sugar.

      Philly moves to the door that connects the rooms, enters ...                                                                                    42.


      INT. MOTEL - LLOYD S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Philly closes the door behind her.  Lloyd takes one look at 
    her practically naked; his eyes grow wide.  He swallows as 
    she reaches into her panties and removes the cell phone ...

                                  LLOYD
                    That s one lucky piece of 
                    electronics.

    ... andquickly begins scrolling through it.

                    Dammit.His call history s been 
                    cleared. 

    The adjoining door begins to open.  Philly spins, holds the 
      phone behind her back.

                                  FRANK
                    Hey, we doin this or not?

                                  PHILLY
                    I m coming right in handsome --

      Frank s cell RINGS- and it s his distinctivering tone!  He 
      reaches behind Philly, yanks away the cell phone.

                                  FRANK
                    What the hell?

      Lloyd runsfor the door. Frank grabs him, slams his head into 
    the wall - Lloyd collapses to the floor. Frank turns to a 
      cornered Philly, squeezes her by the neck and slams her back 
      against the wall.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Who the hell are you?

    Off Philly, in a very bad spot.

      INT. MOTEL - LLOYD S ROOM - DAY

      Frank s grip has grown tighter around Philly s neck.

                                  FRANK
                    Start talking.

                                  PHILLY
                    I work... for the... government... 

      Frank, pissed, squeezes harder.

                                  FRANK
                    You re a Fed like I m a ballerina.

                    I m... a... con... they hired me...

      Frank doesn t know what to believe.  He tosses her to the bed 
    - next to her, on the floor, Lloyd rubs his head, sits up.

                                  FRANK
                    The con part I believe.  Talk or 
                    you both leave here in zip-ups.

                                  LLOYD
                    Shut the hell up.

                                  FRANK
                    What s this gotta do with me?

      Lloyd realizes Philly is up to something.  Beat, Frank picks 
    up the phone, dials...


      INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

      KYLE FERRO lets himself into the house with his key.

                    Katrina?

    His cell phone buzzes and he looks at the display.  He s 
      about to answer it when he looks to his right and his eyes go 
      wide.  There s Tillman. 

                                  TILLMAN
                    What s up, Kyle.

      Tillman then punches Kyle in the face.  As we CUT BACK TO:


      INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

      Frank finishes leaving a message...

                                  FRANK (INTO PHONE)

      Frank hangs up.  Philly, sultry, slowly moves toward the 
      light switch.

                                  PHILLY
                    Y know, I ve spent the past few

      INT. MOTEL - LLOYD S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Frank is in the process of tying Philly s wrists behind her 
      back with his shirt as the door is KICKED IN by Graham.  
      Charlie s right behind, gun pointed right at Frank...

                                  CHARLIE
                    ON THE GROUND!

      ...as Frank puts Philly in a choke hold.

                                  FRANK
                    What the hell s all this?!

                                  CHARLIE
                    Number three on the clock.

    In a flash, Charlie jerks the gun to the left, fires at the 
      wall-clock on the other side of the room.  They all turn to 
    see that the #3 is smoking.  The gun s right back on Frank, 
    who swallows hard.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Next one splits that unibrow.

      Beat, then Frank throws up his hands.  As Philly steps away:

                                  PHILLY
                    Hit redial on his cell - that s 
                    Ferro s number.

      Graham grabs the cell steps to the side with his own cell to 
    his ear - he s already speed-dialed...

                                  GRAHAM
                    Jules, trace this.  804-678...

    As Charlie pushes Frank s ass into a chair.  Philly glares at 
      Lloyd - you big pussy.  Then, Ring.  It s Lloyd s cell.  He 
      checks the displays, cover his mouth as he answers...

                                  LLOYD (INTO PHONE)
                    This really isn t a good time --

      Philly yanksthe phone from Lloyd.

                                  PHILLY (INTO PHONE)
                    Mrs. Lowry?  Get your teat out of 
                    your son s mouth.  He s a big boy 
                    now.                                                                                    46.


    She hangs up - Lloyd is aghast, speechless save for...

                                  LLOYD
                    How dare you...

                                  PHILLY
                    If I didn t think you d get off on 
                    it, I d check to see if she sews 
                    your name in your underwear.

      Graham hurries back in --

                                  GRAHAM
                    We ve got an address.  

                                  CHARLIE
                    Let s go.


      INT. FERRO S HOUSE - DAY

      Ferro s face is beaten.  Katrina and Alyssaare next to him 
    on the couch, crying.  Tillman s wrapping up a phone call. 

                                  TILLMAN (INTO PHONE)
                    ...Yeah.  You re 10 minutes away...  
                    Hurry up.

    He disconnects the call and turns to Ferro.

                                  TILLMAN (CONT D)
                    Always thought you were smarter 
                    than me, didn t you, Bank Teller?  

    As he loads a single bullet into his gun...

                                  TILLMAN (CONT D)
                    Tell me, what s 1 outta6?

      Ferro doesn t respond; he s scared shitless.Tillman spins 
    the gun s chamber and points it at Ferro - Russian Roulette.

                                  TILLMAN (CONT'D)
                    What s 1 outta6 and don t make me 
                    ask again.

                                  FERRO
                    Sixteen point seven percent.

                                  TILLMAN
                    Then the odds are in your favor.

      Tillman extends his hand forward toward Ferro...

                                  KATRINA
                    No --

      PULL!- click- nothing.  Ferro whimpers, Alyssasobs.  
      Tillman spins the chamber again.                                                                                    47.


                                  TILLMAN
                    Let s see if they re in herfavor.  

      Tillman points the gun OFF camera at Alyssa- we hear her cry 
      out.  Ferro s eyes go wide...

                                  FERRO
                    Don t.

                                  TILLMAN
                    Where s the money?

      TIGHT ON Tillman s finger beginning to depress the trigger.

                                  FERRO
                    The attic!

      Tillman smiles.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:


      INT. FERRO S HOUSE - LATER

      Front door.  Ding dong.  No one comes to the door.  Ding 
      dong.  Nothing again... then, BAM!The door is shouldered-in 
    by Shea.  Charlie enters first, followed by Graham, then 
      Shea, Philly and Lloyd bring up the rear.

      They find Katrina tied to a chair -- gagged.  Graham races 
      over, takes the gag off.

                                  KATRINA
                    He took my daughter!

                                  GRAHAM
                    Tillman?

                                  KATRINA
                    He took Kyle and Alyssa.She s 
                    only twelve!

                                  GRAHAM
                    What car were they driving?

                                  KATRINA
                    I don t know.  They got picked up.  
                    Ten minutes ago.

      Lloyd  comforts  her with...

                                  LLOYD
                    Ma am, if it s any consolation, 
                    there s nothing in Tillman s 
                    pathology to suggest he d do 
                    anything sexual with your daughter; 
                    he s strictly a killer --

      Katrina s eyes grow wide as Shea looks at Lloyd like he s an 
      idiot.  Ferro s land line rings.  Charlie answers it.                                                                                    48.


                                  CHARLIE
                    Hello?

                                  TILLMAN (OVER PHONE)
                    Charlie DuChamp.

      Charlie says nothing - he knows who it is.

                                  TILLMAN (OVER PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Back off, or I ll make this kid 
                    suffer.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Listen, there s no need to--

                                  TILLMAN (OVER PHONE)
                    You hear me?  I ll make her suffer - 
                    and that llbe on you.

      Click. He hangs up.  OFF Charlie as we SMASH TO --


      INT. JULIANNE S OFFICE - DAY

      Julianne simultaneously reviews 6 different computer monitors 
    - it looks a bit like a sports book at a casino - a lot of 
      data, but the way her mind works enables her to take in all 
      this information at once.

    Two monitors flash images from Tillman s escape: the license- 
      plate suit-of-armor, the service vehicle, a map showing the 
      route the service vehicle drove before being overtaken.

      Something catches her eye - photos of Food Service Workers 
      attacked in the escape - she zeroes in on the hospital photos 
    of the female worker s head wound.

    She presses a button, ZOOMS IN ON THE WOUND. OFF Julianne, 
    her mind racing, but not putting it all together yet.


      INT. FERRO S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      Charlie, Philly and Lloyd lay out maps and laptopson the 
      table, making it their command center.  Charlie turns to see 
      Graham escorting Shea and a cuffed Frank toward a back hall.  
      Shea and Frank continue on.  Graham approaches Charlie. 

                                  CHARLIE
                    What s that about?

                                  GRAHAM
                    Maybe Frank knows something.  I m 
                    gonnahave Shea find out.

      Charlie looks at Graham, eyebrows raised.

                                  GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Look, I don t like the guy.  But 
                    this is one of the reasons he was 
                    put on the team, right?                                                                                    49.


                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah, but that might be pushing it.

                                  GRAHAM
                    So s taking a little girl.

    A beat, then Charlie looks at Graham, nods approval.


      INT. FERRO S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

      Shea brings Frank into the room, places him on the edge of 
    the bed.  Shea then pulls up a chair.

                                  SHEA
                    Is there one more step we re 
                    missing here?  Something your 
                    brother may have told you that 
                    could help us?

      Frank doesn t say shit- just eye-fucksShea.

                                  SHEA (CONT D)
                    You re worried about incriminating 
                    yourself.  I get it - my whole bid, 
                    I never talked either.  But what 
                    you re doing now, I don t respect 
                    it.  Cause Tillman s got your 
                    brother and a young girl.  

                                  FRANK
                    Look, I m worried about  em too.  
                    But I don t know anything.

      Shea nods, then gets up, starts uncuffingFrank.

                                  SHEA 
                    I don t knock people around when 
                    they re cuffed.  That s for cowards 
                    and cops.

      Frank gets a quizzical look.  Did he say  knocked around? 

                                  SHEA (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  What do you know about 
                    August Tillman?

                                  FRANK
                    I seriously don t --

      Shea lands a RIGHT HOOK in Frank s ribcage-- HARD.  Frank 
      instinctively moves to counter-punch, but doesn t get very 
      far.  Shea s eyes lets him know Shea s a brawler.

                                  SHEA
                    Gonnado something?  Maybe?  No?

                                  FRANK
                    I want a lawyer.                                                                                      50.


                                  SHEA
                    I want a steak dinner ... doesn t 
                    mean I m gonnaget it.

      BAM- Shea hits Frank again.


      INT. FERRO S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

      Charlie, Graham, Lloyd and Philly at the table; the house 
      phone is in the center, on speaker.  A laptop displays a 
      profile image of the head wound to the female food service 
      worker from the teaser.  

                                  JULIANNE (OVER SPEAKER)
                    Amy Flynn - the food service worker 
                    Tillman attacked.


      INT. BREAKOUT KINGS - JULIANNE S OFFICE - SAME TIME

      Julianne looks at the same photo on a monitor.  INTERCUT AS 
      NEEDED BETWEEN JULIANNE AND FERRO S KITCHEN.

                                  JULIANNE
                    A side of the head injury - always 
                    looks bad because the skin s pulled 
                    tight over the skull there, but 
                    overall, non-serious.

      Another image pops up on the laptop.  It s a hospital intake 
      photo of Ferro, after the bank robbery.

                                  JULIANNE (OVER PHONE) (CONT D)
                    It s the same exact injury Kyle 
                    Ferro got at the bank.  

      FLASHBACK: 


      EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

      Tillman has beaten the male driver of the truck unconscious
      with a Maglightflashlight.  Tillman then walks over to the 
      female EMPLOYEE -- who we get a good look at for the first 
      time.  She s an attractive blonde in her late 20s.She 
      smiles at Tillman affectionately.  He kisses her, then --

                                  TILLMAN
                    Sorry, baby.

    He raises the flashlight and clocks her right over her ear --

      RESUME:

      Charlie leans toward the speaker.

                                  CHARLIE
                    You think she helped Tillman too?                                                                                    51.


                                  PHILLY
                          (realizing)
                    I bet she created a distraction so 
                    he could get under that truck.

      FLASHBACK: 


      EXT. PRISON REFUSE COLLECTION - DAY

      Tillman carries his trash bin, looking over at the food 
      service truck -- and behind it, where the two food service 
      employees talk to three guards.

      ANGLE:  The female EMPLOYEE is telling a story, in a 
      coquettish fashion that has clearly drawn the attention of 
    the three male guards and her male co-worker.  

    In the B.G.we see Tillman running for the truck as he 
      unfurls the license plate half-suit-of-armor.

      RESUME:

                                  CHARLIE
                    Where s this woman now?

                                  JULIANNE (O.S.)
                    Quit her job yesterday, citing 
                    stress from the attack.  Same 
                    excuse Ferro used.

      Shea emerges from the back bedroom.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Anything?

      Shea goes right for the freezer, takes out a bag of frozen 
      peas and places it on his right knuckles.

                                  SHEA
                    Not much: he was laundering money 
                    through the bar - we knew that; 
                    Tillman never divorced his wife; 
                    who cares; they all tried to screw  
                    Tillman over; knew that too --

                                  GRAHAM
                    Hold on.  His wife?  The chick from 
                    the bar fight that sent him to 
                    prison in the first place?
                          (offShea s nod)
                    Could that be the same woman from 
                    the food truck?

                                  CHARLIE
                    The wife got a restraining order 
                      andre-married.

      INT. FERRO S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Graham slaps a map of the northeast down on the table.

                                  SHEA
                    So like I said; French-Canadians 
                    are courteous and all, but they 
                    love to get high as much as the 
                    next guy.

                                  GRAHAM
                          (get to it already)
                    How dyou get product to Canada?

                                  SHEA
                    Alburg, Vermont. I d have my crew 
                    gas up -- then hit the back roads 
                    from there.  No border check.  

                                  PHILLY
                    Makes sense.  Tillman planned this 
                    down to a gnat s ass -- he s not
                    gonnarisk it all at the border.

                                  CHARLIE
                    It s a reach...                                                                                    53.


                                  SHEA
                    This guy did hard time-- I 
                    guarantee you he asked around the 
                    yard about the best way to cross 
                      undetected...
                          (taps the map)
                    ... and this is it.  

      Charlie looks over at Katrina -- still sobbing.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Shea s right.  Let s get in front 
                    of him.  We can get a helicopter 
                    from the Richmond field office and 
                    be in Vermont in a half hour.

                    he ll take everybody out if he has

                          (leans in)

      EXT. REST AREA - DAY

      CHYRON:  Alburg, Vermont

      Charlie and Graham s rental car is parked behind a roadside 
      diner.  They have a good view of the rest area.  Charlie 
      wraps up a phone call with his wife.

                                  CHARLIE (INTO PHONE) 
                    Okay.  Nah, just some meetings.  
                    Might be late. Okay.  Me too.  Bye.  

    He hangs up.

                                  LLOYD (O.S.)
                    Did you see a lot of action in the 
                    military, Charlie?

      Reveal Lloyd in the back, sipping the straw of a juice box.

                                  LLOYD (CONT'D)
                    I ask because there s an emotional 
                    impediment when you talk to your 
                    wife -- indicative, perhaps, of 
                    past trauma.

                                  GRAHAM
                    You want a presenttrauma?

                                  LLOYD
                    If he can t verbalize his feelings, 
                    he might try writing them down, 
                    letting her read it.  

      That resonates with Charlie-- then Graham snaps his fingers:

                                  GRAHAM
                    Here we go.

      Charlie turns to see a silver Taurus pull into the rest area.


      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

      Gwen exits the car, gives $20 to the attendant in the center 
      island.  She begins fueling the car.


      INT. TAURUS - SAME TIME

      Tillman s still in the back seat.  Alyssais next to him.  
      She s stopped crying, but is terrified.  Ferro turns back to 
    her from the driver s seat and forces a smile.

                                  FERRO
                    It s going to be okay, Alyssa.                                                                                    55.


                                  TILLMAN
                    Yeah, listen to Kyle.  If you can t 
                    trust him, who can you trust?

    A car pulls into the pump space in front of them.  Shea and 
      Philly exit the car.  Shea uses a credit card to pay at the 
      pump.  Philly-as- girlfriend  is irritated.

                                  PHILLY
                    I don t even know why we re going.

                                  SHEA
                          (as  boyfriend )
                    Then don t go.  That way I won t 
                    have to hear you pissand moan 
                    about it the whole time.  

                                  PHILLY
                    Fine.  I won t.  Jerk.
                          (offhis silence)
                    Know what?  You can hitch-hike.  

      Philly gets into the driver s seat and fires up the car.  

                                  SHEA
                    Baby...

                                  PHILLY
                    Screw you.

      Philly  mistakenly  puts it in drive.  The car lurches 
      forward and smacks into the Taurus.  Shea approaches Gwen...

                                  SHEA
                    Oh man, I m so sorry ...

      Tillman rolls the window down a bit and addresses Gwen.

                                  TILLMAN
                    Tell him no problem.  Let s go.

      BACK IN CHARLIE S CAR...

                                  CHARLIE
                    C mon, get him outtathat damn car.

      BACK TO SERVICE STATION... Gwen hangs the gas pump back up 
    and turns to Shea and smiles.

                                  GWEN
                    No problem.  

      Philly, aghast, is already out of the car.

                                  PHILLY
                    No no no.I feel terrible.  Do you 
                    want to exchange insurance info?  

      Ignoring her, Gwen moves to get into the passenger side.

      BACK IN CHARLIE S CAR...                                                                                    56.


                                  GRAHAM
                    She s getting in.  They re leaving.

      BACK TO SERVICE STATION...

                                  SHEA
                    At least let us give you some money.

                                  GWEN
                    No.  Do you understand English?

    As she turns back to the car, opens the door --

                                  SHEA
                    Fine.  Narrow-ass bitch.

      That s JUST the spark needed.  Tillman pops his door open and 
      moves -- wild-eyed pissed-- towards Shea --

                                  GWEN
                    Baby -- NO -- let it go.

                                  TILLMAN
                    What did you say to her?  

      Tillman REACHES FOR A GUNIN HIS WAISTBAND.  KA-CHUNK - The 
      sound of a car door slamming causes Tillman to turn to find 
      Graham and Charlie exiting their car.  Tillman realizes he s 
      seen Charlie before - in the newspaper article - he s the 
      U.S. Marshal.  This brief hesitation is all Shea needs; he 
      hits Tillman with a vicious right crossand they are 
      immediately fighting for their lives.  

    All the rest happens very quickly:

      -- Gwen gets out of the car brandishing a gun of her ownin 
      Shea s direction but a NOISE makes her turn to find...

    -- Graham RUNNING over top of the hood and LEAPING right into 
      Gwen - CRACK - he tackles her to the pavement while...

    -- Philly yanks open the car door and pulls out Alyssa, 
      running with her and Ferro across the lot to safety while...

    -  Tillman cracks Shea s head against the gas pump, dazing 
    him - as Tillman reaches for the gun in his waistband ... 
      CLICK - a gun is pressed against his head.  

      REVEAL: Charlie holding the gun.  Crisis averted.  Everyone 
      exhales, until Charlie raises the gun and cracks Tillman 
      against the face with it.  As the other Breakout Kings look 
    on in surprise...

                                  CHARLIE
                    You don t mess with someone s kid.

      Charlie cuffs Tillman, hauls him toward the car.  Graham 
      brings Gwen over as well.  Philly comforts Alyssa.Shea sits 
    up, moving his jaw around so it doesn t lock up.  Lloyd 
      approaches, slurping up the remnants of his juice box.                                                                                    57.


                                  LLOYD
                    Good use of past behavior analysis 
                    to predict subjective response.
                          (offShea s confused look)
                    It was smart to call Tillman s girl 
                    a bitch.  

                                  SHEA
                          (sarcastic)
                    Couldn t have done any of this 
                    without your help.

                                  LLOYD
                    What am I, G.I.Joe?  I m a 
                    thinker, not a fighter.

      With Tillman and Gwen cuffed and in the car, Charlie 
      approaches Graham.  A big exhale. Graham nods and smiles.  As 
      SIRENS are heard approaching O.S. -- WE BEGIN MONTAGE...


      EXT. HUDSON RIVER - BENCH - AFTERNOON

      Julianne sits by herself, watching a MAN walk his dog along 
    the river.  She takes a deep breath, stands, approaches.

                                  JULIANNE
                    Excuse me, do you have the time?

                    Yeah, it s 4:30.

      Julianne turns, moves back to the bench, sits, exhales.  
      CRANE UP AND BACK as she stands again and approaches a woman 
      leaning by a railing... Excuse me, do you have the time? ...

                    than myself today.

    And that s when we finally hear her voice for the first time.                                                                                    58.

      INT. MAYBELLE - WOMEN S WING - EVENING

      Philly, back in prison jumper, is in the Vocational Room, 
      clicking at a computer with a few cons scattered about.

    A few key strokes and an ad for a home in COSTA RICA appears.  
    She looks at it longingly, then looks around to make sure no 
    one is looking, then punches a few more keys.

      BANK OF DENMARK site appears.  She enters an Account Number.  
    Her balance: $1,345,876.34.  She leans back, smiles...


      INT. MAYBELLE - CELL - EVENING

      Shea s alone in a decent-sized cell.  He sits on the bed, 
      contemplating the recent change in his life.  He takes a 
      piece of paper, a stubby pencil, and jots something down.  

    He sticks it to the wall, lies on the bed, stares at it.  
      PUSH IN on the paper; it reads: MONTHS EARNED: 1.


      INT. CHARLIE S CAR - AFTERNOON

      Charlie pulls the car to the curb.  Graham glumly looks out 
    his window at a beat-up, aluminum sided QUEENS ROW HOUSE.  A 
      beat of contemplation.  Then --

                                  GRAHAM
                    You never asked why.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Figured you d tell me when you 
                    wanted to.

      Graham shakes his head slowly, then...

                                  GRAHAM
                    Your daughter turns 16 once, and 
                    when her stepdadtells her he ll
                    get her the car  cause I can t 
                    afford it...  I ve taken bullets 
                      that vefelt better.  
                          (turnsto Charlie)
                    How many busts veI done?   

                                  CHARLIE
                    More than most.

                                  GRAHAM
                    And how many times have I seen cops 
                      five-fingering their way  round 
                    some perp s place?

                                  GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    But I never put my hand in the 
                    cookie jar.  Never.  
                          (beat)
                    The one time I do, I take exactly 
                    eight thousand, two hundred, fifty 
                    bucks.  Not a penny more than what 
                    the car cost.  Now I m a scumbag
                    con like the rest of  em.

                                  CHARLIE
                    At least you re at a half-way 
                    house.  You could be at Maybelle.

      Graham nods, looks back to Charlie.

                                  GRAHAM
                    I guess everybody s running from 
                    something, right?

    He opens the door, moves to get out; Charlie stops him with:

                                  CHARLIE
                    You still get to go after the bad 
                    guys, Graham.  

      Graham takes this in a 1/2 beat...

                                  GRAHAM
                    I know.

      Graham exits the car, turns back, tosses a piece of paper 
      onto the passenger seat.

                                  GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    And I gotta admit...  

      Charlie looks at the paper - it s Shea s Breakout Kingslogo.  

                                  GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    ...it grows on you.  
                          (beat)
                    See you at work tomorrow, Charlie.

      Graham closes the door.  Charlie looks up from the paper to 
      watch Graham step to the row house where a man in a cheap 
      sports coat/tie combo waits for him.  Next to the man is a 
      sign that reads: QUEENS COUNTY HALF-WAY HOUSE.  

      HIGH AND WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT: As Graham outstretches his arms 
    and gets patted down by the counselor, like any common 
      convict, Charlie drives off toward the 59th Street Bridge.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                  THE END
