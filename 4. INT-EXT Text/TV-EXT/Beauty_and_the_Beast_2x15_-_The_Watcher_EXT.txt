                                CATHY

        Get off the balcony.

                                VINCENT

        What s wrong?

                                CATHY

        Someone s watching. Go!

Vincent, immediately alert, steps back into the shadows, his eyes darting
across the cityscape.

                                CATHY
        I ll meet you downstairs.

He doesn t move.

                                CATHY
        Vincent, please go!

Their eyes lock. Finally he moves to exit. Cathy watches for a split second
then heads back into her apartment.
GO WITH CATHY.                                                                          5.

Cathy and Jenny are seated at a table, in mid-conversation.
Jenny keeps stalling on telling about her bad dream.
Cathy s interest is piqued, but deep down she s also a
 little afraid.

                                CATHY
          You were asleep. You were
            dreaming. And you saw...?

                                JENNY
          ...I feel like I m putting a curse
          on you.

                                CATHY
          I m going to throw something on
          you if you don t tell me about
          this dream.

Jenny still hesitates, thinking  this is serious... 

                                CATHY
          Come on, not all of your bad
            dreams come true.
                  (a beat)
          Like the polka-dotted guys from
            Mars? That hasn t happened yet.

                                JENNY
                  (a warm smile)
          You remember that?

CONTINUED:

                                CATHY
            Yeah. Come on, what was this one?

Finally, a deep breath...

                                JENNY
            Okay. It was one of those weird,
            quick, flash dreams. You were---
              I don t know where you were --
            you were somewhere, and all of
              a sudden, the lights went out,
            and you were in the dark, and you
            wanted to move but you couldn t,
            and there was this--- this hand,
            but it wasn t connected to anything,
            and it was trying to touch you.

                                CATHY
              Uh-huh...

                                JENNY
            You tried to scream, but you
              couldn t.

                                CATHY
            Okay, wait, wait -- see right
            there -- that s not going to
              happen. A severed hand s coming
            at me, I m gonna scream.
            Guaranteed -- I will scream.
            So what happened next?

                                JENNY
            Well, then I see you running --
            you know how dreams are, they
a don t make sense -- so now you re
            running---

                                CATHY
                    (without a smile)
            Is the hand still after me?

                                JENNY
                  (genuinely although
                  subtly trying to warn
                  Cathy)
            I don t know, Cath, but listen, you re running.
            I don t know if you were running from someone,
            or maybe to someone... I don t know.
            But you can t catch your breath... you can t breathe.

          And then what?

A beat. Jenny edits.

                                JENNY
          And then I woke up. And I guess
          I needed to hear the sound of your
            voice, so I called you.

Cathy can t help but think of the Watcher. Of f her look...

                                JENNY
          What?

                                CATHY
                (still absorbed)
          ...It s just so weird that you
          have these things...

                                JENNY
          Why?

                                CATHY
          About a minute after you called,
          I got another call from some guy.

                                JENNY
          Who?

                                CATHY
          I don t know -- I don t know him,
          but he said something that scared me.

                                JENNY

          What did he say?

                                CATHY
          It s not important. But if I ever
          find out who he is, I m going to strangle him,
          and that ll be the end of your dream.

Jenny has reacted to the word  strangle  with wide-eyed alarm.

                                JENNY
          Oh, my god, I can t believe you
          said that.

                                CATHY
          Why?

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                          14.

                                JENNY
        Because that s what I saw. You
        couldn t breathe because something
        was around your neck. You were
        trying to pull it off, but you couldn t.
        You were being strangled.
                (a beat)
        You died Cathy.

His head hidden by his hood, Vincent casts an ominous dark figure against
the backdrop of city lights. He is surveying the buildings across the park
with an antique brass telescope when he turns at the sound of SOMEONE
APPROACHING via the stairwell. The door CREAKS as it opens.

CATHY

emerges from the stairwell which is located so Vincent cannot immediately
see her. She takes a moment to steel herself, to psyche herself into an
act...she hopes.

ANOTHER ANGLE -

Cathy comes up alongside Vincent.

                          VINCENT
            What s happened today?

                          CATHY
          Nothing.

Vincent looks at her.

                          VINCENT
          What happened?

                          CATHY
          I got paranoid, but I m fine now.

          ...He sent me flowers.

                          VINCENT
                    (having felt her panic)
          It was more than just flowers.

                          CATHY
          But I handled it. Alone.
          He knows about you, Vincent.
          Until we find out what he wants,
          you have to stay away.

Vincent looks at Cathy, finally walks away...

                          VINCENT
          He wants you.

Cathy comes up to him.

                          CATHY
          What can I say -- or do -- to
          convince you?

                          VINCENT
            Catherine, I feel your fear. How
          can I leave you alone with that?

                          CATHY
          Because I can handle fear, Vincent
          -- but if something were to happen to you...

A beat.

                          VINCENT
          Stay below tonight.

                          CATHY
          I m not going to let him do that
          to me. And it gets us nowhere.

Momentarily, Vincent walks away, his eyes back on the cityscape. As Cathy

The passenger side s door is open, the Watcher carrying Cathy, semi-
conscious, towards the rear of the car. The trunk is already open, the
Watcher apparently going to put Cathy inside.

                        WATCHER
        I like it here. I used to play here.
        Now you ll be here, and I ll come visit you.

The Watcher looks at her, wanting desperately to kiss her...but ultimately he
doesn t have the courage. Infuriated, repulsed by his own gutlessness, he
slams the trunk down.

We hear SOMETHING MOVING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE BRUSH. Suddenly Vincent comes
up, his face FILLING THE FRAME, his arm grabbing a tree trunk, half to stop
his forward motion, half for support. His breathing is labored, his concern
for Catherine overpowering. We see in his eyes he can feel her slipping
away...the signal of her heartlight growing weaker...almost disorienting
him...

ON THE TREES AND UNDERBRUSH

as WE HEAR SOMEONE COMING THROUGH THEM. Suddenly the Watcher COMES INTO
FRAME. He stops abruptly, seeing...

VINCENT.

Vincent is still down, on one knee, his head lowered. He looks up, an
immediate recognition. The Watcher grins at him. Triumphant.

                        WATCHER
        Too late.

Vincent starts to rise, the thirst for blood in his eyes. The Watcher sees
what s coming, doesn t move, at some level feeling a destiny tonight. Vincent
annihilates the Watcher.

Vincent turns from the carnage, walks away, desolate, in the direction the
Watcher came from...in the direction Vincent last felt Catherine. Going for
her body. Tears tumble down his cheeks.

The light on Cathy s face is gradually becoming whiter, softer, warmer as she
moves towards it.

CATHY S POV - SILHOUETTES IN THE DISTANCE

The Man and Woman are being joined by other also vague, unrecognizable
SILHOUETTES. The Woman drops the Man s hand and holds out her arms to Cathy,
waiting...

Cathy s smile deepens, her eyes tearing.

                                                      CUT TO:



Vincent is finishing ripping the TRUNK LID off, is reaching into the icy
water...

We see Cathy is drawing close now to the Silhouettes in the Light, the
Woman waiting with open arms. Suddenly from the dark Nowhere, Vincent
appears behind Cathy, scoops her up, into his arms, taking her away from
the Light.

...as Vincent brings Cathy back to Life at the water s edge.


START TIGHT ON THE TWO OF THEM.

Vincent has wrapped Cathy in his cloak. He pulls it over her bare
shoulder, drawing it tighter around her. He holds Cathy in his lap, her
face nestled into his neck, her eyes closed, her body drained, weary.

                        VINCENT
                  (as he draws the
                  cloak tighter)
            Catherine...

                        CATHY
                  (her eyes not opening)
          ...I love you...

Vincent pulls her even tighter against him, his body warming hers.

a SLOW DISSOLVE TO:




The night is alive with activity. Three patrol cars throw red light
everywhere; POLICE RADIOS SQUAWK, filling the air with disembodied voices.
A TOW TRUCK slowly pulls Cathy s car from the lake. The CHOPPER has just
landed, its rotors still thwacking, whipping the air. Joe jumps to the
ground, runs out from under the blades to the first available TROOPER. We
hear snippets of nearby TROOPER CONVERSATIONS as Joe approaches and
passes:


                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                          so.

                        TROOPER DAN
                (just returning from
                mauling, approaching
                TROOPER PAUL)
        Paul, did you ask her about the
        driver s license?

                        TROOPER PAUL
        She said the address would be somewhere
        across the park from her. What happened to him?

                        TROOPER DAN
                (never seen a man
                ripped up like that)
        I don t know...

Joe catches attention of TROOPER FRED.

                      JOE
        Where s Cathy Chandler?

                        TROOPER FRED
                (filling out a report)
        Over there.

Trooper Fred indicates one of the patrol cars. FOLLOW JOE over to find Cathy
in the backseat, still wrapped in Vincent s cloak but now wearing someone s
grey sweats too. Another TROOPER (RAY) is trying to question her.

                        TROOPER RAY
        You don t remember how you got
        out of the trunk?

Cathy shakes her head, still exhausted, holding a steaming cup in her hand.

                      CATHY
        ...No...

                      JOE
                (rushing up)
        Cathy! Are you okay?

Cathys nods.

                      JOE
        Are you sure?

Cathy nods.

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                          51.

                        CATHY
        Can you take me home?

He takes the cup from her hand, helping her out of the car.

                      JOE
        Sure.
                (to Trooper Ray)
        You can reach her through Mike
        Cohen at the New York Thirty-
        third.

                        TROOPER RAY
                (making a note)
        New York Thirty-third.

As Joe and Cathy move towards the chopper, she pulls the cloak tighter around
her, her security blanket.

                      JOE
                (re: cloak)
        What is this?

                        CATHY
        Someone gave it to me to keep
        warm.
