NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES
Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.
CUT TO:
Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the
road. As we drift closer to the car...
CUT TO:
FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.
CUT TO:
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.
DISSOLVE TO:
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.
DISSOLVE TO:
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
DISSOLVE TO:
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
DISSOLVE TO:
As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
MULHOLLAND DRIVE
- NIGHT
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
You feel it?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
Yeah.
They continue to stare.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along
the shoulder ... man up the road said he
saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
that blind corner.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
The boys found this on the floor in back
of the Caddy.
Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
Yeah, they showed me
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
Could be unrelated.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin'
pearl earrings?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.
CUT TO:
The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.
They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.
CUT TO:
Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
DAN
Around here.
Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
CLOSER ON DAN
Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
HERB
Dan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.
HERB (cont'd)
My God!
DISSOLVE TO:
LAX AIRPORT - DAY
The airport sits in blinding sunlight and veiled with smog.
A big jet lands.
CUT TO:
The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
OLD LADY
It's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
been so nice travelling with you.
BETTY
Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and
nervous. It was sure great to have you
to talk to.
IRENE
Now, remember I'll be watching for you on
the big screen.
BETTY
(smiling)
Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.
IRENE
The best of luck to you, Betty. Take
care of yourself and be careful.
BETTY
Okay I will. Thanks again.
Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
CAB DRIVER
Where to?
BETTY
(smiling excitedly)
1612 Havenhurst.
CAB DRIVER
Got it!
They get into the cab and close their doors. The cab pulls
away.
CUT TO:
Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
CUT TO:
The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.
An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
MANAGER
Hi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.
BETTY
I am, Mrs. Lanois. It is Mrs. Lanois
isn't it?
MRS. LANOIS
In all my living glory, baby.
BETTY
Pleased to meet you.
MRS. LANOIS
You can call me Coco ... everybody does.
Stay there, I'll get the key.
BETTY
Okay, Coco.
Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
COCO
I guess it was your grandfather, was
it ... he called me to check in, said you
were on your way and for you to call when
you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
BETTY
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
COCO
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood
these days too.
BETTY
Well, I ...
COCO
You don't have to tell me. It's written
all over that pretty face of yours.. You
came here to be an actress. I just hope
you'll remember there's never been a
great poem called "tits and ass."
BETTY
I...
COCO
You probably don't remember her, but
Louise Bonner lives right over there in
number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs
a damn good acting class.
BETTY
Have many famous actors and actresses
lived here? I was meaning to ask you
that.
COCO
Honey, all the great ones came through
here at one time or another.
A haunting music begins to swell.
COCO (cont'd)
People say in the springtime when the
wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
can still feel the presence of everyone
of them.
BETTY
I guess I've come to quite a place.
COCO
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of
it.
The music fades.
Coco looks down suddenly. On the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
COCO (cont'd)
(yelling up)
WILKINS! ... (no answer) ... THAT DOG CRAPS
ONCE MORE OUT HERE AND I'LL BAKE HIS
BUTT FOR BREAKFAST!!
Coco turns back to Betty.
COCO (cont'd)
You don't have pets do you?
BETTY
No, I don't.
COCO
That's good. They're allowed, but I
don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
One man used to live here that had a
prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't
believe what that kangaroo did to this
courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's
apartment ... it's a good one.
BETTY
I can hardly wait, Coco.
CUT TO:
The street level of the office building is filthy and houses
stores selling racks of cheap toys. Up above we see office
windows and a big sign saying "Office Space For Rent" along
with a telephone number to call. We drift in toward one of
the windows on the sixth floor.
CUT TO:
Before us is a huge modern office building of glass and
steel. Two men in dark suits have exited a large limousine
and are walking up into the building. We drift up the facade,
higher and higher moving in toward the top of the building.
DISSOLVE TO:
Betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. She takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
She sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
Across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. She drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
Some birds fly by overhead. She takes another sip of coffee.
The blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. The phone inside rings. Betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. She crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
BETTY (cont'd)
Hello ... Aunt Ruth!! I can't tell you how
happy I am. Your place is so fantastic!
Yes ... Coco...what a character. I really
like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
airport must not be too fun. What's a
mosquito plane? ... Oh I get it. How long
does that take from Montreal? ... Well,
you'll sleep good tonight ... Hudson Bay
sounds beautiful ...oh well, I hope you
packed your coat. (laughs). You mean
the audition...Wally Brown... she didn't
mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
Coco? Suddenly I'm so nervous ... okay
Aunt Ruth... I'll try. I'll study those
lines until I know them inside out.
Yes, either right here on this fabulous
leather couch or I'll take them with a
coffee in the courtyard like a regular
movie star. (laughs). Oh! I got a real
shock to find your friend Rita here. She
was in the shower and I opened the
door ... Rita ... what do you mean? She was
in an accident ... your friend Rita. No,
Coco unlocked the door. No, she didn't
see her. She's sleeping. No... she's
very nice. I'm sure there's some
explanation, Aunt Ruth... I don't think we
have to do that. Please don't worry.
I'll take care of it. No, I'll let you
know. Where can I ... okay I'll get it
from Coco.
No, please don't worry... thank you so
much for letting me stay here. You've
made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
Please don't worry... Aunt Ruth we don't
need the police. I'll call you when you
get to Hudson Bay. Please...
please ... Goodbye Aunt Ruth.
Betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. She sits for a
moment listening. Silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. As she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. Rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. Betty goes into the bedroom. Rita looks up
at her with desperation.
BETTY (cont'd)
You're awake... I think I misunderstood
you. I thought you knew my Aunt and
that's why you were here. I just talked
to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
to call the police.
Rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
BETTY (cont'd)
Rita?
RITA
(crying harder)
I'm... sorry. I ...
Betty's heart softens.
BETTY
What is it Rita?
RITA
(still sobbing)
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke
up... I thought sleep would do it ...
Betty kneels down in front of her.
BETTY
What's wrong?
RITA
(crying)
I don't know who I am.
BETTY
What do you mean? You're Rita.
RITA
(crying)
I'm not. I don't know what my name is.
I don't know who I am!!
Betty looks down at the purse next to Rita's dress. She picks
it up and hands it to Rita.
BETTY
This is your purse. Your name must be in
your purse.
Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. She hesitates.
Something is worrying her. She looks at Betty for help.
BETTY (cont'd)
You want to know don't you?
RITA
I ... yes, but ... I ...
BETTY
Open it!
Rita slowly unzips the purse. The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.
Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)
CUT TO:
INTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Ray crosses a carpeted closed area. He mounts a flight of
stairs. At the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. Ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. At the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. Again Ray punches in a code. The elevator opens and
Ray goes in. The elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. Ray waits. Finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Who is it please?
RAY
Raymond Harris ... 20743.
The elevator begins to move up. When it stops, the door opens
and Ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful Italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
RECEPTIONIST
(very quietly)
You may go right in, Ray.
Ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. The
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. Heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
Ray enters and the doors close behind him. Ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
RAY
Good afternoon Mr. Roque. (pronounced
Rowk).
Mr. Roque stares at Ray silently.
RAY (cont'd)
Do you want him replaced?
Mr. Roque continues to stare.
RAY
I know they said...
MR. ROQUE
Then?
RAY
Then... I guess it's so .... alright, but
that means we should ...
MR. ROQUE
Yes?
RAY
Shut everything down ... Is that something
that...do you want us to shut everything
down?
Silence. Ray doesn't know what to do. He struggles to
interpret Mr. Roque's silence. He waits. Mr. Roque does
nothing but stare.
RAY (cont'd)
Then we'll shut everything down.
Silence.
Ray turns. The doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. The doors close.
CUT TO:
EXTERIOR - OFFICE BUILDING - CENTURY CITY
Vincenzo and Luigi are staring silently and without
expression at the broken windshield of the limousine. The
limousine driver suddenly starts signaling to a car entering
the driveway to the building. He turns to the Castigliane
brothers.
LIMO DRIVER
The other car is here sirs. Please allow
me.
The limo driver opens the rear door of the new limo, then
hurries around and opens the other rear door. The new driver
gets out of the car.
LIMO DRIVER (cont'd)
Here's the key to the car. Take it
straight to the garage. They're waiting
for you.
The limo driver closes both back doors after the Castigliane
brothers are seated within. He then gets in himself and
maneuvers the big limo out into traffic.

PINK'S CHILI DOGS - DAY
Two guys, JOE ( the guy who killed Ed in the sixth floor
office) and BILLY another unkept, rocker type delivery man
are standing waiting for their chili dogs with a girl, LANEY,
who could be very good looking but she seems to be in poor
health. Her hair is long and stringy. She's wearing a
tight, short sleeve blue sweater, black jeans and boots.
BILLY
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
JOE
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine.
They're all real happy.
BILLY
My next delivery is up that way, so I'll
be getting down to it real soon.
JOE
You're so easy.
BILLY
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
JOE
Yeah, what for?
BILLY
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's
all.
The chili dogs arrive and they pay for them.
BILLY (cont'd)
Can we eat in the van?
JOE
What's
the matter now?
BILLY
Nothing... I don't like being out in the
open like this.
JOE
It must be just so pathetic being you.
Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in
the van.
The three make their way to the van. Joe looks over at
Laney.
JOE (cont'd)
You sure you don't want anything?
LANEY
(hesitantly)
Not here...no thanks.
JOE
Not a coke or anything?
LANEY
No ... thanks though... I'll take a
cigarette if you have one.
JOE
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
As Laney is getting her cigarette and lighting it..
JOE (cont'd)
Any new girls on the street these days?
LANEY
(taking her first big drag)
No.
I haven't seen any.
JOE
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
LANEY
No...
JOE
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't

LANEY
Sure.
Joe spanks her butt as she gets in the van.

I wonder where you were going.
Betty's question hangs in the air. Slowly we move close to
Rita who is on the verge of remembering something.
Suddenly -
RITA
Mulholland Drive.
BETTY
Mulholland Drive?
RITA
That's where I was going... Mulholland
Drive.
BETTY
Maybe that's where the accident was.
There must be a police report. We could
call.
RITA
No.... I don't...
BETTY
We could call anonymously from a pay
phone... just to see if there was an
accident.
Rita sits worrying.
BETTY (cont'd)
Come on. It'll be just like in the
movies. We'll pretend to be someone
else. I want to walk around anyway. I'm
in Hollywood and I haven't even seen any
of it. Come on Rita. Do you feel up to

RITA
Okay... but just...just to see.

Okay.

She's kind of a frumpy woman detective in
British movies.
Rita laughs along with Betty. Betty goes back in the closet.
BETTY (cont'd)

She brings out a pair of khaki pants.
BETTY (cont'd)
Try these on. You can wear one of my T-

Adam pulls into his driveway, but is blocked from entering
the garage by a poolman's truck. He gets out of the car and
looks at the truck - sees the insignia on the door which is a
blue square with the word "Gene" above and the word "Clean"
below. Adam hears steps behind him and turns. A JAPANESE
GARDENER is coming toward him smiling and bowing.
JAPANESE GARDENER
Ah, Mister ... you remember me. I am Taka.
your gardener. For long time I not see
you. I pleased to see you.
Taka reaches out his hand and Adam shakes it.
ADAM
Hello Taka. It's 'cause I'm never home
in the day time. It's good to see you
again. The garden looks great.
Taka bows, smiling and nodding, and goes back to work. Adam
heads toward the front door of his house.
CUT TO:
All dressed now Betty and Rita leave Aunt Ruth's apartment
and walk across the courtyard past Coco's apartment and out
through the iron gates. No one is about.
CUT TO:
Betty and Rita walk along. Birds are chirping in the trees
which line both sides of the street. Betty is smiling and
once again looking around at everything. Her good mood and
excitement about life lifts Rita's spirits.
Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.
After they pass each other Betty turns back and sees the boy
and the woman enter 1612 Havenhurst. Betty and Rita continue
up the street.

The girls walk along the busy boulevard, past guitar shops,
video stores. Betty is looking for a payphone. Rita's eyes

frightened.

PAYPHONE ON RED BRICK WALL - DAY
We see the red brick building. It is Denny's. Betty and
Rita are walking to the payphone. Betty digs out some change
from her purse. She picks up the receiver, drops in a
quarter and dials the "0" for Operator. An Operator answers.
BETTY
Hollywood Police Department please.
OPERATOR
Is this an emergency?
BETTY
No, no, I just want the number.
OPERATOR
Hold for the number.
Betty gets the number for the Hollywood Police Station, re-

SERGEANT BAXTER
Traffic. Sergeant Baxter speaking.
BETTY
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a
sound last night that sounded like a car
crash and I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.
SERGEANT BAXTER
Yes, there was.
BETTY
Can you tell me what happened?
SERGEANT BAXTER
No. I can't.
BETTY
Was anyone hurt?
SERGEANT BAXTER
May I have your name please?
Betty hangs up. She turns to Rita smiling like a girl who's
done something bad and gotten away with it.
BETTY
There was an accident. He wouldn't tell
me anything else, but that was your
accident Rita. I just know it was.
Maybe there's something about it in the
papers. Come on I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.
Betty and Rita enter Denny's.
CUT TO:
Betty and Rita are walking back to the apartment. We see
them from a distance. They are talking and gesturing in an
excited and animated way. Just after they enter through the
iron gates of 1612 Havenhurst and are out of sight we notice
a car moving slowly up Havenhurst toward us. We notice two
men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for
something.

Taka is bowing and smiling and nodding to someone we don't

TAKA'S POV - A man, KENNY, in a sharp black suit is walking
down the driveway past Gene the Poolman's truck to the front
door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo

Kenny knocks on Adam's front door. Lorraine answers.
Lorraine's hands are covered with pink paint. Pink paint is

Gene comes out of the kitchen fast, his hands covered with
pink paint.
GENE
I guess you don't understand English.
She asked to leave. Here's the door.
Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door.
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.
And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor. Finishing his work with
the vintage golf clubs - Kenny leaves.
CUT TO:
Kenny jumps into the front seat of the limo. Vincenzo and
Luigi nod to the driver and they take off.
Taka hoes some weeds beneath a Jacaranda.
CUT TO:
L.A. AERIAL SHOT HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
Night descends on Los Angeles. Millions of lights down below
twinkle like stars.
CUT TO:
We see the courtyard at night. Some of the apartment windows
have dim, warm lights. Most all is in darkness. The only
sound is the water flowing in the fountain with muted distant
traffic. Far away a siren wails softly.
CUT TO:
An older, beautiful woman - drunk, is walking slowly -
strangely toward the door of Aunt Ruth's apartment.
CUT TO:
The woman moves up to the door we see her face. Her eyes have
the eerie look of one possessed. She knocks mechanically on
the door.
CUT TO:
Establish
Adam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon.
We see the rays of the rising sun falling on the huge letters
of the HOLLYWOOD SIGN and the hills surrounding it.
CUT TO:
The screen door slams. Coco and Betty face each other close,
out of earshot of Rita.
COCO
Your Aunt called me.
BETTY
I was afraid of that.
COCO
She wants to know who's staying in her
apartment.
BETTY
(slowly, deliberately)
It's just for a night or two, until she
finds her own place. I tried to explain
that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was
bad and her plane was leaving and she got
it all mixed up. I kept telling her it
was my friend and she kept saying she
didn't know any Ritas ...
COCO
Sweetie, look at me straight.
Betty lifts her eyes to Coco's. Direct, clear.
BETTY
Coco...she's very nice. We went to
school together.
COCO
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know
her.
BETTY
Not really. I met her in junior college
and she was from this other town.
Coco looks hard into Betty's innocent face.
BETTY (cont'd)
You can call my grandparents ... I'm sure
they'd tell you that I don't lie and I
sure wouldn't allow a stranger to invade
my Aunt Ruth's apartment.
COCO
Honey... I was married to a director for
thirty years. He had an uncanny ability
to read people. Maybe some of it rubbed
off on me or maybe I had it all
along ... you're a good kid... What you're
telling me is a load of horse - pucky but
it comes from a good place. I'll trust
you to sort this out. Now I'm not going
against Ruth. She's got enough to worry
about up there in Canada. If she asks-
I'm going to say everything is okay, and
you make sure it is.
(Coco places her hand on
Betty's shoulder and squeezes
it)
If you need any help you know where to
find me.
Betty puts her hand on Coco's shoulder and gives her a
squeeze.
BETTY
You're really something Coco...thank you.
COCO
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise
Bonner says there's trouble in there.
You remember last night. Sometimes she's
wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid
of it.
Coco turns and walks away. Betty studies her and thinks
about what she said before turning and going back inside.
CUT TO:
COURTYARD 1612 HAVENHURST - DAY
Betty is coming out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. She calls
back in to Rita.
BETTY
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.
Don't drink all the coke.
(we hear laughter from inside
and Rita call out.)
RITA
Good luck!
BETTY
When I get back I'll have the cab
waiting, so be ready to go.
RITA
Okay.
Betty closes the door and heads across the courtyard. She
knocks on Coco's door and in a moment Coco answers.
BETTY
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
COCO
It's all right gorgeous. Something
wrong?
BETTY
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition.
Before I go I wanted to ask you if you
could remember the man's name ... Aunt
Ruthie's friend who helped put this
together. It completely went out of my
mind.
COCO
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy.
Been in the business since forever.
BETTY
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
COCO
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give
him a good performance and he'll be happy
and I've got a feeling you'll do just
that.
BETTY
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
COCO
Get going. You don't want to be late.
BETTY
Right. See ya.
COCO
Good luck, honey!
Betty takes off through the iron gates and Coco smiles as she
watches her go.
CUT TO:
The cab pulls up to the gate. Betty pays the driver and gets
out. She-stands for a moment staring at a dream.
She walks through the gate and as she goes is stopped by a
PARAMOUNT GUARD.
PARAMOUNT GUARD
And where do we think we're going, Miss?
Betty stops and turns.
BETTY
To my audition.
PARAMOUNT GUARD
And who are we auditioning for today?
BETTY
Wally Brown.
PARAMOUNT GUARD
And do we know which of the fifty-seven
buildings Wally Brown is in?
BETTY
(smiling)
No, we don't.
PARAMOUNT GUARD
Well, now we've got to figure that out
first don't we?
BETTY
Yes, Sir.
PARAMOUNT GUARD
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive
Building on the second floor. We want to
go in and turn right at the first street.
Then we want to walk three blocks down
past Stage 17 to the white Executive
Building. Once we're on the second floor
the receptionist will take us from there.
Now do we have name?
BETTY
Betty Elms.
PARAMOUNT GUARD
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty
Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good
luck Miss. Elms.
BETTY
Thank you... thank you very much.
CUT TO:
1612 HAVENHURST - STREET - DAY
Chris Isaak song "Except The New Girl" continues.
An idling cab sits waiting with back door open.
CUT TO:
COURTYARD - 1612 HAVENHURST DAY
Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
BETTY
C'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.
CORNELL DUMONT
Hey!
Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
CORNELL DUMONT (cont'd)
Hey, how's Sol?
BETTY
Sol?
CORNELL DUMONT
No ... not you...
(to Rita)
I'm sorry... I forget your name.
RITA
(almost inaudible)
Rita.
CORNELL DUMONT
Yeah. Well, I haven't seen Sol lately.
Tell him to come by the club.
Rita nods ... biting her lip. Cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
BETTY
And what's your name?
CORNELL DUMONT
(big smile)
Cornell Dumont.
He begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
BETTY
(whispering)
Ask him who Sol is ...
Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
BETTY (cont'd)
Maybe he could help...
Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab. They
get in and the cab pulls away.
CUT TO:
Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
BETTY
Selwyn ... number 12.
They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
BETTY (cont'd)
It's this way.
They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
Both girls dive for the bushes.
The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
BETTY (cont'd)
(panting whisper)
Now, you've got me scared.
Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
BETTY (cont'd)
See, I told you there was nothing to be
afraid of!
They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
RITA
Oh no ... don't.
Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
RITA (cont'd)
No one's ...
Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Yes?
BETTY
Diane?
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Number 17.
BETTY
But it said #12.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
I switched apartments with her. She's in
#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
to the right.
The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
It's kind of hidden by the foliage.
Betty and Rita start to leave.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
She hasn't been around for a few days ...
BETTY
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
(starting toward them)
I'll go with you. She's still got some of
my stuff.
The phone rings from inside her bungalow.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
(turning back)
Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.
The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
BETTY
I guess you're not Diane.
Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
BETTY (cont'd)
Still not home I guess.
The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.
RITA
I don't think...
BETTY
(looking around for anyone
watching)
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front
door.
RITA
No.
Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
BETTY
PUSH!!!
Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
BETTY (cont'd)
Meet you at the door.
Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
BETTY (cont'd)
I don't know if you want to come in here
or not. There's some kind of horrible
smell like... something...
Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.
CUT TO:
The Middle-Aged Woman is just shutting the door to her
bungalow. She walks quickly in the direction of Bungalow
#17.
CUT TO:
The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.
Sounds, churning music.
CUT TO:
DARK
We move off the door of Aunt Ruth's apartment and crane
slowly up to the apartment above hers - WILKINS - the one
with the wayward dog. We move closer to Wilkins' apartment
and as we move in we hear a phone ringing.
DISSOLVE TO:
COURTYARD -
NIGHT
The girls come out the front door ... Betty leading and pulling
a much happier Rita along with her. They half run across the
courtyard to stone steps under an Ivy covered eave.
CUT TO:
The girls race up the stone steps toward us. Soon their wind-
blown, smiling faces fill the screen as they look out. There
before them are the lights of Hollywood with silhouetted
palms, slow-moving theater kleig lights, and floating above
it all the giant sign in the hills reading HOLLYWOOD.
BETTY
Here I am Hollywood! My name's Betty.
A pause.
BETTY (cont'd)
(to Rita)
Say it!
RITA
Here I am Hollywood! My name is ... Rita.
They look out, maybe waiting for an answer blowing in the
Santa Ana wind.
CUT TO:
We drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the
wall until we come to the corner. Slowly we round the corner
and move to a dark alley. There amongst the dumpsters and
trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer
to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move
closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is
black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.
