                           MEET JANE 
                                       


                            ACT ONE



  FADE IN:


  INT. ND LOCATION - DAY

  EXTREME CLOSE UP.  Dark sunglasses.  On an average face. 

  Meet JANE BILINSKI (40s).  

  Jane lounges on a LAWN CHAIR, stealing a moment alone.  Until 
  she feels someone s glare.  

  Jane OPENS HER EYES, slides the shades down her nose.  A 
  small white tag dangles from the frame.

  Jane finds a little boy, JIMMY (5), standing over her.  
  Staring.  Digging his finger far deeper up his nostril than 
  anyone ever should.  

  Jane stares back at him.

                              JANE
                What?

                              JIMMY
                What are you doing?

                              JANE
                Resting.

                              JIMMY
                Well, I wanna sit there.

                              JANE
                Well, you can t.

                              JIMMY
                Why not?

                              JANE
                Because I m already here.

  We PULL BACK to reveal we re not at a resort.  Or by a pool 
  for that matter.  

  We re in the OUTDOOR LIVING DEPARTMENT of WALMART.                                                                                    2.



  Jane lazes amidst the PATIO FURNITURE displayed on the floor.  

  Then, over the speaker system...  

                              WALMART EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                Price check, register four.  Price 
                check, register four.

  Jimmy scrunches his face.  It turns red.  Like he s about to 
  cry.

                              JANE
                Oh, come on.  Don t look at me like 
                that.  There are other chairs.

                              JIMMY
                But I want that one.

                              JANE
                Where s your mother?

                              JIMMY
                Rehab.

                              JANE
                Okay.  Where s your father?

  Little Jimmy cranes his neck.  Jane follows Jimmy s eye-line 
  to what appears to be JIMMY S FATHER.  

  Flirting with a WOMAN in the BEDDING DEPARTMENT. 

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Well, I m sure he s looking for 
                you.

  But Jimmy doesn t believe that any more than we do.  He just 
  shoots DAGGERS at Jane.  And pouts.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Five more minutes.  Then the chair 
                is yours.

  Jane lays back again.  Adjusts the sunglasses on her face.  
  Closes her eyes.  But she can feel the little fucker s eyes 
  still on her.  She can t relax like this.  Sits back up.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Fine.  

  Jane pulls her BLUE WALMART VEST from under the lawn chair.                                                                                    3.



                              JANE (CONT D)
                My break was about over anyway.



  Jane puts the vest back on.  Gets up.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Your throne awaits.  


  INT. WALMART - FRONT ENTRANCE - LATER

  Jane greets CUSTOMERS.  With a forced enthusiasm.  As folks 
  come and go...  

                              JANE
                Welcome to Walmart.  
                      (to another)
                Thanks for shopping with us.

  Jane looks out into the PARKING LOT.  Where JIMMY S FATHER 
  continues to flirt with the same Woman he met in BEDDING.

  Jane watches with a curiosity as JIMMY S FATHER adds the 
  Woman s number in his cell. 

  That s when little Jimmy passes by Jane, EXITING the store.  
  Jane forces a smile.  Calls out after him...

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Have a nice day, little man.

  Little Jimmy FLIPS Jane his MIDDLE FINGER.  She stares back 
  with disbelief.


  INT. JANE S CAR - NIGHT

  Jane pulls up to a modest house.  

  A glimpse of her license plate reads WASHINGTON DC.  

  With the CLICK of her GARAGE DOOR REMOTE the garage door 
  opens... 


  INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

  Warm, cozy, but nothing extravagant.

    Exhausted, Jane steps inside.  Takes off her coat.  Heads 
  into the...                                                                                  4.




  INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

  Jane opens a cabinet, grabs a plate.  Moves to the PIZZA BOX 
  on the counter.  Jane lifts the cover to find... 

    ...nothing inside.  Just a few pieces of CRUST.

  Jane shakes her head.  Turns to the sink full of dirty 
  dishes.  

  Too tired to react, Jane heads upstairs...


  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Jane crawls into bed beside her husband, Richard BILINSKI 
  (40s).  His BACK is to her... 

                              RICHARD
                I was waiting.

                              JANE
                I told you I d be working late.

  But when Richard ROLLS OVER WITH HIS EYES CLOSED we realize, 
  along with Jane, that Richard wasn t talking to her after 
  all.    

  He is mumbling in his sleep.  

                              RICHARD
                Will you trim these hedges, 
                  goddammit.

  Jane looks at Richard with disdain.  Richard snorts, stirs.  

  Jane deflates.


  EXT. NATIONAL MALL - DAY

  To establish.  The sun is just rising.  Sprinklers turn on...


  INT. BATHROOM - DAY

  Jane and Richard, side by side, brushing their teeth.  No eye 
  contact.  No words exchanged.  Just two people who were once 
  in love, but now merely roommates.  Jane flinches in pain.

                              JANE
                Ow.                                                                                  5.



                              RICHARD
                What?

  Jane pulls from her mouth SOMETHING SHARP.  It s small, now 
  resting on the tip of her index finger.  

  She holds it up to the light.  Richard leans in, has a look. 

                              RICHARD (CONT D)
                What is that?

                              JANE
                I think it s a piece of toenail.
                      (gross)
                It was in my toothbrush.

                              RICHARD
                Oh, sorry.  Trimmed them last 
                night.

  He continues brushing.  Could give a shit.

  Jane s despondent.  Not just about Richard s toenail, but 
  with life.  Jane spits out the toothpaste and rinses her 
  mouth.


  INT. KITCHEN - DAY

  At the table; MELANIE BILINSKI (18) is texting, RACHEL 
  BILINSKI (15) listens to her IPOD and Richard reads the 
  paper.  Jane serves them all eggs.  

                              JANE
                So, Stephen Moscerelli is finally 
                off those crutches.  Saw him 
                getting the mail yesterday.

                              MELANIE
                      (still texting)
                Yeah.  So?

                              JANE
                So.  It could have been a lot worse 
                is all I m saying.  He took quite a 
                fall.

                              MELANIE
                Shit happens when you act like a 
                dumbass.                                                                                  6.



                              JANE
                I agree.  The boy is seventeen.  He 
                should not be consuming alcohol.

                              MELANIE
                More like, don t take the stairs 
                when you re drunk.  Duh.  That s 
                why God created elevators.

  Jane reacts.  Richard gets up.  Grabs his briefcase.  

                              JANE
                Hey.  Do we need Rodrigo to trim 
                the hedges?

                              RICHARD
                Not that I noticed.  Why do you 
                ask?

                              JANE
                        (covers)
                No reason.

  Rachel SINGS to her IPOD.  Richard turns to Melanie.  

                              RICHARD
                Melanie.  Good luck.

                              MELANIE
                      (still texting)
                Gracias.

                              RICHARD
                      (to Jane)
                Gotta run.  

                              JANE
                Have a good day.

  Jane forces a smile, watches him go.  Melanie suddenly 
  LAUGHS.  Jane wants to be included.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                What?

  But Melanie ignores her Mother.  Texts again.

                              MELANIE
                      (to herself)
                  Hilarious.

  With that, Jane stares at her daughters.  So close.  Yet so 
  far away...                                                                                  7.




  EXT. HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

  As Jane CRAMS the last of SEVERAL BOXES into the back of her 
  SUV, Melanie approaches.  

                              MELANIE
                Can I bring this?

  Jane turns to find Melanie holding...

                              JANE
                My flat iron?

                              MELANIE
                You don t use it.

                              JANE
                That s not true.  I use it.  When I 
                dress up.  

                              MELANIE
                When do you ever dress up?  Or go 
                  anywhere? 

  Melanie makes her point.  Jane cedes.

                              JANE
                Sure.  Fine.  Take it.

  Melanie happily makes a bee-line to the passenger door and 
  climbs into the car.  As Jane follows suit--

                              MAN (O.S.)
                Ms. Bilinski?

  The UPS GUY is standing behind her.  Sexy, built, nice smile.  

  Jane blushes.  Instantly nervous.  She has a crush.

                              JANE
                Oh.  Hey.  Hello.  Yes.  That s me.  
                Our UPS man.  Nice to see you 
                again. 

  The UPS guy is holding a PACKAGE in one hand.  A computerized 
  clipboard in the other.

                              UPS GUY
                Need you to sign for this.                                                                                  8.



  He holds out the clipboard.  Jane grabs the pen.  Holds it 
    upside-down.  Realizing, she adjusts the pen in her hand, 
  fumbles, awkward, laughs clumsily...

                              JANE
                Woops.  Sorry.  First day with a 
                pen.  

  He hands her the package.

                              UPS GUY
                There you go.

                              JANE
                Jane.  

                              UPS GUY
                I m sorry?

                              JANE
                It s Jane Bilinski.  That s my 
                name.

                              MELANIE (O.S.)
                Mom!

                              JANE
                As well as  mom .  And a few other 
                  not-so-charming appellations I 
                answer to.   

  She s flirting.  Or trying to.  A beat.  Awkward.  Jane is 
  smitten.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                  Anyway...

                              UPS GUY
                  Okie-doke.

  The UPS GUY turns, heads back to his truck.  

  Jane stares at his ass.


  INT. JANE S CAR - SECONDS LATER

  Jane climbs into the driver s seat, buckles herself in.  

  She goes to start the car, but then, on second thought...

                              JANE
                This is really happening, isn t it.                                                                                  9.



                              MELANIE
                Pretty much.

                              JANE
                My baby s all grown up.

                              MELANIE
                And taller than you even.

                              JANE
                  I remember my first day of college.  
                My whole life ahead of me.  When 
                anything was possible.

                              MELANIE
                Mom.  Don t get all mushy and force 
                  a Massengill moment.  Please.  

                              JANE
                Why?  I was a teenager once.  With 
                  confusion and fears about the 
                future.  But now look.  I got 
                married.  Had you girls.  We bought 
                a house.  You have so much to look 
                forward to. 

  Melanie considers walking in her mother s shoes...

                              MELANIE
                Now I just want to kill myself.

  Jane stares back at her daughter.  Eventually starts the 
  car...


  INT. JANE S CAR - DAY

  Jane drives through the COLLEGE CAMPUS.  Rolling hills.  
  Brick and ivy.  STUDENTS and their PARENTS unloading cars.  

                              MELANIE
                      (points ahead)
                That s my dorm.  Pull up here.


  EXT. CAMPUS - LATER

  Jane pulls the LAST BOX from her SUV as Melanie joins...  

                              MELANIE
                That the last one?                                                                                10.



                              JANE
                Not quite.  There s actually one 
                more.

  Jane HANDS Melanie the same PACKAGE the UPS GUY delivered 
  earlier.  It s a gift.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                This one s from me.  
                        (pleased with herself)
                Go ahead, open it.

  With that, Melanie tears the tape off.  Excited to have been 
  given a present.  But her SMILE FADES when she sees what s 
  inside.  

  Pulls it out, holds it up.

                              MELANIE
                Night goggles?

                              JANE
                I know I can t stop you from 
                drinking beer or schnapps or 
                whatever it is you ll be getting 
                  intoxicated with, but at least, 
                with these, you ll stumble home 
                safely.

                              MELANIE
                I m not wearing these, mom.  I ll 
                look like a douchebag.

                              JANE
                If Stephen Moscerelli was wearing 
                them, he wouldn t have ended up on 
                crutches now would he?

  Melanie looks at Jane in disbelief.

                              MELANIE
                  Orientation starts in like twenty  
                minutes.

                              JANE
                Okay.  Well.  I love you.  So much.

  Jane hugs her daughter.  Tight.  Fights back the tears.  
  Melanie barely hugs back.   

                              MELANIE
                See you Sunday.                                                                                11.



  Melanie picks up the last box and walks off.  Jane watches 
  with nostalgia, heartbreak and pride, when she suddenly 
  realizes Melanie forgot something.  

  The BOX with the NIGHT GOGGLES inside.  Jane CALLS out...

                              JANE
                Wait, Mel!  You forgot--

  But a CUTE BOY has already approached Melanie, offering to 
  carry her things.  Melanie lets him.  It s official.  Melanie 
  has left the nest.

  Jane blows air, as we...


  INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Rachel lazes across the couch, her eyes glued to the 
    television set.  On the screen:  The Tyra Banks Show .  

  While Rachel watches, Jane folds laundry.  

  ON THE SCREEN:

  A panel of four GIRLS and their MOTHERS.  TYRA BANKS 
  addresses  Jenny .  A 15 year old with a southern accent.

                              TYRA BANKS
                And how long were you cutting 
                before your mom caught you?

                              JENNY
                About two years.

  Gasps from the television audience.  Tyra pleads.

                              TYRA BANKS
                Help us out here, Jenny.  You would 
                take a razor to yourself every day?   
                Bleed, scar, inflict pain.  Why, 
                  Babydoll?  Why would you do that?  

  Jenny s eyes well with tears.

                              JENNY
                  I guess... I guess I just needed to 
                feel something.

  Tyra looks to the camera.  Tears in her eyes as well.

                              TYRA
                And we ll be right back.                                                                                12.



  Jane lifts the remote.  Mutes the volume.  Sits beside 
  Rachel.  With an agenda.  A heart to heart.  Rachel stares 
  back.

                                RACHEL
                What?

                              JANE
                You know your father and I are here 
                for you, right?    

                                RACHEL
                I m not cutting myself, mom.

                              JANE
                Of course not, honey.  But even if 
                you were, we wouldn t judge you.  I 
                just want to make sure you know you 
                can talk to us about anything.

  Rachel grabs the remote from Jane.  Turns OFF the tv.

                                RACHEL
                Okay.  Look.  I know you re always 
                there for me.  You know why? 

                              JANE
                Because I love you.

                                RACHEL
                Because you have nothing else in 
                your life.

                              JANE
                That is not true.

                                RACHEL
                When was the last time you had a 
                hobby?  Or took a class or 
                  something?  Or went out with 
                friends?  Or even had friends?  And 
                now that Melanie s gone, I m gonna 
                get ALL your attention.  Which I 
                worry might actually kill me 
                quicker than any drug addiction or 
                self mutilating tendency I may 
                  consider.

                              JANE
                Where is this coming fr--                                                                                13.



                                RACHEL
                There s gonna be some changes 
                around here.  I ll be sixteen in a 
                few months. I can take care of 
                myself. I don t wanna watch tv with 
                you every night or go food shopping 
                with you every weekend or do movie 
                Mondays, Scrabble on Tuesdays... 
                I m suffocating here.  I don t want 
                a mother anymore.  

                              JANE
                You don t want a mother anymore.

                                RACHEL
                That s what I m saying.  

  Jane swallowed the pill.  Now she s just letting it digest.

                              JANE
                So, what, you just want to be 
                friends?

                                RACHEL
                More like... acquaintances.  

                              JANE
                Rachel.  You can t break-up with 
                me.  I m your mother.

                                RACHEL
                If I have to, I ll serve you with 
                  emancipation papers.

                              JANE
                With what?

                                RACHEL
                For a full parental divorce.

                              JANE
                You can t divorce your parents.

                                RACHEL
                Actually you can.  I ve done the 
                  research.  Plenty of kids are doing 
                it.  Seven won their cases in court 
                last year alone.

  Jane lets that land, as we...                                                                                14.




  INT. SUPERMARKET - AISLE - DAY

  Jane PUSHES A CART, lost in thought.  A carry-over from that 
    conversation with Rachel, when... 

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                Jane?

  Jane stops.  Looks up.  Finds TWO WOMEN (40s), LUCY and 
  FRANCI, standing there, each carrying their own shopping 
  basket, ear to ear grins.

                              JANE
                Lucy.  Franci.

                              LUCY
                  I thought that was you in dairy.

  Trapped in the frozen food section, Jane forces delight...

                              JANE
                My God, it s been so long.

                                FRANCI
                Since the School Fair last year, I 
                think.  

                              LUCY
                That might ve been two years ago.

                                FRANCI
                Of fuck, you re right.  I can t 
                think straight, I m still jet 
                lagged.

                              JANE
                Yeah, I heard Brian was going to 
                  Syracuse.  You guys drop him off?

                                FRANCI
                No, that s next week.  Neil and I 
                have been in Africa for the last 
                month.  

                              JANE
                Africa?  What were you doing there?

                                FRANCI
                  Volunteering with Habitat for 
                  Humanity.   It s so addicting.  Did 
                our first build in India last year, 
                then one in Tajikistan.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                15.

                                FRANCI (CONT'D)
                And leaving for Poland in a few 
                weeks to do another.  

                              JANE
                Wow.  That sounds... wow.

                                FRANCI
                Yeah, got the scars to prove it.

  Franci shows off one on her arm.

                              JANE
                      (to Lucy)
                And you and Ed went, too?

                              LUCY
                Oh, hell no.  Girl, I finally made 
                Partner, so I m lucky if I get to a 
                movie theater these days.  But I m 
                loving it.

                              JANE
                  Congratulations.  That s so 
                  exciting.

                                FRANCI
                Stein, Linsky, Margolis--
                        (gesturing to Lucy)
                --and Woo.  

                              LUCY
                Yeah, it s pretty awesome.

                                FRANCI
                So, what new and fabulous things 
                have you been up to?

                                                                SMASH CUT TO:


  INT. WALMART - DAY

  Jane works the register.  For the only CUSTOMER in line.

  In addition to wearing the classic WALMART VEST, Jane also 
  sports a BASEBALL HAT with an image of CHICKEN LITTLE along 
  with FELT WINGS that hang from the sides.  

  And from Jane s expression, she s not thrilled to have it on 
  her head.

                              CUSTOMER
                Why you wearing that?                                                                                16.



                              JANE
                Wearing what, Sir?

                              CUSTOMER
                That thing.  On your head.

                              JANE
                It s Chicken Little.
                      (deadpan)
                Because our prices are falling, our 
                prices are falling.

  Not amused, Jane hands the Customer his change and he EXITS 
  the store.

  CLIFFORD STOLTZ, another WALMART EMPLOYEE, strolls over.  He, 
  too, is sporting the WALMART VEST and CHICKEN LITTLE HAT.  

  Clifford is 25 and baby-faced, though he carries himself with 
    a confidence most people don t find until later in life.  

                              CLIFFORD
                Nice work, Jane.  You get each 
                customer out the door in a timely 
                fashion, with a smile, little 
                  repartee, no dilly-dallying.  I 
                like it.  

                              JANE
                Oh.  Thank you.

  Jane smiles politely but has no clue who he is.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                I m sorry.  Have we met?

                              CLIFFORD
                I wanted to introduce myself.  
                Clifford Stoltz.  Happy to meet 
                you, excited to get to know you.

  He offers his hand.  She shakes it.  Reluctantly.  He comes 
  on a little strong.

                              JANE
                Nice to meet you, Clifford.  This 
                your first day?

                              CLIFFORD
                Hardly.  Been with the company 
                since  09.  Just transferred from 
                store 5743.                                                                                  17.



                              JANE
                Oh.  Well.  Welcome aboard.

                              CLIFFORD
                Thank you much.  
                      (then; sotto)
                Aren t you curious how I knew your 
                name?  I mean, you re not even 
                wearing a name tag...  

  He leans in, a secret, wink, wink.

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                ... but I won t tell.  Though you 
                should be.  It s sort of a company 
                rule.

                              JANE
                Not really.

                              CLIFFORD
                No, it is, in fact, a company rule.  
                Kinda memorized the handbook.

                              JANE
                No, I mean, I m not really curious 
                how you knew my name.  Should I be?

                              CLIFFORD
                Well.  I asked somebody.  Because I 
                saw you.  And wanted to know.

  He s dangling the worm, but Jane doesn t bite.  In fact, she 
  just stares back at him, baffled why this child half her age 
  is flirting.  

  Clifford knows rejection when he sees it.  Tries to cover...

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                ... because, y know, as Store 
                Manager, it s important I reach out 
                that way.  To all my employees.

                              JANE
                You re the new store manager?

                              CLIFFORD
                I am.  It s a pretty stressful job, 
                but like, whatever you need, I ll 
                totally take care of you.  Totally.  

                              JANE
                How old are you?                                                                                18.



                              CLIFFORD
                  Twenty-five.  
                        (admits)
                In March.

                              JANE
                So it was your idea to make us wear 
                these hats?

                              CLIFFORD
                I like to think outside the box.  
                      (pointed)
                  Y know... about everything.  So you 
                should be aware.  I m totally here.  
                For you.  Whatever you need.

                              JANE
                I need approval to go on break.

  Not exactly the needs Clifford was talking about, but...

                              CLIFFORD
                Right on... you are hereby on your 
                break.   

  Jane nods.  Walks away.  Clifford checks out her ass.


  INT. WALMART - AISLE - DAY

  ROGER (30s), another WALMART EMPLOYEE, unloads boxes as Jane 
  walks by.  

                              ROGER
                Wassup, Mama.

  He doesn t notice as Jane SWIPES his BOX CUTTER.  

                              JANE
                Good morning, Roger.

  She SLIPS the BOX CUTTER into her pocket and keeps walking...


  INT. WALMART - LADIES ROOM - DAY

  Two stalls.  Both doors, closed.  With TWO PAIR of SHOES 
  visible underneath.  

  Jane s FLATS and another woman s SNEAKERS.

  Suddenly, BLOOD TRICKLES TO THE FLOOR in Jane s stall.                                                                                19.



                              JANE (O.S.)
                Fuck.  Shit.

  Then, a toilet flush.  The STALL beside Jane OPENS... 

  MARIA RODRIGUE (60s), a thick, gray-haired woman, steps out.  
  Crouches a little.  Peeks beneath Jane s stall door.  Sees 
  the blood.  Concerned...

                              MARIA
                You okay in there?

  Jane EXITS the stall.  Her SKIRT hiked up to her waist. 

                              JANE
                I m fine, Maria.  Thank you.

  But Jane s leg is bleeding.  She moves quickly to the sink, 
  runs water, dabs the blood...

                              MARIA
                Oh, dios m o.  You are not fine.  
                You re bleeding.

                              JANE
                It was an accident, I just, I 
                walked into this, I was carrying a 
                sharp-- 

  Jane stops.  Looks at Maria.  Deflates.  Too exhausted to 
  lie.  Instead, Jane decides to tell the truth.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                I tried cutting myself.

                              MARIA
                What?  

                              JANE
                Y know, like what the kids are 
                doing.  I know.  It was stupid.

                              MARIA
                Why would you do that?

                              JANE
                Please don t tell anyone.

  Jane starts to CRY.  

                              MARIA
                Oh, cari o, you really hurt 
                  yourself.                                                                                  20.



                              JANE
                It actually doesn t hurt at all.  

                              MARIA
                Then why are you crying?

                              JANE
                I don t know.  
                        (realizing...)
                Because I feel nothing.  I haven t 
                for years.  

                              MARIA
                I don t think so.  I ve known you 
                for months. 

                              JANE
                So why do I feel numb.  Like I m 
                dead inside.  

                              MARIA
                You re not dead.  You re standing 
                right in front of me.  

                              JANE
                I ve been so unhappy, Maria.  In my 
                  marriage.  In my life.  And lately 
                I ve been... what if that s it?  
                What if this is all my life is?  
                I ve only ever had sex with one 
                man, never tried drugs, never 
                traveled the world, had two 
                  beautiful children who want nothing 
                to do with me anymore... I feel so 
                alone.  So lost.  Without any 
                purpose.  
                      (a beat)
                I m sorry, I don t know why I m 
                telling you this...

  Maria takes Jane s hand.  Looks her in the eye.  

                              MARIA
                I m a lot older than you.  So trust 
                me.  This is not the end.  More 
                likely, a new beginning.  Maybe a 
                new love.  A new life.  But it 
                won t happen by itself.  You have 
                to grab it.  Because life is so 
                short and goes so fast, that I 
                would hate to see you miss it.  
                It s a gift.  And so are you.  And 
                when you realize that...                                                                                21.



  Maria stops suddenly.  And falls DEAD to the floor.  

  What the fuck...?!  Jane is as stunned as we are.  

                              JANE
                Maria?


  INT. WALMART - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

  An AMBULANCE parked out front.  The lights still flashing.

  Several WALMART EMPLOYEES and a few CUSTOMERS watch as 
    PARAMEDICS push past with Maria s COVERED BODY on a gurney.  

  Roger stands beside Jane.  They look on, melancholy.

                              ROGER
                Who has a heart attack and dies at 
                  sixty-two?  

                              JANE
                I keep replaying it in my mind.  

                              ROGER
                She was still young.

                    JANEROGER
  You think she knew?  Like, 
  had a sense it was----and she was so fucking 
                                                chill as Floor Manager.  Let 
                                              me smoke in the break room.  
                                                They ll probably get some 
                                                stick-up-the-ass to replace 
                                              her.  Shit.

  Jane TURNS to Roger.  A sudden thought.


  INT. WALMART - OFFICE - DAY

  Clifford sits across his desk from Jane.   

                              CLIFFORD
                And can you tell me why you re 
                  interested in the Floor Manager  
                  position?

                              JANE
                Because nothing happens by itself.  
                You have to grab it.  And life is 
                so short and goes so fast, that I 
                would hate to miss it.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                22.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                An opportunity, I mean.  Like this 
                one.

                              CLIFFORD
                So you ve always wanted managerial?

                              JANE
                No.

                              CLIFFORD
                But you do now.

                              JANE
                Yes.

                              CLIFFORD
                How come?

                              JANE
                Because I need to make more money 
                if I m going to leave my husband.

  Clifford sits up.  He likes that answer.  

                              CLIFFORD
                  Congratulations.  You ve been 
                promoted to Floor Manager.


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - LUCY S OFFICE 

  Mahogany furniture.  Expensive art.  And a spectacular view 
  of the White House.  

  Lucy is seated behind her desk.  Jane, seated across from 
  her.  

                              LUCY
                I m sorry, Jane.  I know you and 
                Richard have been together a long 
                time.

                              JANE
                Since college.  He was my first 
                  relationship...

  We INTERCUT with:


  INT. GLOBAL TECH SERVICES - BULLPEN - DAY

  A sea of cubicles.  Employees immersed in work.                                                                                  23.



  Richard gets up from his cubicle.  A GLOBAL TECH EMPLOYEE ID 
  TAG HANGS FROM HIS NECK.  A file in hand, Richard plods down 
  the hall...

                              JANE (O.S.)
                ... I don t really know anything 
                else.


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - LUCY S OFFICE

                              LUCY
                Well, first, I m going to need
                a list of all your joint assets...


  INT. GLOBAL TECH SERVICES - COPY ROOM - DAY

  Richard opens the file.  As he makes COPIES of the pages 
  inside...

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                ...what Richard s annual income is, 
                what yours is, how many years you 
                were caring for the children while 
                he was at work, and how much you 
                would need each month to support 
                yourself and the girls.


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - LUCY S OFFICE

                              LUCY
                Divorce can be overwhelming, Jane, 
                but the hardest part is over.  
                You ve already made the decision.  

                              JANE
                  I haven t told him yet.

                              LUCY
                Nor should you right now.  Let s 
                get all your ducks in a row 
                first...


  INT. GLOBAL TECH SERVICES - STAIRWELL - DAY

  Richard enters.  Pulls out his cell phone.  Dials.

                              LUCY (O.S.)
                  ...ending a marriage often brings 
                out the worst in people.

                              LUCY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Better to get a head start and know 
                exactly what we ll be asking for.  


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - LUCY S OFFICE

                              LUCY
                Now.  I do need to know if there 
                was infidelity on either side of 
                this story.

  Jane laughs.

                              JANE
                Are you kidding, Richard is a 
                computer technician.  He leads a 
                more boring life than I do.


  INT. GLOBAL TECH SERVICES - STAIRWELL - DAY

  With the PHONE to his ear, Richard WHISPERS...

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                Yeah, I need a guy to trim the 
                hedges.  Thursday morning.  

  Richard hangs up.


  INT. JANE S CAR - DAY

  As Jane drives home, relief washes over.  She s more relaxed 
  than we ve seen, and a smile curls.  She should ve done this 
  a long time ago.  

  The radio is on.   MY SHARONA  comes on.  Jane turns it up.  
  Sings along.  We get the feeling she hasn t let loose like 
  this in years.  Perhaps Maria was right, a new life awaits. 

  Then, out of nowhere--

  The CAR in front of Jane SLAMS their BRAKES.  Jane CRASHES 
  into it.  BAM!


  INT. JANE S CAR - SECONDS LATER

  Jane lifts her head from the deployed airbag.  Looks at the 
  car in front of her.  Watches it drive away.  But Jane is too 
  in shock to take any sudden action.  Sirens sound.  Jane 
  slowly opens her car door.  Stumbles out...                                                                                25.



  An Ambulance pulls up.  What occurs next happens very fast:

  Two PARAMEDICS get out of the Ambulance.  Rush to Jane.  Get 
  her on a stretcher and into...  


  INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

  The Paramedics hook Jane up to a machine.  While they do 
  this...

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                Are you okay, ma am?

                              JANE
                I think so.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Does anything hurt?

                              JANE
                The other car, it, it drove away.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Don t worry about that.  Can you 
                tell us your name?

                              JANE
                Jane Bilinski.

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                And how many fingers am I holding 
                up, Jane?

                              JANE
                Three.

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                Good.  
                      (off the monitor)
                BP 155 over 85.  

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                You remember where you live, Jane?

                              JANE
                1250 South Sageway Avenue.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Is Richard home?

                              JANE
                What?                                                                                26.



                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Is your husband home?

                              JANE
                I, I think he s still at-- how did 
                you know my husband s name?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                If you get home before he does this 
                evening, we need you to do 
                  something for us.  Are you with me, 
                Jane?

                              JANE
                Who, who are you?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                We need you to find his cell phone 
                and download all the photos he s 
                got on it.

                              JANE
                What?  What is this?  

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                We need the photos from Richard s 
                cell phone.

                              JANE
                No.  No.  What re you talking 
                about?  My husband has a Blackberry 
                World.  It doesn t take photos.  
                Who are you?

                                PARAMEDIC #1
                We re talking about his other cell 
                phone.

                              JANE
                What other cell phone?  I don t 
                  understand.  Are you paramedics?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                No ma am.

                              JANE
                Well, who the hell are you?  

  Neither Man answers her.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                You have the wrong person here.  I 
                just got into an accident is all.                                                                                27.



                                PARAMEDIC #2
                We know who you are, Jane.
                      (hands her a card)
                This is the number to call if you 
                find those photos.  

  And just as fast as the Paramedics swooped Jane into the 
    Ambulance, they roll her out... 


  EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

  ... they help Jane to her feet and tuck her back into her 
  vehicle.  


  INT. JANE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

  Jane is seated back in the driver s seat.  She watches 
    helplessly as the Ambulance DISAPPEARS into traffic.  And she 
  is left reeling.  As if it never happened.


  EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

  Two cars in the driveway.  Jane s is smashed in.  


  INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

  Jane stands at the stove, stirring something in a pot.  But 
  her mind is a million miles away.  The water boils over.   
  Jane snaps out of her trance...

                              JANE
                Shit.

  She quickly turns off the gas, cleans up her mess.


  INT. KITCHEN - LATER

  Jane, Richard and Rachel eat dinner at the table.  Rachel 
    occasionally grabs her cell and texts throughout the scene.  

  A lot of silverware clanking, but no one talks.  

  Until...

                              RICHARD
                What happened to the car?                                                                                28.



                              JANE
                I had an accident.

                              RICHARD
                You didn t think to mention that?

                              JANE
                It wasn t a big deal.

                              RICHARD
                Whose fault?

                              JANE
                Theirs.

                              RICHARD
                And what happened to them?

                              JANE
                I don t know.  They drove away.

                              RICHARD
                They drove away?

                              JANE
                Yes.

                              RICHARD
                So, now our insurance will have to 
                cover the damages?

                              JANE
                I guess so.

                              RICHARD
                Our rates will go up.  That s not 
                good.

                              JANE
                It is what it is, Richard.

                                RACHEL
                Can you pass the bread?

  Jane does.  A beat.  More silver clanking.  More silence.  

  Jane tests him...

                              JANE
                It s too bad you weren t with me.  
                  I could ve taken a photo of the 
                other car with your cell before it 
                drove off.                                                                                29.



                              RICHARD
                We have the same phone, Jane.  Mine 
                doesn t have a camera either.

                              JANE
                Oh.  Right.

                              RICHARD
                You get an estimate?  

                              JANE
                No.  Not yet.

                              RICHARD
                Well, you should.  These insurance 
                  companies give you a very small 
                window.

  They sit in silence again.  Rachel has finished eating.  She 
  gets up from the table, leaves.  

                              JANE
                And in case you were wondering, my 
                neck s a little sore but other than 
                that, I m okay.

  Richard hadn t thought to ask.  

                              RICHARD
                Oh.  Good.

  Richard keeps eating.  Jane watches him.


  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Dark.  Richard s asleep.  Jane lays beside him, wide awake.  
  Once Richard starts to snore, Jane SLIPS OUT of BED.

  As she creeps out the room, Jane takes note of Richard s CELL 
  PHONE charging on his dresser.


  INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

  Jane quietly searches through drawers, examines piles of 
  mail, papers, etc...                                                                                 30.




  INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

  Jane sits at Richard s desk, rummages through his drawers, 
  check books, piles of papers, careful not to leave anything 
  out of place.  

  Jane moves on to their COMPUTER.  

  ON THE SCREEN:

  Jane opens Richard s email account.  She clicks anything that 
  looks suspect.  But finds nothing.

  Jane drags the curser to ALL DELETED FILES.  Only, each one 
  is associated with GLOBAL TECH.  

  Except one.  Titled  FOR YOUR EYES ONLY 

  ON THE SCREEN: 

  A naked photo of Rachel.  With a note attached.

  Hey Gabriel, I ll show you mine, if you show me yours.  

  -- Rachel

  Jane gasps.  Horrified.

                              JANE
                Oh my god...

  But with more pressing things at hand, Jane reluctantly 
  shakes it off, as we...


  INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

  Jane digs through boxes, shelves, finding nothing out of the 
  ordinary.  She hits a wall.  

  Until Jane eyes A SPARE SET OF KEYS hanging.  She grabs 
  them...


  INT. RICHARD S CAR - NIGHT

  A simple interior.  Nothing fancy.                                                                                31.



  Now wearing the NIGHT GOGGLES Jane tried giving to Melanie 
  earlier, she digs through the glove compartment, under the 
  seats, inside the visors, even opens an empty Starbucks cup 
  and looks inside, trying to find SOMETHING.  Anything to 
  corroborate what she s been told.  

  But all Jane comes across is a half cup of old coffee.

  Annoyed with herself, embarrassed even, Jane RIPS the NIGHT 
  GOGGLES off her face and sits back with frustration.  

                              JANE
                This is crazy.

  Jane s frustration turns to a chuckle, laughing at herself, 
  at the mere thought that Richard is hiding any secrets, that 
  he d have any reason to have a second cell phone.

  Jane opens the car door, about to step out, but realizes she 
  forgot one thing.  

  Jane reaches across the passenger seat and SLAMS the GLOVE 
  COMPARTMENT shut.  The AIR VENT COVER pops out. 

  Jane stares at it.  That s weird.  

  Then, INSTEAD of PUSHING the VENT COVER back into the 
    dashboard, Jane PULLS the vent cover OFF instead.  

  Revealing something hidden inside.  Jane pulls it out.

  Richard s second cell phone.  Jane s jaw drops. 


  EXT. WALMART - DAY

  To establish.  The parking lot is empty.  

                              CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                Top of the morning, folks.


  INT. WALMART - REGISTERS - DAY

  A circle of WALMART EMPLOYEES stand by the registers.  We can 
  see a HANDFUL OF CUSTOMERS waiting outside for the store to 
  open.  But until then, Clifford has the full attention of his 
  Staff.

                              CLIFFORD
                Sadly, we are one employee short 
                today.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                32.

                              CLIFFORD (CONT'D)
                I trust everyone has been informed 
                of Maria Rodrigue s passing.  Just 
                another reminder of how fleeting 
                this life is.  And how blessed we 
                all are to have things.  Like our 
                life, for one thing.  This job.  
                      (points at customers 
                        waiting outside)
                  Customers to serve.  A truckload of 
                Kellog s new Toaster Strudel 
                waiting in the stock room to be 
                  unloaded.  Which we all know flies 
                off the shelves like hotcakes.  
                Push  em today, people.  Having 
                said that, let s take a moment of 
                silence for our beloved co-worker.

  The Employees take Clifford s lead.  All heads go down.  In 
  silence.

  Distracted, Jane CLUTCHES onto the CARD the PARAMEDIC gave 
  her earlier with his CONTACT NUMBER on it.  She occasionally 
  opens her palm and steals a look.  Debating whether to call.

  Out of the corner of his eye, Clifford watches Jane.  For no 
  other reason than he likes to look at her.  She looks up, 
  meets his stare.  She forces a smile.  Clifford winks back.  
  Clifford likes Jane.  And he s too young to give a shit what 
  anyone thinks about that.

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                      (looks at his watch, then)
                ... and that s our time.  RIP, 
                Maria.  In other news, the lovely 
                Jane Bilinski is taking over the 
                role of Floor Manager.  So let us 
                all give her a hand.

  Clifford and the Employees CLAP with enthusiasm.

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                I am stoked!  Are you stoked 
                people?!

                                EMPLOYEES
                Hell ya!

                              CLIFFORD
                Give me a  W .

                                EMPLOYEES
                 W !                                                                                33.



                              CLIFFORD
                Give me an  A !

                                EMPLOYEES
                 A !

                              CLIFFORD
                Give me an  L !

                                EMPLOYEES
                 L !

                              CLIFFORD
                Give me a squiggly!

  The Employees shimmy their hips.

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                How do we feel?!

                                EMPLOYEES
                Fired up!

                              CLIFFORD
                That s what I m talking about!  Now 
                Swine it up!

  Each Employee extends an arm, palm up, as Clifford squirts a 
  dollop of anti-bacterial goop into each hand.

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                Three minutes  til show time, 
                folks!

  Jane pulls out her cell phone, walks off.  Clifford stares at 
  her ass.


  EXT. WALMART - LOADING DOCK - DAY

  Jane s found privacy.  Holds the card in one hand, her cell 
  in the other.  

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                Hi.  This is Jane Bilinski.  I 
                found what you re looking for.


  EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LATER

  Jane stands beside the sign -- THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.                                                                                  34.



  Tourists pose beside her.  Cameras flash.  

  But Jane isn t there for a photo op.  She s meeting someone.  
  Scans the crowd.  

                              MAN (O.S.)
                Excuse me.

  Jane turns, expectantly.  Only it s an overweight TOURIST.  
  She deflates.  Was expecting someone else.

                              JANE
                Can I help you?

                              TOURIST
                Would you mind?

  The man holds out his camera.  Jane reluctantly agrees.

                              JANE
                Sure.  Okay.

  As the TOURIST and his WIFE pose for Jane, she lifts the 
  camera to her face.  

  JANE S POV THROUGH THE LENS:

  At first we just notice the Tourist and his wife.  But then, 
  in the background, our eyes are drawn to a familiar face in 
  the crowd.  

  Paramedic #2 from the ambulance earlier.  

  The one who gave Jane a number to call.  We get a better look 
  at him now.  40s, clean cut, handsome.

  He s staring right back at Jane.  She drops the camera from 
  her face.  Looks right at him.  He s standing alone.  

                              TOURIST
                Gotta wait for the light to blink.

  Jane takes the photo, hands the Tourist his camera.

                              TOURIST (CONT D)
                Thanks so--

  But Jane is already gone.  

  EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - SECONDS LATER

  Jane stands with Paramedic #2.  He gestures to the crowd.                                                                                35.



                                PARAMEDIC #2
                This busy enough for you?

                              JANE
                It s fine.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Let s walk.

  They do.  Through the mass of people.

                                PARAMEDIC #2 (CONT D)
                Y know, Daniel Chester French, the 
                guy who sculpted the Lincoln 
                  Memorial, was deaf.  That s why 
                  Lincoln s hands are shaped as an 
                 A  and an  L  in sign language.

  Jane s not up for small talk.

                              JANE
                  Interesting.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                  Lincoln... talk about an honest 
                  upstanding citizen.  
                      (then)
                How s your head?  

                              JANE
                My neck is still stiff, thanks.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Yeah, sorry about that.  We had to 
                make sure you were alone.  And that 
                we had your undivided attention.  
                You understand.

                              JANE
                No, frankly, I don t.  I don t 
                  understand any of this.  Who is 
                 we ?  Who are YOU?  I mean, 
                  honestly, I have no idea what I m 
                doing here.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                You said you found your husband s 
                second cell phone.

                              JANE
                I have what you want.  But first 
                you tell me who you are.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                36.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                Is my husband having an affair with 
                your wife?  

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                No.

                              JANE
                Okay.  Is my husband screwing your 
                client s wife?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                I m not a private investigator.  
                And your husband is not having an 
                affair.  At least, not to my 
                  knowledge.

                              JANE
                Then what do you want from me?  And 
                what the hell is my husband doing 
                with a second cell phone?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Jane...
                      (then)
                Is it okay if I call you Jane?

                              JANE
                Fine, whatever.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Jane, for the last seven years your 
                husband has been an International 
                Spy, selling highly sensitive 
                security information to Russian 
                  Intelligence Agencies in exchange 
                for money.  

  A beat.  Jane, at first, is speechless.  Then she can t help 
  but laugh.  

                              JANE
                Come again?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                And my name is Agent Michael Winter 
                with the Federal Bureau of 
                  Investigation.

  He ever so inconspicuously flashes a badge.  Jane stops in 
  her tracks.  

                              JANE
                That is the craziest thing I ve 
                ever heard.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                37.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                Richard is a computer technician 
                for Global Tech Services.  And has 
                been.  For the last twelve years.

                                WINTER
                Global Tech is the sole provider of 
                tech support to every Government 
                agency in the country.  They have 
                access to files as high as the 
                White House.

                              JANE
                This conversation is ridiculous.

                                WINTER
                We don t think so.

                              JANE
                Okay, this is obviously a big joke.  
                Did Rachel put you up to this?

                                WINTER
                No ma am.

                              JANE
                You have some beef with Richard and 
                this is all just payback?

                                WINTER
                I m afraid not.  

                              JANE
                Well, y know what then, Mr. Winter 
                or whoever you really are.  I m 
                  offended.  You screw up my car, 
                which I now owe the deductible on, 
                  I could ve been seriously injured.  
                You plant absurdities in my head 
                that have me sneaking around my 
                house all night and yeah, okay, so 
                I did find another cell phone, 
                which is probably for my husband s 
                mistress or whatever to reach him 
                on, but A. I don t care, and B. I 
                don t have time for this crap.  I 
                just got promoted to Floor Manager 
                and I certainly don t have time to 
                be screwed with by some guy who 
                gets his rocks off watching a soon 
                to be middle aged woman run around 
                in circles after--                                                                                38.



                                WINTER
                --where did you find the second 
                cell?

  Jane stops, can t believe the cajones on this guy.

                              JANE
                In his car.  It was hidden inside 
                the vent.

                                WINTER
                  Impressive.  That couldn t have 
                been easy to find.  Let me guess, 
                you tried turning it on but he 
                keeps the SIM card hidden somewhere 
                else.

  Jane won t admit it, but Winter s right.

                              JANE
                Don t get me wrong, I am hardly 
                Ingrid Bergman here, standing by my 
                man out of some sort of 
                  responsibility.  In fact, we ve 
                been nothing more than roommates 
                for the last ten years, it s just, 
                this is all a bit far fetched and 
                silly, frankly.  So, I m leaving.

  As Jane walks off--

                                WINTER
                We transferred four thousand 
                dollars into your bank account.  
                The one you re using for Melanie s 
                tuition.  

  This stops Jane.  

                                WINTER (CONT D)
                That outta cover the insurance 
                  deductible, medical expenses and 
                the rest for your trouble.  Bank Of 
                America account number 17738409.  
                Check it yourself.  It cleared this 
                morning.

  Jane s eyes narrow.  Taking him more seriously now.

                              JANE
                How did you know my bank account 
                number?                                                                                39.



                                WINTER
                We know a lot of things.

                              JANE
                I ve been married to this man for 
                almost twenty years.  How can you 
                expect me to believe this?

                                WINTER
                In the last three months your 
                husband traveled five times for 
                  business.  Twice to New York, twice 
                to San Francisco, and once to 
                Texas.

                              JANE
                What s your point?

                                WINTER
                On three of those occasions he 
                didn t fly home from the city he 
                did business in.  Caught puddle 
                jumpers to remote areas, stayed for 
                one night, then flew back to DC.

                              JANE
                What are you talking about?

                                WINTER
                Bottom line.  We re offering you an 
                  opportunity.  That would entail you 
                to stay married to Richard, live in 
                the house, and continue your life 
                exactly as you have been.  Day to 
                day chores, the kids, Walmart.  And 
                help us understand who your husband 
                is working for and why.  

                              JANE
                You want me to spy on my husband?

                                WINTER
                And we ll pay you in exchange.

                              JANE
                If you re so sure Richard s 
                breaking the law, why not arrest 
                him?

                                WINTER
                Because he s a small cog in a very 
                big wheel.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                40.

                                WINTER (CONT'D)
                He s worth much more to us out of 
                jail than he would be inside. 

  Jane hands Winter a disc.  

                              JANE
                Even without Richard s SIM card I 
                could still access his photos.  I 
                  downloaded them while he was 
                  sleeping, before I put his cell 
                phone back.  But I think you ll be 
                  disappointed.  It s just some 
                pictures of public mailboxes and a 
                few trees.  
                      (then)
                I m sure there are Americans who 
                spy for other countries, Agent 
                Winter.  But I highly doubt my 
                husband is one of them.  

  But as Jane walks away from Winter, her face says something 
  contrary.  She doesn t know what to believe...


  INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

  Richard enters, takes his seat at the table.  Rachel follows, 
  does the same.  With gloved hands, Jane pulls a hot dish from 
  the oven.  Places it on the table.  A steaming plate of meat 
  and vegetables.

                                RACHEL
                That chicken again?

  But Jane doesn t answer her.  Not because she s ignoring her 
  daughter, but because her mind is somewhere else... 

                                RACHEL (CONT D)
                Hello?  Earth to Jane.

                              JANE
                What?

                                RACHEL
                I just asked you if this is 
                chicken?  Again.

                              JANE
                I didn t hear you.  Yes.  We re 
                having chicken again.  If you don t 
                like it, Burger King is just a 
                twelve minute walk.                                                                                41.



  Sarcasm like that never comes from Jane s mouth.  Rachel and 
  Richard both take note.  

                                RACHEL
                You don t have to be a bitch about 
                it.

                              RICHARD
                Rachel.  It s been a strange week, 
                with your sister starting college, 
                and a fender bender... why don t 
                you cut your mother some slack. 

                                RACHEL
                She s not my mother.

                              JANE
                Well, you can call it whatever you 
                want, but you emerged from my 
                vagina.

                                RACHEL
                Really?  You needed to go there?  
                With food on the table?  
                      (then)
                What s wrong with you?  You never 
                talk like that. 

  Jane finally sits down for dinner.  Her composure in tact.

                              JANE
                I found something the other night.  
                  Something incriminating.

  Without looking at them, Jane serves herself.  Richard and 
  Rachel watch her do this.  Their curiosity piqued.

                                RACHEL
                  Incriminating to who?

  Jane looks up.  Stares at Richard.  Then turns to Rachel.

                              JANE
                You.

                                RACHEL
                What did I do?

                              JANE
                Sent naked photos of yourself-- 
                      (air quotes)
                -- to  Gabriel  on My Space.                                                                                42.



                                RACHEL
                What were you doing on my My Space 
                page?

                              JANE
                Don t flatter yourself.  I was on 
                the computer and found it in the 
                deleted files.  You re fifteen for 
                  godssake.

                                RACHEL
                What I send to my friends is none 
                of your business.

                              RICHARD
                Who s Gabriel?

                              JANE
                She sent erotic photographs of 
                herself into the ether and she can 
                never get those back.  

                                RACHEL
                It s my fucking body, godammit.  I 
                can do what I please.  

                              RICHARD
                Don t curse at the table.

                              JANE
                Who is this Gabriel?  

                                RACHEL
                He s a poet.  And he doesn t view 
                my body as a negative force running 
                ramped on the net.  He sees it as

                              JANE
                What is he, making a coffee table 
                book?  

                                RACHEL 
                Just because you live in your tiny 
                  protective bubble where nothing 
                happens and it s probably been 
                forever since you ve seen your own 
                naked body, doesn t mean we all 
                have to live that way.

                              JANE
                This is my fault.  You inherited my 
                naivet .                                                                                  43.



                                RACHEL
                Gabriel says nudity is the rawest 
                form of ourselves.  It s the 
                  foundation of who we are to the 
                core.  Nakedness is truth.  
                  Nakedness... is power.  

                              JANE
                Well, then, I guess you re a few 
                photos away from becoming leader of 
                the free world.

                                RACHEL
                      (taunts Jane)
                I m gonna send him another naked 
                photo tonight.

                              JANE
                Y know what, just forget it.  
                Because the truth is, if someone 
                really wants to sneak around, and 
                have secrets, and lie and deceive 
                everyone under their roof... 

  Jane stops herself.  Realizing the line between husband and 
  daughter is blurred.  She covers.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                ... I can t stop you.  But it just 
                makes me wonder is all.

                                RACHEL
                Wonder what?

  Jane doesn t look at Rachel.  Because truthfully, it s not 
  her daughter she wonders about...

                              JANE
                Who you are.

                                RACHEL
                I m a sex addict meth head who will 
                sell my babies for money.  

                              JANE
                Perfect.  Eat your chicken.  And 
                clean up after yourself.

  Jane continues to eat, just as poised as she was when she 
  first sat down.  In silence, Rachel and Richard do the same.                                                                                44.




  INT. OFFICE - DAY

  As Richard heads out the door, Jane sits at their desk, her 
  head in paperwork, bills.  There s a POST IT NOTE on the 
  computer screen.  Jane peels it off.

  It reads: 

  Staying at Karen s tonight.  Shooting up tons of heroine.

  Rachel

  Jane rolls her eyes.  Richard appears in the doorway.  
  Dressed for work.  His BRIEFCASE in one hand.  A small VALISE 
  in the other.

                              RICHARD
                Hey, so, I ll be flying to Boston 
                after work.  Flight leaves at 5:30.  
                Just for the night.  They re 
                  instituting a new system at City 
                Hall.  

                              JANE
                Okay.

                              RICHARD
                I ll be back tomorrow.  Late.  
                Don t wait up.

                              JANE
                Okay.

                              RICHARD
                Rachel will be fine.  She s just 
                being a teenager.

                              JANE
                Okay.

  Richard nods goodbye.  Jane waits for the door to close 
  behind him, then rushes to the window.  Takes cover behind 
  the curtain.  Watches him drive off...


  INT. KITCHEN - DAY

  Jane is on the phone.  An AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE on the other 
  end.  Her voice bleeds through.  

  Under the following, Jane consults her own records/calendar.                                                                                45.



                              JANE
                      (into phone)
                Hi.  My boss asked me to confirm 
                all his air miles over the last few 
                months, would you mind confirming 
                some flights with me?  

                              AIRLINE REP (O.S.)
                Happy to.

                              JANE
                      (into phone)
                Great.  Flight 673 on the twentieth 
                of last month, he flew from New 
                York to DC...

                              AIRLINE REP (O.S.)
                Your boss s name?

                              JANE
                      (into phone)
                Richard Bilinski.

  A beat.  Jane waits.

                              AIRLINE REP (O.S.)
                I don t see his name in our records 
                for that flight.  Oh, wait.  
                Actually I do.  But he canceled the 
                  reservation that morning.

                              JANE
                      (into phone)
                What flight did he change it to?

                              AIRLINE REP (O.S.)
                He didn t.  At least not with our 
                airline.

                              JANE
                      (into phone)
                You re the only airline our company 
                uses.  
                      (then)
                Can you check a flight on the third 
                of this month, number 437 from San 
                  Francisco to DC?

  A beat.  Jane waits.

                              AIRLINE REP (O.S.)
                He wasn t on that flight either.                                                                                  46.



                              JANE
                      (into phone)
                Well, this is embarrassing.  My 
                records are off.  Please tell me 
                he s on a flight to Boston out of 
                DC tonight at five-thirty?  Or I 
                may have to seek new employment.


                              AIRLINE REP (O.S.)
                I m sorry.  Richard Bilinski is not 
                on that flight either.  But I could 
                make him a reservation right now if 
                you d like...?

  Jane seethes.  Her eyes narrow.  Knows what she has to do.


  EXT. GLOBAL TECH OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT - DAY

  To establish.  The work day comes to an end.  EMPLOYEES exit 
  the building.  Walk to their cars...


  INT. JANE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

  Parked.  Jane sits behind the wheel.  In a BASEBALL HAT and 
  SUNGLASSES.  

  Her eyes fixed on the doors to Global Tech.  She waits.


  EXT. GLOBAL TECH OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

  Richard WALKS OUT.  His briefcase in hand.  He goes to his 
  car.  Gets in.  Drives off.


  INT. JANE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

  Jane starts her car.  Follows him.


  INT. JANE S CAR - DAY

  Jane parks behind a tree.  

  The sign on the building ahead reads: ENTERPRISE RENT-A-CAR.

  JANE S POV: 

  Richard talks with a SALESMAN inside.  The guy hands Richard 
  a SET OF KEYS.                                                                                  47.



  Richard gets into a BLUE SPORTS CAR.  Drives off.


  INT. JANE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

  As Jane follows the BLUE SPORTS CAR, we take note; her 
  dashboard clock reads: 5:08 p.m.


  INT. JANE S CAR - NIGHT

  Jane s been driving for a while.  

  The dashboard clock reads: 6:45 p.m.  

  With the BLUE SPORTS CAR still in view, Jane continues to 
  follow.  The BLUE SPORTS CAR pulls into a MOTEL.  Parks.

  Jane hangs back, not wanting to be seen.  

  She parks several cars away from where Richard does.  

  Watches him get out of the BLUE SPORTS CAR.  Stretches.  
  Heads inside the MOTEL LOBBY.

  JANE S POV:

  Through the MOTEL LOBBY window, the MOTEL MANAGER takes CASH 
  from Richard.  Hands him a KEY in exchange.

  Jane DIALS her CELL.  Lifts it to her ear.  As it RINGS on 
  the other end, Jane watches Richard THROUGH THE GLASS.  

  He answers his phone.

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                Jane.  Hi.

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                Hey.  I just wanted to make sure 
                you landed okay.  Heard there s a 
                lot of rain in Boston.

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                Yeah.  We landed in one piece.  I m 
                still at the airport though.  About 
                to grab a cab.

  Richard FEEDS CHANGE into a SNACK MACHINE.                                                                                  48.



  Buys POTATO CHIPS.

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                You eat yet?

  Richard then FEEDS CHANGE into the COKE MACHINE.  

  Buys a COKE.

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                Me and some of the guys, we re 
                going out for steaks later.

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                Well that s good.  I hate when you 
                reach for the chips and soda.  

  Through the window we watch Richard react.  As he holds CHIPS 
  in one hand and a SODA in the other.

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                What do you mean?

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                I know it s easier, but it s 
                poison.  And horse hair, 
                  apparently.

  Richard HESITATES eating the next chip.

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                Horse hair?

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                Or rat s hair.  One of those.

  Richard suddenly doubts his choice.  Tosses the chips and 
  Coke in the trash.

                              RICHARD
                      (into cell)
                Yeah, um, y know what, I think I 
                see a cab.  I better jump.  I ll 
                see you tomorrow.                                                                                49.



                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                Okay.  Have a --

  But Richard already HUNG UP.  Jane watches Richard leave the 
  MOTEL LOBBY.  He walks to a MOTEL ROOM.  Uses the KEY to 
  enter.  And disappears inside.

  Jane exits her car.


  INT. MOTEL LOBBY - SECONDS LATER

  Jane approaches the FRONT DESK.  The MOTEL MANAGER stands 
  behind it.  The same one who handed Richard his key.

                              JANE
                Excuse me, I was just at the gas 
                station across the street, filling 
                my tank, when I could ve sworn I 
                just saw Leonardo DiCaprio walk in 
                here.

                              MANAGER
                Who?

                              JANE
                Ohmygod, only the sexiest man to 
                ever walk this earth.   Titanic ?  
                 Catch Me If You Can ?

                              MANAGER
                Him?  Really?  

                              JANE
                Well, he got a room.  Didn t he 
                give you his name?

                              MANAGER
                He called himself...
                      (off ledger)
                  ...Stuart Walker.

                              JANE
                Well, obviously, if he told you his 
                real name, every gossip mag would 
                be camping out in the parking lot.

  Just then, we HEAR a DOOR SLAM.  Richard is walking toward 
  the MOTEL LOBBY.  Jane sees him.  She ducks.  Behind the 
  door.  Richard ENTERS.  Approaches the Motel Manager.                                                                                50.



                              RICHARD
                Hey, my room doesn t have any 
                towels. 

                              MANAGER
                Oh.  That s an oversight.

  The Motel Manager SNEAKS A GLANCE at Jane, hidden behind the 
  door.  She lifts her finger to her lips.  

                              MANAGER (CONT D)
                I ll call housekeeping.  Sorry 
                about that.

                              RICHARD
                No problem.

  Richard EXITS.  Jane comes out from hiding.

                              JANE
                Thank you.  I would have died if he 
                saw me trembling like this.  Not 
                how I d want my first introduction.  

                              MANAGER
                So that was Leo?

                              JANE
                  Definitely not.  Leo is way cuter.  
                Can t blame a girl for trying 
                though, right?  You take care now.

  Jane turns, walks out.  Her smile quickly fades, as we...


  EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

  To establish.  The sun is rising.  A new day.


  INT. JANE S CAR - DAY

  Jane has been in her car all night.  

  The dashboard clock reads: 6:03 a.m.

  A few empty COFFEE CUPS strewn across the front seat.  She 
  looks like shit.  Exhausted.  But fueled with adrenaline.

  JANE S POV:

  Richard EXITS his motel room.  Climbs into the BLUE SPORTS 
  CAR.  Drives off.                                                                                  51.



  Jane starts her engine, follows...


  EXT. PUBLIC PARK - DAY

  The BLUE SPORTS CAR parks curb side.  Richard climbs out.  

  JOGGERS, DOG WALKERS, and GARDENERS keep the grounds alive 
  with activity.


  INT. JANE S CAR - DAY

  Jane pulls her car over, parks her car.  

  JANE S POV:

  Richard walks into the PARK.  Takes a SEAT on the PARK BENCH.  
  Several GARDENERS work around him.  Trimming hedges.  Jane 
  takes note. 

                              JANE
                        (harkens back)
                They re trimming the hedges.  I ll 
                be damned.  

  Richard checks his phone.  Checks his watch.  Pulls an 
  ENVELOPE from inside his jacket.  Stands.  Walks to the TRASH 
  CAN.  Throws the ENVELOPE inside.   As Richard plods back to 
  the BLUE SPORTS CAR...

  Jane s cell phone rings.  She answers it.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                      (into cell)
                Hello?

                              WOMAN (O.S.)
                Hi, I m calling from Principal 
                Drake s office from Voldoma High?

                              JANE
                What s wrong?

                              WOMAN (O.S.)
                No need to be alarmed.  We just 
                wanted to notify you that the money 
                for Rachel s field trip is due 
                today.  

                              JANE
                I gave Rachel that money two weeks 
                ago.                                                                                52.



  Jane looks up.  The BLUE SPORTS CAR starts, engine revs up...

                              WOMAN (O.S.)
                Oh.  I see.  Well, I suppose you 
                need to work that out with your 
                  daughter.

                              JANE
                You are absolutely right, I do.  
                And I most certainly will.  

  Jane looks up again.  The BLUE SPORTS CAR is GONE.

                              WOMAN (O.S.)
                Well, I guess we ll wait to--

  Jane HANGS UP on the woman.  Realizes she lost Richard.

                              JANE
                Shit.

  Just then, Jane CATCHES A GLIMPSE of an OLD MAN entering the 
  park.  A walking cane in one hand, a coffee in the other.  

  Jane stops scrambling, suddenly intrigued by him...

  JANE S POV:

  The Old Man SITS on the same PARK BENCH Richard did.  

  After a beat, the OLD MAN moves to the same TRASH CAN Richard 
  tossed the ENVELOPE into.  

  The OLD MAN throws his coffee cup away.  Then, he pulls the 
  same ENVELOPE from the TRASH CAN Richard had left behind.

  With that, the OLD MAN shoves the ENVELOPE inside his coat.  
  As he WALKS out of the PARK...

  Jane STARTS HER CAR, follows him around the corner.  

  Only to find the OLD MAN is suddenly GONE.  He s disappeared.

  Jane creeps down the street, sure he couldn t have vanished. 

  But he did.

    Overwhelmed, Jane pulls her car over.  Reels.  She s now seen 
  it with her own eyes.  

  Winter was right.  Richard is a spy.                                                                                53.




  EXT. HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

  Rachel and KAREN (15) sit on the FRONT STOOP.  Smoking 
  cigarettes.  Jane s car pulls in the driveway.  

                                RACHEL
                Shit.  The Warden.

  Rachel and Karen toss their smokes.  Jane gets out of her 
  car, approaches them.  

                              JANE
                Give me those.

  Instead, Rachel introduces her friend.

                                RACHEL
                This is Karen.

                              KAREN
                What s up.

                                RACHEL
                Not that it s any of your business, 
                but we re going to Erica s.

                              JANE
                I want them now.

                                RACHEL
                What re you talking about?

                              JANE
                The cigarettes you re hiding.
                      (Rachel plays dumb)
                Under your right butt cheek.

                                RACHEL
                No.  Forget it.  They re my 
                  property.  You can t confiscate 
                them.

                              JANE
                I don t want to.  I want to smoke 
                one.

                                RACHEL
                What?  Why?

                              JANE
                Because I ve had a shitty day.                                                                                54.



                                RACHEL
                You ve never smoked a cigarette in 
                your life.

                              JANE
                Never too late.  Besides, I m 
                pretty sure I paid for them.

  Rachel reluctantly PULLS OUT HER PACK OF SMOKES and PULLS ONE 
  OUT for Jane.  Hands it to her.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Thank you.  

  Jane walks inside.  Karen turns to Rachel.  Taken aback.

                              KAREN
                That s your mom?

                                RACHEL
                God.  What is up with her?  She s 
                acting so... normal.


  INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Jane lights the cigarette.  Coughs.  An amateur.  She inhales 
  again.  Blows smoke.  Gets the hang of it.  

  Jane moves to the MANTLE.  Studies the family photos:

  A much younger Jane and Richard on their wedding day.

    A youthful Jane and Richard with their two INFANT daughters.

  Jane and Richard at the beach. Melanie, Rachel are TODDLERS.

  As Jane masters the art of smoking, she stares at these 
  memories and recalls what once was.  She was happy.  She was 
  a part of something.  She was in love.  

  But those days are gone now.  Just memories framed in 
    decorative wood.  

  Jane looks away.  Resigned to what she has to do...


  INT. BEDROOM - DAY

  Piles of clothes thrown on the bed.  An opened suitcase.  
  With an urgency, Jane starts to pack.                                                                                   55.




  INT. BATHROOM - DAY

  Jane turns the SHOWER on.  Water shoots from the spigot.  
  Jane feels the temp.  Not hot enough.  

  She peels off her clothes.  

  Then Jane OPENS DRAWERS, grabs lotions, razors, deodorant...


  INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

  ... packing the toiletries in the suitcase, as well.  

  As Jane snags a few dresses from the closet, it all seems 
  rather sane... 

  ... until Jane unexpectedly THROWS them TO THE FLOOR --

  -- and SCREAMS.  Loudly.  In a sudden fit of rage.  

  Finally, the woman explodes. 

  Jane KICKS the clothes across the room, grabs whatever s in 
  reach and WHIPS it against the wall.   

  Jane SCREAMS again.

  Releasing all the emotions she s had pent up.  

  All the sadness.  All the betrayal.  All the lies.

  And in that moment, Jane CATCHES a glimpse of HERSELF in the 
  MIRROR.  NAKED.  

  She stops.  Stares at herself.  As if she hasn t in years.  

  Meet Jane Bilinski.

  Nakedness is truth.  Nakedness is power.

  And just like that, a strength immerges.


  EXT. VIETNAM VETERAN S MEMORIAL - DAY

  Amidst the crowd of TOURISTS, Jane and Winter WALK along the 
  list of engraved names, messages, cards, etc.                                                                                56.



                              JANE
                You were right about Richard.  He 
                did cancel those flights, then lie 
                about them.  So, I followed him 
                last night.  A couple hours away.  
                And watched him leave an envelope 
                in a trash can.  Another man later 
                picked it up.  Then disappeared.  

                                WINTER
                Was he onto you?

                              JANE
                My husband?  Hardly.  I m about as 
                  invisible to him as I am to the 
                rest of the world.  He didn t 
                notice a thing.

                                WINTER
                Did you confront him?

                              JANE
                No.  
                      (then)
                He also goes by the alias Stuart 
                Walker if that helps. 

  Winter pulls out a small tablet.  Jots it down.

                                WINTER
                Stuart Walker, huh?  That s a new 
                one.  

                              JANE
                That s all I know.

                                WINTER
                So, why did you call me here today?

                              JANE
                I talked to a divorce attorney--

                                WINTER
                --we know.

                              JANE
                --yeah, you mentioned that earlier. 
                Clearly, there s no hiding much 
                from you guys.  I always wanted a 
                big brother, but it s not exactly 
                what I had in mind.  Anyway, I came 
                back this morning and started 
                packing.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                57.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                Just wanted to run as far away from 
                this marriage as I could. So sad 
                that this is what became of all the 
                hopes and dreams I had when we met.  
                When we started a family.  I had it 
                all planned out.  How my life would 
                look.  But somewhere along the way 
                I became a spectator.  Life was in 
                cruise control and I was just along 
                for the ride.  Believing that if I 
                strayed off course I d be letting 
                everyone down somehow.  But in the 
                process, I ve only let down myself.  
                I don t know who I am anymore.  Or 
                what my purpose is.  I don t think 
                I ve ever known, really.  I met, 
                then married Richard before I had a 
                chance to figure all that out.

                                WINTER
                And now?

                              JANE
                As I was packing to leave, it hit 
                me.  I m so angry.  So appalled by 
                my husband s betrayal.  And not 
                because he s been lying to me for 
                so long.  But because he s been 
                living this life of excitement and 
                intrigue for years.  And I haven t.

  Jane stops.  Turns to Winter.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                As hard as it was to follow Richard 
                like that... it s the first time in 
                years I ve felt alive.  
                      (a beat; then)
                So, I m in.   What Richard s doing 
                is wrong.  And I want to help you 
                figure out who he s working for.  
                And why.  

                                WINTER
                I m very pleased.  Had a feeling 
                you d come around.

                              JANE
                Can you at least pretend I m not so 
                  predictable?

                                WINTER
                I ll work on that.                                                                                58.



                              JANE
                Thanks.

                                WINTER
                Those photos you downloaded, 
                despite your concern that images of 
                trees and a mailbox were useless... 
                our techs were able to analyze 
                them.  They re convinced of the 
                  contrary.  They re actually a tip-
                off to Richard s next exchange.

                              JANE
                So what does that mean?

                                WINTER
                It means, live your life as you 
                have been and we ll be in touch.  
                You ll be notified of your next 
                  assignment when we re ready.  Until 
                then... we ll go our separate ways.  
                But I think this is the beginning 
                of a beautiful friendship...

  Winter nods, smiles slightly and moves off.  As Jane watches 
  Winter disappear into the throng... 

                              JANE (O.S.)
                I ve been more hopeful lately...


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - OFFICE - DAY

  Jane sits with Lucy.

                              LUCY
                  Hopeful s good.   

  Then Lucy leans forward.  Always loves a secret.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                What did Richard do to turn you 
                around so fast?  

  Off Jane, a grin immerging...


  INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

  A four star establishment.  Richard enters.  Alone.  Goes to 
  the elevator.                                                                                59.




  INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY

  Ding!  The elevator doors open.  Richard steps off.  We 
  follow him down the hall.  Passing a beautiful BRUNETTE.  

  They won t look at one another.  

  Even when she slips him a room key.  


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - OFFICE - DAY

                              JANE
                I guess you could say -- Richard 
                finally showed me who he really 
                is...


  INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

  Richard enters using the SAME KEY the BRUNETTE slid him.

  The room is pristine, the bed untouched.  

  Except for a MAGAZINE.  Laying on the comforter.  

  Titled: PC UTILITIES.  A publication for the technically 
  inclined.  

  The COVER STORY in bold letters:

   IS YOUR PC SECURE? 

  Richard opens the magazine.  Finds a stack of cash between 
  pages.  He puts the cash in his money clip.  Rolls the 
  magazine, sticks it under his arm and exits, as we...


  INT. STEIN, LINSKY, MARGOLIS & WOO - OFFICE

                              LUCY
                Isn t that always the case.  Even 
                after years of marriage, kids, a 
                career, we all eventually find 
                  ourselves.  But, in our own time.

  Jane nods, knowingly, as we...                                                                                60.




  INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

  Jane pulls a HOT DISH from the oven.  Melanie and Rachel are 
  seated.  

                              MELANIE
                That chicken again?

                              JANE
                Yes.

                              MELANIE
                Thank god.  The food at school 
                sucks.   

                                RACHEL
                Trade you any day.

  Richard joins his girls at the table.  Kisses Melanie s head.

                              RICHARD
                Hey stranger.  How was your first 
                week?

                              MELANIE
                I met a boy.

                              RICHARD
                I was speaking academically, but 
                okay...

  Jane places the HOT DISH on the table.

                              MELANIE
                So, what s new around here?

                                RACHEL
                Please.  Same boring shit, 
                  different day.

                              RICHARD
                Pass the potatoes.

  Jane hands Richard the plate and sits down to dinner with her 
  family as if were any other day.  Only, it s not.  For Jane, 
  it s the first day of the rest of her life...


  INT. WALMART - AISLE - DAY

  Roger is stocking shelves.  Jane walks by.                                                                                61.



                              JANE
                Roger.  Break for lunch now.  Stock 
                the rest later.

                              ROGER
                Hey, you re the boss.

  As Roger scurries off, another WALMART EMPLOYEE approaches. 

                              EMPLOYEE
                Jane, your food s here.

  She hands Jane a BROWN PAPER BAG. 

                              JANE
                But I didn t order anything.

                              EMPLOYEE
                Well, some guy dropped it off.  
                Said it was paid for.  Over the 
                phone.

  The Employee walks away.  Jane stares at the bag.


  INT. WALMART - STORAGE ROOM - DAY

  Dark.  Dingy.  Shelves piled high.  

  Jane ENTERS carrying the BROWN PAPER BAG.  Stealing some time 
  alone.  She sits on the floor.  Opens the bag.  Searches 
  inside.  Expecting a clue.  But there s just a sandwich.  
  Jane has a closer look.  Shrugs.  Pleased.  Her favorite...

                              JANE
                Huh.  Turkey.

  Jane unwraps it.  Takes a bite.  Enjoys it.  Until...

  ...she flinches.  Has bitten into something hard.  She spits 
  it out.  It s a LAMINATED MESSAGE about an inch long.  

  It reads:

  Tomorrow.  4pm.  Union Station.

  Jane has gotten her first communication from Winter.  A smile 
  curls.  Her face lights up.  

  Suddenly, a noise from feet away.  Jane s smile disappears.  
  She looks around.  Sees nothing.                                                                                62.



                              JANE (CONT D)
                Hello?  Anybody there?

  Clifford reveals himself from behind the shelves.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Jesus.  You scared me.

                              CLIFFORD
                Sorry.

                              JANE
                What re you doing down here?

                              CLIFFORD
                Trying to steal a few minutes to 
                myself.  

                              JANE
                Yeah.  Me, too.

  Clifford takes a seat beside her.

                              CLIFFORD
                What are you smiling about?

                              JANE
                I love my new job.

  Only it s not exactly her promotion at Walmart Jane is 
  talking about, but...

                              CLIFFORD
                Well, that is great to hear.

                              JANE
                I mean, I haven t felt this kind of 
                  excitement in a long time, 
                  Clifford.

                              CLIFFORD
                I can see that.  You re all... 
                beaming and shit.

                              JANE
                I love it so much, I would eat it, 
                if I could.

                              CLIFFORD
                Now that s enthusiasm.                                                                                  63.



                              JANE
                Do you want to rip my clothes off, 
                  Clifford?

                              CLIFFORD
                What?  

                              JANE
                Let s just do it.

                              CLIFFORD
                It?

                              JANE
                Sex, Clifford.

                              CLIFFORD
                  Seriously?

                              JANE
                Yes.  I wanna fuck you, right now.  

  Then, Jane starts to laugh.  At herself.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                I can t believe I just said that.

                              CLIFFORD
                I can t either.

  Their laugh trails until--

                              JANE
                But seriously... do you?

                              CLIFFORD
                Wanna have sex with you?

                              JANE
                Yeah.

                              CLIFFORD
                I, I always want to.

  Jane kisses him.  Clifford kisses her back.  They make-out 
  like two sex starved teenagers.  It s primitive, messy... 
  until he suddenly pulls away.  

                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                Whoa.

  He pinches himself.                                                                                64.



                              CLIFFORD (CONT D)
                I ve had this dream so many times. 
                You re not like, on something are 
                you?  Or drunk?

                              JANE
                I m sober.  Promise.  
                      (happy to report)
                I am wide awake.

  With that, Jane kisses Clifford again, and as they fall back 
  onto the cold floor, we know we re not only witnessing two 
  people taking advantage of a lunch break, but the REBIRTH of 
  a Woman who had not been tasting the fruits of life... 

  ... until now.  And as Jane and Clifford rip each other s 
  clothes off, we can t help but root her on, knowing her world 
  is about to explode, as we...

  FADE TO BLACK.
