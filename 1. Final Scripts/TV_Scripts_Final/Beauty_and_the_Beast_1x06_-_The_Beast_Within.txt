      FADE IN:

      INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - OUTER - DAY

      Through the morning swirl, we PICK UP CATHY pouring herself
      coffee from the machine, sipping its bitter brew. She
      carries her cup and an armload of files to her cubicle,
      passing JOE coming out of the D.A.'s office.

                                          CATHY
                            What's going on in there?


                                          JOE
                            Looks serious. Marino says
                            to stick around until they're
                            done.

                                          CATHY
                            Why do I get the feeling I
                            better cancel lunch with my
                            father?

                                          JOE
                            Be happy to make it up to you
                            with dinner... ?

                                          CATHY
                            Sounds wonderful.

                                JOE       
                                    (stunned)  
                            You're kidding?

                                          CATHY
                                      (playful)
                            I'm sure dad would love to
                            have dinner with you
                            sometime.

      Joe gives her one of his looks... as EDIE passes with a
        newspaper.

                                          EDIE
                            Hey, Cathy, congratulations. "That
                            Catlady Reinstated" case? A real
                            gumshoe masterpiece.

                                   JOE
                            See how good we are to you,
                            Radcliffe? You get the
                            headline cases.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                              2.

      Behind them, the D.A.'s door opens. MARINO shakes hands
      with a delegation of weary-looking tough men in dark suits
      -- officials of a waterfront local.

                                          EDIE
                            Damn right. No corporation has
                            the right to fire an employee
                            just because she feeds stray
                            cats in their parking lot.

                                          CATHY
                                    (laughs)
                            One small case for Cathy
                              Chandler...

      Edie spots Marino heading their way with a dour expression.

                                          EDIE
                            -- One giant meow for the Rum Tum
                            Tugger.

      Edie makes her escape as:

                                          MARINO
                            Looks like you're going to be 
                            spending a few days in the port
                            of New York, Chandler.

                                          CATHY
                            Anything to get off cat patrol.
                            What's up?

                                          MARINO
                            The mob's trying to get back into
                            one of the longshoreman's locals.      
                                    (gestures after his
                                   visitors)

                            Those union guys are scared stiff.
                            It isn't just any mob. It's Mitch
                            Denton's.


                                          JOE
                            Denton? Didn't you put him away
                            five years ago?

                                          MARINO
                                    (nods)
                            Extortion and violence. He beat
                            the murder rap.

                                          CATHY
                                    And now he's out?

      Marino hands Cathy a bulging folder.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                    MARINO
                    The Waterfront Commission files.
                    Read 'em and weep. Then call De
                      Corsia at the union. He'll take
                    you down to the docks. See if
                    you can't get a few leads on what
                      Denton's up to.

                                    CATHY
                    Wait a sec. The guy Denton was
                      supposed to have beaten to death
                    with his own hands five years
                      ago... wasn't he a federal
                      investigator doing the same
                      thing?

                                    MARINO
                           (grim smile)
                      Better than the Rum Tum
                      Tugger, huh?

      On Cathy's apprehensive reaction:


      EXT. THE  PORT OF NEW YORK - ESTABLISHING - DAY

      The energy of the waterfront. The rumble of trucks and
      trains and forklifts, the clatter of cargo, the grumble of
      tugs, the counterpoint of ships' whistles. Giant cranes
      heave containers, some as large as boxcars, loaded and
      sealed in faraway lands, from the decks of ships to the
      backs of 18-wheelers. Hundreds of longshoremen. There's a
      movement and force to the waterfront as awesome as the
      sea itself.


      EXT. PIER  DAY

      We PAN from the open hatch of a cargo ship as the crane
      lifts a giant turbine generator... to a car pulling up on
      the dock.

      MITCH DENTON

      gets out of the car. Recently released from prison, his
      face is worn and lined, but he's charismatic, good-looking in
        a cruel way, a man given to sudden volcanic violences that
      come and go in a breath, often replaced by a sardonic laugh.
      He has a need to dominate that is truly dangerous.

      A muscular hiring boss, NAT, comes over.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                     4.

                    Six hundred and twenty-three guys
                    at five bucks a head. Not a bad
                    slice from these piers.

                                    DENTON
                              (unimpressed)
                    It's a start. Any trouble?

                            (a shrug)
                      You've been off the docks a few
                      years. Everybody don't know
                      you're back. Some of the
                      importers figure --

                                    DENTON
                    Tell them I'm doing the figuring
                    from now on. Next time I'll pull
                      a walkout. See how they like
                      their Nip cars sitting on the
                      docks for a month.

                                    NAT
                    Don't worry about it --

                                    DENTON
                    I'm not worried.
                            (beat)
                    What about Fraser?

                                    NAT
                    He's working in the hatch. I hear
                    he hasn't changed his mind about
                      talking to the union.

                                    DENTON
                            (a smile)
                      Hasn't he...? 

      Nat understands, nods... turns back to the ship and jumps
      down on the deck.


      INT. FREIGHTER HATCH - DAY

        Longshoremen are unloading another generator. CHARLIE
      FRASER steps away as the empty pallet descends. He's tough,
      good, natured, something of a leader among the men.

      ON DECK

      Nat catches the eye of the crane operator high above.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              5.

      CRANE OPERATOR

      as a wordless message passes between them.


      EXT. PIER - DAY

      Cathy approaches the ship with union official DE CORSIA,
      a beefy no-nonsense longshoreman who graduated up to a white
      collar.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    They say the waterfront spits
                      poison, breaks the backs of its
                      workers, and harbors the scum of
                    the world. That's all true, Miss
                      Chandler --
                            (a smile)
                    -- but God help me, I love this
                      place, stink and all.

      Cathy gazes around, awed by the power of the docks.

                                    CATHY
                    It's pretty overwhelming. I'm
                      afraid my waterfront education
                      began and ended with Marlon
                      Brando.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    Some things never change. Long
                    as there's piers and 'shoremen,
                      there's bloodsuckers to prey on
                      them.

                                    CATHY
                      You're the union. You must know
                      things we could use against people
                    like Denton.

                                    DE CORSIA
                              (shrugs)
                    We know lots of things_ But prove
                    them ... ? This is the waterfront.
                      Nobody talks.

      They start to board the cargo ship.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              6.

                              (continuing)
                    But I've managed to line up a
                      longshoreman who might know a
                    thing or two. A guy with real
                    guts who's sick and tired of
                      having a mob noose around his
                    neck. Name of Charlie Fraser.

      THE DECK

      as Nat yells down into the hatch.

                                    NAT
                      Fraser! Move it up!

      IN THE HATCH

      Fraser gives him a rude sign, finishes hitching the
      generator to the pallet.

                                    NAT
                              (yells to crane)
                    Okay, take it away.

      THE TURBINE GENERATOR

      rises out of the hatch, watched by longshoremen. One of

      them, a mean  looking jock called CUJO, inches closer to
      Fraser.

      MITCH DENTON

      watches from his car... waiting.

      CATHY

      glances up at the generator as De Corsia gets a worker to
      point out where Fraser is.

      THE CRANE OPERATOR

      suddenly appears to lose control.

      THE GENERATOR

        plunges downwards.

        CHARLIE FRASER

      in the middle of the hatch...  He jerks his head up as the
        generator hustles back towards him. Cujo pushes him
      forward. 

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              7 .

                      Fraser!

        A longshoreman tries to yank Fraser out of danger. Too
      late. The generator crashes down on him.

      CATHY - ON DECK

      rushes to stare down into the hatch.

                                    CATHY
                    Dear God!

      MITCH DENTON

      motions his driver with a sour smile.

                                    DENTON
                    Now everybody knows I'm back.

      As the car pulls away:

      CATHY

      joins De Corsia and the others around Fraser's crushed and
      broken body.

                                    DE CORSIA
                                    (grim)
                      Welcome to the waterfront.

      On Cathy's stricken face:


      EXT. WATERFRONT NEIGHBORHOOD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

      Burned out piers, tenement streets lit by dim lamps. A BOAT
      WHISTLE cries in the night. Some of the buildings are
      terrible, others are okay. We MOVE IN on one tenement that
      has its share of garbage, graffiti and grit, but doesn't
      have any windows broken out. It's like an old person trying
      to hold itself together -- doesn't look great but still
      trying.

      We HEAR VINCENT'S VOICE reading:

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              8.


      CONTINUED:

                                    VINCENT (V.O.)
                    "The deck was deserted, and he
                      crawled to the extreme end of it,
                    near the flagpole. There he
                      doubled up in limp agony. His
                    head swelled; sparks of fire
                      danced before his eyes; his body
                      seemed to lose weight, while his
                    heels wavered in the breeze."


      INT. SAM'S TENEMENT - NIGHT

      CAMERA PANS across this ancient and cracking place to pick
      up VINCENT reading from an old leather-bound first edition
      of Kipling's "Captains Courageous" to an arthritic older
      man with failing eyesight, SAM DENTON, propped up in bed
      on several pillows. Sam's a gaunt, rawboned man with a face
      that looks as if it were carved in granite... as if infinite
      suffering has been met with dogged, unyielding spiritual
      strength.

        A young boy from the underworld, LUKE, 14, sits with them.
      Tough, intelligent good looks with the blood of several
      races mixed in with a defiant but vulnerable nature.

                                    VINCENT
                              (reading)
                    "He was fainting from seasickness,
                    and a roll of the ship tilted him
                    over the rail on to the smooth
                    lip of the turtle-back. Then a
                    low, gray mother-wave swung out
                    of the fog, tucked Harvey under
                    one arm, so to speak, and pulled
                    him off and away to leeward; the
                      great green closed over him "

        Vincent stops. Sam's eyes are closed in reverie.

                                    VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                      Sam... ?

      He gently puts his hand on Sam's arm. The old man coughs,
      opens his eyes. 

                                          VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                      Sam? Are you all right? 

                                  SAM
                            (weary smile)
                Gave you a scare, did I?

        (CONTINUED)                                                                              9.

                              (softly)
                    What were you dreaming about?

                                    SAM
                      A great adventure... Being washed
                      overboard from a luxury liner... being
                      rescued from the waves by
                    the crew of an Atlantic fishing
                      schooner...

                                    VINCENT
                              (smiles)
                    It's late. You're tired. I should
                    get Luke home.

                                    LUKE
                    You just take it easy, Mr. D.
                    I'll be back tomorrow. Bring your
                      medicine, too.

      Sam smiles his appreciation.

                                    SAM
                      Thank you, Luke.

                                    VINCENT
                    We'll read some more tomorrow night.

      Vincent and Luke prepare to leave.

                                    SAM
                      "Captains Courageous." I like
                    this book. Never did get around
                    to reading Kipling.

                                    VINCENT
                      Never to read Kipling is almost
                    as bad as never being young ...
                    or never dreaming of sailing your
                    own boat across uncharted seas
                    to mysterious lands.

                                    SAM
                      Vincent ... ?

        Vincent motions Luke to wait, leans over the old man.

                                    VINCENT
                      What's wrong, Sam?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                      10.



                            SAM
                      Maybe you shouldn't come
                      again, not for a while.

                              VINCENT
                    Try not to
                            worry.
                            (lightly)
                    Don't you want to hear how the
                    fishing schooner sails to the
                    Great Banks?

                                    SAM
                    Don't care so much, Vincent. Not
                    about people --
                            (voice fading)
                      People always let you down.

      Vincent covers him up to let him sleep, turns off the light.

                                    VINCENT
                    You never let us down. I'll
                      always be here for you.

      Vincent leaves quietly with Luke.


      INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT

      Vincent and Luke return home.

                                    LUKE
                    The book's okay, I guess. But
                    who wants to read about sailing
                    to mysterious lands... ? I want
                    to do it.

                                    VINCENT
                    You will. Someday.
                            (smiles)
                      Thank you for coming tonight.
                      I know Sam appreciates your help.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              11.

                      Helping Sam or punishment chores
                      building walls? Easy choice.
                    This way, I get to skip a few
                      lessons.

                                    VINCENT
                              (disapproving)
                      You've skipped too many lessons
                      lately. What have you been up to?

                                    LUKE
                              (defensive)
                      Nothing. Other kids've done lots
                      worse than play hookey --

                                    VINCENT
                      I know that. Why are you so
                      angry?

                                    LUKE
                              (shrugs)
                    I'm not really angry. I just
                      haven't been feeling so great.

                                    VINCENT
                    What have you been feeling? Can
                    you tell me?

                                    LUKE
                              (grimaces)
                      I don't know. I'm fourteen years
                    old and everybody but you treats
                    me like a kid. I want to get out
                    of the tunnels for a while... have
                    some fun... do something
                      important.

                                    VINCENT
                      Maybe you'd like to come up to
                    the Brooklyn Bridge with me one
                      night?

                                    LUKE
                    The Brooklyn Bridge? Not exactly
                    my idea of a big night out. Now
                    if you said a ride in a Corvette

                    There are ways. That might be

                    But we have to make a deal. Sam
                      helped us for a lot of years,
                      didn't he? Where do you think
                    we got so much of our food from?
                      Helping him isn't much to ask in
                      return, is it?

                    He needs our help, so we help him.
                      That's our way.

      They're interrupted by KIPPER running to meet them.

                                    KIPPER
                    Got a message for you, Vincent.
      He hands Vincent the written message. He reads it quickly.

                                    VINCENT
                      I have to go. We'll talk later, 
                   Luke.

                                    LUKE
                      Remember ... a Corvette!

        Vincent gives Luke an affectionate touch... hurries away.

                                    LUKE
                    One day I'm gonna go up top as
                      often as Vincent.

                           KIPPER
                    That right?

                                    LUKE
                      Nobody tells Vincent,  Stay off
                    the streets.  No one pushes him
                      around. No one tells him who to
                    hang around with or what to do.
                      That's for me --

      Luke stares down the tunnel after Vincent.

      EXT. CATHY'S TERRACE  NIGHT

      CLOSE on photos, clippings and police records on Mitch
      Denton ... WIDENING to Cathy trying to absorb them. She
      sighs in frustration. There's a SOUND  She turns as Vincent
      appears behind her.

                                    CATHY
                      Vincent...

                                    VINCENT
                    It's been too long, Catherine.

      They almost embrace... hold back.

                                    VINCENT
                   I'm glad you sent word. There
                   are many things I need to
                   talk  about.

                                    CATHY
                      I need you, too. I feel so
                      angry... helpless. A brave man
                    was murdered today because he
                      wanted to talk to me.

      She throws the Denton files down bitterly, stares out across
      the city.

                                    CATHY
                              (continuing)
                      I used to love the breeze from
                    the river. Now I can only think
                    of the death that comes with it.

                                    VINCENT
                              (comforting)
                    Not always death. Sometimes I
                    go out to the harbor to see the
                      ships and I can sense the life
                    and feelings of men and women in
                      faraway lands. Their energies
                    and passions --
                              (sadly)
                    Of course, it's not true.
                      Feelings are not the same for
                      everyone. How could they be?

                                    CATHY
                      Vincent... what's troubling you?

                                    VINCENT
                      I don't know how to say it...
                      There are certain feelings that
                      confuse me.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                           14.
        CONTINUED:

                                    CATHY
                    Can you describe them?

                                    VINCENT
                              (hesitates)
                    The feelings that come from caring
                      about a child... a child like Luke.

                                    CATHY
                              (surprised)
                    The boy you told me about last
                    time? You said he's been in and
                    out of trouble for years.

                                    VINCENT
                    Not so much anymore. He's scared
                    and lonely. He hides his feelings
                      behind a protective wall.
                              (heartfelt)
                      Catherine... I don't know how it
                      happened... Luke's slipped into
                    my life, day by day. I've started
                    to feel as if he's my own flesh
                    and blood.

                                    CATHY
                      That s wonderful. I don't believe
                    any of us are given feelings of
                    love simply to hide them.

                                    VINCENT
                    You know what I am. You and
                      Father are the only family I have.
                      Luke's changed that. He was
                      abandoned as I was... needing
                      someone to guide him as I needed
                      Father to guide me. I want him
                    to have a chance for a decent life --

      He looks at her, eyes filled with longing.

                                    VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                    Did you mean what you said? About
                    not hiding feelings of love... ?

                                    CATHY
                              (softly)
                    Do you need to ask?

      They are suddenly very still, very aware of each other.
        Vincent moves to touch her hair ... then withdraws his hand.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)
                                                                                                                                     15.



                                    CATHY
                              (continuing)
                      I found something in my father's
                      library. It's from the Greek.
                      I wanted to give it to you -

                                    VINCENT
                      Tell me.

      Cathy picks up a sheet of paper with a poem written on it.

                                    CATHY
                       Thus every race on earth of men
                      and beasts, And the creatures of
                      the sea, The herds and birds of
                      brilliant hue, Are swept with
                      passion. Love is the same for
                      all."

                                    VINCENT
                              (echoing)
                        Love is the same for all --

      His hand closes over hers with deep love.

      EXT. WATERFRONT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

      Early morning. Luke whistles, carries a sack of groceries
      down the street to Sam's building... slows at the sight of a
      big car pulling up opposite.

      LUKE'S POV - MITCH DENTON

      gesturing his driver to stay... crossing the street.

      BACK TO LUKE

      watching curiously as Denton enters Sam's building.

      INT. TENEMENT LANDING - day

      Denton climbs the rickety stairs, stepping over loose
      boards. He knocks on Sam's door. The old man opens it,
      supporting himself on crutches.

                                          SAM
                            C'mon in, Luke. I was just --

      He stops, stares at Denton's crooked grin.

                                          DENTON
                            Hello, Sam. How are you?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              16.


      CONTINUED:

                                    SAM
                      What're you doing here?

                                    DENTON
                      Aren't you glad to see me? After
                    five years --

                                    SAM
                      I didn't ask you to come back.
                    What do you want now?

                                    DENTON
                    What kind of talk is that? I
                    heard the old ticker gave out on
                    you while I was in the cage. I
                    was worried. Can't I come in?

                                    SAM
                              (angry)
                      I don't want you here.

                                    DENTON
                    Easy, old man. The last guy who
                      talked to me like this --

                                    SAM
                              (nods slowly) 
                      You're a killer, all right.
                      Underneath that fancy suit --

                                    DENTON
                      Come on, Sam. You're my old man.
                      We've had enough wasted years
                      between us. Let me give you this
                      --


      He pulls out a roll of bills.

                                    SAM
                      Keep your blood money.

                                      DENTON
                      Have it your way. But I'm setting
                      myself up again in the old
                        neighborhood. I just thought we
                      could make up.

                                    SAM
                      How do you make up for all the
                      innocent people you've hurt and
                      killed? They should've kept you
                      locked up in prison.

       (CONTINUED)                                                             17.


        CONTINUED: (2)

                                    DENTON
                              (flaring)
                      The way you kept me locked up
                      for years?

        ANGLE TOP OF STAIRS

        where Luke has crept up to listen. He's startled by this
        confrontation.

      BACK TO SAM AND DENTON

                                    SAM
                      I tried to do the best I
                      could for you.

                                      DENTON
                      Sticking me down in those
                      tunnels like a rat?

                                    SAM
                      That's not the way it was! The
                      city was going to take you
                      away
                       - put you in some foster home
        Denton looks at him with a hard expression.

                                      DENTON
                      At least I would've breathed
                      fresh air every day.

      He storms away downstairs, past Luke pressed against the
        shadows. Sam hobbles out after Denton on his crutches.

                                    SAM
                      I did my best for you --

        There are tears in Sam's eyes. A pain and longing behind
        the rage that he cannot express. Luke stares at him in
        confusion as Sam's voice breaks:

                                   SAM
                              (continuing)
                     My son --


        INT. TENEMENT LOBBY - DAY

        Denton comes downstairs, angrily slams his fist against the
        stairwell, gains control of himself. He starts out into
        the street... has a thought... looks down the stairs into
        the basement. A bitter smile plays on his face. He decides
      to go down another flight.                                                                              18.


        INT. BASEMENT - DAY

        Denton pushes open the door against piled rubble and old
        boxes. He knows what he's looking for as he pulls a rotting
        old furnace aside to reveal a hidden area of crumbling
        brick. He pulls several bricks away, uncovers a tunnel
        entrance.

        ANGLE - LUKE

        watching from the basement door, stunned by Denton's
        knowledge of the tunnel.


      INT. TUNNEL - DAY

        Denton climbs through, clicks his lighter on to illuminate
        the way. He carefully heads down the tunnel, stops to cock
        his head at the distant CLANGING PIPES... nods to himself
      in recognition at the sound... moves on.

        LUKE

        far behind in the tunnel ... quickly finds a pipe, and a
        stone, taps out a message of warning to the underground.


        INT. FATHER'S CHAMBER - DAY

        Vincent and FATHER are studying some plants and flowers.

                                      FATHER
                      I've always loved flowers. Except
                      for Aphrodite, there's nothing
                      lovelier in the world than a 
                      flower.

                                    VINCENT
                      You really believe they
                      have feelings... ?

                                      FATHER
                      Of course. We only think they
                      lack feelings because we don't
                      take
                      the time to watch and learn
                      from them --

        Kipper bursts in.

                                      KIPPER
                      Intruder! Luke just sent a
                      warning. There's an intruder in
                      the tunnels --

      On their alarm:                                                                              19.


      INT. STEAM TUNNELS - DAY

        Denton's feet echo as he moves along the pipes... reaches an
        ancient heavy iron door. He hesitates, opens it, goes
        through.

      We SEE Luke following at a distance, deeply curious.


      INT. SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN - DAY

        Denton climbs down a rusty ladder set in the old brick.
      He looks around... frowns. This is unfamiliar. There's
      an old red-brown arch, filthy with decay... a deep black
        well. From the other side of the walls, there is a RUMBLE
      of drainage water. Denton gropes along the side of the
        well, looks down unhappily... decides to retrace his steps.

      As he reaches for the ladder again, there's a sudden GROWL
      from the darkness around him. He jumps back in fear.

                                      DENTON
                      Who's there...? 

      LUKE

        looks down from the top of the ladder, trying to see what's
        happening.

        DENTON

        stares at the shadow coming closer... looming over him.
        Then suddenly... he laughs.

                                      DENTON
                      Jesus! You scared the life outta
                      me!

        VINCENT

        emerges into the dim light. He's a powerful, intimidating
        figure. But Denton gets to his feet, unafraid, grinning.

                                      DENTON
                              (continuing)
                      Hello, Vincent. Don't you
                      recognize me? I've come home,
                      old friend. I've come home --

                                    VINCENT
                              (fierce)
                      Why are you here? You're not
                      welcome.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              20.


        CONTINUED:

                                      DENTON
                      Don't get so excited. I couldn't
                      resist. Came back to see the old
                      man, thought I'd check out the
                      tunnels --

                                    VINCENT
                      So you could find me?

                                    DENTON
                      Why would I want to do that, old
                      friend?
                              (grins)
                      Just because you refused me
                      sanctuary down here five years
                      ago? Because you chained me to
                     a pipe in the cellar of a police
                     precinct house? Those are old
                     headlines. 

                                    VINCENT
                      What do you want?


        Denton shrugs, looks around at the cracks and ledges and
      round black mouths of passages.

                                      DENTON
                      Told you. I was curious... You
                      changed the tunnel entrances.
                      I got lost.

                                    VINCENT
                      We change them all the time...
                      to keep out scavengers.

                                      DENTON
                      Now you've hurt my feelings. Me,
                        a scavenger? Hey, remember how
                      afraid you were of the drainage
                      water going out to the harbor --

                                    VINCENT
                              (growling dangerously)
                      What I remember is that you
                      murdered a man... that you chose
                      to live by violence. I remember
                      that you ceased to be one of us
                      years ago.

                                      DENTON
                      What are you trying to do? Tell
                      me off? Why, you lousy freak --

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                        21.

                                    VINCENT
                      Leave the underground. Now. If
                      you come again, I can only
                        believe you intend us harm.

                                    DENTON
                              (sneers)
                        Come back here? You think I'd
                        want to hang around this hole?
                        Eight years I lived down here
                        and what did it get me -- ?

                                    VINCENT
                        You were a fool. You had a
                        chance for a better life -- if
                        you'd had the sense to see it.


                                      DENTON
                        Living like a rat? I got a chance
                        at a better life -- but I took
                        it! After I ran away from here, I
                        had to sweat blood to get work in
                        the stinking hold of a cargo
                        ship. Taking over the docks took
                          a little doing, you know. Some
                        pretty mean guys were in the way-
                        -

                                      VINCENT
                        And you had them killed

                                      DENTON
                              (taunting)
                        If you believe that... kill me.
                        You're a dangerous animal,
                        aren't you? Kill me now.

        Vincent's fangs draw back. But he turns away, opens a grill
        doorway.

                                    VINCENT
                        I'll show you the way out.
                        Don't ever come back.

                                      DENTON
                              (cynical smile)
                        I knew you couldn't hurt me. Same
                        old noble Vincent. The animal who
                        thinks he can walk like a man.

        Denton saunters out. On Vincent's barely restrained rage

                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                            ACT TWO


      FADE IN:

      INT. TUNNEL - DAY

      CLOSE on bricks and mortar being used to block up a tunnel
        entrance... WIDENING to Vincent directing Kipper and several
      other kids at work.

                                    VINCENT
                        Block off all the entrances
                        around here. He mustn't be
                        allowed to find his way back
                        down.

                                    KIPPER
                        Be done in a couple of hours.


      As Kipper moves off to direct the building crew, Luke
      appears at Vincent s side, carrying the leather-
      bound "Captains courageous."


                                    LUKE
                        Thought I'd go up top and see
                        Mr. D. Maybe read to him a
                        bit.

                                    VINCENT
                        What's this? You're
                          volunteering?

                                    LUKE
                              (shrugs)
                        I like old Sam.

                                    VINCENT
                            (a smile)
                        He'll be happy to see you again.

      Luke turns, hesitates.

                                    LUKE
                              (intrigued)
                        I used to hear some of the
                        older kids talk about Mitch
                        Denton. How he really made it
                        big on the surface.

                                    VINCENT
                        He didn't make anything,
                        Luke. He broke and
                          destroyed human beings.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                          23.

                      I guess he must've done a lot of
                      rotten things. But he sure showed
                      everybody he was something special
                    and could do what he wanted.

                                    VINCENT
                              (forceful)
                    You don't know anything about him.
                      Denton was like a cancer in our
                      community --

                                    LUKE
                      I heard what he said to you. I
                    know what he meant. He was sick
                    of being nothing.

                                    VINCENT
                      Listen to me, Luke. If you'd seen
                    the things Denton has done --

                                    LUKE
                    I've seen enough things.
                              (bleak)
                    I've seen my moma bleed to death
                    like a pig 'cas some junkies slit
                    her. She was falling and trying
                    to stay on her feet... I watched
                    her die. I was crying.
                              (defiant)
                    Well, I ain't never gonna cry
                      again!

        Moist-eyed, he hurries away before Vincent can stop him.

                                    VINCENT
                    Luke!

      But the boy's gone. On Vincent's concern:


      EXT. THE WATERFRONT - ESTABLISHING - DAY


      INT. UNION OFFICE - DAY

      Cathy's pleading with the union official, De Corsia, and
      several longshoremen, whom we should recognize from the cargo
      hatch earlier. JACK SWEENEY is the young longshoreman who
      tried to push Fraser to safety. McQUADE is a hard little
      bantam of a man. SHANKS a good-natured, hulking longshoreman.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    If you could just give me one
                      piece of evidence linking Denton
                    to your friend's murder, we'd have
                      a start.

                                    DE CORSIA
                    Come on, guys. We can't help you
                      unless you help us. I know each
                    one of you puts in a few bucks
                    every day to Denton to keep
                      working --

                                    SWEENEY
                    Big help the union's been --
                              (bitter)
                      I told Fraser there'd be no use
                    talking to you. Keep quiet, we'll
                    all live longer.

                                    McQUADE
                      Denton killed Fraser and I don't
                    aim to be next. 

                                    CATHY
                           (exasperated)
                    Then why did you agree to meet
                    me now?

                                    SHANKS
                      Because Fraser was our friend.
                    He thought the union and the D.A.
                    could help.

                                    DE CORSIA
                              (sighs)
                    Our union investigators confirmed
                    the crane operator's story.
                      Mechanical malfunction.

                                    SWEENEY
                      Mechanical malfunction, my ass!
                    Who paid off those investigators?
                    I saw Cujo push Charlie Fraser
                    right under that generator.

                                    CATHY
                    Then give me a sworn statement --

                    And risk my family's lives? Sorry,

                      That's exactly what you have to

                    I'm sorry. We've done all we can.

      Cathy and De Corsia sadly watch the men file out.

                    He's right. Took a lot of guts to
                    show their faces here.

      INT. SAM'S TENEMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

      Luke enters, tentative, sensing something wrong.

                                    LUKE
                    It's me, Luke. I got your
                      groceries. Hey --

      A hand suddenly lifts him bodily by the scruff of his neck.
        A SCAVENGER THIEF -- grungy, scarred, doped out of his mind.
      The SECOND SCAVENGER has Sam trembling at knifepoint,
      crutches kicked out from under him.

                      Get in here, kid.
                      SCAVENGER
                                  LUKE
                            (struggles
                    )
                    Let me go!

      The scavenger backhands him across the room.

                                    SAM
                      Leave the boy alone!

                                      SCAVENGER
                    Stay down, you old buzzard!

      The second Scavenger presses the point of his knife against
      Sam.

                                    SECOND SCAVENGER
                      Start talking, grandpa. You gotta
                    have something around here that's
                      worth more than ten cents.

                                    SAM
                    Take whatever you want -- for
                      God's sake, don't hurt the boy
                    --
                                    SECOND SCAVENGER
                      Old man's wasting our time.

                                      SCAVENGER
                    Cut him.


                                                                  (CONTINUED

      CONTINUED:

      The second scavenger's breathing hard, eyes lit up in
      orgasmic bliss as he fondles his knife. But he doesn't get
      any further. Mitch Denton bursts into the apartment, heaves
      the knife-wielder off his feet with maximum force... cannons
      him into the wall. The first scavenger throws the bedside
      lamp. Denton ducks. The lamp smashes. Luke scrambles to
      pull Sam free of the melee as Denton brings his knee into
      the scavenger's groin. SHOUTS of anguish. The scavengers
      run for their lives.

                                    DENTON
                            (breathing hard)
                    Sam -- you okay?

      Denton helps Luke get Sam upright in a chair.

                                    SAM
                      I'm fine -- fine --

                                    DENTON
                    What the hell happened?

                                    SAM
                      Scavengers! Lousy scavengers!
                      I was asleep when they broke in.

                                    DENTON
                      Lucky I came back.

                                    SAM
                    Why the hell did you?

                                    DENTON
                    Is it so terrible to want to see
                    my old man? I've been having a
                    yen to mend our fences. You
                      complaining?

                                    SAM
                      Can't complain about your timing.
                              (gruff)
                      I guess a small part of you's
                      still the old Mitch.

                                    DENTON
                      That's more like it, Sam.
                            (at Luke)
                      Who's the kid?

                                    SAM
                              (suddenly wary)
                    He helps me. Brings me stuff.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              28.

                      a friend of mine.

      Denton curiously picks up the fallen copy of  Captains
        Courageous  as Luke reaches for it.

                      What're you getting so excited

      Luke senses danger. He backs off, raises his fists, body
      tense.

                                    LUKE
                      Don't come near me, man.

                                    DENTON
                      I wasn't going to.

                                    LUKE
                    Like hell you wasn't. I've seen
                    that look before. I know what it

                                    DENTON

      He gazes curiously at Luke.


      INT. FATHER'S CHAMBER  - DAY

      Father paces restlessly, deeply disturbed by Vincent's
      report.

                                  FATHER
                      This is bad news. Denton is a
                      force of evil. Pure.
                        Intelligent. Vicious. At war
                      with the world and himself.

                                    VINCENT
                      What am I to do if he comes again?
                      He's a danger to us all. I tried
                      to reason with him --

                                  FATHER
                      Reason with that man? For
                      centuries, we've struggled to
                      break the chains that bind us to
                      evil. Buddha in India...
                      Confucious in China... Plato and
                      Aristotle in Greece... they lit
                      the beacon fires, gave us the dawn
                      of hope and knowledge and
                      reason... yet still, still we
                      confront the eternal evil. No,
                      Vincent. Don't try to reason with
                      a man like Mitchell Denton.
 
        Kipper enters, disturbed.

                                    FATHER
                              (continuing)
                    It's all right, Kipper. What is
                    it?

                                  KIPPER
                    I'm not sure, Father. One of the
                    runners just saw Luke near the
                    east steam tunnels.

                                    VINCENT
                             (a smile)
                    He's' got exactly five minutes to
                    get back in time for his lesson.

                                    KIPPER
                    I don't think he's coming back
                    for his lesson. The runner saw
                    him with Mitch Denton.

                                    VINCENT
                      Denton --

                      That's what he said. Luke's
                      brought Denton back into the
                      tunnels --

    On Vincent's shock:

      INT. TUNNELS - DAY

      CLOSE on the initials "M.D." inscribed in old brick...
      WIDENING to Denton showing them to Luke.

                                    LUKE
                      You're "M.D?" And I thought this
                    was my special place.

                                    DENTON
                    My special place, too. Had to
                      bloody a lot of noses to keep it
                    just for me.

                                    LUKE
                      Me, too.
                              (grins)
                    You still fight pretty good. The
                    way you handled those scavengers
                    -- that was great.

                                    DENTON
                      Maybe I'll teach you a few tricks
                      when you come up top again. How'd
                      you end up down here, anyway?
                      Run away from home?

                                    LUKE
                      I didn't run away from home. Home
                      ran away from me when my mom
                      became a dopey. Our place was
                      a real shooting gallery.

                                    DENTON
                              (sympathetic)
                      Tough. What happened to your old

                      I never knew him. How come Mr.
                      D sent you down here for Father
                    to raise?


                                    DENTON
                    Sam was too ill to raise me
                      himself -- after mom died. I used
                    to hate him for that... until
                    a few years in the can gave me
                    time to think things over. I
                    don't hate him any more --
                            (hard)
                    But I hated every day I was down
                    here. The tunnels were meant for
                      freaks like Vincent --

                                    LUKE
                    Hey, don't call Vincent a freak.
                    He's my friend.

                                    DENTON
                    He's not a man -- not like you
                    and me --

      Something hard and ominously sharp grips Denton's neck. He
      freezes... as Vincent emerges from the shadows, holding
      Denton with his claw, able to rip his throat in a single
      movement.

                                    VINCENT
                    Luke? Are you all right?

                                    DENTON
                              (gasping)
                    It's not what you think. I wasn't

                      Father's waiting for you, Luke.
                    Go to him.

      Luke takes off at a run. Denton swallows with difficulty,
      sweat breaking out all across his face.


                                    VINCENT
                              (continuing)
                      I told you what would happen if
                    you came back.

                                    DENTON
                      Vincent -- Please!

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              32.

                    That boy is like a son to me.

      Vincent's claws dig into Denton's neck. Denton finds
      himself lifted almost off the ground.

                                    VINCENT
                    Leave the boy
                      alone.

      He drops Denton free. Denton scrambles away, clutching his
      throat, hissing resentfully.

                                    DENTON
                      That's a good one. Like a son
                    to you? That kid's like me, not
                    you.
                              (taunting)
                      Dream about it all you want,
                      Vincent -- but a freak can't be
                      a father to anyone.

      He scuttles away down the tunnel, leaving Vincent stricken
      with pain and rage.


      EXT. ALLEY -- TUNNEL EXIT  DAY

      Denton bursts through a coal chute to an alley in the
        outside world. He's startled to find Luke waiting.


                                  LUKE
                            (defiant)
                    I'm not a kid. Vincent shouldn't
                    push me around.

      Denton smiles with cynical pleasure.

                                    DENTON
                      That's right, Luke. You're not
                      a kid any more.

      He puts a fatherly arm around the boy. And as they head off
        together:
                                                                FADE OUT.

      EXT. D.A.'S OFFICE AND STREET - DAY

      Cathy returns to the office. Kipper dashes up and drops a
      message into her hand, quickly zips away. Cathy reads the
      message... understands, hurries away from the office.



      EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEAR DRAINAGE DUCT - DAY

      Cathy glances around... enters the duct.


      INT. DRAINAGE DUCT - DAY

      She finds Vincent waiting in the darkness.

                                    CATHY
                              (anxious)
                      Vincent... ? What's wrong? You've
                      never called me here during the
                      day --

                                    VINCENT
                            (urgently)
                      Catherine, I need your help.
                      Luke's run away.  He's gone with
                      Mitch Denton.

                                    CATHY
                      Why would he go with Denton?

                                    VINCENT
                      There's a side to Luke that's
                      tough and hard. Denton is drawing it
                    out to get back at me. Can
                      you help ?

                                    CATHY
                    Of course. But it'll be tough.
                    I'll need a search warrant for
                      Denton's office and home ... all
                    the waterfront holes he might be
                      keeping Luke. God, I don't know if
                      I can get one --

                                    VINCENT
                      I've got to find Luke. If Denton
                      harms him --

                                    CATHY
                    He has no reason to harm him.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    Do I shock, you, Catherine? You
                    know there's something inside me
                    that waits for my anger... feeds
                    on my rage... and strikes without
                      mercy.

                                    CATHY
                    No! You've only harmed others
                    when there's been danger --

                    When I feel pain... emotional
                    pain. I feel that for Luke. If
                      Denton were here now, something
                    evil inside me would make me
                    destroy him --

                      You're wrong, Vincent. There's
                    no evil in you, not the smallest
                      trace. The emotion you feel for
                    Luke is the love any father feels
                    for a child he cares about.

                                    VINCENT
                    The more I feel for Luke, the more
                      I sense this terrible rage. How
                    can I hold it back? The only way
                    is to love Luke less --

                                    CATHY
                    You could never do that.

                                    VINCENT
                    No --

                                    CATHY
                    It's the price we pay for love.
                    You feel, you need, you hurt --

                    thing inside me -- this thing I
                      cannot control -- that makes me

      She sees the depths of Vincent's pain. As tears fill

      EXT. BRIDGE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

      An old rusty bridge spanning a less travelled part of the
      river.


      EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - BASE OF BRIDGE - DAY

      Luke gazes with fascination at the barge tethered under the
      bridge as several muscular men unload cargo crates and carry
      them into a couple of old shacks, once used to house
      equipment for the bridge. We PICK UP Denton wheeling and
      dealing with a few associates, including the hiring boss,
      Nat, and the longshoreman, Cujo (both seen earlier during
      Charlie Fraser's murder.) Luke goes over to him, concerned.

                                    DENTON
                    Get away with those video units
                    last night?
                                    CUJO
                      I faked the bills of lading.
                      Customs won't even know they're
                      gone.

                                    DENTON
                    What I like to hear. Give me a
                      tally on this, will you, Luke?
      He hands Luke the bills of lading.
                                    LUKE
                      You want me to count these?

                                    DENTON
                    When I was your age, I used to
                      count the boss' cut every day.

                     LUKE
           
        (pleased)
                 Well, sure  -                
                       (uncertain)
                      But... is all this stuff stolen?

                      I did some favors for a few guys,

      Denton ruffles Luke's hair... moves off with Nat.

                                    NAT
                      Taking a chance, aren't you, with
                    this kid?

                                    DENTON
                    He's okay. He's got brains and
                      he'll never tell what he sees.

                            (grunts)
                      You're sure?

                      I know this kid like I know
                      myself.
                              (twisted smile)
                      I also know an old friend who's
                    not going to like Luke being with
                    me one little bit. And that's
                    the best reason of all to have
                    him here.

      Luke brings the bills back over.

                    Good work, Luke. How'd you like
                    to do a little more work for me?
                    Make yourself some pocket money?

                    So forget phone taps. But if we
                    pull out all the stops... put
                    as many people on Denton as we
                    can spare...

                                    MARINO
                      That's crazy. I'm already
                      understaffed. Until you get
                      something I can take to a judge
                    --

      Joe crosses their path in time to hear:

                                    CATHY
                    I've already got a longshoreman
                    who saw the guy who pushed Charlie
                      Fraser under the generator.

                                    JOE
                    Where is he? Where's his
                      statement?

                                    CATHY
                              (reluctantly)
                    He won't come forward yet.

                                    MARINO
                    You give me that longshoreman --
                    then you get your surveillance
                      order.

                                    CATHY
                              (distraught)
                    We can't wait. For God's sake

      She catches herself. Marino and Joe are staring at her.

                                    MARINO
                    Tell me, Chandler, why did you
                    want to work in the D.A.'s office?

                                    CATHY
                      Because I wanted to make a
                      difference. What's that got to
                    do--

                                                                  (CONTINUED)         

                                                                                 39.


      CONTINUED: (2)

                                    MARINO
                      That's fine and dandy. But if
                    you don't mind my saying so,
                      you've had kind of a rarefied
                      upbringing. This isn't Camelot.
                      I don't send knights into battle
                      against dragons. We're down and
                      dirty. That means a lot of sweat
                    and legwork so that we can
                      prosecute according to the law.
                      Evidence, Chandler. Evidence!

      Marino steps into the elevator. Discussion's over. As the
      doors close on him, Joe gives Cathy a sympathetic look.

                                    JOE
                      Better learn how to grow an extra
                      layer of skin.

                                    CATHY
                              (sharp)
                    You mean pretend I don't care?

                                    JOE
                    Low blow, Radcliffe.

                                    CATHY
                      I'm sorry, Joe 


                                      JOE
                              (softly)
                      We all know you care, Cathy.
                      Sometimes that just isn't
                      enough.

      On Cathy'S frustration:


        EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT  NIGHT 

      We PAN from a dark warehouse to a couple of trucks parked in
        shadows... tough guys assembling... to Denton's car further
        back. Nat and Cujo leave the car to join the other men.
        Denton holds back, pointing out a high window in the
        warehouse to Luke... who's increasingly uneasy.

                                      DENTON
                      When you get through the window,
                      keep to the stairs and come down
                      to the first level. You know how
                      to unlock a fire exit?

                                    LUKE
                      That window? You're kidding.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                              40.


      CONTINUED:

                                    DENTON
                      I'm kidding? Do I look like I'm
                      kidding?

                                    LUKE
                      I didn't figure on something like
                      this, Mitch. I mean, I want to
                      work with you --
                              (at the trucks)
                      But this is a heavy duty heist.

                                    DENTON
                      A few high tech micro-computers...
                      Nobody's even going to know
                      they're gone.

                                    LUKE
                      I don't want to mess with it,
                      okay?

      Denton grabs him by the arm, twisting. Luke grimaces in
      pain.

                                    DENTON
                      What's the matter with you? I
                      thought you knew something. I
                      thought you learned something from
                      me.

                                    LUKE
                      I don't want to go up there. It's
                      stupid --

                                    DENTON
                              (fierce)
                      You're stupid, kid. I'm going
                      to give you two seconds to get
                      hold of yourself. Then you're
                      going through that window. You're
                      not going to make me look bad in
                      front of these guys.
                              (deadly)
                      And if you screw up, I'm gonna
                      bust you. I can do a whole lot
                      of wicked stuff to you

      And as Luke writhes in terror:


      INT. WATERFRONT BAR - NIGHT

      Cathy enters, finds Jack Sweeney in a back booth, brooding
      over a drink. She goes over.

                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                      41.





                                    CATHY
                    Buy you a drink?

                                    SWEENEY
                    Don't give up, do you?

      She slips into the booth.

                                    CATHY
                      I need a sworn statement that you
                    saw Denton's man push your friend
                    under the generator. 

                                    SWEENEY
                    You're crazy. Only way to smash
                    Denton is with a steel pipe in
                   a dark alley. Maybe one night
                   I'll do just that.

                                    CATHY
                      Denton will kill you and plead
                      self-defense. Help me fight him
                    in court with the D.A. and the
                    union behind you.

                                    SWEENEY
                    You know what you're asking?
                      You're asking me to --

                                    CATHY
                              (appealing)
                      Please, Mr. Sweeney. What if I
                    tell you a young boy's life is
                    at risk ?

                                    SWEENEY
                    My family's lives are already at
                      risk. In God's name, what do you
                    want from me?

                                    CATHY
                      Wrong question, Mr. Sweeney. What
                    do you want from yourself... ?
      On Cathy's appeal and Sweeney's anguish:                                                                              42.


      EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

      Luke peers over the edge. A long way down. Nat finishes
        unrolling a rope ladder down past the window. Cujo hands
      Luke a canvas bag. The boy shoulders it, swings over the
      edge of the roof onto the ladder. The rope sways
        dangerously. But there's no escape for Luke. He grits his
      teeth... moves down until he reaches:

      THE WINDOW

      Luke pulls out a chisel and crowbar from his bag. A
      precarious moment. He jimmies the window open, heaves
      himself inside.

      ANGLE - MITCH DENTON

      down below, seeing Luke vanish from sight.


      INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRS - NIGHT

      Luke uses a flashlight from his bag... creeps down past a
      door. The light and sounds of a security guard's TV.

                                    GUARD'S VOICE
                    Who's there?

      Luke snaps off his light... freezes.

                                    GUARD'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                    Hey, down there!

        FOOTSTEPS from above. Luke races down the stairs. The
      guard FIRES. CRACK! The bullet whacks into a wall. Luke
      gasps as slivers of brick cut the side of his face.


      EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WATERFRONT - NIGHT

        Vincent is brooding across the dark waters... jerks his head
      up at the sound of ALARMS.


      EXT. DENTON'S CAR - NIGHT

      Denton rages as ALARMS sound. He yells to the trucks.

                                    DENTON
                      Take off! Take off!

      He dashes back to his car.                                                                              43.


      EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

      Vincent throws caution to the wind... races with the speed
      of a lion.


      EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT

      Luke breaks free of the fire exit... runs like crazy for
      Denton's car.

                                    DENTON
                    Over here! Kid! Over here!

      Denton's driver squeals the car towards Luke to pick him up.
      Denton holds his door open.

      LUKE

      is suddenly transfixed in an overwhelming glare -- the
      headlights of one of the trucks careening around to escape.

        VINCENT

      arrives... sees what's going to happen... his horror.

                                    VINCENT
                     Luke!  No!


      LUKE

      spins around... the truck is upon him. There's a sickening
        crunch. His body hits the ground.

      DENTON

      sees Vincent... slams his door shut.

                                    DENTON
                      Get outta here!

        VINCENT

      rushes to Luke's unconscious body. Behind him, guards and
      lights and alarms. They haven't spotted him yet.

                                    VINCENT
                    Luke --

      A sob breaks from him. He tenderly cradles Luke in his
      arms. The boy seems dead. And as Vincent's grief erupts
      in a terrible bone-chilling CRY of pain and despair and
        rage...

                                                                FADE OUT.


                         END OF ACT THREE

                                                                                          44.

      FADE IN:

      INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - CUBICLES - NIGHT

      Late. Edie looks in on Cathy, brooding at her desk.

                                    EDIE
                    Penny for them?

                                    CATHY
                    What... ? Oh. I don't know.
                      Nothing. Everything. My job.
                    The waterfront. A friend in
                      trouble. Sometimes, I feel as
                    if I'm no use to anybody.

                                    EDIE
                    Easy, girl. All part of life's
                    rich pageant.

                                    CATHY
                              (laughs)
                    Come on. Buy me a drink.

      She reaches for her coat... stops at the sight of Jack
      Sweeney. He smiles awkwardly.

                                    SWEENEY
                      I talked to my wife. Kids, too.
                    We all figure the same. It's time
                    to stop letting Mitch Denton walk
                    all over us.

                                    CATHY
                              (lighting up)
                    Mr. Sweeney, I could kiss you.
                    In fact, I think I will!

      She hugs him joyfully... as the phone rings. Edie picks up.

                                    EDIE
                      D.A.'s office... She's right here.
                              (to Cathy)
                    The hospital -- ?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                            45.

                      ... I don't
                        understand...
                                (stunned)
                      ... oh, God, no... of course...
                      I'll be there right away...

        Edie and Sweeney stare at the shock on Cathy's face:


      INT. HOSPITAL - CRITICAL CARE AREA - NIGHT

      The distraught Cathy rushes in. A NURSE moves to stop her.

                                    NURSE
                    You'll have to stay outside --

      Cathy runs to where the DOCTORS are working full-speed on
      Luke. She stops short, devastated by the sight of him.
      His head is bandaged. Plastic tubes feed oxygen into his
      nose. Needles feed a colorless potion into his arm. White
      discs like suction cups on his smashed and bloody chest.
      The rhythms of his heart blipping on a screen.

                                    NURSE
                      Please... The doctor has to give
                    his full attention to the boy.

                                    CATHY
                      How bad is it... ?

                                    NURSE
                    He's in critical condition. His
                      right lung isn't exiting air.
                      Either it's full of blood or its
                      collapsed --

                                    CATHY
                      Luke --

                                    NURSE
                    Is that his name? We didn't know.
                      Somebody carried him here. There
                      was just a note with your name
                    on it.

                                    CATHY
                    If I could see him for a moment
                    --


                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                           46.

      CONTINUED:

                                    NURSE
                      That's impossible. There's been
                    brain injury. A ruptured artery.
                    If you'll just wait --
      Cathy stares back at Luke as the nurse tugs her away.


      INT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

      CLOSE on Vincent as a CRY of pain bursts from him...
      WIDENING to Cathy, sadly gazing at him.

                                    CATHY
                      They'll be operating all night.

                                    VINCENT
                      He's dying --

                                    CATHY
                    We don't know that. You got him
                    to the hospital in time. Luke
                    could pull through.

                                    VINCENT
                    I let him down. I should have
                      protected him.

                                    CATHY
                      Don't blame yourself. You did
                      everything you could. When the
                      police find Denton  

        Vincent's eyes glitter with hatred.

                                    VINCENT
                      I know where Denton is. I sent
                      runners out.

                                    CATHY
                      Where... ?

                                    VINCENT
                      I can't tell you. Forgive me,
                      Catherine. I have to do this
                      alone.

                                    CATHY
                    What are you talking about? I've
                    got a witness. We can move against
                      Denton now --

                                                                  (CONTINUED)



                                                                                           47.


      CONTINUED:

                                    VINCENT
                    It's too late. This time he has
                    to die.

                                    CATHY
                    That won't help Luke. You're in
                    pain. Don't let your feelings
                    take over  -

                                    VINCENT
                      I loved Luke. If I were truly
                    his father, wouldn't I have the
                    same need -- ?

                                    CATHY
                              (appalled)
                     The need to punish ... not to kill.

                                    VINCENT
                    Do I repel you now, Catherine?
                    You find me very ugly -- like a
                      beast?

                                    CATHY
                      I love you, Vincent. Nothing can
                      change that. But what you're
                    doing is wrong. Very wrong.

                                    VINCENT
                      I keep seeing Luke broken in my
                    arms --
                            (eyes lost)
                    You said it yourself. "Love is
                    the same for all --"

      He turns into the darkness... and the full horror of what
      he intends to do hits Cathy.

      ON VINCENT - MOVING SHOTS

      as he travels through the shadows... different kinds of
      tunnels... moving faster... until he is hurtling at
      incredible speed. Steam begins to swirl around him. A
      warrior in the mists.


      EXT. DENTON'S BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The sweep of steel, arching across the sky... the movements
      of armed men on guard.                                                                              48.


      INT. BRIDGE TOWER - GENERATOR ROOM - NIGHT

      Denton stares from the open door at the darkness and the
      glow of the city beyond the river. Behind him: old
      machinery in what might have been a generator room to
      provide electricity to light the bridge.

      Nat joins him.

                                    NAT
                    You scared of this guy? How do
                    you even know he'll come after
                    you?

                                    DENTON
                    The kid must be dead. He'll come.

                                    NAT
                    I still don't get it. Who is he?
                    What's he look like?

                                    DENTON
                    When he comes... you'll know him.

      On Denton's bleak look:


      INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

        Vincent lies on his stomach, gripping the roof of a subway
      car as it hurtles through the darkness.


      INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - NIGHT

      Cathy paces anxiously ... turns quickly as Father appears.

                                    CATHY
                      Thank God you came. Do you know
                    what he's gone to do?

                                    FATHER
                              (sadly)
                      I know. I tried to stop him, too.
                      There's a fire in Vincent that
                    has to burn itself out.

                                    CATHY
                    Do you know where he is? We have
                    to stop him.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              49.


      CONTINUED:

                                    FATHER
                    You can't stop him. I've always
                    been afraid a time like this would
                    come. When that instinct to kill
                    would rise up from deep within
                      Vincent --

                                    CATHY
                    We have to stop him! One half
                    of Vincent is struggling against
                    the other.
                              (voice breaking)
                    If that instinct triumphs over
                    the man --

                                    FATHER
                    He will never allow himself to
                    go on living.

                                    CATHY
                    Tell me where he's gone!

                                  FATHER
                            (long beat)
                    To a bridge --


      EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

        Vincent explodes through brick and wood of a walled up old
      duct. He scrambles to the surface, stares breathlessly out
      at the river. Turns... and sees the bridge.


      EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT


      CLOSE ON an armed guard looking out over the river.
        Vincent's arm reaches INTO FRAME and hooks him around the
      neck, pulling him down into the shallows. A GURGLING
      sound... silence.


        Vincent leaps up the bank towards the huts at the base of
      the bridge. He scans the land with feral instinct... He
      senses Denton's presence behind a high lighted window. His
      fangs draw back. A low growl.


        There's the ratchet-click of an automatic weapon being
        recocked. Another guard, searching for his partner. He
      turns... sees Vincent charging down upon him with terrifying
      force. Vincent rips the guard apart. Bullets spew wildly.


                                                     (CONTINUED)                                                                                      50.


      CONTINUED:

      THE TOWER DOOR slams open. The gunfire brings YELLS inside.
      Glaring light frames a shadow with an automatic weapon.
      Vincent lets go a blood-curdling snarl... and again life
      leaves a guard. Vincent slips inside the tower.


      INT. BRIDGE TOWER - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT

      On a high balcony overlooking a chamber filled with rusting
      equipment, Denton stands holding a pistol as Nat and Cujo
      run out of another chamber with guns.

                                    DENTON
                      Get down there!

      Nat and Cujo clatter downstairs.


      INT. GENERATOR ROOM - NIGHT

      Vincent's cloak vanishes behind machinery, into the shadows
      as Nat and Cujo burst inside... crisscross the room with
      bullets. They stop firing. Silence--


      INT. UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

      Denton nervously moves away from the stairs. He can just
      about see the door Nat and Cujo ran through. He hears a SCREAM.
      Then a SHOT. SNARLS. The SOUND of something human being ripped
      to shreds. And silence.


                                    DENTON
                     Nat... ? Cujo... ?



      Denton backs into:


      INT. UPPER CHAMBER - NIGHT

      A kind of old office. Cramped. Broken furniture. A window
        overlooking the river. Denton nervously waits. He HEARS a
      SOUND from outside. Somebody coming up the stairs. He
      stands rigid, off to the side by the window, waiting, gun
        extended.


      EXT. BRIDGE ROAD - NIGHT


        Cathy's car careens to a halt. She runs out... sees the
      fallen guards.  Fearing the worst, she runs to the tower.         51.


      INT. UPPER CHAMBER - NIGHT

      CAMERA FRAMES the open door. Suddenly the FRAME is filled
      by the sweaty, distorted face of Denton as he readies to
      fire. The SOUND comes closer. Nat staggers inside, ripped
      and bleeding, steps into Denton's arms. Denton pushes him
      away in horror as:

      VINCENT

      explodes through the window, shattering glass, thrusting
      his gloved hand through to grab Denton. He's climbed up
      the outside wall. Denton SCREAMS as Vincent draws him out
      backwards through the window.


      EXT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON GIRDERS - NIGHT

      Vincent hurls Denton out onto a high girder. Denton
      scrambles away in terror, almost falling. Vincent's a
      fierce, dramatic figure, fangs bared, cloak billowing as
      he's raked by high winds.

                                    DENTON
                      Mother of God! Please! Please,
                      don't!

      He crawls out to a dangerous exposed point on the girders,
      clings to it.

                                  DENTON
                              (continuing)
                      I didn't hurt the kid -- it was
                    an accident --

      Vincent growls. His ferocity is frightening and awesome. He
      starts forward to finish Denton off.

                                    CATHY (O.S.)
                            (shouting)
                     Vincent! No!

      Vincent turns to see Cathy at the shattered window.

                                    VINCENT
                    You shouldn't have Come here.

                                    CATHY
                      I had to come. Don't do this
                      terrible thing.

                                    VINCENT
                    He doesn't deserve to live.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              52.

                    But you can choose to let him
                      live. In your heart, you know
                      that's right.

                                    VINCENT
                    In my heart I feel only pain.

                                    CATHY
                    Your pain is for Luke. For his
                      life... for his love.

                                    VINCENT

                    to that other instinct inside you.

                                    CATHY
                      Frightened, bitter lonely
                      people. Like him --

      She points to Denton.

                                    CATHY
                              (continuing)
                    Come home, Vincent. Come back
                    to us --

      And on Cathy's appeal... and Vincent staring down at Denton:


      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM . NIGHT

      CLOSE on Luke hooked up to the machines, head and body
        swathed in bandages. He could be dead. There's the sound
      of the curtains being drawn... then Vincent's hand ENTERS
      FRAME... hovers over Luke's face. We WIDEN to REVEAL
      Vincent. It's late, the ward is silent and dark.

      Luke's eyes flutter. He stares up at Vincent with a kind
      of wonder.

                                    VINCENT
                    Don't say anything. You're going
                    to be all right.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              53.


      CONTINUED:

                                  LUKE
                            (a whisper)
                   I'm sorry --

                                    VINCENT
                    You fought for life, the doctors
                    said. I'm proud of you.

                                    LUKE
                            (with difficulty)
                      I never meant to hurt you... I
                      didn't want to be a nobody...

                                    VINCENT
                    You could never be that, Luke.

                                    LUKE
                      I guess I made a big mistake. A
                      whopper.
                            (eyes fluttering)
                      Vincent... ?

                                    VINCENT
                    I m here...

                                    LUKE
                              (almost asleep)
                      Still gonna get that Corvette.

      Vincent sees the slightest hint of a smile on Luke's
      sleeping face ... looks down. The boy's hand has taken his
      own. And as we PULL BACK SLOWLY from Vincent keeping a
      silent vigil:


      EXT. CATHY'S TERRACE - DAWN

      Cathy has fallen asleep in her chair as light begins to
      streak the night sky. She suddenly blinks, sits up.
        Vincent is there.

                                    VINCENT
                      Luke's strong. He's going to make
                      a wonderful recovery.

                                    CATHY
                              (nods)
                      Things will be better when he
                    comes back home.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              54.


      CONTINUED:

                                    VINCENT
                              (shakes his head)
                      Luke was never meant to live in
                      the underworld. I'll find him
                      a good home in your world.

                                    CATHY
                      My world... ? I feel so sad every
                      time you say that. My world...
                      your world. Can't they ever be
                      the same?

                                    VINCENT
                      I don't know, Catherine. I wanted
                      a man's life last night. Wanted
                      to kill --

                                    CATHY
                      Don't... it's over...

                                    VINCENT
                    Is it? Denton called me a beast
                      pretending to be a man... and
                      I found another beast within
                      myself...

                                    CATHY
                            (eyes welling)
                    There are many men who are more
                      beasts than you... but they hide
                    it. You have the finest heart
                    of any man.

                                    VINCENT
                      You're crying... for me...

                                    CATHY
                      ...and for myself. I feel your
                      pain... and your love.
      They're both choked with emotion.

                                    VINCENT
                    Even with two worlds between us...?

                                    CATHY
                      "Love is the same for all -- "

      And as they move to a tender embrace...

                                                                FADE OUT.

                                    THE END
