On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is
spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones
and medieval walls.
A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley.
There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly
heard from inside.
High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies
from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.
He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES.
A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE.
THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below.
As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins,
sure he's heard something.
But there's nothing there. He continues on.
Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.
WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.
The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled
features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is
STERLING.
STERLING
I hate to drop in unexpectedly.
Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE
from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks
it away.
Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO
underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see
the "ASTON-MARTIN" LOGO.
As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and
flattens against the wall.
A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.
The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.
BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.
Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in
the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading
towards.
As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He
smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd.
Sterling's ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb.
The SUV is right behind him. Viktor rolls down the passenger
window, readies his PISTOL.
The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.
They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.
Sterling skids around a corner.
The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass
and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.
The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.
Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.
A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is
ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.
Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts
BLASTING.
BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof
glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!
Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on
the RIMS.
The rear license plate folds down, revealing a ROCKET ENGINE.
Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator.
Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.
SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at
ever increasing speed.
Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!
But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic
looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE
GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded
SNIPER.
Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.
The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It
ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.
We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.
On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on
the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.
The missile locks-in and FIRES...
HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots
GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car.
WHOOMPH! The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air.
Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down on
the deck.
Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT.
Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands
on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD
BUFFET.
CUT TO:
A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn
and SPEED OUT OF TOWN.
We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In
the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK
BUILDINGS.
The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky.
We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take
position behind a FOUNTAIN.
ACCOMPLICE #2 (CAREY HART) sneaks across a roof and takes
position overlooking the fountain position of #1.
ACCOMPLICE #3 (DAVE MIRRA) takes up position in the second
story window of a FLOPHOUSE HOTEL down the street.
A MESSENGER (BOB BURNQUIST) skates up to the front of the
skyscraper with a PACKAGE. He gets the attention of the
SECURITY GUARD inside. The Security Guard unlocks the door
and lets him in.
Just then a VAN pulls up and ACCOMPLICES #4 (SHAUN PALMER)
and #5 (MAT HOFFMAN) hop out. They open up the back and a
BICYCLE is rolled out of the back by a MAN IN A HOODED JACKET.
Jacket Man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the
lobby.
Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST
BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA. He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM.
From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn
with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS.
Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him.
Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his
back and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest. He pulls out a ROAD FLARE
and SPARKS IT. We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his
SPOKES.
He LIGHTS THEM with the flare. Then he TOSSES THE FLARE off
the building.
The Accomplices see the flare drop. #'s 1, 2 & 3 pull CAMERAS
OUT and start filming.
Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal. He evades
Security Guards, picking up speed.
With Guards right behind, he drops off the TOP PLATFORM and
lands on a massive SATELLITE DISH.
Using the dish as a ramp, Xander LAUNCHES himself OFF THE
TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.
He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end
over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...
He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a
flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and
night lights.
The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's
own chest camera, in SUPER 8 and DIGITAL VIDEO, from four
different angles.
Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets
towards the ground.
At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his PARACHUTE
OPENS.
The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement.
It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest.
Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and
#5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the
van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape.
As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS
OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike.
SLAM TO:
TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing
TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop
we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF-
PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street
SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that
tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie.
DISSOLVE TO:
Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's
smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another
BACKPACK on his back.
Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building.
We see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD.
We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro.
The other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in
SPANISH.
VIRG
Jee-zus, man! What the hell now?
Another damn test?
T.J.
We should head for those trees.
XANDER
Don't look at me, brother. It's every
man for himself.
They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as
they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
Xander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around.
He flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees
stuns him.
XANDER
You gotta be kidding me.
We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE
PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place
looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM.
NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's.
Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING.
A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move.
He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the
HEADLIGHTS of a truck.
Narcos hop out and charge forward.
Xander raises his hands.
XANDER
You boys are too good for me. Guess
I failed this one, huh?
They grab him and haul him away.
Narcos are shouting, running to and fro.
TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air. They are trying to repel
an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE.
Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like
Apocalypse Now, their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place.
Xander comes out of the torture building holding T.J. in a
fireman's carry. His hands are still CUFFED, the length of
chain dragging.
Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting T.J. on the
ground.
XANDER
You alright?
T.J.
I used to be a SEAL, it's not the
first time I've been shot. Thanks,
man.
XANDER
Keep your head down, I'll be right
back. I'm gonna steal us some wheels.
Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting.
He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY.
Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way.
He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters.
He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night
Sun.
Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the
camouflage netting.
VIRG
They're all over the place! What the
hell's going on?
XANDER
Looks like we're in the middle of
the drug war.
The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting.
They're pinned down.
XANDER
Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go
that way, I'm gonna go this way.
They can't follow us both.
They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking
up DUST all around them.
XANDER
Go!
They jet off in opposite directions.
Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands
and the dangling chain make it difficult.
He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS.
Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.
XANDER
Shit!
The CHOPPER swoops down after him.
Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him.
BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground
right behind him.
Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in
"North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's
running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.
Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him.
Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the
plants.
All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE.
Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with
their guns. Narcos run terrified.
Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front
of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.
XANDER
I'm gonna need to hit the trees after
a night like this.
He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT
FOREST.
Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS
OF COCAINE. He heads for it.
Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings
around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around
him.
Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck.
Bullets chew up the dirt all around him.
As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK.
There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up.
WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts
into the night air.
Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into
FILTHY WATER.
A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white.
Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls
inside.
The Chopper makes another pass overhead.
The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on.
Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe.
JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN
flood the compound. There's no going back.
Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line.
The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are
quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea.
As he goes by, one of the TREES moves.
He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on
EXPLODES UPWARDS. ARMS reach out, tackling Xander from behind.
Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds,
the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape.
They fall on him like a curtain.
XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD
is pulled over his head.
FADE TO BLACK.
We CRANE UP from the COBBLESTONE STREET as a BEAT-UP CAR
races by. We rise up, revealing PRAGUE in all it's glory.
It's a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town. Xander
shakes his head.
XANDER
James Bond never had to put up with
this shit.
Ivan 1 pulls Xander's gear bag from the trunk and throws it
on the sidewalk.
Xander picks it up and carries it into the building.
A fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big
bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass,
expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous.
Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a
Tshirt that says "RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND" complete with
a photo of the Hedgehog.
A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut.
He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is
TOBY LEE SHAVERS.
Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL
CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle.
SLOVO
Your government must know something
we don't.
Shavers walks up to them.
SHAVERS
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle-
trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent
Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking
for what's his name. Three X' s.
XANDER
That's would be me.
Shavers gives him a disapproving look.
SHAVERS
Figures. You got someplace we can
spread out my gear or what? I mean
today.
Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off,
muttering to himself.
SLOVO
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
XANDER
Yeah, thanks a lot.
The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two
TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch.
The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander
supervises. Anders hovers around him.
ANDERS
So what you think? Beautiful!
Sitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra.
Petra has a LAPTOP.
YORGI
Has it arrived yet?
Petra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their
BANK ACCOUNT.
PETRA
Nothing. He had two days.
YORGI
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office.
Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL.
Xander opens the door.
XANDER
Very nice. I'm impressed.
YORGI
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to
have a bit of a problem...
Just then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into
their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles.
XANDER
I had to inspect the merchandise
first.
YORGI
Of course.
He nods for Kirill to stand down.
OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the
Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER.
XANDER
What's this?
YORGI
This is a gift. From me to you.
Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC
GTO.
YORGI
It's a little nothing, you take it.
Xander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger
seat.
YORGI
Come on, get in.
Xander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine
ROARS.
XANDER
You're alright, Yorgi.
Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on
the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's
got a camera with a big zoom lens.
SLOVO
Smile, bychara.
Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get
a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the
roof.
CRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE.
Down below, Kirill hears the noise.
KIRILL
Yorgi!
They all look to the abandoned building.
Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg
poking through the ceiling.
Xander is taken aback.
YORGI
What in the hell...?
Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol.
Thinking fast, Xander does the same.
They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's
heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw
as well, all of them covering Xander.
YORGI
What's going on, my friend?
XANDER
You tell me! You got a sniper up
there or what?
YORGI
He's not with us, Xander. He must be
with you.
XANDER
(he cocks the hammer)
Bullshit! You get your boy off that
roof or I swear to God I'm gonna
give you another hole to breathe out
of.
Yorgi stares, finally believes him. He lowers his gun.
YORGI
Get him! Find out who he is!
By now Slovo is down the fire escape. He hits the ground and
goes running down the street.
The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars. Xander SPINS the
cylinder on his REVOLVER.
XANDER
I've got him. Buckle up.
The GTO peels out.
Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander
comes skidding around the corner. He looks back and sees the
speeding GTO.
YORGI
That's the cop from the club!
Xander does the only thing he can. He puts the car sideways
and aims out the window as he slides to a stop.
Slovo turns and BLAM! Xander SHOOTS Slovo right in the chest.
IN SLO-MO: a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest and Slovo
falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and
betrayal.
The smoking shell clatters to the ground.
Slovo blinks up at Xander, gasping for words, then lays still.
Xander hops out, rifles through Slovo's pockets. The other
Anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on.
YORGI
What are you doing? Get in the car!
Xander heads back to the GTO and the cars peel out.
The Ivans pull up in their transport trucks. They see all
the blood and rush towards Slovo. But something doesn't look
right.
Ivan 1 TASTES the blood and spits it out.
IVAN 1
It's sweet.
Ivan 2 pulls a CHROME DART from Slovo's chest. Slovo GROANS.
It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river.
XANDER
You got a great set-up here Yorgi.
You really know how to live.
YORGI
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's
been good to me.
XANDER
I've been here before, when I was a
kid. My old man was in the service,
we used to live on the Army base in
Hamburg.
YORGI
You, an Army brat? I don't see that
one at all. Did you join the service
as well?
XANDER
Hell no. My dad was a straight up
tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this
general off and got himself
dishonorably discharged. Had a court
martial and everything. The charges
were total bullshit, so he was sure
he'd get his name cleared, but it
didn't happen.
YORGI
Connections and politics, it's the
same everywhere.
XANDER
My old man, he bought into the system,
and it screwed him. So he swallowed
a bullet. Me, I don't believe in
nothing I can't see and touch.
The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets
and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a
window with his SNIPER RIFLE.
P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs.
The scope pans over to Yorgi, who looks INTO CAMERA and gives
a small signal, calling off the hit.
BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER
Yorgi looks up at a "PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE" banner.
YORGI
Next week these idiots are having a
peace conference here. What the hell
are they going to talk about? It's
the system itself that causes all
the world's problems. You're okay,
buddy. Come on, it's getting early.
They stroll off and Kirill stands down.
A flotilla of VEHICLES (Xander's GTO among them) drives
through the gate in a massive, stone wall. It's a big manor
house in the middle of town.
Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his
SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE.
P.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the
crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way
towards the exit.
KIRILL
Nice and easy, Petra...
Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the
door, a BUS passes by.
Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass.
P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible
through the bus windows.
Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger...
As soon as the bus passes he FIRES!
But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe.
CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise,
Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block.
He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the
sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows.
At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL
RAIL down the middle.
As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the
SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink
flying.
He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does
a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too
fast for Kirill.
He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE
AIR.
Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon.
By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in
frustration.
Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a "Where
did he go?" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her
performance.
Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO
speeding away.
FADE TO:
We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen
from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An
airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's
legendary "Troll Wall". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to
the ocean.
Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear
webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each
thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced
MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship.
Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is
precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff
is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen.
FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military
style. He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low.
HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: "6 PM"
The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without
saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall.
Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group
freefailing down the sheer cliff face.
XANDER
Very nice.
The six plummet away from him at incredible speed. In a hard
arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h.
Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between
their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and
rocket away from the wall.
Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation.
ON THE SHIP BELOW --
The ship below is a scientific research vessel. On the deck,
a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set.
The six dark figures close in rapidly.
At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide
towards the ship.
A sailor looks up and spots them.
Before he can shout, he's SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down.
Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs.
They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical
manner. They herd everyone back heading for the bridge.
Petra hangs back. She looks back at the cliff, up towards
Xander.
XANDER'S P.O.V.
Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge.
As they head inside, they disappear from view.
Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.
XANDER
Let's see what's going on inside...
"PENETRATOR" P.O.V.
Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP.
He sees THE CREW, herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy
99.
ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE. It's white and twelve
feet long. There are MOTORS on either side and a PANEL OF
SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like projection rising
from the back.
This is the AHAB DEVICE. It sits in the WET WELL at the back
of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.
YORGI
Ready the boat.
There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship.
Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck. They start to WHISTLE
as they work. Sounds like the "Andy Griffith" theme.
XANDER'S BINOCULARS P.O.V.
He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device.
XANDER
What the hell are you guys stealing?
BACK ON THE SHIP
The smaller boat is launched and ready to do. Yorgi goes to
the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch.
The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. In
seconds Ahab starts to float. Anders loosens it from it's
moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER BOAT.
KIRILL
Ready.
Yorgi hits another switch, opening the BALLAST DOORS on the
port side of the ship. Air flows out, causing the ship to
list to one side.
PETRA
What are you doing?
YORGI
It all happened so fast. Such an
unfortunate accident.
Yorgi MACHINE GUNS the wet well control panel.
YORGI
Let's go.
They climb onto the boat. Petra is the last to board. She
looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more,
making sure he notices.
XANDER'S P.O.V.
He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being
towed behind. He pans over and ZOOMS IN on the shot-up control
panel.
XANDER
What the hell...?
He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding.
With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts
LISTING. The thing is going down.
He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the
Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped,
their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS.
Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up.
XANDER
No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed
to be an observer. Aw shit. This job
sucks.
He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle.
XANDER
Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't
work, your ass is kicked.
Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths.
Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff...
And that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down.
Suddenly we're falling with him.
We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from
the craggy rock face.
The force of the wind ripples his cheeks.
He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away
from the cliff like Superman.
Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE.
Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE
LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL.
Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards
the ship.
Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi
from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him.
YORGI
What was that for?
PETRA
I'd forgotten how exciting it is
working together.
YORGI
You've been so quiet lately, Petra,
I thought you no longer cared.
PETRA
Why don't we go below decks and work
off some of this adrenaline.
YORGI
(smiles)
Viktor! Stay the course.
Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below.
Xander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing
deck and undoes his harness.
He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck.
XANDER
Son of a bitch!
He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away.
Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on
the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved.
Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the
price.
Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in.
With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below
decks.
Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking
for. The Captain's Son shows him the right switch.
XANDER
You sure?
The Son nods and Xander flips the switch. MOTORS start to
HUM.
The bilge pumps spew out water furiously. Crew members come
up from below decks. They are soaked and grateful. They go
about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to
the exhausted Captain.
XANDER
Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads
with that uniform?
They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself.
FADE TO:
The GTO screeches into the lot. Shavers is on his way out
with his SUITCASE.
XANDER
Get in. We've got work to do.
This is a beautiful open air market in a town square
surrounded by old buildings. The place is PACKED.
In the midst of it all, we make out Petra moving through the
crowd. She stops to look at some vegetables when Xander passes
by her.
XANDER
Right behind you.
They keep talking, pretending to shop.
XANDER
So what's the plan with this Ahab?
Are they selling it or what?
PETRA
No, something worse. He says it's a
surprise, but I know him. This is
his masterpiece.
XANDER
We've got to find out what it is.
Can you handle that?
PETRA
(beat)
There's something I didn't have time
to tell you before.
XANDER
What's that?
PETRA
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been
undercover for over a year.
XANDER
You're what? What the hell have you
been doing?
PETRA
I don't know. Eight months ago I
stop hearing from my people. No
explanation, just silence. So I stay
and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm
in so far, they'd kill me if I left.
Now every day I get farther and
farther away from what I was. I'm
like you said, a criminal.
XANDER
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus,
what the hell are you doing? Those
people almost drowned on that boat
and you didn't lift a finger.
This stings her. She knows well the price she paid.
PETRA
No, I guess I've been no help at all
to you.
XANDER
Get your head back in the game. There
are lives at stake here.
PETRA
Of course. I'll do what I can. I
have to go, before they notice.
XANDER
When can I see you again?
PETRA
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not
much help anyway, remember?
Then she's off into the crowd.
The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander
approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK,
packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST.
He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up
the side.
He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house.
VIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy.
Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below.
Xander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX.
He waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a
basement window.
Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running.
Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going
on.
Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby
and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM!
The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up.
He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a
"ramp" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE.
A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim.
Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by
he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL
before he can shoot.
The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.
YORGI
He blew the gate control. Anders!
Get the bastard!
Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine
gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him
go, hoping for the best.
(NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual
locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated
by a physical reason)
Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind
him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end.
At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall.
Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of
the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel,
he hops onto the wall.
The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the
top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows.
They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide.
They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping
neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes
a detour.
He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER
CONSTRUCTION.
Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't
that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS.
Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and
follows Xander.
They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF
ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as
they race towards that last apartment building.
Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump,
Xander pulls up behind Anders.
They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps
on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right
behind him.
They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced
on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories
below.
He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep
his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control.
Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie
and RAMS Anders over the edge.
The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears
through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground.
Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building.
He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually
take him to street level.
As he makes his way down, Anders stirs. The guy is a bloody,
broken mess but he gets to his feet. He sees where Xander is
headed and he scurries off to intercept him.
Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. The
only way out is fenced in. But there's a RAMP leading up to
a LOADING DOCK. Xander will have to use that ramp to jump
the fence.
Anders climbs to the second floor of the building. There is
a small crane arm loaded with metal. If he pushes it at the
right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike.
He giggles maniacally, blood dripping.
Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump.
Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out.
IN SLOW MOTION: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over
the fence.
The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander.
Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE, grabbing
onto the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB. He passes RIGHT
UNDERNEATH the swinging crane arm.
Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on
with ONE HAND. In his OTHER HAND Xander's got his PISTOL.
BLAP!
Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. He stops,
sees Anders' BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley. He
tucks his pistol away and roars off.
The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river.
There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE
PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it.
XANDER
Where are we going?
PETRA
We're getting out of this place.
We've done enough.
XANDER
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go
now. What's Yorgi got planned with
that nerve agent?
PETRA
It doesn't matter anymore, forget
it.
XANDER
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
PETRA
What do we owe our governments? Yours
kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
XANDER
Petra, this ain't about the people
that sent us here, you know that.
PETRA
No, now it's about us. Let's do
something for us before we both get
killed. Don't you want to get to
Bora Bora, Xander?
XANDER
We can't leave now. We have to do
something.
PETRA
Why? You're the one who believes in
nothing. Screw the world, or whatever
you said.
Xander grabs her by shoulders.
XANDER
Alright, so I was full of shit. I
thought believing in things was wrong.
Turns out believing in nothing is
worse. You might as well be dead.
I'm not thrilled with the world, but
I'm not gonna let those idiots start
killing people. Come on, you're a
cop, we've got to get these guys.
He's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement.
PETRA
They left. To a fortress in the
mountains.
XANDER
We'll have to go after them.
PETRA
Aren't you afraid?
XANDER
A long time ago I learned how to put
fear away in a little place in my
head. Maybe that's my problem. If
you don't feel fear you can do some
amazing things, but you can also
screw your life up in ways you can't
imagine.
PETRA
I must be healthy, then, because I'm
scared to death. I guess I'd better
get back to Yorgi.
XANDER
You don't have to do that.
PETRA
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't
just let him go free. Besides, I can
help you from the inside.
XANDER
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've
been?
PETRA
(shrugs)
I was supposed to wait for the cop
to kill you and then kill the cop.
They'll believe me.
(beat)
I've been lying for so long, one
more time won't hurt.
XANDER
When this is over, we're just gonna
take off, the two of us. Take a
vacation.
PETRA
What the hell are we doing? We're
doing all this together, trusting
each other, making plans, and we
haven't even slept together yet.
Xander kisses her.
XANDER
That gives us something to live for.
Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up,
revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big
BUILDING on the river.
We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock
strewn, near vertical drop.
Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's
got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a
helluva climb.
Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's
beautiful up here.
He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch
and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on
his feet.
Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of
the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval
fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down
the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something
else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging
to rocks for balance.
On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a
GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been
spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on
SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants.
Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the
Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his
men.
A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER.
Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE.
All around him the Guards are driving into position. They
form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them.
Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.
VIKTOR
Hold positions!
He squints up at the speck that is Xander.
Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket.
XANDER
Nothing like fresh powder.
He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade.
Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER.
The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING
DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing
down the mountain.
The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with
a tremendous shock.
There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight,
then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the
brink.
Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at
his heels.
From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards
watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.
Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they
can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.
There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and
ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes
a run for it as well.
Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight
train, frothing like white water.
Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a
JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof
of the Outpost.
The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything
and everyone in its way.
Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling
under the onslaught.
Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over
the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a
stop.
Then it's all quiet.
Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's
nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.
Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE,
he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his
flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for
good.
Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's
right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to
BEEP.
XANDER
(into communicator)
Gibbons, long time no talk. You
wouldn't believe my day.
INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS ON THE PRIVATE JET WITH A TEAM OF
AGENTS.
GIBBONS
What the hell has been going on,
Triple X? How about a status report?
Xander looks down on the Castle. There seem to be MAFIYA
HENCHMEN all over the grounds.
XANDER
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad
guys. The usual.
GIBBONS
I'm on the way with a team to relieve
you. What's the latest?
XANDER
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind
of rocket launcher. They were loading
canisters of liquid into it, light
colored and dark colored in the same
tube but separate. Something tells
me this it that "classified" stuff
you didn't want me to know about.
Does the song "Silent Night" mean
anything to you?
GIBBONS
Yes it does.
XANDER
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better
then that.
GIBBONS
Silent Night is the name of a top
secret binary nerve agent. The glass
canister is shot into the air and
detonated. The black and white
chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud.
When it settles down to Earth, it'll
kill everything in the vicinity.
XANDER
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is
something we came up with?
GIBBONS
Yeah, that's right. So now that you
know, you understand why it's
important that we get it back.
XANDER
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're
not supposed to be making weapons
like that anyway. Guess we shoulda
played by the rules.
GIBBONS
Somebody else makes those decisions,
not guys like you and me. You've
done your job, X, head back to Prague.
I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This
is my operation now.
XANDER
We don't have that kinda time, boss,
I don't think Prague's gonna be around
much longer. I've gotta go now. I've
got a lot of bad guys to kill.
Xander hangs up and heads down the hill.
A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. He
stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him.
WHACK! With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps
walking. He's a man on a mission.
He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. There's
no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. A canyon of
ROCKS is below.
Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "TERMINATOR"
CLIMBING CLAWS. He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into
the solid rock.
Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface.
We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making
this impossible climb.
At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's
rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky
chasm below.
Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the
way with his climbing claws.
At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander
grabs him and pulls him over the edge.
The Guard FALLS into the chasm.
Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD
rushes him, grabbing for his rifle.
Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun
from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the
Guard down.
He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower.
The front gates have just been blown apart. Through the smoke
and wreckage come Ivans 1 & 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK CZECH
SECRET POLICE. Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot
bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets.
The Czech Secret Police are having their way. They cross the
courtyard and burst into the main building.
Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him
and shoots him in the back.
They step over him and enter a GARAGE.
The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across
the courtyard.
Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts
heading down the mountain.
Xander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police
working on the wounded Ivan 1. Ivan 2 walks up.
XANDER
How's Ivan?
IVAN 2
He is okay.
XANDER
Thanks for coming, man, you guys
were right on time.
IVAN 2
We are always on time. Two have
escaped, in truck.
PETRA
Yorgi and Kirill.
XANDER
Let me guess, they had a big white
torpedo with them.
IVAN 2
Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he
send something for you.
A big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's
blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out.
IVAN 2
We'll be right behind you.
Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols.
XANDER
Did you do your homework?
PETRA
(nods)
If they launch it, I know how to
bring it back.
XANDER
Let's do this.
They both climb in and the GTO peels out.
Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up.
He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip.
Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the
mountain.
XANDER
Where's he headed?
PETRA
He owns a big industrial complex on
the river. He'll launch it from there.
Xander floors it.
Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the
GTO gaining on them.
YORGI
(in Russian, subtitled)
They're coming! Get back there.
Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He
lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container.
As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK!
The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows
the headrest off Xander's seat.
XANDER
You get down! I'll take care of this
fool!
He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window.
PETRA
No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind
the nerve agent!
Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror.
XANDER
Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing
around soon and shoot something
valuable!
Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the
sights.
Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide.
The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain.
Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns.
The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex
up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.
The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex.
Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen
up above.
The GTO comes at the gates at full speed.
XANDER
Let's see what my man put together.
Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He
flips one.
The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER.
BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.
The metal doors are getting SHREDDED.
Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO.
The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks.
The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down.
A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the
GTO zips inside.
The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here.
Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere.
A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping-pong ball sized
MINIBOMBS dump onto the road. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The bombs
send the Guards scattering.
The GTO sizzles away.
XANDER
Where'd the damn truck go?!
PETRA
Go to the water, it's that way!
A tactical (a pick-up with a .50 cal machine gun attached)
pulls up behind them and opens fire.
XANDER
Toadies right behind.
PETRA
Let me.
Petra punches another button.
The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their
own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES.
As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW
UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical.
All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control.
It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the
men going sprawling.
PETRA
Fantastic options.
At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck
and prepare for launching.
They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into
the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's
insides.
YORGI
I've got it, go! Cover me!
Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off.
He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building
on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes
his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear.
When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES.
The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering
column.
Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building.
Petra clutches her arm, wounded.
XANDER
You okay?
PETRA
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
XANDER
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop
playing nice.
Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make
their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning
in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as
he can.
Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't
have much of a target.
KIRILL
What are you doing!
He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a
HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER.
ANGLE ON - the missile launcher's COMPUTER SCREEN. The green
display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. Its
the GLOWING POINT of Kirill's lit cigarette.
The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES.
Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at
him.
He gets it immediately. In a panic he fumbles for the
cigarette...
Too late. The missile zeroes in on his head.
WHOOOSH! The entire wooden shack blows apart.
Xander walks up to Petra.
XANDER
I guess the surgeon general was right.
ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The
electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river.
Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi
escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see
the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination.
Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She
presses buttons desperately.
PETRA
He's shut out the communication
circuit!
XANDER
You can't talk to it?
PETRA
No, it's like a safety. We are going
to have to access the manual controls.
XANDER
A manual control on a moving torpedo.
This day keeps getting better and
better.
Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT.
XANDER
Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going
down! Have them evacuate downtown!
Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and
sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his
steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on
them and he reloads his weapons.
Xander drives while Petra checks her controller.
PETRA
It's running three meters down. Twenty
knots.
XANDER
It has to surface to release the
nerve agent, right?
PETRA
By then it's too late! The only way
to safely dispose of the nerve agent
is in deep water! The chemicals will
break down and dissipate!
XANDER
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow
it up underwater!
They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank
getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast.
Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath
the water.
PETRA
There it is! Hold it steady!
Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front
of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind.
She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's
boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet
GRAZES Petra's arm.
XANDER
Petra!
She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the
engine compartment.
Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's
boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge
support and shatters.
They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's
full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing
in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and
Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.
PETRA
Xander! It's coming up!
Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi
clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra
tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.
Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs
him from behind in a chokehold.
YORGI
This is going to be exciting, buddy!
Front row seats to the apocalypse!
Come on, sing with me!
(singing madly)
"I am an Antichrist / I am an
anarchist / I... wan-na be...
Anarchy!"
Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips
him and they both topple overboard.
They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel
each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding
torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St.
Charles bridge.
On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF
PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from
the river.
Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi
slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in
the torpedo's wake.
Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.
Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing
Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.
XANDER
No you don't.
He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is
BEEPING menacingly.
IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his
hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he
doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.
He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the
bridge above him. Total strangers...
The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former
nihilist.
Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with
his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.
Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the
water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab
starts to DIVE.
With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside
down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.
Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men
fighting.
We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on
Ahab and continues downstream.
Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.
It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES,
setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and
it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.
The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds.
A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils.
Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the
water, but there's no sign of Xander.
Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE,
scanning the water. Nothing.
Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.
Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.
There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they
see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.
The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water,
walking up the boat ramp.
His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's
a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't
seen before. The Phoenix has risen.
Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander
shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.
GIBBONS
Thought you bought the farm down
there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
XANDER
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So
are you done with me yet?
GIBBONS
You've kept up your end of the
bargain, I'll do the same. But you
really should consider staying on,
you make a decent agent.
XANDER
But I hate cops, remember? Except
for her.
GIBBONS
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there.
You're a hero. Don't be afraid to
join the good guys.
XANDER
Who says you're the good guys?
He starts walking off with Petra.
GIBBONS
You know what they say, the only way
to change the system is from the
inside.
XANDER
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking
this thing off my ankle? The poison
needles?
GIBBONS
On come on, X. Did you really think
we were that barbaric?
XANDER
No needles, huh? What about the acid
bath?
GIBBONS
All for show. Just a psychological
mind game to get you to do the right
thing.
XANDER
(smiles)
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
Gibbons waves.
GIBBONS
We'll be talking soon, you'll see.
You'll be back.
Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm.
PETRA
I can't believe my mission is finally
over. I don't even know what to do
with myself.
XANDER
You can't welch on me now. We had a
deal.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON - a big "X" spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand.
The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white
beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island... BORA BORA...
Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE.
CUT TO:
A THIRD "X" BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER'S HEAD.
Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water.
Xander steps out of a hut built over the water.
We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. She's got
a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down. It's a vision of
heaven.
He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom
off.
PETRA
(laughing)
What are you doing?
XANDER
It's about your next mission. You
need to be debriefed.
FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon
nude. There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we
know what they're up to.
Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses
of their outlines beneath the water.
The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's
COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers. We hear them
surface and start SPLASHING off camera.
Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP.
FADE OUT.
THE END
