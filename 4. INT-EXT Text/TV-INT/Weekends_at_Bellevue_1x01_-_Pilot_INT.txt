      A clean-cut MAN in his 30s in a corporate suit and tie is 
      determined as he zooms his car down a highway.  He passes a 
        graffiti-covered semi and zooms into the mouth of the HOLLAND 
      TUNNEL.  A sign reads:  WELCOME TO NEW YORK. 



      The Man opens his briefcase in the Conference Room of a big, 
      corporate office.  He takes out a sheaf of papers and walks 
      over to a huge WHITE BOARD covering one wall.  Meticulously, 
      he begins to transcribe a set of numbers from the paper he s 
      holding with a dry-erase marker.



      The white board is filling up with orderly NUMERICAL 
      STATEMENTS as the Man transcribes more of his document onto 
      the board.  A CORPORATE SECURITY GUARD appears at the door.  
      The Man takes a sip of coffee from a communal kitchen mug.

                                  GUARD
                    Sir, we re locking up.  

                                  MAN
                    Go ahead, I m good here.

                                  GUARD
                    Do you have a keycard?

      The Man doesn t answer.

                                  GUARD (CONT D)
                    Because I can t let you stay after 
                    hours without a keycard.

                                  MAN
                    I ve got clearance.

                                  GUARD
                    From who?  What department?
                          (no response)
                    Sir?

      The GUARD steps into the room and for the first time, he and 
      we SEE that the Man s calculations have COVERED every inch of 
      the white board, as well as the SURROUNDING walls.  Off this 
      chilling tableau--                         Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 4



      It s morning as the Man is unloaded from a police car by two 
      cops, BREEN and SOUTHERLAND, outside Bellevue Hospital s ER.  
      The man is agitated, hands cuffed behind his back.  

                                  MAN
                    It s all the zeros and the ones and

      As they burst through the double doors, we EXPERIENCE the 
      bustle of the ER from the POV of a man in the midst of a 
      psychotic episode:  colors are brighter, sounds are 
        exaggerated.  It s a woozy, distorted view of the blood and 
      chaos in the ER.  ER nurse DAHLIA takes one look and can 
      immediately tell it s a psych case.  She points down the 
      hall.

                                  DAHLIA
                    Psych ER is that way.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:



      Ben is on the move, tailing Doctor DIANE WALLACE (40s), the 
      Department Head of Psychiatry,  through the halls of the 
      psych ward.  Warm, outgoing and wearing a prairie skirt from 
      1995, Diane s obviously not a native New Yorker.  Ben is a 
      junior attending, rumpled but nerdy-cute in his slept-in 
      shirt and tie.  

                                  BEN
                    You weren t even going to tell me?  

                                  DIANE
                    Tell you what?

                                  BEN
                    Ellie and I trained at Columbia 
                    together.  

                                  DIANE
                    Coffee.  I need coffee.

      Ben follows Diane into--



      Ben follows Diane into a grimy break room with a wall of 
      lockers and a ten-year-old Mr. Coffee maker.  Diane chooses 
      from a mismatched cluster of mugs, pours two cups.

                                  BEN
                    You could have asked me about her.

      Next to the coffee maker is an old copy of the New York Post.

                                  DIANE
                    Three weeks, three days.

                                  BEN
                    What?

                                  DIANE
                    For three weeks and three days, 
                    this copy of the Post has been 
                    sitting on this table.                         Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 8


                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    I threw it into the recycling bin 
                    and somebody actually fished it 
                    back out.  Now I m just fascinated 
                    to see how long it lasts in here.

                                  BEN
                    Diane-- Why didn t anyone ask me 
                    about her?

      Diane hands a mug to Ben.

                                  DIANE
                    Because junior faculty aren t 
                    consulted for new hires, that s 
                    why.
                          (off his look)
                    She comes out of an excellent 
                      residency, she knows New York, 
                    knows the patient population.  

                                  BEN
                    Okay, forget about me, did you talk 
                    to anyone at Columbia?  

                                  DIANE
                    No, Ben, I hired her because I 
                    liked her boots.  
                          (off his look)
                    I know things got messy at Columbia 
                    but life is messy, that shouldn t 
                    be news to you.  I had three 
                    meetings with Ellie, I talked to 
                    all her advisors.  She was hired 
                    because I want her here.  I think 
                    she ll fit right in.
                          (then)
                    Come on.  We re late.

      They exit from a different door than the one they came in, a 
      door that leads directly into--



      The FISHBOWL is a glass enclosure that allows the staff to 
      keep an eye on the patients and vice versa.  The staff avoids 
      eye contact with the patients, trying to pretend they re not 
      being watched.  Ellie, Chuck and others are gathered for the 
      MORNING REPORT, a daily meeting where psychiatrists, nurses 
      and social workers discuss the new admissions and strategize 
      a plan for the day.                          Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 9

                    Morning everyone.  Somebody tell me 
                    about the overnight admissions.

                    pigeons in Central Park.

                    pigeons have made some serious 
                      breakthroughs.

      Diane and others are amused-- Ben, not so much.  The Manic 
      Man from the Teaser bangs on the glass of the Fishbowl in a 
      desperate attempt to get their attention.

                    morning with the police, no ID,

      A fresh-faced psychiatry intern, CLAIRE COHEN (25) shoots her 
      hand up.  She s upbeat and outgoing, obsessed with the 
      psychodynamic approach to psychiatry.  She s read a ton on 
      the subject and wants everyone to know.  Her fellow intern 
      MANEESH SARMA (26, Indian, dryly understated) rolls his eyes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    According to Winnecott s theory, 
                    mania is a desperate defense of the 
                    ego against despair.

                                  BEN
                    That s not what she asked.

                    What are the DSM criteria for a 
                    diagnosis of mania?

      Maneesh opens his mouth to answer but Claire jumps in before 
      he gets a word out.

                    Fine.  Learn the DSM but then 
                    unlearn it.  It s limiting.   
                    Designed by committee.  And totally 
                      unnecessary.

                    how could I say no to the chance to 
                    spend every weekend with the 
                    deranged underbelly of New York?

                    Guys, we ve got a full triage area 
                    and a consult waiting in the ER.  
                    Ben, take the discharges, Ellie, 
                    you cover consults with the 
                    interns.

      Ellie throws a look to the interns.  Teaching is so much 
      work. 

                                  ELLIE
                    Both of them?

      Ellie heads out, Claire and Maneesh follow.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Awesome.  I love consults.  



      Ellie and her interns, Claire and Maneesh, move through the 
      huge medical ER adjacent to the psych ED.  Bloody patients 
      are wheeled by on gurneys, trauma teams run past, it s all 
      part of the chaotic, gory landscape of a busy ER.

                    I love working weekends.

                    Less competition for cases, more 
                      opportunity to learn.

      Ellie is annoyed by Claire s upbeat manner and her perfect 
      hair held back with a preppy headband.

                                  ELLIE
                    Fewer residents, no teaching 
                      conferences, easier to get real 
                    work done.

                                  CLAIRE
                    If you hate teaching, why are you 
                    working at a teaching hospital?

                                  ELLIE
                    Why are you wearing that headband?
                          (to Maneesh)
                    And you.  So quiet.  What s your 
                    story?  What led you to psychiatry?

                      Abandonment issues?  Didn t have 
                    the board scores for neurology?

                    Yeah?  What was yours?

      Ellie pauses for a beat as a bloody patient on a gurney 
      whizzes by them.

                                  ELLIE

                    You know the unspoken hierarchy in 
                      a hospital-- neurosurgeons at the 
                    top, pediatricians at the bottom.  
                    But mental illness is everywhere, 
                    in every specialty.  When you re a 
                      psychiatrist, absolutely everyone 
                    needs you.

                    Speaking of which-- that s Knox.  

      Ellie sees a young, surfer-y attending charting at a desk.  
      This is Doctor JARED KNOX.  Knox is 32, scruffy and sexy, the 
      kind of ER doc who works like a dog eight months a year so he 
      can spend the other four surfing in Fiji and skiing in Vail.

                                  CLAIRE
                    He calls psych for any patient who 
                    wants to talk for more than thirty 
                    seconds.

                                  ELLIE
                    Doctor Knox?

      He looks up, flashes a friendly, seductive smile.  Ellie 
      notes his huge eyes, puka shell necklace.  Dangerously hot.  

                                  KNOX
                    How can I help?

                    a consult for us?

                                  KNOX
                    Yes I do.

      Knox decides he s going to be needing a lot of psych 
      consults.

                                  KNOX
                    Well, alright.  Let me know any way  
                    I can help... orient you.

      Ellie picks up on his vibe, smiles.

                                  ELLIE
                    Wow.  Impressive example of phallic-
                      narcissism.

                                  KNOX

                    brought in by his NYU roommate 
                    after he wigged-out in the gym.

                                  ELLIE
                      Wigged-out?  That s your working 
                      diagnosis?

                                  KNOX
                    The treadmill was talking to him, 
                    he started throwing free weights at 
                    an invisible threat.

                                  ELLIE

                                  KNOX
                    Negative for drugs and alcohol.
                    But there s a family history of 
                      schizophrenia.

                                  ELLIE
                    He s the perfect age for a first 
                    psychotic break.

                    My thought exactly.  Let me know 
                    what you think. 

      Knox moves off as they stop in front of a skinny teenager, 
      DAVID BELLINGER, sitting up on a gurney, eyes darting, 
      terrified.  Ellie s pager BEEPS.  She ignores it as she, 
      Claire and Maneesh approach.

                    How s this?

      In a series of QUICK FLASHES, we SEE the world from DAVID s 
      POV.  The machinery and monitors seem to be undulating, 
      breathing, whispering.  He looks over at the LED display on a 
      nearby heart monitor.  A numeric heart rate morphs into a 
      message that only David can see:  WE...ARE...HERE...  David s 
      eyes flash back to Ellie, terrified.

                                  DAVID

                    Shhh!  They re everywhere!  You re 
                    part of it.  THEY CAN HEAR YOU!

      Ellie knows Claire s approach won t work.  She leans in, 
      whispers, playing along.

                                  ELLIE
                    Who s everywhere?  Who are they?

                                  DAVID

                    another Dan.  I m not a jobber, I m 
                    not going back.

                    You don t have to.  I m here to 
                    make sure of that.

      David puts the pillow over his own head.  

                                  DAVID

                    it. 

      Ellie puts Lucinda s chart down, leans back in her chair.

                                  ELLIE
                    Well, I m not leaving until you do.

                    My daughter Maggie s wedding is in 
                    a week.  Surgery can wait. 

                                  ELLIE
                    I m sure Maggie wouldn t mind 
                    moving the wedding.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    That would require telling her.  
                    And once I do that... everything 
                    stops.  And I don t want it to 
                    stop.  
                          (then)
                    I don t expect you to understand.

                    They know I fainted at lunch.  They 
                    think I m being kept overnight for 
                    a few tests.

                    Listen.  I understand why you feel 
                    you have to change my mind.  But 
                    you won t.  God wants me at that 
                    wedding.  

      Ellie and Ben exchange a look.

                                  ELLIE
                    Ms. Webb... religious faith can be 
                    helpful to people in times like 
                    this.  But maybe the two of us, 
                    right here, right now, are a 
                    message from God.  We are 
                      delivering unto you a neurosurgeon.

      Lucinda forces a tight smile.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    Are you making fun of me?

                    No.  I m trying to save your life.



      Ben follows Ellie out into the hallway, unimpressed.

                    Bernard Chavez is a fierce 
                      libertarian.  A patient has to be 
                    speaking in tongues before he ll 
                    rule them incompetent.

                                  ELLIE

      Ellie s pager BEEPS again.  She reads the text.

                                  ELLIE
                    It s Diane. 



      Ellie stands in the hallway, looking into the Community Room, 
      an open, central room where psych patients are able to talk, 
      mingle, watch movies, etc.  Diane sits in a circle of chairs 
      with 8 other inpatients conducting a  goals  meeting-- a type 
      of small group therapy where patients lay out their plan for 
      the day.  LOUISE, a disheveled and childlike woman in her 
      40s, is speaking.

                                  LOUISE
                    Today, I m going to eat three 
                    square meals because you are what 
                    you eat.

      VICTOR (30s), severe and sharp-tongued with a shaved head and 
      chiseled features, is sitting next to Louise.

                                  VICTOR
                          (sarcastic)
                    Ambitious plan, Louise.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 20


                                  DIANE
                    Let s try to be supportive here.  I 
                    think that s a very productive 
                    goal.  

                                  VICTOR
                    Oh, I m supportive, Doctor D.  I 
                    don t want Louise turning into 
                    whatever the hell that was they 
                    served us for lunch.

      The other patients laugh.  Diane turns to STEVEN, a sad, 
      quivering dock worker in his 30s sitting on the other side of 
      Victor.  There s a cast on his leg.

                                  DIANE
                    Steven, let s hear from you.  What 
                    are your goals for the day?

      Steven mumbles something inaudibly.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Steven?

                                  STEVEN
                          (barely audible)
                    I m... I m gonna call my wife. 

                                  VICTOR
                    Oh, man, here we go again.  She s 
                    leaving, you idiot.  She s done.

      Ellie is listening intently from the doorway.  Something 
      changes on her face, she suddenly seems miles away.



      The voice belongs to Diane, who s standing in front of Ellie 
      at the door.  Ellie snaps back into the moment.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 21

                    jumped out a second story window.

      looks at Ellie, then everyone is looking at her.

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  She ll move on--

                    -- She ll move on.  It ll be easy 
                    or it ll be hard, but she ll move 
                    on because that s what people do.

                                  STEVEN

                    No.  But I do know this:  you can t 
                    use suicide to manipulate people.  
                    It doesn t work. 

                                  STEVEN

                    And where are we going to keep the 
                    shopping cart?

                                  CHUCK
                    The real question is...

      He picks up a plastic animal crate from the cart and turns it 
      so Ellie can see something is ALIVE inside.  Ellie jumps 
      back.

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    What are we supposed to do with a 
                    live damn squirrel?

                                  ELLIE
                    Better than a dead one.

                                  CHUCK
                    Go help your intern.  He s 
                      floundering over there.

      Ellie looks over to see Maneesh trying to talk to the Manic 
      Man from the teaser.  The Man is gesticulating wildly, 
      pacing, speaking a mile-a-minute, clearly running the show.  


                      MANEESHMAN
      Let s try this again.  Is I m a one-one-one-zero-one. 
      there anyone you d like us to You are a zero-zero-zero-
      call?  Family?  Friends?  zero.  All zeros.

      Ellie steps up.  She has an affinity for these types of 
      patients.

                                  ELLIE
                    Why you?

                                  MAN
                    Because I have the information, I 
                    have the codes.  You are a zero-
                        zero-one-one-one-one.

      Something about what he s just said sparks her interest.

                                  ELLIE
                    Huh. 
                          (then)
                    We ll be right back.

                    Hurry, we re running out of time.

      Ellie leads Maneesh away.  She s on to something.

                                  ELLIE
                    Okay.  Why am I excited right now?

                                    MANEESH
                    Um, computers are taking over the 
                    world?

                                  ELLIE
                    Ah, no.  

      She eyes a cop, MIKE, posted in the Triage Area.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Day shift cop-- what s his name?  

                                    MANEESH
                    No idea.

                                  ELLIE
                    Rule number one in the psych ER-- 
                    make friends with the cops.      

      She crosses up to Mike.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Officer, hi.  I m Ellie Harlow, a

                                  ELLIE
                    Nice to meet you, Mike.  And thank 
                    you for what you do.  Without you 
                    this place would be chaos.

                                  MIKE
                    Thanks, doc.

                                  ELLIE
                    Wondering if you might be able to 
                    help us out.  

                                  MIKE
                    I can try.

                                  ELLIE
                    Can you get a list of cars with 
                    southern plates impounded within 
                    the last 24 hours?
                          (then, to Maneesh)
                    New York is a magnet for manics, 
                    they gravitate here from all over.  
                    And when you re king of the world, 
                    you don t bother reading parking 
                    signs.

                                    MANEESH
                    You think our guy is from the 
                    south?

                                  ELLIE
                    Did you hear how he said 
                       infuhmation ?  He dropped the R. 
                      Sometimes, when the meds start to 
                    kick in, you can detect hints of an 
                    accent you didn t hear before.
                          (to Mike)
                    So Mike, what do you say?

                                  MIKE
                    That s not my department, Ma am.

                                  ELLIE
                    Come on.  It s all on the computer.

      Mike s attention drifts to Claire, who s approaching with a 
      notebook in hand.  Ellie notes his interest.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ER boy is still sleeping-- can you 
                    sign off on him in my patient log?  

                                  ELLIE
                    Your what?                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 28


                                  CLAIRE
                    I m keeping a journal of every 
                    patient I see during intern year, 
                    and having every attending sign off 
                    on my treatment plan.

                                    MANEESH
                    Why?  

                                  CLAIRE
                      Educational purposes.  Medical-
                    legal protection.  Research for the 
                    book I m going to write one day.  

                                    MANEESH
                    You re a freak.

      Ellie sees Mike looking at Claire, has an idea.  She turns to 
      Mike as she takes the book and signs.

                                  ELLIE
                    -- She is, you know.  Big time.  
                          (as she signs)
                    Can tie a suture into a slip knot 
                    using only her tongue.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Excuse me?

                                  ELLIE
                    Mike Claire, Claire, Mike.  
                          (to Mike)
                    You get me the info, this intern 
                    will go out to dinner with you.  
                          (off their looks)
                    Play along, kids.  It s for the 
                    greater good.  

      Diane steps up, stern.

                                  DIANE
                    Doctor Harlow, I need to talk to 
                    you.  Now.



      The cafe is crowded, bustling.  Diane is a regular, knows all 
      the people working behind the counter.  

                                  DIANE
                    Therapy is part of your job.  You 
                    don t want to be here, let me know 
                    now before I waste any more time.

      Ellie can sense Diane is serious.

                                  ELLIE
                    Diane.  I want to be here.  I...  
                    I ll be more careful.

                                  DIANE
                    Good.  Because the first rule of ER 
                    psych is don t die.

      They walk up to the counter where JUDGE BERNARD CHAVEZ (45, 
      Hispanic, hipster glasses) orders a coffee from a gregarious 
      35-year-old Italian named NICO behind the counter.  

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Double latte, low foam.

                                  NICO
                    You got it, Judge. 

      Ellie clocks the Judge.  Chavez nods to Diane as he heads 
      over near the condiment counter to wait for his drink.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 30


                                  CHAVEZ
                    Diane.

                                  DIANE
                    Bernard.

      Nico hands Diane a cup of black coffee.

                                  NICO
                    Here you go, Doctor D.  The usual.

                                  DIANE
                    Thanks, Nico. 
                          (turns to Ellie)
                    Anything for--

      Ellie is gone, having followed Judge Chavez over to the 
      condiment counter.  Diane leaves two dollars on the counter 
      and watches Ellie from a distance for a moment.  Ellie is 
      animated, on her game.  Diane joins them, mid conversation.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    She understands the risk of 
                    delaying surgery?

                                  ELLIE
                    Yes, in a way, but--

                                  CHAVEZ
                    But nothing.  She s competent.  

      Nico holds up a cup behind the counter, his coffee is ready.

                                  NICO
                    Judge Chavez!

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Excuse me.

      Chavez starts to claim his coffee, Ellie steps into his path.

                                  ELLIE
                    No, no, no, here s the thing.  

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Excuse me.  You re standing between 
                    me and my latte.

      Ellie doesn t budge.

                                  ELLIE
                    The aneurism could, theoretically, 
                    be impairing perfusion of her 
                    frontal lobe.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 31


                                  CHAVEZ
                    In English, please.

                                  ELLIE
                    The frontal lobe controls 
                      personality.  Which means her 
                      willingness to take risks might be 
                    falsely elevated by the aneurism 
                    itself.  It s like asking a patient 
                    to make a life or death decision 
                    when they re drunk.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    You re saying she s acting drunk?

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  I m saying there s no way 
                    anyone in their right mind would 
                    refuse to reschedule a stupid 
                    wedding for something like this.  
                    I m saying we d all be committing 
                      malpractice if we didn t at least 
                    explore the possibility that--

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Tomorrow morning.  9 AM sharp.

      Chavez moves off.  Diane smiles to herself as she squeezes 
      honey into her coffee.  This is exactly why she hired Ellie.

                                  DIANE
                      Convincing the judge to hold a 
                      competency hearing on a Sunday is 
                    no small feat.  

      Diane licks her stirrer and chucks it into the trash as she 
      starts for the door.  Ellie follows.  On the move:

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Question for you.  Have you ever 
                    tried ecstasy?

                                  ELLIE
                    Tablet or powder?

      Diane smiles, the answer implied.  

                                  DIANE
                    Then I ll assume you know all about 
                    its therapeutic potential for 
                    patients with PTSD.  Of course, the 
                      establishment will never fund 
                    studies using MDMA so we have to be 
                    creative.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 32


                                  ELLIE
                    We?

      Diane and Ellie exit the cafe, emerge on to--

      the hallucinating boy, who is SEIZING violently.  ALARMS 
      BLARE, it s a full-on ER trauma scene.  Maneesh is on a

                    What was the sodium?

                                    MANEESH
                    We never got it.

      The seizing stops.

                    Alright, atta boy.

                                  ELLIE
                    What do you mean, you never got it?

                                    MANEESH
                    Knox cancelled the order, said it 
                    was overkill.

                    What were we supposed to do?  He s 
                    the attending.  

                                  ELLIE
                          (re: David)
                    He s your patient.  He is who 
                    matters.

      Ellie walks over to Knox who is charting at the bedside.  She 
      grabs the chart out of his hands to get his attention.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Why the hell did you cancel the 
                    labs I ordered?

                                  KNOX
                    It s the standard psych move-- you 
                    guys order a bunch of unnecessary 
                      diagnostic tests and refuse to take 
                    the patient until the results are 
                    back and the patient is  medically 
                    cleared.   

                                  ELLIE
                    I wasn t trying to block the 
                      admission.  The kid was talking 
                    about being  a jobber -- it s a 
                    wrestling term.  It got me thinking 
                    that maybe he d been dieting and 
                      over-exercising which led to his 
                      electrolytes being seriously out of 
                    whack.

                                  KNOX
                      Reasonable theory.

                                  ELLIE
                    Which is why I ordered the sodium!

      Knox smiles, flirtatious.

                                  KNOX
                    You know, I like you.

                                  ELLIE
                    SHUT UP!

      Maneesh wheels David s gurney toward them.

      Ellie takes the gurney over from Maneesh and starts to roll 
      down the hall, passing Knox as she goes.

                                  ELLIE
                    I know your type.  The ER shifts 
                    fund the surfing in Fiji and the 
                    rafting and the heli-skiing but you 
                    don t care about the work.  
                          (off his look)
                    If you ever cancel a lab on one my 
                    patients again I will report you to 
                    the Chief of Staff and strangle you 
                    with that ridiculous puka shell 
                    necklace, got it?

      Claire and Maneesh look on, impressed.  She turns to Claire 
      and Maneesh.

      We STAY WITH Ellie as she wheels the gurney down the hall.

      FADE IN:



      The New York Psychiatric Society cocktail party is in full 
      swing.  Ben is there, looking good in an expensive suit.  He 
      works on a whiskey at the bar alongside a distinguished 
      couple in their 60 s, HENRY and GENEVIEVE, who sip Cabernet.  

                                  BEN
                    She just got here and already she s 
                    managed to alienate half the staff.

                                  HENRY
                    Are you in the alienated half or 
                    the unalienated half?

                                  BEN
                    I heard she completely lost it in 
                    the small group session today.

                                  GENEVIEVE
                    But you weren t actually there.

                                  BEN
                    No.  But it s clear Ellie Harlow s 
                    got impulse control issues.  

                                  HENRY
                    You ve mentioned her name five 
                    times and you haven t even finished 
                    one drink.

                                  BEN
                    Stop.

                                  GENEVIEVE
                    Sorry, honey.  I can smell 
                      sublimated attraction from across a 
                    room and you re standing right next 
                    to me.

                                  BEN
                    I m NOT--
                          (stops himself)
                    God, I hate seeing you two at these 
                    things.  Have you thought about 
                    retiring?

      He downs the rest of his drink and turns to put his glass on 
      the bar.  As he does, he sees--                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 37


      ELLIE.  Dressed up in a clingy, vintage-y black cocktail 
      dress.  Beautiful and sexy without trying too hard.  She sees 
      Ben and smiles, beelines in his direction, to the delight of 
      Henry and Genevieve.

                                  GENEVIEVE
                    Ah.  I wonder who this could be.

                                  BEN
                    Behave.

                                  ELLIE
                    Ben, hi, guess what?  Judge Chavez 
                    agreed to a hearing on Lucinda Webb 
                    tomorrow.

                                  BEN
                    You re kidding.  On a Sunday?  

                                  ELLIE
                    Yup.  

                                  BEN

                      Impressed?  Grateful?  Sorry you 
                    ever doubted me?

      Ellie senses Henry and Genevieve watching.

                    receptive to certain types of 
                    personal work.  Sometimes it s 
                    prozac, sometimes it s ecstacy...

      The bartender pours, Diane hands one to Ellie.

      is going with this but downs her drink too.  Diane smiles, a 
      little tipsy.

                      fellowship at Harvard to spend 
                    weekends in a stinky psych ER?

                    How did you... I didn t tell anyone 
                    about the fellowship.

                                  DIANE
                    We only get to hire new faculty

                    the real question is... why did you 
                    choose us?

                    Maybe the patients here make you 
                    feel sane in comparison.  Maybe you 
                    have a hero complex.  Maybe you 
                    like puzzles that can break your 
                    nose.

                    Every patient interaction is a 
                    window into yourself and you might

                      psychiatrist.  But you have to 
                    manage it.  You re like Luke

      Drayton, MD, and a phone number.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Cate Drayton.  I think she d be a 
                    good fit for you. 

                                  ELLIE
                    What?

                                  DIANE
                    We all have our hotspots, Ellie,

                    find them.

                    Get there first and do the work, 
                    or, I assure you, you will drown 
                    here.

      Ellie takes the napkin with a tense, disingenuous smile.

                                  ELLIE
                          (with an edge)
                    Thanks, Diane.  Appreciate it.  

      Miffed, Ellie moves off.  We STAY WITH her as she looks at 
      the napkin again before chucking it into the trash and 
      heading for the door.  Ben watches her go, realizing he s a 
      little too aware of her position in the room.  He shoots a 
      look to his parents.  Dammit, they were right.



      Ellie opens her eyes to find herself in the back of a moving 
      ambulance.  She takes in her surroundings, sees a PARAMEDIC 
      riding alongside her.

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Hey there.  You re awake.  

      Ellie tries to sit up but strains against the surgical tape 
      holding her head to the gurney.

                                  ELLIE
                    I don t need a hospital.

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Sit tight, Ma am.  We ll be there 
                    soon.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 44


      In the front seat, the DRIVER is listening to a baseball game 
      on the radio.  He calls back to the Paramedic.

                                  DRIVER (V.O.)
                    Tigers lost, six-three.

      The Paramedic scoots up towards the front so he can talk to 
      the driver through the partition.

                                  PARAMEDIC     
                    You owe me ten bucks, man.

      Ellie peels off the surgical tape holding her head and sits 
      up.  She glances over her shoulder at the Paramedic who s 
      still wrapped up in sports talk with the Driver.

                                  PARAMEDIC (CONT D)
                    When the hell are they going to 
                    dump Randy Smith?

      As the rig slows for a red light, Ellie sees an opportunity.  

                                  PARAMEDIC (CONT D)
                    59 games?  I mean, come on!

      She rips the wires out of the monitor and in a fluid move, 
      THROWS OPEN the back door of the ambulance and LEAPS OUT, 
      SMASHING the side of her head into the asphalt as she lands.  



      Ellie, a fitted coat over her cocktail dress, walks briskly 
      through the ICU.  Ellie seems a bit adrift as she stops at 
      Lucinda Webb s room.  Lucinda is awake, a notebook in hand.

                                  ELLIE
                    Hey there.  You re awake.

                                    LUCINDA
                    Yeah.  A million things to do the 
                    week before a wedding.  Don t you 
                    ever go home?

                                  ELLIE
                    I came back to give you one last 
                    chance to change your mind.

                                    LUCINDA
                    Doctor.  I thought I was clear.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 45


                                  ELLIE
                    Ms. Webb, tomorrow morning I am 
                    going to go before a judge and 
                    argue that you are incompetent to 
                    make this decision for yourself.

                                    LUCINDA
                    You can do that?

                                  ELLIE
                    I m going to say that your aneurism 
                    is affecting your judgement.  And 
                    since this is impossible to 
                    actually prove or disprove, there 
                    is a very good chance the judge is 
                    going to agree with me and force 
                    you to have the surgery.

                                    LUCINDA
                    What?  Why?

                                  ELLIE
                    Because your daughter s wedding is 
                    not worth dying for.  She wouldn t 
                    want you to take this chance.

                                    LUCINDA
                    You don t understand.

                                  ELLIE
                    That s where you re wrong.  I do. 
                    I do understand.  You die, a part 
                    of her dies too.

      In one swift move, Lucinda YANKS her IV out of her arm, 
      causing blood to leak out onto the floor.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    I m leaving.

                                  ELLIE
                    No, you re not.  I ve placed you on 
                    a hold until after the hearing.  

      Lucinda sees a security guard at the door, starts crying.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    This seems extreme because it is.

                      psychiatrist when you have no

                    Get out.  GET OUT OF HERE!



      It s Sunday morning in the Fishbowl.  Ellie is in charge, 
      running through cases with Claire as Chuck feeds chunks of a 
      day old donut to the squirrel in it s cage.  As she talks, 
      Ellie cleans up coffee cups, candy bar wrappers and other 
      detritus from the night shift.

                                  ELLIE
                    It s like after midnight, the 
                    garbage cans turn invisible.

                    And somebody get a clonodine patch 
                    on the obsessive subway guy, his 
                      dyskinesias are worse.

                    Freudian theory says obsessions are

                                  ELLIE
                    Claire, this is Bellevue, not some

      Ellie s about to chuck a few old tortilla chips but Chuck 
      stops her.

                                  CHUCK
                    Uh-uh.  Florence likes those.

                                  ELLIE
                    Florence?  I thought it was a boy 
                    for some reason.  
                          (off Chuck s look)
                    It seems boyish.

                    You.  Come on.  Let s round.



      Ellie and Claire approach David Bellinger, the seizing boy 
      from earlier.  He s sitting up in bed, lucid and texting.

                    I m Doctor Harlow, this is Doctor

                    Totally normal.  Did anyone explain 
                    what happened?

                    The sodium level in your blood was

      David s not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

                                  ELLIE
                    Soon.  But listen... last night you 
                    mentioned  jobbing .  Are you a 
                    wrestler?

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah.

                                  ELLIE
                    My brother was a wrestler.  
                    Sometimes he did some pretty crazy 
                    things to get his weight down.  
                    Rubber sweatsuits.  Diuretics.  

      David s eyes widen at the mention of diuretics.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    You see, there just aren t that 
                    many ways for a healthy guy like 
                    you to throw his electrolytes so 
                    out of whack.  Diuretic abuse is 
                    kinda my leading theory here. 

                                  DAVID
                    You re not going to tell my coach, 
                    are you?

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  You re an adult, you can do 
                    whatever you want.

                                  DAVID

                                  ELLIE
                    Really.

                                  DAVID
                    Because what I d really like to do 
                    is bend you over the sink.

                    Sorry, but you guys are the hottest 
                    doctors I ve ever seen.

      Claire and Ellie react.  The guy is a misogynist prick.

                    down the hall.  One word from me 
                    and he ll come here and beat your

      David is shocked into submission.

                    Um, yeah...

      Ellie turns to Claire approvingly as they walk out.

                    Ms. Webb.  This is a competency 
                    hearing.  Do you understand what 
                    that is?

                                    LUCINDA
                    Yes.     

                                  CRAIG
                    Your honor, these doctors are 
                    trying to make a case that Lucinda 
                    Webb lacks decision making capacity 
                    but it s a ridiculous claim.  

                                  BEN
                    Sir, Ms. Webb needs emergent 
                    surgery to repair a leaking brain 
                    aneurism.  

                                  ELLIE
                    If she waits, the risk of a 
                      catastrophic head-bleed could be as 
                    high as twenty percent.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Ms. Webb, anything you want to say?

                                    LUCINDA
                    I don t understand any of this.  I 
                    mean, I ve made my decision.  I 
                    don t know why none of you can 
                    respect that.

      Lucinda is emotional.  Ellie seizes an opportunity.

                                  ELLIE
                    Your honor, her lesion may be 
                    causing emotional lability.

                                    LUCINDA
                    My husband... he left me two years 
                    ago... It wasn t just that there 
                    was another woman.  He actually 
                    went to a dating site to find 
                    another woman.  He went looking for 
                    someone younger.  Someone much 
                    younger who likes football and 
                      snowboarding.

                    Get to the point, Mrs. Webb.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 52


                                    LUCINDA
                    For the past two years, I ve felt 
                    like a carton of milk sitting in 
                    the fridge past it s expiration 
                    date.  And it wasn t just that I 
                    was old... older.  It was that 
                    there was nothing left.  My husband 
                    was gone.  My daughter was gone, 
                    working at her crazy law firm, 
                    eating Chinese food at her desk 
                    every night.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    What is your understanding of the 
                    risk?  That is the question here.

                                    LUCINDA
                    My understanding is that risks are 
                    part of living.  

                                  ELLIE
                    Your honor, the aneurism may also 
                    be creating a distorted sense of 
                      invincibility.

      Lucinda glares at Ellie.

                                    LUCINDA
                    I know I m not invincible. 

      Close on Ellie, Lucinda s words resonating.



                                    LUCINDA
                    For those years after he left, I 
                    barely went out of the house.  But 
                    then, slowly, I started doing 
                    things.  A book club.  Playing 
                    scrabble online with strangers.  
                    Nothing big.  But these were things 
                    I never would have done before.

                                  ELLIE
                    Judge, I don t see how this--

      Lucinda refuses to be shut down.

                                    LUCINDA
                    -- And then, over time, I got 
                    bolder.  A trip to Italy.  A 
                    singles mixer.  Dance lessons for 
                    Maggie s wedding.  

      Off Ellie we--



                                    LUCINDA
                    I am going to dance the tango with 
                    my hot gay dance instructor at my 
                      daughter s wedding this weekend 
                    because for the first time in two 
                    years, I feel awake.  I understand 
                    the risks and I ve decided.  I ve 
                    decided I m not going to die before 
                    I m actually dead.

                    Your honor?

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    She s not incompetent. 

      Ben is totally blindsided.  What the fuck is going on?

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    She knows what she s doing.  And 
                    she needs to be there.

                    Doctor Harlow can t unilaterally

                    If you guys don t have consensus 
                    about her lacking capacity then 
                    we re done.

                    I m sorry.  But all of a sudden it 
                    made sense.  This court order would 
                    have made us feel better but it 
                    would have done absolutely nothing

                    Look, I m not perfect, alright?  
                    But you clearly have some 
                      conflicted feelings about me that 
                    you re going to have to work out--

                                  BEN
                    Don t-- just don t.  I am sick of 
                      psychiatrists trying to out psych 
                    each other.  I grew up with that my 
                    whole life.  No.  The problem is 
                    not some kind of psycho-trigger.

      FADE IN:



      Ellie appears at the door of Lucinda s room.  Lucinda is 
      dressed, ready to go.  Daughter MAGGIE (20s) and future son-
      in-law LEO (20s) are there to pick her up.

                                  ELLIE
                    Knock, knock.  

      Lucinda isn t sure what to make of Ellie at the door. 

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    I just wanted to say goodbye.

      Ellie steps in, Lucinda looks nervous.  Leo and Maggie don t 
      know the whole story about why she was here.

                                    LUCINDA
                    Doctor Harlow.  This my daughter, 
                    Maggie, and her fiance Leo. 

                                  ELLIE
                    Hello.  And congratulations.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Thanks.  And thanks for taking care 
                    of my mom. 

      Lucinda tries to act casual.

                                    LUCINDA
                    We should get going, honey.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m glad it s nothing serious but 
                    how come nobody has any idea why 
                    she passed out?

      Ellie hesitates.  Either she betrays Lucinda s confidence or 
      corroborate with this dangerous gamble.  Ellie takes a 
      breath.

                                  ELLIE
                    Sometimes tests don t tell the 
                    whole story.  But the one thing we 
                    do know is that your mom is a very 
                    strong woman.  
                          (then)

      Lucinda is hugely relieved not to be outed.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    Thank you, Doctor Harlow.  For 
                      everything.

                                  LEO
                    I ll go get the car.

      Lucinda gives Ellie a hug as Leo and Maggie file out.  Ellie 
      returns the embrace--

                                  ELLIE
                    If you re not back here five 
                    minutes after that bouquet is 
                    thrown I m hunting your ass down, 
                      understood?

                                    LUCINDA
                      Understood.  

      With a grateful smile, Lucinda goes to join her family.



      Maneesh and Claire watch as Chuck holds out an almond to  
      Florence the squirrel who s now out of the cage.

                    Not really.  Animal training is

                    it s most basic form.

                    praying squirrel in a ward full of 
                      hallucinating psychotics is a bad 
                    idea?  Or is that just me?

                    Oh.  Hi.  That was fast.

                                  MIRA
                    Got on the first plane out of 
                      Charlottesville when you called.  
                          (then)
                    Can I see him now?



      Ellie, Maneesh take Mira to a gurney where her husband, 
      Charles Kennerly, AKA Manic Man, sleeps.

                    He s gonna be out for a while.  
                      Combination of meds and the fact 
                    that he probably didn t get much 
                    sleep the last few days.

                                  MIRA
                    Thank you so much for finding me so 
                    fast.  Last year he was missing for 
                    over a week.

      Ellie gets a chair for Mira.  She sits, takes Charles  hand.

                                  MIRA
                    Nine years.  We met when we were 
                    both getting our PhDs in 
                      engineering.  He was so amazing-- 
                    he could memorize an entire 
                    chemistry text in a day.  We didn t 
                    realize that it was the onset of... 
                    this. 
                          (collecting herself)
                    You know, when he s on his meds, he 
                    wins teaching awards.  Makes great 
                      cappuccino.  Reads Tolkien to me in 
                    bed.  All the rest... I just try to 
                    accept it as part of the deal.

                    That s incredibly hard to do.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 59


                                  MIRA
                          (emotional)
                    The key is to let go of an illusion 
                    of perfection, you know?  Your life 
                    is your life.  There is no normal.

                    Can I wait here until he wakes up?

                                  ELLIE
                    Of course.

      Ellie and Maneesh move off.  Ellie has clearly been affected 
      by Mira s words.  Maneesh notices.

                                    MANEESH
                          (smiles)
                    This is all just a power trip for 
                    you, huh?

      Ellie gives him a playful shove.  

                                  ELLIE
                    Tell anyone and you re dead.
                          (then)
                    Check it out.

      They see Claire LEAVING the ward with Mike the Cop.  

                                    MANEESH
                    No way.

      Diane steps up.

                                  DIANE
                    Ready to sign out?

                                  ELLIE
                    Hell, yeah.

                                  DIANE
                      Congratulations, Ellie.  First 
                    weekend at Bellevue.  You survived.



      MUSIC STARTS as Ellie and Knox knock over a row of kayaks and 
      have sex among the boats and paddles of a boathouse.  It's 
      fun and hot and... very much alive.   


      Vanessa sits up in bed, sexy in a sea of white.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 62


                                    VANESSA
                    Hey.  Sorry about Friday, I got 
                    wrapped up with the DJ and sorta 
                    lost track of you.

      From Vanessa s POV we see the HOT DJ from the Teaser is 
      lounging at the other end of the bed, painting Vanessa s 
      toenails black.

                                  ELLIE
                    That s okay, I went home early.  

                                    VANESSA
                    Lunch at Tartine?  We need to catch 
                    up.

                                  ELLIE
                    Perfect.  Meet you there at one.

                                    VANESSA
                    Isn t it great to be free on a 
                    Monday instead of locked to a desk 
                    like normal people?

                                  ELLIE
                    You know, Vanessa... there is no 
                    normal.  

      Ellie hangs up as she approaches a beautiful prewar building.  
      She takes a breath and walks in through the doors...  MATCH 
      CUT WITH:


      Ellie comes into an office-- we see from a sign it's the 
      MIDTOWN ROWING CLUB.  She's joining, getting her own kayak.  
      A CLERK hands her a form and a pen.  MATCH CUT WITH:



      Ellie signs in at the desk and heads into an elevator as-



      Ellie walks down a long hallway.  She stops at a door marked 
      Cate Drayton, MD, Psychotherapy.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 63


      It's the therapist from the napkin that Diane gave her.  
      Ellie knocks.  Dr. CATE DRAYTON (late 40s, expensive 
      pantsuit) opens the door.    

                                  ELLIE
                    Doctor Drayton?  I m Ellie Harlow. 

                                    DRAYTON
                    Come in.

      Ellie steps into the gorgeous minimalist office.

                                  ELLIE
                    I m afraid I m not very good at 
                    this.

                                    DRAYTON
                    That s okay.  I am.

      Ellie looks out to sweeping views of the Hudson, emotional--

                                  ELLIE
                    A few nights ago... I dove off a 
                    party cruise into the East River.

      Doctor Drayton takes this in.

                                    DRAYTON
                    That sounds like a good place to 
                    start.
