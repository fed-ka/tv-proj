The morning Circle of Sales! Employees and their wares.
Larry stands, yet to speak, ready for his moment of
pronounced enthusiasm...

Larry Crowne leads the High Fives.
MENSWEAR DEPT - LATER
Larry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle
Map... stacking a mountain of tube socks... stocking those
briefs ... hanging "Metallica" Speedos on little hangers...
helping CUBBY - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor -
clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again.
3.
MOMMY
Too much mac & cheese for this
little pickle bug!
LARRY CROWNE
They do love the comfort food.
Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug...
Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done...
The BIG STORK PIZZA BOXES have been raided for slices.
A RETIREMENT PARTY is going on. A SIGN reads "Good Luck
Dorothy Genkos!" The name has been printed over the last
person to retire. People are cutting loose as best they can
at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete.
None more than Larry. Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for
DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady. This is a fun group.
Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: COX,
STRANG, ANDREWS and HURLEY (Female).
4.
STRANG
Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two-
K a year are history. Who else
would do us that favor?
ANDREWS
Wish they'd all sail off like her.
Save us some grief.
STRANG
The "R" Bomb is going to do some
collateral damage to this place.
Hurley is shocked!
HURLEY
"R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?
COX
Separating the chaff from the
wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff,
right?
HURLEY
Chaff is the waste matter, correct.
When are we restructuring?
COX
Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders.
Hurley looks sick. She hates this.
STRANG
What say we drop a brick in the
pond to warn the herd?
ANDREWS
How?
STRANG
Firing someone.
COX
Someone they'd never expect to be
let go. To look fair. I like it.
STRANG
Like a Team Leader.
HURLEY
Team Leader?
STRANG
5.
COX
Suggestions on who it should be?
STRANG
I say Crowne.
HURLEY
Larry Crowne?
Strang rolls his eyes.
STRANG
Who else? Avery won't retire. We
fire him, it's a law suit.
AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.
STRANG (CONT'D)
Alvarez is about to drop a kid.
She'll go part time in a week.
ALVAREZ - Heavy with child.
STRANG (CONT'D)
Crowne's pink slip will save 'da
"U" big green backwash.
COX
What Salary Tier is Crowne at?
ANDREWS
Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L.
bump at the first of the year.
COX
Sweet. We'll need Actionable
Cause, of course.
They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."
COX (CONT'D)
How's his review record?
HURLEY
He's a candidate for Employee of
the Month. His 22nd time.
COX
Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a
reason...
Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.
6.
HURLEY
We could use the Limited Horizons
strategy.
(EXPLAINING)
Larry will always be passed over
for Management. He never went to
college.
COX
You're that familiar with his
record?
STRANG
She was his squeeze for a few
weeks, weren't you, Vick?
HURLEY
That was before the New Employee
Covenants. That you even
remember...
STRANG
The memory haunts me.
ANDREWS
He'll sock us for severance.
STRANG
Big brick in the pond, though.
COX
Let's call it. Today, end of
shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu.
LARRY is dancing up a storm.
Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is
fastidious in his work.
The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no
attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by.
VASQUEZ
LC Why still here?
7.
LARRY CROWNE
Team Leaders zone departments
before punching out. It's policy.
VASQUEZ
I mean here here. You just got
paged to Meeting Room 2.
The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of.
LARRY CROWNE
Probably to clean up after the
party.
VASQUEZ
Isn't it Employee of the Month Day?
Larry brightens. That is what it must be.
LARRY CROWNE
Speck-tack-alar.
Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps.
VASQUEZ
You're the only one around here who
deserves it. How many will this
be?
LARRY CROWNE
Ah, who's counting?
He flashes his fingers: twenty two!
Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the
substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats.
LARRY CROWNE
Remember how we saw "The UniMart
Way" video, Vick? You and me,
alone in this room, and look at us
now.
Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.
STRANG
Cubby. Make tracks.
The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves
8.
LARRY CROWNE
I think I know what this is about.
STRANG
I don't think you do.
COX
Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So
we take care. Which makes moments
like these tough for all of us.
LARRY CROWNE
Sounds like you're firing me.
Larry is joking.
STRANG
I take it back.
COX
Corporate has mandated a
restructuring in all UniMart
stores. That's the word they use.
I call it a pain in the touchas.
(THEN)
It is touchas, right? Where you
get kicked?
HURLEY
Yeah. A yiddish word.
ANDREWS
Like the buttocks.
HURLEY
Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.
COX
Hurts to get kicked back there, no
matter what language you speak.
Larry now gets it.
LARRY CROWNE
UniMart is firing me...
STRANG
Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
LARRY CROWNE
Why me?
9.
ANDREWS
Who do you suggest? Alvarez?
Avery? I don't think so.
LARRY CROWNE
Why not Strang?
Strang snorts.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
I've been here longer than you,
Jack. I started 21 years ago as an
Inventory Associate at the store on
Euclid.
Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.
HURLEY
Seniority would preclude this
reality, Larry, but UniMart's
policy is to never limit your
horizons.
Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.
COX
Here's the prob: your lack of a
graduate degree will forever retard
any move up the management ladder.
STRANG
Becasue you never went to college
you're forever retarded.
LARRY CROWNE
I won't make the Front Office?
STRANG
Never.
(shows his college ring)
S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs!
It's true.
LARRY CROWNE
I went in the Navy. Right outta
high school. Five years, and by
then...
COX
Thank you for your service to our
country, Larry. And, in total
seriousness to UniMart too
10.
LARRY CROWNE
I thought I was Employee of the
Month.
STRANG
In a way, you are.
Larry can't believe this. Nor can he move.
LARRY CROWNE
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose
my house...
COX
The timing on this is always a
bitch.
LARRY CROWNE
Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys.
Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this.
Can't we fix this?
COX
Really wish we could.
(THEN)
Vick? The generous severance
package?
She has a folder with posted "Sign Here's."
HURLEY
Sign here. Here. Here. Initial
that. Sign here. One more. Done.
Strang finds one last piece of party pizza.
Larry pulls up at a red light. From his hands-free speaker
jerry-rigged on his dash, we hear ON-HOLD Music.
RECORDED VOICE
Then, we hear the engines of SCOOTERS -- at least a dozen of
them. They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter
of the riders as they scream over their engines as they AD-
"Remember, you always have a friend
at RiverBank..."
LIB where they are going next...
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE)
Laurie Gammelgaard thank you for
holding how may I help you?
Larry has to shout over the SCOOTER SQUAD ruckus.
LARRY CROWNE
I was holding for Barry Raphael in
Home and Real Estate?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
Mr. Raphael is no longer with the
bank. How can I help you?
LARRY CROWNE
Barry is gone? I need to talk to
someone in Home and Real Estate.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
12.
The SCOOTER SQUAD has made their decision and peel out --
VROOM, YEOOW...
LARRY CROWNE
(reading his ATM card)
I wish! I'm Customer number 566
7878 2031 339 and I can be there in
three minutes!
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE)
As long as you are here before six,
okey dokey.
ZZZZZMMMM, BLAARREE... The scooters are gone, but Larry is
still yelling...
LARRY CROWNE
Three minutes!
Larry sits at Gammelgaard's desk looking at his own records,
sipping complimentary coffee that is ghastly.
LARRY CROWNE
What happened to Barry Raphael?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (PRE-LAP)
Barry Raphael was harassing the
younger tellers but we are not
supposed to admit that.
(THE PAPERS)
This is some kick in the head.
Not sure what to tell you, Mr.
Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE
I m hoping not to lose my house.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
You're carrying what on the house?
LARRY CROWNE
$291,987.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble.
Three years ago I'd have loaned you
$700,000, but I think you read the
papers.
LARRY CROWNE
13.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD No.
She gets a brochure: "The RiverBank Survival Plan!"
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (CONT'D)
But RiverBank does have a plan for
you.
(THE BROCHURE)
In a few weeks your financial base
will tell us what we can do. Find
new employment. Liquidate
everything low on the Value Index.
Stick to a budget. Clip coupons,
buy in bulk, you know the drill.
Then come back and we'll work with
you.
LARRY CROWNE
That's RiverBank's plan for me?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
It is Friday, Mr. Crowne...
HIS UNIMART POLO SHIRT
He is holding it in his hands.
THE LAUNDRY ROOM
Larry is about to throw the thing away, but then puts it and
some fabric softener in his washer.
LIVING ROOM - LATER
Mood music plays from the Crowne Vinyl Library, a complete
wall of LP's. Alphabetized... We can see into the...
KITCHEN
Larry sits in his breakfast nook with an old laptop computer
and a pot of coffee.
An on-line job application... Mega-Save. Larry is entering
his data. He comes across that part of any application that
will forever be daunting to him.
EDUCATION/ COLLEGE
What can he do, but enter the truth?
NONE.
More On-line Applications flash by....
Plug-It-In Center...Education/ College -- Didn't Go
White Front House and Home ... Education/ College -- High
School! Go, Navy!
Furniture Planet ... Education/ College -- Is it necessary?
Patterson's Appliances ... Education/ College -- Masters
Degree: School of HARD KNOCKS!!!
15.
Larry stops. This may be futile. He looks about to give up.
But then, he thinks.
He stands. Thinks some more...
IRONING BOARD
Unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment. The
iron breathes hot fumes... spray starch plumes like jet
exhaust.
Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis
to perfection.
He is focused. Intense. And good at ironing...
Way back in the rear of the store, behind a false panelling a
furniture store should be ashamed of, Larry has filled out
another application and is waiting for someone to give it to.
A PLANET STAFFER finally shows her head.
16.
LARRY CROWNE
How do I offer this up to
Personnel?
PLANET STAFFER
There should be a box to put it in.
Larry finds a box.
LARRY CROWNE
This?
PLANET STAFFER
No. There should be another box.
LARRY CROWNE
There isn't.
PLANET STAFFER
That's the one, then.
Larry is alone again - ignored as he applies for this job.
Now he's asking some HEAD COOK pulling cutlets.
Larry is talking to CHEF AMOS, who runs the place.
18.
CHEF AMOS
Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne.
I never forget anyone who quits on
me.
LARRY CROWNE
As I recall, I gave my notice and
worked all my shifts and that was
12 years ago.
CHEF AMOS
As I recall, I had to hire and
train a line cook to take your
place. Walking out doesn't happen
in a vacuum, you know.
(THEN)
Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a
job again. But you've been out of
the business a long time, and look
around. I don't need you.
The place is fully staffed and rocking. Larry will not be
working here.
Larry is seated at the counter. PERRY pours him coffee as
RAUL -- the head cook -- is talking from the service window.
CARLOS and NICK are in the back.
RAUL
You come in two weeks ago I would
have kissed you on the mouth, but
Carlos and Nick, they walked in.
Best I can do? Put you at the top
of the list.
Raul goes back to work.
PERRY
Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I
could help you but Raul runs the
back.
19.
LARRY CROWNE
Not sure I could work here anyway.
The atmosphere is too pleasant and
the clientle too A Number 1.
PERRY
Breakfast on the house. Chorizo
Scramble, right?
LARRY CROWNE
No charity today. I got things to
do.
PERRY
Like what?
LARRY CROWNE
Nothing. I was just saying that.
He is alone. He is going to lose his house. He has nothing
to do. He has no future. He sits on the couch. ESPN's
SportsCenter is showing highlights...
He's asleep on the couch. He awakens to the very same
edition of ESPN's SportsCenter showing the very same
highlights.
Larry wants to shoot himself in the head. Instead, he picks
up the catalog of East City College....
Larry is trying to make sense out of the application. An
Enrollment Counsellor - DAVE BUSIK - sidles up to him.
BUSIK
Back to college, huh?
LARRY CROWNE
First time. I was in the Navy.
BUSIK
(HIMSELF)
Coast Guard. Adventure of a
Lifetime.
LARRY CROWNE
Galley Mate.
23.
BUSIK
We teach a whole track in Hotel and
Restaurant Food Preparation.
LARRY CROWNE
No. No, no. I need an all-new
career and a place to go everyday.
BUSIK
Those two things are my specialty.
HALLWAY -- walking towards Busik's cubicle.
BUSIK (CONT'D)
First thing. Bravo for choosing
East City College. Never too late
for an education. Second, you need
a jolt to the confidence machinery.
He grabs a folder...
BUSIK (CONT'D)
I am going to change your life.
(a page in the catalog)
Speech 217: The Art of Informal
Remarks, cause it's not enough to
just be smart anymore, you have to
project ease even when it ain't
easy.
LARRY CROWNE
Is this Public Speaking?
BUSIK
It's training. Job interviews will
be a breeze with the confidence
you'll get from Speech Two One
Seven.
(even better...)
And you'll spend three hours a week
with the most attractive package in
all of Academia. The Golden Girl
of East City.
(MAGICAL WORDS)
Mercedes Tainot.
Mercedes stops at the doorway.
25.
MERCEDES TAINOT
This is it?
P.O.V.
NINE STUDENTS sit self-consciously, including PINEDO,
DIBIASI, MACK, and CALIMERIS
Mercedes quickly does a head count.
MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)
...7, 8, 9.
She laughs.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
My day has just been made and it's
only 8:02 in the morning!
(THEN)
This class...is CANCELLED!!
Mercedes explains.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
The city charter requires a minimum
of ten students per class,
otherwise it costs more to have us
here than not. Did you really want
a class at 8 AM? I didn't. Throw
out those alarm clocks!
Larry Crowne bursts through the door - panting for breath.
LARRY CROWNE
Please tell me this is Speech 217.
Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates
Larry Crowne.
She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in
large, shaky-yet-feminine script:
CARE.
She underlines it four times.
MERCEDES TAINOT
While earning a Masters in
Shakespearean Political Discourse
from Vassar, I learned to care.
Caring is a prerequisite for this
class I have to teach in this
(THEN)
(MORE)
26.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Participate. Show up on time.
(Larry gets a eye on that)
Care. And stay awake the 55
minutes three dawns a week I have
to be here, or I will fail you and
not care.
(a name on the board)
My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie-
knot'. Tay-no. You will each
address the class on Wednesday. A
procedure. How. To do. Something.
Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her.
Dibiasi raises his hand.
DIBIASI
Ms. Tie-knot?
Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him.
DIBIASI (CONT'D)
Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo...
MERCEDES TAINOT
Who are you?
DIBIASI
Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me
Nomad. Only two days before I
gotta get up and give my address?
You may be dreaming.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Why are you here, Steve?
DIBIASI
Counsellor Busik said this class
would change my life.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Busik. Of course...
Dibiasi's cell phone rings.
DIBIASI
I gotta take this...
Mercedes Tainot may kill this kid.
An actual classroom, but in sad shape. In one section sits
LALA PINEDO - from the Speech Class.
Larry sees her and sits next to her, oblivious to the fact
that she is cripplingly shy.
LARRY CROWNE
Look at us, in two classes in a
row.
PINEDO
Yes. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE
That Ms. Tainot is something else
isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge
life and, I confess, she sca es e
This whole place scares me.
PINEDO
Yes.
LARRY CROWNE
I woke up this morning so nervous
about the first day of school. I
changed my clothes three times.
We may have noticed TALIA FRANCESCO - a very stylish young
student - come in and sit nearby. No notebook or anything...
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. Larry Crowne, and I'm
babbling.
PINEDO
I am Lala.
DR. MATSUTANI (O.C.)
I order you to turn off all cell
phones, smart phones, and any phone-
like devices!
The teacher comes in - DR. MATSUTANI.
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
You have entered The Knowledge
Zone!! Econ Prime! One textbook!
(holding it up)
Written by? Ed Matsutani, PhD.
That's me! Read this book Follow
into the Promised Land!
(MORE)
28.
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
(he laughs mock
MANIACALLY)
That usually scares people. Yet
none of you have fled. A good
economic indicator.
Larry leans over to Lala.
LARRY CROWNE
I like this guy...
PINEDO
Yes...
Much like the other. Four students sit, waiting for class to
begin.
Mercedes has already written up on the board in Happy Letters
"English 40: Shakespeare As Politician. CARE! PLEASE! I
DO!!!"
But no one else is showing up.
The clock shows 3:09. MERCEDES TAINOT
What happened to the 16 sign-ups?
(NOTHING)
Shakespeare as I know him... is
cancelled.
EXT GAS STATION - AFTERNOON
Larry is filling up his car, watching his money go down his
gas pipe.
A body builder on a SCOOTER -- a guy we will come to know as
DELL GORDO -- pulls in to the opposite pump. He flips up the
seat, pops the pump into his scooter tank, and in seconds, is
done.
That scooter only sips gasoline. Off Dell goes, while
Larry's tank fills and fills and fills...
Patience is at her home office - card table. Coupons.
Computer on eBay.
PATIENCE
Your next wife might stand smoking
that pipe in the house but your
first one says 'uh-uh!'
On the old TV on "Wheel of Fortune" (A person).
LAMARR
Passing through, woman...
Lamarr goes through the patio doors to the back yard, a space
filled with even more yard sale items.
PATIENCE
Larry Crowne, been thinking about
you. Sit down here...
Larry watches Vanna White turn letters - he solves the
puzzle.
LARRY CROWNE
"College Graduate."
PATIENCE
That's going to be you someday.
She's pulled up some LP's on eBay on the computer.
30.
PATIENCE (CONT'D)
You have money in all those
records. If you can part with
them, they'd go for something on
the eBay. I'll show you how...
From the back patio, Lamarr comes in pushing a scooter in not
too bad of shape, though its windscreen is faded.
LAMARR
This what you're talking about?
LARRY CROWNE
That's a hunk of junk.
LAMARR
This is classic.
LARRY CROWNE
It doesn't work.
LAMARR
It will for eight hundred dollars.
LARRY CROWNE
Two hundred.
LAMARR
Seven hundred.
LARRY CROWNE
Two hundred.
LAMARR
Six fifty.
LARRY CROWNE
Two hundred.
LAMARR
Six thirty.
PATIENCE
Gonna be a long night with you two.
LARRY CROWNE
Forget it.
LAMARR
Larry! The secret of any
negotiation is for both of us to
win Talk to me How much do you
31.
The cyclist pulls up right next to:
Larry Crowne, riding a scooter for the first time. Gives the
passing Rider - who couldn't care less -- a 'thumbs up!'
RIDER
How you doing...
LARRY CROWNE
Speck-tack-alar.
(THEN)
Nice machine. Where you headed?
RIDER
Work.
LARRY CROWNE
School. College. I'm a student.
What do you do?
RIDER
I'm a gynecologist.
LARRY CROWNE
Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day'
but that would be stating the
35.
The light changes.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
You take care.
As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he
stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.
Mercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit
hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls
from her Thermo-cup.
Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes.
In front of the board that says "PHONES OFF!!" Calimeris is
demonstrating an exercise for her speech.
CALIMERIS
With the push-up added, the 4-count
Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie
and works out the pecs and biceps.
It's an all-in-one exercise perfect
for Cheerleader conditioning. The
6-COUNT BURPIE
37.
The class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a
fan.
MERCEDES TAINOT
We now all know how to Burpie.
Thank you.
(THEN)
Who's next?
No one volunteers. Though Pinedo is about to...
MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)
Make me the bad guy.
(HER ROSTER)
Ms. Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE
You mean me?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Mr. Crowne. My bad.
Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.
Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.'
He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue.
MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)
Go.
LARRY CROWNE
My presentation will be on the
subject of a very particular
procedure. "How to make French
Toast", but I'll speak English...
Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks
to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...
MERCEDES TAINOT
M classes were once filled with
e rnest young men ready to learn
all I had to teach them. Cute boys
fresh out of High School who all
had crushes on me from day one. Now
look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound
for jail. Mack. Treating college
like another tour of combat.
Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd
be Osric in Act 5. The part that is
always cut.
38.
Larry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking,
only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)...
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Busik, I am going to kill you. You
can't suggest these saps take
Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me
in at this ungodly hour for 2
minutes on French toast?
Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about
Larry.
She is a stone face.
LARRY CROWNE
Most people think syrup comes out of
a plastic bottle.
MERCEDES TAINOT
(still talking to herself)
Great. The history of the sugar
maple tree now. Thank you
Wikipedia.
Larry still has a dozen cards to go.
But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up.
LARRY CROWNE
That went fast...
MERCEDES TAINOT
Breakfast may never be ready.
Larry gathers his cards. Busik gives him a 'bravo!'
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Next.
Pinedo tries to volunteer to go next...
DIBIASI
I'll go. But you aren't going to
like it.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Are you clairvoyant?
DIBIASI

DIBIASI (CONT'D)

Mercedes rolls her head. Busik laughs out loud.
BUSIK
Simple. Direct. Informative.
An incomprehensible POWERPOINT GRAPHIC is projected with Dr.
M. explaining what it means. Gibberish!!
Larry is taking notes, beside Lala, when his phone vibrates.
He flinches to turn it off before getting into trouble.
On his phone a message: TALIA: "Scoot?"
It takes a moment for him to understand what is going on.
His phone buzzes again.
to your right"
Larry looks as instructed. He sees Talia, phone in hand,
miming riding a scooter -- you and me -- wind in our hair...
Another text: TALIA: "Lance! Look
Larry gets it. Nods okay. Turning back, he finds Dr.
Matsutani, standing over him. Palm out.
DR. MATSUTANI
Your mobile, please.
Larry hands it over.
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
I will return it after class if I
don't crush it first.
Talia and Patience are putting outfits together from off the
hangers.
TALIA
Layer this... with this.
PATIENCE
Add this belt?
TALIA
I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT?
PATIENCE
Reeled it in like tuna from the
Atlantic.
TALIA

You and I are going to spend some
time together!
He is entering some of his choice, rare LP's up for auction
on eBay.
DOORBELL RINGS
It's Talia.
TALIA
I gotta see Chez Lance.
LARRY CROWNE
Entrez vous, sea food plate.
Talia enters and looks around. The decor screams out: "A man
lives here."
TALIA
No sign of a woman around here for
years. Drape a scarf over that
lamp and you'll soften the light.
No TV, b t vinyl disks of music?
You trying to seduce me?
She examines the record collection.
TALIA (CONT'D)
Alphabetical order. No artistic
chaos for you.
She closes her eyes and picks out an LP at random.
TALIA (CONT'D)
Spin this platter, Mr. DJ?
LARRY CROWNE
Good choice.
As he puts it on, Talia drifts into the...
KITCHEN
Nothing matches, but it is well-equipped with a cozy
breakfast nook.
TALIA
Breakfast nookie!
(THEN)
45.
TALIA (CONT'D)
Did Denise make you breakfast in
here with a little apron and
lipstick perfectly applied?
LARRY CROWNE
I did most of the cooking,
actually.
(THEN)
You know about Denise?
TALIA
Patience thought she was stuck up
and seriously fleeced you.
Larry can't believe his neighbors are so loose-tongued.
TALIA (CONT'D)
So what happened there, my Lance?
LARRY CROWNE
The usual stuff between three
people.
TALIA
She must have been pretty.
(THEN)
Fair haired or dark?
LARRY CROWNE
Dark.
TALIA
Like me.
(THEN)
So? How about a demonstration?
he means 'of the kitchen'. Larry's game...
LARRY CROWNE
Stay outta my way.
VEGETABLES ARE CHOPPED
BURNERS TURNED ON
MISMATCHED UTENSILS COME OUT OF DRAWERS
A CHICKEN BREAST IS POUNDED
OLIVE OIL GOES INTO A PAN
BEER OPENED
46.
Pizza bread. Chopped veggie salad. Lightly fried potatoes. A
pounded chicken breast. Beer in a bottle.
Talia eats as Larry gets corn bread he steamed fresh and
moist onto a plate.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
Cooking for friends is sort of fun.
Three hundred times a day is not.
DELL GORDO (O.C.)
That corn bread I smell?
TALIA
Kitchen, Monkey!
Dell Gordo has walked into Larry's house.
DELL GORDO
Corn pone!
Dell Gordo dives in after helping himself to a bottle of beer
from the refrigerator.
TALIA
Lance made all this. You should
have seen him. He was like...
Talia does a mime of Larry cooking - like a spastic drummer.
DELL GORDO
You're like Uncle Ben or something.
Stan's working on your bike.
LARRY CROWNE
He is?
Larry goes to the window.
DELL GORDO
Said the thing was a time bomb.
He's saving your life.
P.O.V.
Stan has broken down much of Larry's bike using Lamarr's
tools. Lamarr is standing over him, pointing out what he
thinks needs to be done. Stan is ignoring him.
DELL GORDO (CONT'D)
Let's go lift iron, Monkey. It's a
shoulders and arms day
(MORE)
47.
DELL GORDO (CONT'D)
Lance, raise your right hand and
say something patriotic.
Larry does, just for fun.
LARRY CROWNE
'We'll be right back after these
messages.'
DELL GORDO
You're in the Street Patrol. A
full-time mission for beauty and
justice.
Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips --
no romance at all, but still...
TALIA
That Denise. What a fool. You a e
way cooler than you appear.
She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers.
DELL GORDO
Lance. All men fall in love with
Talia. You will too, if you
haven't already. But I love her
the most. Know that right now.
LARRY CROWNE
Capice.
DELL GORDO
Seriously. Don't make me keep my
eyes on you. What's your real
name?
LARRY CROWNE
L rry.
DELL GORDO
Mine's Don. Shake hands.
(EXPLAINING HOW)
Look each other in the eyes. Firm
grips. No contest, but firm. Hold.
Stack it.
(THEN)
One word, Lance. Peace.
LARRY CROWNE
Peace indeed.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH is a former student of Mercedes with
braces on her teeth. Her name is printed in perfect block
letters behind her on the board. She is giving a polished,
well-prepared "off the cuff" presentation: DYNAMIC SEMINARS
PRESENTS: SHAKESPEAREAN ECONOMICS.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Act I: Inventory. What do you
sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach
your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of
accounting. Receivable.
Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward
planning. Plan to grow. Act Five?
Final Profitability. What do you
clear on bottom-line?
(THEN)
In other words: "To be or not to
be... in Business."
It's all nonsense, but it looks nice in PowerPoint form.
Larry is taking notes.
Calimeris has drawn her Pyramid of ideas.
Mack sleeps with his head straight up.
49.
Pinedo is listening intently, counting the ideas out on her
hands.
Dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)
For business, social, and self-
improvement workshops, email me:
Francestaylor-briegh@dynasem.com.
Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her
classroom. She is preoccupied.
The applause for the speaker jolts her.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Did you notice? No script. No
notes. So it can be done.
The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some
DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
White, Siler and Koss, you are up
next time.
(THEN)
You did good, Fran. Thanks.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Anything for the woman who brought
out the public speaker in Frances
Taylor-Briegh.
(THEN)
I used you as a Focal Reference but
you weren't there for me. What's
wrong, Mercy?
Mercedes signals Frances: "Not yet", then points to Larry,
still finishing up his notes.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING)
I broke up with the Orthodontist.
Now I have to get a new boyfriend
and a new orthodontist. You ever
do that? Get crushes on people you
see every day after ignoring them
and then find out they're creeps
after all?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Mr Crowne? Can you move along
50.
LARRY CROWNE
That was a great presentation. I
learned a lot from it.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Super.
LARRY CROWNE
Smart stuff. Super smart.
The women watch him go. As soon as he's out the door:
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going
on?
MERCEDES TAINOT
When was the last time you looked
at your life and saw nothing but
fraud and desperation?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Mercy. You're an idol to me.
Hearing you talk like that is
crushing my dreams.
Mercy wants to take it back.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Well I'm joking of course!!!
She pretends to laugh. A little too much.
Dr. Matsutani is diagramming on the board.
DR. MATSUTANI
If the balance on Axis A is the
same metric as Axis B you're in
deficits because of overhead,
taxes, and re-investment.
(THEN)
Translation? Ms. Francesco?
TALIA
Something complicated.
DR. MATSUTANI
Ms. Pinedo?
51.
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
Mr. Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE
Breaking even is not making profit,
it's a theoretical assumption.
Economics abhors an assumption.
Talia is amused while sizing him up, from shoe to collar.
Bad shirt... pleated pants, too short... running shoes.
DR. MATSUTANI
Someone's been reading my book.
(THEN)
The Break Even Paradox creates a
new metric...
Talia makes a decision and palms her phone, punching in a
text. In a second, Larry's phone vibrates. He struggles to
get it before he gets caught with his mobile on.
TALIA: "Scoot? You/me?"
Larry nods at Talia.
Turning back, Dr. Matsutani is there again.
Larry hands him his mobile phone again.
Palm out again. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
I am growing tired of this game,
Mr. Crowne. Aren't you?
Pitch black as the grate rolls up and open, revealing Talia,
Larry and their parked scooters.
LARRY CROWNE
Holy smokes!
The place is crammed with vintage clothes. Racks and boxes
and stacks of every fashion.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT D)
You got inventory.
She disappears in the back, rummaging around.
TALIA
I started in the smallest unit.
LARRY CROWNE
This is just sitting here? Talia!
This is unproductive capital! Sell
it on eBay.
TALIA
No one should ever buy clothes off
the internet. You have to feel the
fabric and test the drape...
LARRY CROWNE
What is all this worth?
Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes.
TALIA
A lot to me. Try these on.
LARRY CROWNE
Where?
TALIA
Anywhere. Fashion is no place for
modesty. Strip.
He does.
LARRY CROWNE
53.
TALIA
This is a service to humankind,
Lance. It hurts me to see a Top
Cat dressed like an ex-hockey
player. You gotta look gorgeous
from shoe to collar. Starting now.
Larry is taking off his pants just as Dell Gordo has pulled
up on his scooter.
DELL GORDO
Monkey! Thought you might be here.
TALIA
Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put
your pants on!
Larry, in fact, has his pants off.
Dell Gordo has a look in his eyes of, well, "What the fuck?"
She is driving home.
GPS VOICE

INT TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - LATER
Dean is opening take-out containers to put the food on
plates. The table is set a little too ornately. Wine.
HE'S
Candles. Flowers.
In other words, he's making up.
Mercedes comes in through the door. Sees what's up.
being good and cute. He pours Margaritas.
DEAN TAINOT
No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm
a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful
and brilliant. And I will be a
good boy from now on. Why?
Because you're right and I've
learned my lesson. Just don't be
mad at me forever. I have a
pliable soul and I pray you do too
54.
He dangles her a fresh Margarita. She'll take it...
BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mercedes and Dean have had make up sex. It was okay.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
Ah. That was nice.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It was. Yes.
DEAN TAINOT
Been thinking. If you ever want to
take a whack at writing something --
say a blog a couple of times a week --
I could help you out.
MERCEDES TAINOT
How?
DEAN TAINOT
I'd read your stuff. Make comments
to make it web-savvy. Pieces need
to pop, you know. Takes a little
PRACTICE
MERCEDES TAINOT
Okay.
DEAN TAINOT
See? You can't stay mad at me. No
reason to be mad at me...
He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
I'm just a guy who's a guy being a
guy...
Mercedes' eyes: She didn't like hearing that...
Larry -- in new, vintage clothes with his morning coffee --
is at his computer entering his financial record into a
program - Ed Matsutani's SmartPlanning MoneyWorks.
He is also on his Mobile Phone -- pressing his party's
extension...
55.
DENISE
This is Denise. How can I help
you.
LARRY CROWNE
Denise. Larry.
DENISE
My god. Larry Crowne. I remember
you.
LARRY CROWNE
This a good time?
DENISE
Other than me being at work?
LARRY CROWNE
I'll call you later.
DENISE
I'm surprised is all. What do you
want?
With checkbooks, statements, etc. Larry is looking for the
bottom line.
Out it comes: In RED!
($887.00)
LARRY CROWNE
Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal.
DENISE
Spit it, Lar.
LARRY CROWNE
I'm going to miss a few months on
the checks for the house.
DENISE
Okay.
LARRY CROWNE
I hoped not to, but I there it is.
DENISE
Okay. Yeah.
LARRY CROWNE
I'm sorry.
56.
DENISE
How many months?
LARRY CROWNE
Let's start with six.
Silence on the other end.
DENISE
That can't happen, Larry.
I'm extended. I've put a deposit
down on the first vacation I've had
in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as
valid as yours, so I need the
checks like always. A deal's a
deal.
He goes back to the computer, to eBay to see how his LP
auction is going.
One record is going for... $0.75. Another: $1.25. Another:
NO BIDS.
LARRY CROWNE
I don't have it.
DENISE
That's not my problem. Take out a
loan on the house or something.
LARRY CROWNE
I tried. I'm too much of a risk.
DENISE
Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't
want to open up the whole lawyer
thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks,
doesn't it? I appreciate the
rigorous Crowne honesty, but this
can't happen.
(THEN)
These calls are monitored to
guarantee customer satisfaction, so
I'm hanging up before my supervisor
comes on...
Raul is sitting at the counter doing his paperwork. Perry
comes up to him.
PERRY
Can I smell trouble or what?
RAUL
Can you speak English?
PERRY
Those two over in booth 6...
P.O.V.: Two GUYS IN SUITS.
PERRY (CONT'D)
Homeland Security. I piped thei
badges and everything.
RAUL
What is Homeland Security doing
here...
Raul looks back in the kitchen. Carlos and Nick are prepping
their stations.
Raul bolts for the kitchen. In seconds we can see him through
the Service Window.
He whispers and gestures to Carlos and Nick, who suddenly
show PANIC in their eyes.
They now bolt the kitchen, out the back way.
BOOTH 6
R
Perry is po ring coffee for the Agents, making small talk
as...
Out side the window, Carlos and Nick are fleeing for their
Illegal Alien lives...
Larry is still trying to makes sense of his money woes when
his phone rings...
Caller ID: "Perry's Coffee Shop Breakfast All Day!"
LARRY CROWNE
HEY
58.
INTERCUT/PERRY'S
Perry is serving hotcakes to the Agents while Raul is on the
phone.
RAUL
This is Larry Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE
Raul? Yes.
RAUL
Get your ass down here. You got a
job.
LARRY CROWNE
I do?
The place has filled with customers. Perry is jammed and
behind the window, Raul is slapping orders up in a frenzy.
PERRY
We're swamped, Kimosabe. Get back
there!
RAUL
You're late on your first day!
Larry comes through the swinging doors. He stops and takes a
breath. His life has come to this. He is back in a kitchen.
What can he do, but dive in...
LATER
Larry is at the window, putting up orders and ripping slips
off the wheel.
Not so much as cracking a smile, though...
RAUL
Where you learn to turn eggs like
59.
LARRY CROWNE
The USS Coral Sea.
(THEN)
Boss, I don't want to quit school.
RAUL
So don't.
LARRY CROWNE
I gotta get to class before I miss
the whole day. And I can't work
mornings Mondays, Wednesdays,
Fridays.
RAUL
Soon as the rush is finished, go.
I'll get my idiot brother-in-law
three days a week. You take
evenings. Deal?
LARRY CROWNE
Deal. When will we talk salary?
RAUL
Never. This is take it or leave
it. Don t worry. I may be tough
but I'll be fair.
Mack is at the podium giving a presentation with his Star
Wars Action figures.
MACK
These are not toys. Nobody 'plays'
with these. These are kept behind
glass, so no way am I passing them
around today.
Mercedes TALKS to us and HERSELF.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Wait a ding dong minute.
(counts the heads)
1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is
missing! Who cut my class?
She lets slip OUT LOUD:
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Where's Larry Crowne?!
Everyone looks at her.
60.
MACK
Guess Larry's out today.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Anyone know why?
MACK
He didn't call me.
Ad-libs: no one knows why Larry is out.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I don't believe this! Ditching me?
He ditched me? Not okay. Larry
Crowne, you are on my Shit List.
Everyone shares looks like they've witnessed a Lover's Spat.
Speaking quietly in their seats...
DIBIASI
Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a
Teach-ee.
CALIMERIS
When you were out last week, she
said nothing. I think she has a
crush on Larry Crowne.
PINEDO
I do too.
(off their looks)
He's a nice man.
Mack speaks up.
MACK
Should I continue?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Yes. Tell us more about your man
dolls.
Mack is humiliated now.
MACK
I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba
Fett...
Dr. Matsutani is in mid-lecture when Larry comes in, late.
LARRY CROWNE
(QUIETLY)
I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani.
May I still sit in the class?
DR. MATSUTANI
This is college, Mr. Crowne. The
only thing you can't do is smoke in
the building. Hand over your
phone.
(LARRY DOES)
I'm going to ask a question in a
moment. I want someone other than
you to answer it - I don't care if
the silence is positively Arctic.
Larry moves to take a seat.
Talia can't believe his choice of dress. She mimes to him
"What's with the outfit?" His mime answer is unintelligible.
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
This brings us to a dreaded task to
every corporate entity. What is
the purpose of semi-annual re-
purposing? Anyone?
(THEN)
Anyone?
He waits. And waits. And waits. Matsutani stares fear into
the hearts of all but Larry.
LARRY CROWNE
(WHISPERING)
Lala... To upload market
differences without...
PINEDO
Without mooting the quarterlies. I
know.
LARRY CROWNE
Then say it.
(SHE WON'T)
Just give the answer. You know it.
Say it.
PINEDO
Can I?
62.
LARRY CROWNE I
insist.
Lala Pinedo clears her voice. But still whispers...
PINEDO
To up... met... es without ...ing
...terly predicts....?
No one understood that...
DR. MATSUTANI
I know what you mean, but please
share it with your classmates?
PINEDO
(LOUD ENOUGH)
To upload market differences
without mooting quarterly
predictions.
DR. MATSUTANI
Does this affect the Value Index?
PINEDO
No. Only the profit markdown.
DR. MATSUTANI
Someone is doing the reading!
Lala Pinedo beams! Larry applauds. Talia whoops!
Noisy kids squirm and cry and play games as they get haircuts
from other stylists.
Larry is in a chair meant for toddlers. The Scooter Squad
Hair Stylist is cutting his hair. Talia is taking Larry's
shitty Velcro wallet and putting his stuff into a cool used
leather one with a chain.
TALIA
She must not be having any amok
lovin'.
SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST
That makes me cranky, too.
TALIA
Without a workout in the Inner
Sanctum a few times a week I can't
concentrate.
LARRY CROWNE
Inappropriate subject in mixed
company.
SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST
For girl-talk this is nothing.
LARRY CROWNE
64.
TALIA
You you want to fix it with your
teacher? Bang her.
Talia slides a photo of herself making a face into Larry's
wallet, then adds a condom in its foil.
LARRY CROWNE
She's marred.
TALIA
You'd kill two birds in one bush.
Nothing wrong with a campus
romance. Otherwise life is what?
Breakfast work, coffee, school,
lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk,
Mexican food, a movie, glass of
wine or two then bed? That's not
living.
SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST
Not without some smooching time.
TALIA
Bet she'd give you an A plus.
(THEN)
If you're any good...
She and the Stylist crack up!
Larry has filled out a bunch of papers and is sitting down
with Laurie Gammelgaard, who offers him coffee.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
More complimentary coffee?
LARRY CROWNE
Complimentary coffee is usually
lousy.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
I drink it all day.
(THEN)
So? You're back!
65.
LARRY CROWNE
I got a job.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
Atta Baby!
LARRY CROWNE
Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all
day. And I'm going to school.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
At East City. I see.
(from the papers)
Larry, this doesn't change
anything.
LARRY CROWNE
I was afraid of that.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
The interest alone will eat up your
service industry salary.
LARRY CROWNE
You said come back in a few weeks.
It's been a few weeks.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
Okay.
(THEN)
I will personally take this to my
supervisor and fight to get you the
loan you need. But you know how
complimentary coffee is always
lousy? Your chances are, too.
LARRY CROWNE
I can't make the payments on the
house. I'm going to lose it,
aren't I?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
Stop with the gloomy puss. You're
doing everything right. Hang in
there. You still have a friend at
RiverBank.
LARRY CROWNE
You guys are forced to say that,
aren't you?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
66.
THUNDER ROLLS IN THE DISTANCE
The windows are fogging up. Frances and Mercedes sip take-
out coffee and eat glazed rings of death.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
I never read them.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Who did? I'm married to an ex-
teacher turned blogger with two
books in print. And oh, yes, he has
the libido and internet access of a
13-year-old.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
I had a boyfriend who owned every
movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d
hear a DVD go into the playe an
knew what I was going to be doing in
a half-hour.
Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia
with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Once more to Divorce Court to
cashier a spouse, line my cloak
with alimony and do myself homage.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to
Roderigo.
Talia jumps out and runs into the donut shop.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Why can't all my students be like
y u?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Because, as I learned in your
class, I am one of a kind.
Larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her.
He never sees Mercedes or Frances.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)
Hey, that guy's in your class.
Mercedes wipes fog off the window.
MERCEDES TAINOT
68.
P.O.V.
Talia is talking to the Donut Shop Lady, selecting crullers
and old-fashioneds.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a
leash!
Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
That's why he's in college! To get
laid!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
It happens.
Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of
donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a
ring of sweet into his mouth.
Mercedes rolls down her window and yells.
MERCEDES TAINOT
You are everything that's wrong
with America, Larry Crowne!
They did not hear her.
INT SPEE H 217 - MORNING
Larry is at the podium, prepping his "Personal First"
presentation as the class comes in. He is dressed as Talia
styled him.
DIBIASI
Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know
you were gay. You've gone all
Project Runway on us.
Mercedes enters, eyeing Larry with residual venom. He is
oblivious. She takes her listening post in the back of the
room as the class goes quiet.
LARRY CROWNE
Should I begin?
Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)

MERCEDES TAINOT
(talking to herself in the MOVIE
DEVICE WAY)
Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk.
(THEN)
Look at the new pants. They
actually fit. And that jacket is
'smart'. Did Busik put Larry
Crowne into Fashion for Creeps? An
old goat dressed like lamb.
(THEN)
Of course! It's that doe-eyed
young thing he's been wearing on
his sleeve. Dressing like he's
half his age. Give me a shotgun!
I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now!
(THEN)
Am I being unfair? I mean, if I
were single and some young buck
took to me, wouldn't I be inclined
to diddly-dally?
She looks at Dibiasi, who has snuck iPod earbuds onto his
head, is mouthing the words and playing air guitar.
The class erupts in l ughter. Mercedes wasn't paying
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Youth wouldn't be the only
requirement, of course.

DIBIASI
(jerking out buds)
What? What he say?
LARRY CROWNE
Unless you're looking at a chart,
you don't even know the Equator
when you cross it...
MERCEDES TAINOT
A repackaged Larry Crowne won't
fool me. Shame on you. Going
after jail bait, you criminal.
Insert Viagra joke here...
(THEN)
herself at you... No. Don't let
up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY!
Polite applause. Mercedes pretends she heard every word.
70.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Anyone recall anything from that?
PINEDO
That Larry believed there were
signs on posts marking the Equator.
CALIMERIS
And that, when it's a first time,
they make the rookies dress in drag
and sing Abba songs?
Mercedes missed a lot of that. Everything, in f ct.
MACK
Larry worked on an Aircraft
Carrier! Night Carrier Landings
are the trickiest flying in world.
Mercedes is learning this for the first time as well.
MERCEDES TAINOT
That was a memorable nugget.
PINEDO
Larry was stationed in Panama! My
father is from Panama!
MERCEDES TAINOT
Mr. Koss to the lectern, please.
More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech.
Mercedes heard none of them...
Larry bangs out orders.
Raul sits at the butchers block, sipping coffee, observing
his new kitchen staffer.
Larry is slapping orders together at the same time he h s his
studies out -- trying to do two jobs at the same tim
His mobile phone vibrates.
TALIA: "Scoot?"
He punches in
"Can't. Job."
He goes back to his studies just as another order comes up.
Then his phone vibrates again.
TALIA: "Job? Sob! Coming!"
LARRY CROWNE
Oh crap.
In they pour, sizing up the place for a hangout. Talia, Stan -
- minus Dell Gordo -- and others sit at the counter where
they can see Larry.
TALIA
Chef Corona! Steam us some corn
bread?
The others pretend to be grumpy diners: Feed us! What's a
Reuben Sandwich? Where's my Sanka!
LATER
Up comes order after order. Burgers. Hot beef sandwiches.
Turkey clubs. Greek Salads.
72.
TALIA (CONT'D)
Woman on deck!
Raul looks up from his Spanish Language Newspaper.
RAUL
You can't come in here.
TALIA
I'm a friend of Lance's.
RAUL
No Lance works for me.
Talia hops up to sit on a butcher block.
RAUL (CONT'D)
This is my kitchen and I am the
boss.
TALIA
Is he, Lance?
LARRY CROWNE
Raul's my boss, yeah.
TALIA
Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are
ya' cool, Raul?
RAUL
Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair,
too.
TALIA
As boss, do you make up the menu?
L
RAUL
A
N . But I do the purchasing.
R
TALIA
Is that a tough but fair job?
R
RAUL
Y
It makes me crazy, you kidding? But
it's gotta be done every day or
guess what? No food. I'll show you
how much I gotta do...
P
U
And just like that, Talia has seduced another man.
telling her the secrets of purchasing orders
s fries into the deep fryer.
RAUL IS
73.
LATER
Talia is with Perry at the register. She's seduced him now,
as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever.
PERRY
Breakfast all day, see. From Corn
Flakes to popovers. We make the
best Chicken Fried Steak outside of a
truck stop.
TALIA
Can Lance take a break?
PERRY
Who?
TALIA
The artist formerly known as Larry. I
need his expertise.
PERRY
(CALLING)
Lance.
Perry signals to Larry then to Talia and makes a talking
gesture.
BOOTH - LATER
Larry and Talia sit. She has her notebook out -- sketches
and ideas and forms...
LARRY CROWNE
Square footage at this price is a
bargain.
TALIA
Maurice says I'm saving his life by
renting the space.
LARRY CROWNE
(WRITING)
This is your Matsutani Delta
Number. You net this every month,
you cover overhead, and the rest is
profit.
TALIA
You sure?
LARRY CROWNE
Chapter four.
74.
TALIA
You make it sound so simple!!
Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead
with kisses.
Appearing out of nowhere: Dell Gordo.
LARRY CROWNE
(BOLTING)
Well, back to work!

MERCEDES TAINOT
You lie to me, Dean. Every day.
You. Lie. To. Me.
DEAN TAINOT
You looking for a whole new man,
Mercy? I'm the jerk who has to
transform into Ultraman to make you
happy? No. I like myself, Mercy. I
put up with you and complain about
nothing.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm not complaining. I'm stating
the truth. I teach while you
pretend to work.
DEAN TAINOT
I had three postings today alone.
FogCaster, SkyScan, and
ParsecTwelve.com
MERCEDES TAINOT
Those weren't postings. They were
comments.
DEAN TAINOT
Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to
judge me?
(THEN)
I know what's really pissing you
off. I like big titties. And you
don't have any.
Yeow. A line has been crossed. A big, ugly line has just
been crossed. Even Dean knows it.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
Maybe I should take that back.
MERCEDES TAINOT
LET ME OUT OF THIS FUCKING CAR!!!
A young couple -- call them JANET and TONY - have been on
their first date. It's gone well.
76.
JANET
As soon as I saw you, I said, "I
want to go out with that man."
TONY
What did you say when I asked you
out?
JANET
I said "Yes." You were there,
remember?
TONY
I saw you and I thought "I would be
a lucky guy if she'd go out with
me."
JANET
Yes you are.
TONY
Honestly, this is about as good a
first date goes, isn't it?
JANET
Disaster looms on most first dates,
but I'm talking to you like you're a
friend I want to make out with.
TONY
Hold that thought.
Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.
Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops.
DEAN TAINOT
I take it back. I take it back.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Drive, asshole! Drive away!
DEAN TAINOT
I've been drinking, too.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Drive straight til you hit a cliff
on the coastline!
DEAN TAINOT
You win! I'm letting you win!
Everything you say is right and
WIN!
77.
MERCEDES TAINOT
LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With
a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!
DEAN TAINOT
Screw you, you washboard!
MERCEDES TAINOT
Oh, chillax!!!
GPS VOICE
Please enter your destination.
Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock
and hurls it at him.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm throwing rocks at my own car !!
Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
The jerk who just deserted me? My
husband of 4 friggin' years!
She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know
what to do with each other now.
Here they come at the speed of a lazy cow. Mercedes is
singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal".
Mercedes leans against the door. What did she just do????
LARRY CROWNE (O.S.)
Goodnight, whoever you are!
MERCEDES TAINOT
Whoever I am...
Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed
a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is
looking at Larry.
Larry is listening to Lala with delight.
PINEDO
Seeing them -- the Northern Lights,
the Aurora Borealis -- should have
been beyond me, but I was a little
girl in Coach class still awake, a
window seat, a moonless night
somewhere over Greenland with a
shimmering curtain of emerald,
gossamer light dancing just for me.
(THEN)
That is something I will remember
forever.
The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala,
who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who
rises in applause for the once quiet classmate.
Then the applause is over.
The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI
That was a knockout speech, Lala.
Made the news. Caused riots
downtown. School's out til 2019.
The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and
head ou .
MERCEDES TAINOT
Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
CALIMERIS
Why doesn't she just throw herself
at him?
PINEDO
This is bordering on harassment
now.
DIBIASI
Quiet down. I'm watching the TV
show...
MACK
Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
89.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I need a few moments alone with Mr.
Crowne thank you.
DIBIASI
Move along folks. Privacy's a
right in this great nation of ours.
MACK
You want I should close this door,
lock it, and barricade it so you
won't be disturbed??
We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.
LARRY CROWNE
How are the Triplets? Groggy,
Puffy, and Grumpy.
He means the hangover.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Last night was a confluence of too
many things happening in too short
a time span.
LARRY CROWNE
Last i ht? Let's see, what was I
doing? Studying some. Working
some. Can't recall. I've forgotten
everything that happened last night
as best a gentleman can.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I had no right to judge you or your
relationships. Date who you want.
Larry has no idea what that means.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
But what happened last night --
between adults -- was
inappropriate. If gossip were to
circulate, the problem could be
more than just embarrassing. My
status as a professor could be
tarnished.
LARRY CROWNE
I wouldn't want that.
MERCEDES TAINOT
happened before.
(MORE)
90.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
With parking attendants. Strangers
at parties when I've had a bit too
much of the demon rum. This was the
first time with a student.
(THEN)
I hope the entire thing will be
forgotten.
Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher.
LARRY CROWNE
Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
MERCEDES TAINOT
So there will be no bravado among
you and your pals?
LARRY CROWNE
None.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE
I'd better scurry along to Dr.
Matsutani's class. I hope I don't
have this same conversation with
him.
Larry leaves - a good mood ruined...
Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark
glasses?
Larry stands where he was once king.
P.O.V.
The place looks different. Shabby. Unkempt. Understaffed.
He recognizes no one.
AISLE
No one is there to help Larry pick out two 'For Sale by
Owner' signs. And, he can't help it: he straightens out
some messed up racks and shelves.
REGISTER
Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former
Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history.
Larry slides the signs for purchase. Manning the thing?
Vicky Hurley. Not looking good
HURLEY
' ind bargains today?'
LARRY CROWNE
Vick? How you doing? Larry
Crowne.
Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her
Cashier's Apron.
HURLEY
Larry. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE
Why are you on the Register?
93.
HURLEY
Management Execs are now required
to put in 8-hour shifts on the
floor. Every day. No overtime.
No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or
UniMart Bargain Card? Like you
have one of them.
LARRY CROWNE
Cash. No receipt.
Hurley is robotic.
HURLEY
You got out of here just in time...
'Thank you for choosing UniMart,
where united we blah blah.'
She is in the front of the class with a small box. Hungover?
A bit, yes...
MERCEDES TAINOT
Here I have surprise topics.
Friday, in a Lightning Round, you
must wax on that topic for 2
minutes without pause, repetition,
or lack of charm. No notes. One
visual aid.
(THEN)
Ms Pinedo Draw
96.
Ms. Pinedo pulls a paper from the box.
MS. PINEDO
'Potatoes?'
MERCEDES TAINOT
Spuds. Can't wait.
Dibiasi draws a paper.
DIBIASI
'Disraeli'? What is that?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Who is that?
DIBIASI
It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done.
Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit
uncomfortable in class since the recent events.
LARRY CROWNE
'Consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT
That's supposed to say 'Communism.'
LARRY CROWNE
The handwriting is loopy. Looks
like 'Consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism.
Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.
CALIMERIS
'Malpity Hoople.'
(THEN)
What's this say?
MERCEDES TAINOT
No idea. Just pick another.
Dr. Matsutani is going on. Larry is looking for Talia, who
is not in class.
97.
DR. MATSUTANI
(HIS BOOK))
At the end of each chapter is a
study guide. Master those and you
will have mastered my book. Master
my book and you will take over the
world.
He laughs demonically.
DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
By now you should be laughing with
me.
Larry can't believe Talia is not there...
They sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Yep.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
You'd think leggy blondes like us
would be impervious, right?
At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the
kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee.
Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.
PERRY
Ladies. Bring an appetite?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
The mark of a restaurant is their
Key Lime pie.
Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.
PERRY
100.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
No Key Lime?
PERRY
Cream pies I got.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Boston Cream?
PERRY
Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady,
you're killing me here.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.
PERRY
Ma'am?
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'll have the French Toast.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
French Toast?
MERCEDES TAINOT
(on the menu)
Breakfast all day.
Perry leaves to put in the order.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
You won't believe how far I fell on
the Hooch-o-meter.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
I have seen it happen a time or
two.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I kissed a boy.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
When, third grade?
MERCEDES TAINOT
One of my students.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
You Hoor.
(THEN)
Gimme the friggin' details! He's
not a minor is he?
101.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Older than me.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Hugh Hefner in your class? What
went down?
MERCEDES TAINOT
He sort of... rescued me. And...
he smelled nice.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
He a fireman who bakes bread?
MERCEDES TAINOT
I wanted to be kissed so asked if he
wanted to and he did.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Bold. Who is he?
KITCHEN
Perry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite
out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook.
PERRY
You're slipping, Larry.
(THE TOAST)
Lady says it's not French Toast as
she knows it.
LARRY CROWNE
She's insane.
PERRY
Take it up with her.
Larry heads out of the kitchen.
PERRY (CONT'D)
No shouting, okay? This is a
family friendly establishment.
BOOTH
Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes.
LARRY CROWNE
Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a
problem with your order?
MERCEDES TAINOT
102.
Knock Larry over with a feather.
LARRY CROWNE
Mrs. Tainot.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
(TO MERCEDES)
The student of yours!?
MERCEDES TAINOT
This is Larry Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE
There's no way in creation I screw
up French Toast.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It was fine, actually.
(THEN)
I wanted to see if it was really
you cooking back there. And say,
howdy. Howdy doody.
During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of
Larry -- to find out how he smells.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Ready for the final?
LARRY CROWNE
You'll be the judge of that.
The is a beat of silence.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
So, your meal is satisfactory?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Absolutely.
LARRY CROWNE
Would you let my boss know so I
don't lose this job?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Yes indeed.
LARRY CROWNE
Shall I prepare you another batch?
MERCEDES TAINOT
No. Thanks.
103.
LARRY CROWNE
Then I will return to my station..
Mercedes watches him go.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
You kissed the cook...
(THEN)
I got a whiff. He smelled like
bell pepper.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Look at the men in my life.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
Blame it on the booze... and
collect yourself.
(THEN)
You hoor...
MERCEDES TAINOT
That's my problem. I'm a drunken
hoor.
KITCHEN FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
That ends... right now.
(THEN)
Check please?
Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his
face. He tosses the French Toast down the disposal.
Mercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums,
cleaners, and fortitude.
BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's
tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled,
just chucked.
KITCHEN
The cupboard is open. Where there was once booze go coffees
and teas.
MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's
life...
104.
On the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI.
Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes...
MERCEDES TAINOT
What a difference from day one. I
must be a better teacher than I
thought.
(THEN)
Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris
stopped up-talking. Lala you can't
shut up. Mack spoke about
Australia for three minutes and
mentioned kangaroos only twice. And
Larry Crowne...
Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his
UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to
the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..
105.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
I was tough on him. But he learned
fast. How he connected the Circle
of Sales to the expanding universe
is impressive as hell. I'll never
forget about the Value Index now.
He gave a perfect speech.
(THEN)
And... He's polite. Instead of
fighting me off that night, what
does he do but kisses me one and
then all but tucks me in. What kind
of guy does that to a loopy tramp
like me? He could have ravaged me.
I misread this guy and if I had a
brain I'd find a way to steal him
away from that cutie pie and keep
him for myself. I wonder if he'd
like that, if he would... What did
I just say?
(THEN)
What did I just say about Larry
Crowne?
The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that
last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each
other. The men stifle laughs.
DIBIASI
Nothing. And I was just wrapping
up here.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm so sorry. Please go on.
DIBIASI
Larry? It okay if I get to my
climax and denouement?
Larry nods.
DIBIASI (CONT'D)
Thank you... If it was the romance
novelist in him that made Victoria
the Queen become such a pal, chalk
it up as another brick in the
legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of
Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime
Minister of Great Britain. Not bad
for a Jewish guy, huh?
Dibiasi is done. Applause.
106.
PINEDO
Not so much as a bump, Nomad!
Why'd you go last?
DIBIASI
Fourth quarter dramatics.
(THEN)
Not that it mattered to my Speech
professor...
MERCEDES TAINOT
Congratulations all of you.
MACK
Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we
vote?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Not me, I have to stay objective.
MACK
I say... Lala!
They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her
name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her.
Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to
pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.
It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of.
As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne
leading a parade around the room.
Everyone is taking the final.
Dr. Matsutani. Looking around the class. Using his hands
like a pair of binoculars.
Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers.
Larry is finished. He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his
Blue Book.
DR. MATSUTANI
The first to finish. No surprise.
Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry
leaves.
107.
The final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this
part himself.
He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying
his kitchen, what was once his.
Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.
MACK
This is the last of them. Damn,
you have a lot of records.
LARRY CROWNE
Priceless at a buck apiece.
Raul and Perry are talking when they see Mercedes Tainot
enter.
RAUL
My next wife just walked in.
Perry looks.
PERRY
I love this business sometimes.
(GREETING MERCEDES)
Something told me you'd be back.
Is Larry Crowne working today?
KITCHEN
Larry is arranging his station.
109.
PERRY
Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a
question about the menu.
Larry can see her. She looks gorgeous.
RAUL
Go ahead. I'll take the window
even though I'm the boss of the
whole kitchen.
BOOTH - LARRY'S HQ - LATER
Mercedes is having coffee.
MERCEDES TAINOT
There's Larry Crowne. Are you
allowed to sit?
(HE DOES)
Where does Perry get his coffee?
LARRY CROWNE
I add chicory and a bit of vanilla.
Trick I picked up in the Navy.
MERCEDES TAINOT
You're probably wondering why I
stopped by. Well, it's to tell you
your grade for Speech 217. You
killed on the final and have an A.
Way to go!
She offers him a Terrorist Fist Bump. With the hand that no
longer has a wedding ring on it...
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Actually, everybody got an A, but
you got the special A where I tell
you in person.
LARRY CROWNE
Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs.
Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Class is out. Call me Mercedes.
Or Mercy, for short.
(THEN)
So. Just wanted to congratulate
you. Your girlfriend will be
thrilled.
LARRY CROWNE
110.
MERCEDES TAINOT
No. I meant the... never mind.
(THEN)
Which classes are you going to ace
next term?
LARRY CROWNE
This has turned into a full time
gig. Out of necessity.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I hope you continue your education.
Back at East City. You've made
such a good start.
LARRY CROWNE
I'll have to see.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM,
thank God. Who knows what I'll
hear with the extra sleep.
LARRY CROWNE
My first class in college ever.
And I get an A. Gotta be the
teacher.
They look at each other.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Should get going.
(THEN)
You don't know anything about car
devices, do you?
LARRY CROWNE
Cars not much. Devices some.
They rise.
Perry greets him at the door.
112.
PERRY
Kimosabe, holding off til after
school to woo the teacher is the
move of a class act.
Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away.
Mercedes has just written "Care" next to "Welcome to
Shakespeare!!" up on the board. She turns. And does a quick
head count.
Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one,
again.
Clumps up the wooden steps are heard...
Calimeris, Mack, Pinedo, and Dibiasi come tramping in. Twelve
students now.
DIBIASI
(on his phone)
I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in
hot water with Professor Tai-bo...
Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Is Larry with you?
CALIMERIS
Um, no. Should we track him down
and drag him in here?
Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I... Seeing you all... I just
thought...
(THEN)
Choose a seat and lets get started!
The four smile at each other...
113.
PINEDO
Carrying a torch for Larry til it
burns her hands...
No larger than the nook of his old house. Breakfast is being
served.
The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made
French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook.
Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post-
Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving. His arm shows a Navy tattoo that
may be old or new...
Mercy Tainot glows in and out. She slides next to him, close
to him The meal is perfect
117.
