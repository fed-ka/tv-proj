      A modest, over-grown duplex situated on the wrong side of the 
      tracks in the upscale township of Lafayette Hill, PA; a town 
      of tree-lined streets, affluent homes and scenic lanes.  

      Jane bounces out the front door to find... 

      BILLY NUTTER (16) waiting on the front step.  He s the male 
      version of Jane.  Cute, but lacks the confidence to own it. 

                                  BILLY
                    Garret s got a job interview, huh? 

                                  JANE
                    Let s hope this one goes better 
                    than the last few.  

      Billy pops up, following Jane to the driveway.  

                                  BILLY
                      Something ll come up.  

      Jane stops, looks at him anxiously, crinkles up her face. 

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Don t worry.  It will.  

      Billy puts an arm around her, gives a playful cheer-up shake.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Besides.  We have far more dire 
                    issues to discuss.  

                                  JANE
                    Such as?                                                                                        4.


                                  BILLY
                    Such as...

      Gestures at Jane s mode of transportation.  A bright yellow, 
      1981 Vanagon Riviera with fake wood panelling on the doors.  

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Will  The Magic Bus  actually make 
                    it to school today?   

      Jane smiles, amused by her best friend.  

                                  JANE
                    Magic Bus is a thing of beauty, 
                    Billy.  Don t underestimate it. 



      Jane s van spews chunky, brown smoke as it lurches into a 
      parking spot, wedged between a line of shiny, new Volkswagen 
      Beetles and tiny, candy-colored Mini Coopers. 

      Looks of disgust from PASSING STUDENTS as...

      The van takes a guttural, clunk-fueled moment to settle.  



      Jane and Billy - vintage, off-beat - stand out as they stride 
      across a parking lot full of fresh-scrubbed American teens.  

      A SLOW MOTION walk of shame, with a hint of swagger.  

      Beyond the parking lot, Whitemarsh High School; a glossy, 
      glistening, state-of-the-art school...  Go, Lions!  



      The snapping of computer keys as Jane quickly scrolls and 
      searches and Google s after school job listings. 

      She stops, brightening as she reads.  

      ON SCREEN: A listing for paid internships at Urban Outfitters 
      corporate headquarters in Philadelphia. 

       Looking for a future in the fashion industry? ...   A chance 
      to put away some money for college?  


      The Magic Bus shudders to a pause at the entrance of the 
      train station, Billy behind the wheel. 

                                  BILLY
                    I can t believe she said,  Yes.  

                                  JANE
                    Yeah, well, I have to get the 
                      internship.  It s not over yet.  
                          (spotting it)
                    Oooo... Here comes the train.  

      Hops out of her Vanagon, dressed for her interview in a 
      belted vintage dress paired with argyle tights and boots. 

                                  BILLY
                    I still don t get why you can t 
                    just drive in to the city...

                                  JANE
                    In the Magic Bus?  Are you kidding?  
                    It wouldn t make it into the city. 

      She races in to the station with a wave...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    See you tomorrow! 

      Billy s cell phone begins to buzz with an anonymous text.   

       When can i c u?  



      A funky, retro, reconstituted factory warehouse in the Navy 
      Ship Yard district. Young workers buzzing about the immense 
      brick building.  Enormous windows overlooking the harbor.                                                                                       12.



      ON: a bowl of Cap n Crunch as it s doused with milk.  

      Jane takes a seat at the small kitchen table, digging in. She 
      picks up as the portable phone RINGS on the counter. 

                                  JANE
                          (answering)
                    Hello? -- Yeah, hold on a sec.                                                                                      26.


      Covering the mouthpiece.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Dad?... Dad?!

      She walks, still working on her cereal, through the kitchen 
      and down the hall, phone propped beneath her cheek. 

      Jane peers in her dad s room  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Dad?  

      Jane spots his  interview  suit and tie laid out neatly at 
      the end of the bed. The sound of Garret SINGING in the shower 
      warbles out from beyond the bathroom door.  She smiles. 

      She turns back, uncovering the phone with a formal... 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  He s not available 
                    right now, may I take a message?   

      Jane stops in her tracks, lowering her voice. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Look.  I know he s late on the 
                    payments but...

      Quickly closes herself in her bedroom. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Can t we get a couple extra months? 

      She listens, her eyes drifting to the  Executive Assistant 
      Applicant Pack  that Birdie sent her home with.  

      A beat.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    How many payments behind are we?  

      She listens again.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    That many. 

      And then Jane s face sets, determined.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Give me two weeks.  I ll take over 
                    the house payments. We ll be caught 
                    up in... 
                          (does the quick math)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Three months.  That s all I need.  
                          (a beat)
                    No, I m not his wife.  I m...    
                          (here goes nothing)
                    I m his sister. 

                                  BILLY (PRE-LAP)
                    You ll never get away with it!



      An upscale home in Lafayette Hill, swarming with kids for a 
      giant house party.  Somebody s parents clearly out of town. 

                                  JANE
                    This?...  

      Jane looks over at Billy as they climb out of The Magic Bus. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (incredulous)
                    This was your one condition?   

                                  BILLY
                    We don t get out much.  Sue me.  

      Jane groans, hesitating. 

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    You don t want to go, we don t have 
                    to go.  But, then I m not...

      Rubs his fingers together.  

                                  JANE
                    I know.  I know.  No documents. 

      She takes a deep breath, sizing up the in-crowd party, then 
      tosses a faux leopard fur wrap around her neck... 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Here goes nothing.  

      CUE:  WILD THING  by Tone-Loc.  

                                  TONE LOC
                    Let s do it. 

      Jane and Billy begin the long march towards the house.  



      Jane stands, alone by the pool. An island of boredom in a sea 
      of debauchery; teens laughing, dancing, drinking around her.  

      She sees Billy exiting the house, his eyes scanning for Jane.  

                                  JANE
                    Yo!  Over here! 

      He weaves his way through the party, finally reaching her. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Where the frack have you been?  
                    It s been, like, half an hour...

                                  BILLY
                    Long line. 

                                  JANE
                    Wait.  What s on your face? 

      She grips his chin to wipe -- what we know is -- a smudge of 
      lipstick off of his mouth, leaning in for a closer look. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Is that...?                                                                                     34.


      Suddenly, Jane lurches forward, belly flopping directly into 
      the pool with a giant splash! 

      Lulu Pope revealed in the spot where Jane once stood. 

                                  LULU
                          (aside, to Billy)
                    I don t like her touching you. 

                                  BILLY
                          (pissed)
                    Jesus, Lulu....

      Some JOCKS race over, whooping loudly... 

                                  JOCKS
                      Dunk-a-dork!

      Scooping Billy up by either arm and sending him, head first, 
      into the pool after Jane. 

      ON:  Jane, bobbing in the pool.  

      A beat. Billy pops up in the water beside her. 

                                  JANE
                          (dry)
                    This was such a good idea, Billy. 

      Jane tosses her water-logged, faux leopard wrap out of the 
      pool.  It lands on the ledge with a loud, wet schwaaaap!

                                  BILLY
                    Yep.  Good times. 

      Billy looks at Jane.  

      Jane looks at Billy.  

      And, they start to laugh.  Both sinking beneath the surface 
      in a watery cloud of air bubbles.

                                          ACT FOUR



      Jane darts through the train doors just as they close.   



      Jane sprints across the parking lot, almost falls, recovers,  
      and then races through the doors.   

      Jeremy Jones watches, amused, from his office window.  



      Jane standing outside a Philadelphia bar.  She looks 
      nervously back over her shoulder, finishing up her call. 

                                  JANE
                          (so guilty)
                    You know how it is.  Lots of... 
                    homework.  See you later.                                                                                      41.


      Snaps the phone shut.  Then, to herself:  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Right after I burn in hell. 

      Jane heads inside, showing the BOUNCER her (fake) ID. 



      Jane heads out to the curb, calmly hailing a taxi.  



      Classroom silent, students all at work on a pop quiz.  

      Bzzzt, bzzzt.   Bzzzt, bzzzt.  

      Jane glances down at the blackberry buzzing angrily in her 
      lap.  An incoming call from Gray.  

      Covers it with her hand as her teacher glances about for the 
      source.  A relieved look from Jane as the blackberry settles.  

      Less than three seconds later...

      Bzzzt, bzzzt.   Bzzzt, bzzzt.  

      It s Gray again.  The teacher glares at Jane now.  Nailed.  

                                  JANE
                          (whispers)
                    Sorry. 



      A cobbled street lined with well-appointed brick town houses; 
      brightly painted doors, perfect window boxes.  



      Jane looks up at the glossy, black door.  The brass house 
      number.  Impressive.  She mounts the stairs of the stoop. 



      A pair of french doors swing open on to the garden. 

      Jane steps out, taking in the perfectly raked pebble paths 
      and the gurgling pond and bobbing water lillies and...

                                  LYLE (O.C.)
                    Hello, there. 

      Jane SCREAMS. 

      LYLE (mid to late 70 s, graying, weathered face) stands 
      behind Jane, a narrow, wooden rake in his wrinkled hands.                                                                                      49.


                                  LYLE (CONT D)
                    Lyle. I take care of the garden 
                    when Gray s out of town. You are...

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.  Jane.  
                          (shakes his hand)
                    I m Gray s new assistant. 

                                  LYLE
                    Another one, huh? 

                                  JANE
                          (smiles)
                    Yep.  
                          (re: the garden)
                    It s gorgeous. 

      He nods, taking it in.  Then...

                                  LYLE
                    Let me show you something. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Lyle leads Jane around a flowering cherry blossom tree.  

      Beneath it, the kidney shaped koi pond brimming with fish, 
      eagerly bobbing to the surface as he tosses in some food. 

                                  JANE
                    Oh my goodness.  They re amazing.   

                                  LYLE
                    And, boy do they like to eat.  

      He passes Jane a handful of food and she tosses it in. 

                                  LYLE (CONT D)
                    Gray loves these fish.  

                                  JANE
                    Really?  It s funny, I... didn t 
                    really picture her having pets.  
                    She s not exactly warm and fuzzy.  

                                  LYLE
                    She s not so bad.  

      A beat.   

      Jane looks up at the back of the giant brownstone.                                                                                     50.


                                  JANE
                    She lives here alone?  

                                  LYLE
                    There was a husband once. 

                                  JANE
                    And now?

                                  LYLE
                    Now... there s not. 

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  

      She looks at Lyle and, from the look on his face, decides 
      it s best not to ask. 

                                  LYLE
                          (deep breath)
                    Well.  I better...

      Lifts the rake.  Smiles at Jane.  

                                  LYLE (CONT D)
                    Back to work. 

                                  JANE
                    It was nice to meet you, Lyle. 

                                  LYLE
                    You, too. 

      He returns to raking the tiny pebbles as Jane heads in.    



      Billy waits outside school, nervously pacing.  Silence. 

      And then...

      A $90,000 piece of German perfection crests the horizon with 
      Jane behind the wheel. 

      Gray s glossy, candy apple red Porsche convertible screeches 
      to a stop in front of the school... 



      Gray s Porsche screeches into the lot, Jane races inside.   



      THE PORSCHE slowly disappears behind an electric garage door.  

                                  JANE
                            (explaining)
                    Oil change.  

                                  LYLE
                    Of course. 

      Lyle grins as Jane hands him the car keys.  

                                  JANE
                    Would you mind putting these back 
                    for me?  I think it s my last day.                                                                                      59.


                                  LYLE
                    Sorry to hear it. 

                                  JANE
                    Me, too.  

      A sad look from Lyle as he watches Jane head down the street.  



      Billy sits on a bench, waiting, as the train from the city 
      rattles in to the station.  An exhausted Jane steps off. 

                                  BILLY
                    Hard day at the office, dear? 

                                  JANE
                    You have no idea.  

      She plops on to the bench beside him.  A beat.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    This week, Billy... it was the 
                    first time in sixteen years I felt 
                    like I wasn t invisible. Like I 
                    could see the other side, you know?      

      Jane fishes her ringing cell from her bag.  It s Gray. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Was nice while it lasted. 

      A grimace as she answers.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hello?  Yes... I understand... No, 
                      I understand.  Of course. 

      She hangs up, face blank.  

                                  BILLY
                    Sorry, Janey.  
                          (shoulder bump)
                    You okay?   What did she say?    

      Jane looks over at Billy.  Shocked smile forming.     

                                  JANE
                    See you Monday.   



                                            THE END
