                  They broke in through an open

    She hands it back.

                  time in your child s life, his

                  Years ago in Colorado, I was trying

                  was Jagermeister and I signed up

                  forgot about it.  Now I get a 
                  letter saying I show up for duty or 
                  I face military prison.  How the 
                  hell did they find me?  I mean, I m

                  That s not a fair choice.

                  So how do you know Nancy?

                                PETER
                  Our sons do karate together.

                                SANJAY
                  Have you known each other long? 

                                PETER
                  No.  We met a few weeks ago.  Hey, 
                  could I get a muffin?

                                SANJAY
                  The muffins can wait.  What are

                  She s a remarkable woman.  Strong

                  Fine.  But I ll be close by if you 
                  need me.

    Sanjay reluctantly walks away.

                  You cannot become a lesbian just 
                  because you don t want to lose 
                  weight.  The only girl you should 
                  be seeing is Jenny Craig.

                                ISABEL
                  What?

                                CELIA
                  I know, you see people like Rosie 
                  O Donnell and you think, hey, she 
                  can find love, but that s not where 
                  lesbianism is going, Isabel.  Look 
                  at the L word.

                  She s a little Asian girl.  They 
                  look like boys already.  You might 
                  as well go for the real deal.

                                PEGGY LEE
                  Hey, I have boobs.

                                CELIA
                  Those are not boobs.  Call your 
                  grandparents and tell them to pick 
                  you up.

                  Of course not, honey.  I m going to 
                  live for a long, long time.  The

                  to be sure.  I mean, there s still

                  Why would you say that?

                                ISABEL
                   Cause when you think you re going

                  Like crap.

                  Good.  Remember it fondly because 
                  it s all downhill from here.  What 
                  the hell were you thinking?

                                SILAS
                  We were just screwing around.

                  Screwing around?  You took ecstasy. 
                  That shit is like taking ice cream 
                  scoops out of your brain.

                                SILAS
                  How original.  I may have been 
                  fucked up, but I heard Officer

                  You think you re cute?  You re 
                  destroying your life.  And I swear

                  in your room until you get some 
                  sense, I ll do it.  You don t fuck

                  I don t take drugs.  When have you

                                SILAS
                  You may not take them, but you sell 
                  them. 

    Nancy skips a beat.

                  You don t know what you re talking

    Silas grabs his backpack and fills it with condoms, his iPod,

                  questionable decision about how to

                                SILAS
                  What choice do you have?  

    Silas grabs his bong, adds it to the backpack, zips it up and 
    throws it over his shoulder.

                                NANCY
                  I have the choice to kick you out

                  You want to explain that to Shane?  
                  Of course not.  He s been through

    Silas opens the door and exits.  Nancy takes a beat then 
    follows after him.

                  You realize, if you do this, Heylia 
                  will never speak to you again.

    Nancy retrieves a corkscrew from a drawer.  She turns around

    She exits and closes the door behind her.  It s the Kay 
    moment at the end of The Godfather as she watches everyone 
    kiss Michael s ring before someone shuts the doors.  

    Shane watches as she rejoins the group at the table.  

    Conrad enters through the back gate, carrying his clone.  He 
    puts it down in the middle of the table.  One by one, they 
    sniff the leaves. 

    Lupita shuts the door.

    Peter is asleep in bed.  

    Nancy wakes up and looks over at him, smiles.  We hear the

    She gets out of bed, nude.  It s cold.  

    She grabs the nearest garment off a chair - Peter s jacket.  
    Puts it on
