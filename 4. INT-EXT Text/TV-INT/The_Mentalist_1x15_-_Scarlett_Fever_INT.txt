      A lively cocktail party is in full swing as CATERERS serve 
      hors d oeuvres to the crowd.  


      SCARLETT MARQUESA, 30 s, beautifully dressed, comes 
      staggering down a hallway, hands at her throat, a choked 
      scream on her lips.  She blindly runs into and over the top 
      bannister overlooking the foyer.  She falls -- crash landing 
      on a table of hors d oeuvres -- to her death.    

      As pandemonium ensues, a little boy -- OSCAR MARQUESA -- 
      curly black hair, nine-years-old, comes out of his room, 
      peers down through the banister and sees his mother s 
      contorted body on the floor below.


      JANE, opposite a shaven-headed tattooed GANGSTER, who gazes 
      intently at a shiny .45 Caliber SILVER BULLET Jane is holding 
      between thumb and forefinger.  

                                  JANE
                    ...Look at it, George.  Beautiful, 
                    isn t it?  Look at that.  Like a 
                    little jewel.  Or a child s toy.  
                    Wouldn t it be good if you could 
                    relax and go back to a time when 
                    you were a child?  A little boy 
                    with no cares or worries. You can 
                    go back if you want if you think 
                    about it, if you just close your 
                    eyes and drift away.  That s right.  
                    Don t you feel happy and relaxed?    

                                  GANGSTER
                    Yes...

      The Gangster is in a light trance.

      the glass, far away from the rim where it would have been 
      deposited by drinking from the glass.  He looks around and

      FADE IN:


      The room still has not been cleared from the day before as 
      police tape and broken furniture clutters the scene.  Victor 
      comes down the stairs with a HANDBAG and a PHONE and gives 
      them to an awaiting Lisbon and Jane.

      and looks through it discreetly while they walk into --


      All the available counter space is covered with glasses, 
      silverware, and dishes from the night before.  Victor shows

                          (bristling)
                    Asra?  Yes.  They got along fine. 
                    Why ask about her?

                                  JANE
                    You and Asra are having an affair, 
                    aren t you?

                                  VICTOR
                    What?  No!  

                                  JANE
                    No?  Really?

                                  VICTOR
                    No, really, and what the heck kind 
                    of police are you anyhow to ask me 
                      a question like that?  On no basis 
                    at all. 

                                  JANE
                    My mistake, sorry. 
                          (beat)
                    Is she your business partner then?  

                                  VICTOR
                    She s my accounts manager.  

                                  JANE
                    Ah.  Okay.  I understand.

                                  VICTOR
                      Understand what?

                                  JANE
                    No matter.  There s no keys in 
                    here.  D you know where her keys 
                    are?  

                                  VICTOR
                    No, I couldn t find them.  I wanted 
                    to move her car.

                    Never mind, I m sure they ll show 
                    up.

                                  VICTOR
                    I develop real estate.

                                  LISBON
                    Rough market.

                                  VICTOR
                    You know.  We ve all seen better.  
                    I m very confident it ll turn 
                    around soon.  

                                  LISBON
                    Did Scarlett work with you? 

                                  VICTOR
                    No.  She was the artistic type.  
                    She made jewelry, that was her 
                    thing.  Made a pretty good business 
                    out of it in fact.  Selling to 
                    friends and neighbors.

                                  LISBON 
                    What kind of jewelry?  Expensive 
                    stuff?

                                  VICTOR
                    No.  Just nice trinkets really, 
                    earrings, bracelets. 

                                  JANE
                    Can we see some?

                                  VICTOR 
                    Sure.

      Victor goes to another part of the kitchen and brings over a 
      flat velvet display that houses a couple of rings, bracelets 
      and two artful little pill boxes.  Jane and Lisbon pick 
      pieces up, study them and put them back.

                                  JANE
                    Very nice.

                      Scarlett s idea.  She figured we 
                    needed to let people know we re 
                    doing fine.  And we are, doing 
                    fine.  

                                  LISBON
                    At the party last night, did anyone 
                    behave in an unusual manner?  Were 
                    there any odd incidents you recall? 

                                  VICTOR
                    No.

                    Yes.  Good friends.

                    We ll need a guest list.

                                  VICTOR
                    Sure.  They were from the country 
                    club mostly.  Scarlett was elected 
                    chair of the women s committee there, 
                    which is kind of a big deal in this 
                      community?  Very prestigious.  I was 
                    so proud of her, although it meant 
                    she had to spend a lot of her time at 
                    the club. 

      Oscar comes tearing through the room again, screaming, sword 
      flailing. 

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Oscar!  Stop, please!

      Oscar comes to a full stop, looks at his dad before silently 
      darting out of the room.  Lisbon and Jane look on awkwardly.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Pardon me.  Are we done here?

                                  LISBON
                    For the moment, yes.  We ll be in 
                    touch if we need anything else.


      Jane and Rigsby with Mandy Riljek.

                                  JANE
                    Asra Hadami.

      Mandy blurts out laughing, and stops herself quickly.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    That s a funny idea?

                    No.  It s just, no.  Victor and 
                    Asra are good friends, nothing 
                    more.  Asra had nothing to do with 
                    this.

                                  JANE
                    No?  What s the general opinion

                    My guess.  Victor.

                                  RIGSBY
                    What makes you think that?

                                  MANDY
                    Nothing really.  Victor s a nice 
                    guy, but that s who kills women, 
                    isn t it?  Their husbands.  Ninety 
                    percent of the time.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Seventy percent, I think.

      Jackie.

                    We were very close.  Being her 
                    deputy on the women s committee,

                    She talked a lot about moving away.  She 
                    was tired of keeping up at all costs.

                    Oh no, only Scarlett has a key.

                    We need your key.

      Asra and Mandy sit up in bed, alarmed, shielding their 
      nakedness with sheets.

      FADE IN:


      Lisbon and Van Pelt heading for the interview room.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Boss?

                                  LISBON
                          (reading file)
                    Hmm?

                                  VAN PELT
                    I ve been here nearly six months 
                    now.  Half a year.

                                  LISBON
                    What d you want?  Half a cake?

                                  VAN PELT
                    I want to take lead on this 
                      interview.  

      Lisbon looks up from the file, appraising her.

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Okay? 

                                  LISBON
                    Sure, go ahead.  

                                  VAN PELT
                          (grins)
                    Thanks, boss. 

      They walk into the waiting room, Van Pelt leading the way.


      Van Pelt slowly paces as she questions Asra.  Lisbon hangs in 
      the back.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Why were you running, Ms. Hadami?

                                  ASRA
                    No reason.  Stress.  I needed 
                    space.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      23.

      CONTINUED:2929

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nothing to do with the argument you 
                    had with Scarlett Marquesa the 
                    night she died?

                                  ASRA
                    I didn t have an argument with her.

                                  VAN PELT
                    We hear differently.

                                  ASRA
                    No argument.  I swear.  I didn t 
                    kill her.  This is absurd. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    No more absurd than you clearing 
                    out your accounts and abandoning 
                    your home for  no reason. 

                                  ASRA
                    Maybe I need a lawyer.

      Van Pelt looks to Lisbon who nods for her to press on.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Say the word.  What he ll tell you, 
                    if you re not involved in the 
                    murder, best speak up. 

                                  ASRA 
                    I ran because I knew the murder 
                    would expose some issues I would 
                    like to keep private.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Such as your relationship with 
                    Mandy Riljek?

                                  ASRA
                    Exactly.  News like that could be 
                    ruinous.

                                  VAN PELT
                    True, but not the kind of thing you 
                    abandon your house for.  You said 
                    issues.  What are the other issues?

      Asra indicates truth being told...







                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      24.

      CONTINUED: (2)2929

                                  ASRA
                    I didn t want to look Victor in the 
                    face and tell him that I d helped 
                    run everything he d worked so hard 
                    for into the ground.

                                  VAN PELT
                    How did you help do that?

                                  ASRA
                      I borrowed money from the company s 
                    cash reserve.

                                  VAN PELT
                    How much?

                                  ASRA
                    A little over half a million.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Where did it go?

                                  ASRA
                    I made some poor investment choices 
                    that I had to cover quickly.

                                  VAN PELT
                    So you stole --

                                  ASRA
                      I borrowed.  From the reserves.  I 
                    skimmed the money from each 
                      development deal that should have 
                    gone into the company s reserve 
                    account as back up.  We were making 
                    so many deals, I knew I would get 
                    it back before it would matter.  
                    But then the deals and the funding 
                    dried up and suddenly that reserve 
                    was very important.  I sold 
                    anything I could get my hands on to 
                    cover the money.

      Van Pelt again looks back at Lisbon who gives her approval of 
      how she handled the questioning.  Van Pelt is pleased.


      Rigsby comes in, sits down with Mandy, who s been cooling her 
      heels and getting impatient.  Rigsby writes on a form.

                    Why am I even here?  I ve done

                    weekend.  But your husband Jim s 
                    away.  And you laughed at the idea 
                    of Asra and Victor as lovers.

      Mandy sits back.  Rigsby hands her a form on a clipboard.

      Mandy takes the form.  Cho enters.  Speaks a tiny bit 
      woodenly.

                    Oh, sorry.

                                  RIGSBY

      Rigsby makes a  be my guest  gesture.  Mandy sizes them up as 
      she leaves.  After she s gone.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Not bad.  Your delivery was a bit

      Lisbon and Van Pelt talk to Victor.  Oscar runs in and out 
      dressed as a WIZARD.  

                                  VICTOR 
                    I can t believe it.  Asra s been 
                    with me for over five years.  She 
                    was right there with me in the 
                    trenches.  I can t believe it.   

        Robotically, Victor pulls out  fixins  and begins making a 
      sandwich.

                                  VAN PELT
                    After going over your accounts, we 
                    had a couple of questions.

                                  VICTOR
                    Sure.

                                  VAN PELT
                    You ve talked about cash crises in 
                    your business, but regular cash 
                    deposits have been made into your 
                    personal accounts.  Some were 
                    upwards of five thousand dollars.

                                  VICTOR
                    Oh.
                          (embarrassed)
                    Those were Scarlett s deposits.

                          (over his shoulder)
                    Hey, Oscar, come get your lunch.

                                  LISBON
                    Those are some pretty hefty 
                    deposits for someone not really 
                    working.  Where was the money from?

                                  VICTOR
                    Her jewelry business.

                                  LISBON
                    I thought you said it was a small 
                    side business?

                                  VICTOR
                    It was, but apparently she had a 
                    lot of interest in her pieces.  She 
                    recently made a deal with a couple 
                    of boutiques.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Do you know which ones?

                                  VICTOR
                    Never asked.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Without her money, you would have 
                    fallen behind months ago.

                                  VICTOR

                    I know all too well that it was my 
                    wife that had to save our bacon.

      Oscar bounds into the room.  He stares at his plate.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)

                    You made it wrong.  Mommy never 
                    puts all this stuff in it.  She 
                    knows I like it plain.

                                  VICTOR
                    Can we compromise, buddy?  I need 
                    to talk to these police ladies.  
                    We ll fix it better next time.  Now 
                    please just eat the sandwich.

      Victor sets the plate on the table in the breakfast nook.  
      Obedient, but visibly disappointed, Oscar sits down and eats.

                    Sorry about that.

                    You can buy  pay-as-you-go  phones

                    minutes on them and then dump the

      He hangs up, grabs his jacket and exits.


      Jane furtively moves to a door marked  WOMEN S COMMITTEE 
      CHAIRWOMAN  and slips inside.  


      Rigsby s already there waiting.  Jane locks the door so that 
      only someone with keys can get into the room.  Rigsby opens 
      drawers and when he finds nothing, makes himself comfortable. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Should have brought some snacks.

      Jane sits down to wait.


      Rigsby and Jane sit in darkness.

      They HEAR the RUSTLE OF KEYS at the door as it opens.  A 
      shadowy figure -- that we soon recognize as Patience -- makes 
      her way to the safe and inserts a key.  Opens it.  Looks 
      inside and takes out a plastic bag full of pill bottles.  
      Just then, her CELL PHONE RINGS and Patience answers it.

      The LIGHT FLICKS ON and Patience finds herself standing in

      Rigsby watches while Patience calmly powders the shiny spots 
      of her face with a compact using the two-way mirror.

                                  RIGSBY
                    How did you come to have Scarlett

                                  PATIENCE
                    I took them when I went to offer my 
                      condolences to Victor.  Naughty I 
                    know, but I couldn t wait.

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s not naughty.  It s a felony. 
                    You wanted to get your hands on her 
                    pill supply.

                                  PATIENCE
                    Nonsense.  I opened that safe out 
                    of idle curiosity.  I had no idea 
                    there were any pills in there.  I 
                    simply wanted to measure the 
                    windows for new drapes.  I ll be 
                    the next chair of the committee.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why not wait until it s official?

                                  PATIENCE

                                  RIGSBY
                    She was doing a booming business.  
                    And you wanted a part of it.  Maybe 
                    a little too much.

                                  PATIENCE
                    So I killed her?  Please.  Hello!  
                    She was a drug dealer.  People she 
                    dealt with must have done her in.  
                    Other dealers.

                    Or a highly capable rival right in 
                    the middle of her own community.

      Patience sits up.  She s all business as she stares Rigsby 
      down.

                                  PATIENCE
                    You ve found no drugs or poison on 
                    me or in my home, the keys were 
                    taken after she was killed, and I 
                    only opened that safe out of idle 
                      curiosity.  You taped together your 
                    whole theory with a couple of idle 
                      conversations I had with a drug 
                    dealer.  Does that about sum it up?


      Lisbon and Jane observe the interrogation.

                    When she puts it like that, it does

      Jane walks to the foyer.  Oscar comes down the stairs.

                    So what s next?

                                  JANE
                    CBI s already hard at work putting 
                    the pieces together.  In fact... 
                      nevermind.

                                  JACKIE
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    I really shouldn t talk about it 
                    since this is an ongoing case.

                                  JACKIE
                    Now you know you can t leave 
                    something like that hanging.

                                  JANE
                    Promise this stays just between us?

      The women nod as they lean in a little closer in anticipation 
      of some juicy gossip.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    We re going after Victor Marquesa.

                                  JACKIE
                      Victor?... I don t believe it... He 
                    doesn t look like the type.

                                    HEATHER
                    On what grounds?

                                  JANE
                    We think he killed Patience out of 
                    revenge for the murder of his wife.

                                    HEATHER
                    But you said there was no proof 
                    Patience was guilty?

                                  JANE
                    I guess Victor didn t want to wait 
                    for proof.

                                  JACKIE
                    What s going to happen to Oscar?

                                  JANE
                    Mom murdered and now his dad s a 
                    murderer.  Once his father is 
                    arrested, he s going to be placed 
                    in foster care.

                                    HEATHER
                    Oh how dreadful.  That poor child.  

      Jane sits there looking solemn.


      Jane sits before Heather.  Lisbon hangs in the back.

                                  JANE
                    I first suspected it was you 
                    because it seemed like everybody 
                    else at the club wore some of 
                      Scarlett s jewelry.  But not you.  

                                    HEATHER
                    That s it?  Jewelry?

                                  JANE
                    The more we talked, the more I felt 
                    your pain and anger.  Losing your 
                    daughter has unhinged you.

                                    HEATHER 
                    Unhinged.  Yes.  I suppose I am. 
                    My daughter loved to dance.  Didn t 
                    matter what kind of music, a toe 
                    would start tapping.  She was so 
                    full of life.  
                          (beat)
                    She d taken several painkillers 
                    with alcohol before she got behind 
                    the wheel.  One of her neighborhood 
                    friends got them from her mother.  
                    Who got them from Scarlett. 

                                  JANE
                      I understand your anger.

                                    HEATHER 
                    It was like they ripped my soul out 
                    clean.  But, the rest of the world 
                    kept moving right along.  It was 
                    like I was the only one who 
                      remembered what happened.

      FLASHBACK


      Drink in hand, Heather sees Scarlett, Patience, and other 
      women giddily passing around a tube of lipstick.  They crowd 
      around the mirror trying it on.  As soon as it hits the 
      table, Heather swipes it.

                                    HEATHER (V.O.)
                    So when I saw her flitting about 
                    town selling pills without a care 
                    in the world, still hosting parties 
                    at her house... happily dancing 
                    around without a stitch of the 
                    misery I was carrying, I snapped.


      Heather pours a powdery substance into the drink tumbler and 
      stirs it around.  Then she writes a note with the lipstick, 
      puts the napkin around the glass, and heads back out.

                                    HEATHER (V.O.)
                    I killed her.  I didn t want any 
                    other person to have to experience 
                    what I did.


      Pretending to be a little tipsy, Heather hugs Scarlett and 
      swaps out her nearly empty drink with the fresh poisoned one 
      with the napkin.  Scarlett readily accepts it.  Heather pats 
      her on the back before disappearing into the crowd.


      Scarlett has been drinking on her new beverage for a while as 
      she reapplies her make-up.  She sees the tumbler in the 
      reflection of the mirror and notices the napkin.  She pulls 
      the napkin off the glass and reads it, crumpling it up and 
      throwing it in the wastebasket.  She begins to feel weird and 
      starts clutching at her throat.

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    And Patience?        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      50.



      Patience lies on her back covered with a sheet.  She is 
      blissed-out with a face mask and cucumber slices covering her 
      eyes.  We see a knife inch toward her.

                                    HEATHER (V.O.)
                    She told everyone at the club not 
                    to worry, she s going to take over 
                      Scarlett s business, and keep the 
                    pills coming.  Like nothing had 
                    happened.  Like no lessons had been 
                    learned.  I had to finish what I 
                    started.  I had to.

      END FLASHBACK


      Jane still sits across from Heather with Lisbon in the back.

                                  JANE
                    And now that it s done, do you feel 
                    better?

      Heather slowly drops her head and begins to cry.

                                    HEATHER 
                    It doesn t change a thing.


      Victor and Oscar stand with Van Pelt, Cho and Rigsby.  Lisbon 
      enters.

                                  VICTOR
                    Agent Lisbon.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Marquesa.

                                  VICTOR
                    I just wanted to thank you and your 
                    team.  I have to admit the whole 
                    scene in front of the house --

                                  OSCAR
                            (corrective)
                    It was make believe, Dad.

                                  VICTOR
                    Sorry.  The make believe was 
                      unorthodox, and unpleasant frankly, 
                    but I guess you all know what 
                    you re doing.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      51.

                                  LISBON
                    Most of the time.  My apologies if 
                    we ve been tough on you.

                                  VICTOR
                    It was useful to hear some straight 
                    talk.  We re moving out of Villa 
                    Marsante, back to my hometown.  My 
                    son and I have some catching up to 
                    do.

      As Victor and Oscar exit, they cross Jane entering.  He 
      awkwardly shakes Victor s hand and gives Oscar a hair ruffle. 

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Mr. Jane, thank --

                                  JANE
                    -- No, no.  Please forget it.  
                    Bye.  Good luck. 

      He walks on.  They go.  Jane walks over to Lisbon et al.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Another minute and I d have missed 
                    them.  I do hate it when people say 
                    thank you.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why?

                                  LISBON
                    He likes to play the Lone Ranger.  
                          (Fifties girl voice)
                    Who was that masked man?  I never 
                    got the chance to thank him.

                                  JANE
                    Exactly.  
                          (to Rigsby)
                    Hey, I don t want to alarm you, but 
                    your friend Jackie s standing right 
                    behind you looking very fierce.

      Rigsby turns to see Jackie in all her fierce kitty glory 
      standing by the entrance.  She gives a little wave.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh, yes.  I invited her to lunch.

      Rigsby collects his coat from his chair and heads off to meet 
      Jackie at the front.  Van Pelt looks surprised.  Jane looks 
      amused.
