      FADE IN:


      EXT. RUMOHR ESTATE - LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK - DAY
11


      A behemoth, imposing mansion, sprawling grounds, old money.


      Taking advantage of this mild, early spring day, six CHILDREN 
      are playing hide and seek with a regal, statuesque woman of 

      49, KATHERINE RUMOHR.  She wears a T-shirt and jeans but it s 
      impossible to dress down her class.


                                  KATHERINE

                    Okay, I m starting...

      She covers her eyes.


                                  KATHERINE
                    One!  You guys better get moving!


      The children scatter in all directions, toward the beach, the 
      dock, the dunes and the house.


                                  KATHERINE
                    Two!

      Katherine smiles watching them between her fingers.



                                  KATHERINE
                    Three!


      CAMERA follows a 5 year-old boy, CHARLIE RUMOHR, as he darts 
      toward the residence.


                                  KATHERINE (O.S.)

                    Four...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ENTER the MASTER SUITE 


      and continue to the 


      MASTER BATH


      where we hear the hiss of a steam bath.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. STEAM BATH - DAY
33

      HUGH RUMOHR, 75, fit as a man half his age, sweats alone in 
      the steam.  He is slouched, head down, eyes closed.

      CLOSE on him as he slowly raises his head and squints into 
      the churning white clouds.  He thinks he hears something. 

      Beat, then he relaxes, closes his eyes and sits back.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
44

      Rumohr, in a robe, wipes sweat from his face and walks over 
      to a sitting area where toast, coffee, juice and the day s 
      papers are laid out for him. 

      He sits, takes a bite of toast and picks up the front section 
      of the Times.

      He skims the front page, takes a sip of coffee and goes to 
      reach for the next section of the paper.

      His hand freezes a few inches from it.  

      An object is placed on top of the paper.  He picks it up.

      CLOSE on a four-leaf clover.

      ANGLE on Rumohr, his reaction.  Whatever the clover was meant 
      to signify, its intent has been received.

      Beat.

      Rumohr goes to the window.  He looks down at Katherine about 
      to start searching for the kids.

      She looks up at the house and double-takes seeing Rumohr in 
      the window.

      She looks beautiful, happy.  She s about to go back to the 
      game when something in Rumohr s strong, steady stare makes 
      her pause.

      A cloud passes overhead, drawing a shadow over her.  She 
      lifts her chin at him just slightly.

      ANGLE on Rumohr, we might, or we might not, see the smallest 
      fraction of a nod from him.  

      Beat, then Katherine goes back to the game.

      Rumohr steps away from the window, moves to a Jasper Johns 
      flag painting on the wall.

      SHOT of the painting, one flag, within another flag, within 
      another flag.  

      Rumohr takes it off the hook to REVEAL a safe.  He opens it.  
      We SEE $100,000 in new bills and a .9 millimeter PISTOL.

      Rumohr picks up the gun, checks that it s loaded.  It is.  

      He steps back and raises it to the side of his head.

      As he starts to pull the trigger to blow his brains across 
      the room... 

      CAMERA slides away to the antique canopy bed under which we 
      SEE Charlie Rumohr has been hiding.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Katherine is hot on the heels of one of the kids, both of 
      them huffing and laughing, when she HEARS the GUNSHOT. 

      Katherine stops cold and wheels around to the mansion, the 
      color running out of her face until her cheeks mirror the 
      wispy, pale clouds gathering above.

                                  ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. SOUTH STREET - NEW YORK CITY - DAY
66

      A windy day, gusts sweeping the streets clean.  

      Pick up WILL TRAVERS, a hard 36, his boyish face made coarse 
      and trustworthy by some indeterminate suffering.  There is a 
      faint lavender pall under his eyes from lost sleep.

      Will is dressed in corduroy pants, oxford button-down, 
      sweater, Navy pea coat.  It s his daily uniform donned so he 
      doesn t have to pay attention to his appearance.

      There is a fish delivery truck at the corner.  As Will 
      passes, the DELIVERYMAN watches him go.  Their eyes catch for 
      a split second.

      Will comes to a building with only one tenant.  He pushes the 
      BUZZER for the  AMERICAN POLICY INSTITUTE 

      SHOT of a tiny CAMERA in the corner of the vestibule inside.

      Beat, then it buzzes.

      Will pushes open the heavy door and enters.

      Just inside is a reception desk behind which sits NORRIS 
      SCHOTT, Reyn Spooner Hawaiian shirt, imperturbable eyes, face 
      wizened as beef jerky, possibly retired military.   He has a 
        surveillance monitor in front of him but is more focused on 
      the day s sports page.

      CAMERA follows Will through a second door, this one unlocked, 
      into the American Policy Institute.


      The common area is as austere, clean and nondescript as any 
      law firm.  But every office ringing the common area is 
      actively lived-in, personalized with photos, artwork, plants, 
      crocheted pillows on couches that fold out into beds.

      We get the impression that once someone arrives here, at 
      whatever point in their career, they stay.

      There is a cacophony of phones constantly ringing.  It should 
      be assumed every time we return here, phones are ringing as 
      white noise in the background.

      Bunches of four offices are grouped together with their own 
      conference rooms.  








































































































































































































































                                                                                      5.



      Will passes a wide staircase leading down to what we SEE is a 
      vast underground LIBRARY.

      He keeps walking.

      Will nods hello to MILES FIEDLER, 40 but could pass for 70, a 
      world-class neurotic with long hair, permanently glassy eyes 
      and yellowed fingers from a two pack a day smoking habit.  

      Fiedler drinks deeply from a cup of black coffee, then places 
      a nicotine patch on his shoulder.  Now he gets up and hurries 
      to keep pace with Will, who doesn t slow.


                                    FIEDLER
                    If a client doesn t know what 
                    questions to ask...

                                  WILL
                    We tell them what questions to ask.

                                    FIEDLER
                    An adversary doesn t know how far 
                    they re willing to bend, I m 
                    thinking we try the same thing.

                                  WILL
                    This for next week s North Korea 
                    session?
                          (Fiedler nods)
                    Has it been done with success?

      Fiedler takes out Nicorette gum and eats a piece.

                                    FIEDLER 
                      Brezhnev s loaded on vodka at an 
                    orgy negotiating SALT II with 
                    Carter.  He refuses Carter s every 
                    ask.  Cy Vance tells Carter to 
                    agree to Brezhnev s asks...

                                  WILL
                    But then repeat them back using his 
                    own instead of Brezhnev s.

                                    FIEDLER
                    Yeah.  Carter shouts louder and 
                    louder over Brezhnev s ladies but 
                    by the time he s done, Brezhnev 
                    says he s glad Carter saw the light 
                    and they had a deal.


      Will lifts his chin at the nicotine patch and the Nicorette.

                                  WILL 
                    Isn t that an either/or type of 
                    thing?  The goal is to diminish the 
                    nicotine in your blood.

                                    FIEDLER
                    Not really.

                                  WILL
                    Then why quit smoking?

                                    FIEDLER
                    Get the wife and kids off my ass.  

      Fiedler heads back to his office.  

      Will walks on.  

      Ahead, he SEES a bow-tie wearing conservative his same age, 
      BOB TEST.  Test is immaculately groomed, arrogant and blue-
      blood calm.  It s not that he s succeeded at everything he s 
      ever tried.  It s that he s succeeded effortlessly. 

      Test waits for Will with a glower in front of offices 
      belonging to VICTORIA LIPMAN (40) and TANYA SOBOTKA (30), 
      colleagues and close friends.

      Victoria is an easy-going soccer mom with a high-end genius 
      IQ, and Tanya, the youngest analyst, with short hair, pierces 
      visible and not, and several statement tattoos.

      Victoria s office is decorated with her kids artwork and 
      family photos.  Tanya s is decorated with cacti, posters of 
      The Damned, Buffalo  66 and James Joyce.


                                  TEST
                    The one and only American movie 
                    Chechen rebels watch before going 
                    into battle. 

                                  WILL
                    Good morning, Bob.

                                  TEST
                    Good morning.  Now cut the shit and 
                    answer.  

                                  WILL 
                    Rocky.

      Test tenses for a second but then breaks into a grin.

                                  TEST
                    So how does it feel, being wrong?  

                                  WILL
                    I wasn t finished.

      Test folds his arms on his chest, bracing...

                                  WILL
                    Rocky III.  Chechens are going to 
                    identify with a persistent 
                    underdog, Rocky, who defeats a 
                    lumbering giant, Mr. T, brought 
                    down by his ego and pride. 

      The exasperated look on Test s face says it all.  Nothing for 
      him to do but change the subject.  

                                  TEST
                          (to Victoria)
                    I need you and Tanya to weigh in on 
                    a few new items.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Namely?

                                  TEST
                      Comparison of public, private and 
                    parochial schools in Ohio.
                          (Victoria rolls her eyes)
                    Subaru wants us to revisit how they 
                    might enter Arab markets while 
                    still maintaining sales in Israel.


      Victoria makes a snoring sound.

                                  TEST
                    And that little something from the 
                    DoD and Navy we ve been expecting.

                                  VICTORIA
                          (sits up)
                    Perks to SOP for submariners?  
                          (Test nods)
                    Is it actually in there?  Softcore 
                    porn on subs slinging hundreds of 
                      nuclear-tipped warheads?

                                  TEST

      Will starts away.  Test keeps pace.

                                  TEST
                    Seen the market since it opened?  
                    Pendry Goss is in free fall.  Rumor

                    hear, they have the same business 
                    and cash reserves as yesterday.

                                  WILL
                    Who started the rumor?

                                  TEST
                    Hasn t been nailed down.

                    The street would love to see them 
                    eat shit and die.  Could be anyone. 

      Will walks on.

      Victoria follows Test into a

      CONFERENCE ROOM

      where we SEE deep cushioned chairs more akin to Winnebagos 
      than corporations around an octagonal coffee table.

      CAMERA ducks back out and into

      TANYA S OFFICE

      where she is sipping a mug of espresso and cruising through 
      what we SEE is the New York Post crossword.  

      Quickly, she has only one answer remaining, five down.  


      Tanya bolts out of her office and starts running down the 
      corridor to catch Will.

                                  TANYA
                          (re: crossword)

                                  TANYA
                    Five down.  What do lucky 
                      lepidoptera larvae eat?

                                  WILL
                    Clover, among other plants.  If 
                    they re lucky...

                                  TANYA
                    Four-leaf clover.
                          (checks)
                    Wait, I need nineteen letters.

                                  WILL
                    Try the Gaelic.

                                  TANYA
                    Which is?

                                  WILL
                    I have no idea.  The only Gaelic I 
                    know is  Pog mo thoin.   Try Latin.  
                    Marsilea quadrifolia.

      Victory.  Tanya blows Will a kiss.

      Will finally arrives at his office, outside of which waits 
      his research assistant, MAGGIE YOUNG (30).  There is an open, 
      optimistic spirit in her.  For too long, her Achilles Heel 
      has been her willingness and desire to trust people.  This is 
      a part of herself she s determined to change.

                                  MAGGIE
                    So, how are we feeling?

                                  WILL
                    Fine.  And you?

      Maggie narrows her eyes, scrutinizes him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    What day is today, Will?

                                  WILL
                      Wednesday.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Yeah...

                                  WILL
                    April 8th.  

      Beat, Maggie closes her eyes and nods.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    It s my birthday.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Get cracking, we re going to lunch 
                    in four hours.

      In contrast to other offices where employees have practically 
      moved in, Will s has no photos, posters or plants.  Nothing 
      of him.  Just books and periodicals, stacked eight feet high.  


      The route to his desk is through valleys and ravines of books 
      (string theory, Harlequin romances, Biblical analysis, 
      Darwin s Origin of the Species, works of Edward R. Tufte and 
      countless  How-To  guides on everything from installing solar 
      panels to the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga) to a desk 
      where no less than fifty documents are waiting for him.

      Will looks out his window across the street at the parking 
      structure where we SEE a MAN (HADDAS) get out of a maroon 
      Volvo and walk toward the stairs, careful to step over a 
      crack in the pavement.

      ANGLE on Will, a small smile watching this.

      Now Will starts into a book.

      CAMERA takes its time circling the room, then...

      Slowly ANGLE up to the doorway where Maggie is knocking.

      Will doesn t hear her for a beat, then finally looks up.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Let s go.  Up and out, lunch.

      Will looks at his watch.  Four hours have passed.

                                  WILL
                    Maggie, can I have a rain check?

                                  MAGGIE
                    I knew it.

                                  WILL 
                    I still have some pressing work.

      PAN the overgrown surfeit of work demanding his attention, 
      splayed across the entire surface area of the desk.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Rain check then.  
                          (starts to leave, pauses)
                    I m not giving up.  

      A last look back at Will and Maggie is gone.  

      Beat of Will at his desk, too much work to even begin.  So to 
      procrastinate, he takes out the Times crossword and dives in.  
      Ink, of course.


      He flies through it as if he had the answer key.

      When he s two-thirds done...

      CLOSE on his face, a glimmer of surprise.  He finishes it 
      then moves on to the crossword for the Washington Post.  

      He s flying through that, too, when he suddenly stops and 
      sets down his pen.  

      He gets up and leaves his office.

      FOLLOW him down to 

      TANYA S OFFICE

      which is empty since she s at lunch.  He enters and picks 
      through her trash to find the crossword he helped her clinch.

      ANGLE on Will, his mind churning.

      Beat, then he exits Tanya s office. 

      FOLLOW him to the stairwell and down into the stacks of the 

      LIBRARY

      where he beelines to the periodicals, hundreds of current 
      magazines and newspapers from People to Pravda.  

      Will chooses several daily papers.

      QUICK CUTS of him doing the crosswords in the...

      1) Houston Chronicle

      2) Atlanta Journal-Constitution

      3) Los Angeles Times

      4) Boston Globe

      5) Miami Herald

      6) Chicago Tribune

      He sets them down side by side.  

      First we notice  MARSILEA QUADRIFOLIA  in all papers with the 
      same clue about the lucky larvae.  

      But then...

      CAMERA REVEALS it s not just one.  

      INSERT SHOT of ten answers:  identical in all the papers.

      ANGLE on Will, incredulous, his mind racing.


      He writes down the ten answers.

      SHOT over his shoulder as he starts to work, drawing out 
      possible connections between the words, piecing together 
      their significance.  

      It s trial and error, we SEE him erase several words, false 
      starts, progress is difficult and incremental.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. OFFICE OF DANIEL HADDAS - DAY
77

      DANIEL HADDAS, 67, is on the phone but waves Will in and 
      directs him to a chair.  Will sits.

      Haddas has a round face, round glasses and a round body.  He 
      is a patient, wise man with nothing to prove.

      PAN the room to find charms, talismans, pendants and amulets 
      from his wide travels.

      One item sticks out...an industrial broom.

      Haddas gets off the phone. 

                                  WILL
                    What s with the broom?

                                  HADDAS
                    Mitchell was sweeping up the other 
                    night as I was leaving.  He brushed 
                    one of my shoes by accident.  

                                  WILL
                    Let me guess, bad luck?

                                  HADDAS
                    Very.  Brings imprisonment or 
                    death.  The only way around it is 
                    to spit on the broom, so I bought 
                    it from him and did what I had to 
                    do.  Ridiculous, I know. 

                                  WILL
                    I found a pattern in the big ticket 
                    papers.  And there might be others.

      Will hands him the list, the crosswords and the work he s 
      done drawing out the connections.

      Now Will walks Haddas through it.  

                                  WILL
                    It s not just the repetition.  
                    Three down, two chambers of the 
                      legislative branch,  bicameral,

                    later known as the Grateful Dead 
                    played in San Francisco, but also 
                    Millard Fillmore, lard-ass, know-
                    nothing 13th President.  The 
                      executive.  Four down, would-be 
                    alma mater of felonious record-
                    holding receiver.  Answer:  
                       Marshall  as in Randy Moss, 
                    Marshall University Thundering 
                    Herd.  But also, Thurgood Marshall, 
                    the judicial.  Then, five down, 
                    what do lucky lepidoptera larvae 
                    eat?  Answer,  marsilea 
                      quadrifolia. 

                                  HADDAS
                    Which is?

                                  WILL
                    Four-leaf clover.  Our three 
                    branches of government are here:  
                      legislative, executive and 
                    judicial.

                          (beat)
                    So what, or who, does the fourth 
                    leaf represent?  

      Beat of Haddas studying the pattern.

                    editors.

                                  WILL
                    I ve done my share of crosswords 
                    and I ve never...

                                  HADDAS
                    Usually they re a little more 
                    subtle borrowing from each other. 

      Haddas sets Will s documents on a massive stack of papers.  
      Clearly they ll never get looked at again.

                                  HADDAS
                    Thanks, Will.

      Beat, Will slowly rises, turns to leave, hesitates a last 
      beat, then exits.

      As soon as he s gone, Haddas takes out a piece of paper and 
      starts to hurriedly scribble.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Haddas walks quickly to the far corner office.

      SHOT of an elevator beside Ingram s office as Haddas passes 
      it.  There is no  up  button, just a keyhole.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      KALE INGRAM might remind us of Donald Rumsfeld, icewater in 
      his veins, been at this longer than anyone, his formidable 
      skills only sharpening by the decade.

      Haddas is about to speak when Ingram holds up a finger to 
      wait.  He s watching an updated report about Pendry Goss on a 
        finance-related cable news outlet.

      SHOT on TV of Pendry Goss corporate headquarters on 47th 
      Street.

      SHOT on TV of their valuations starting the day and at

                    It s a thing of beauty.

                                  HADDAS
                    Something in the crossword today.  
                    I ve never seen anything like it.

                                  INGRAM
                    Which paper?

                                  HADDAS
                    All the indicators.  Someone either 
                    didn t expect the pattern to be 
                    caught or wasn t afraid if it was.

      Haddas gives Ingram the list of ten words which is now in his 
      handwriting instead of Will s.

      Ingram scans it so fast it seems impossible he s actually 
      read it.

                                  INGRAM
                    Whose work is this, Daniel?

      He sits at his desk and picks up a generic, half-finished 
        Hallmark-ish  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  card, and shreds it.

      He takes out a note card and WRITES a short note.  We do not

                    Happy birthday.

      Will jokingly shakes the gift.  It s very obviously a book.  
      He removes the wrapping.

      We SEE it s  BEST ROAD FOOD IN AMERICA  a guide to out-of-the-
      way diners off America s highways and godforsaken roads.

                                  WILL
                    If you were in search of a book I 
                    haven t read, you ve succeeded. 

                                  HADDAS 
                    Not an easy feat.  What are your 
                    plans tonight?

                                  WILL
                    What was it the man said about 
                    asking questions you already know 
                    the answer to?  

                                  HADDAS
                    Only kind of question to ask. 

      Haddas now gives Will a sealed envelope.  Will starts to open 
      it but Haddas puts a gentle hand on Will to stop him.

                                  HADDAS 
                    Wait till you re home.

                                  WILL
                          (re: book)
                    Thank you for this.

      Haddas is about to walk away when he decides instead to take 
      a beat right where he is.  

      He pats Will on the shoulder.  

      Beat, Will looks up at him.

      Haddas has a look of pride and approval, almost paternal.  
      Finally, he walks on.  

      Will watches him go, his affection unmistakable.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. EAST VILLAGE - NIGHT
1212

      Walking head down, shielding his face from the cold wind with 
      his collar, Will approaches his building.  He passes an old 
      Norton in shitty condition parked outside.  


      Will climbs his stoop and is about to enter.  He fumbles in 
      his pocket for the keys.

      When he pulls his hand from his pocket he s holding both his 
      keys and the now-crumpled letter from Haddas.

      Will opens the note.  A KEY slides into his palm.  

      He READS the note:   Drive away.  Don t look back.  It s 
      time.  Daniel 

      Will regards the key then looks down the stoop at the Norton.

      He smiles broadly for the first time in a long time.

      He takes out his cell and dials.  It connects.

                                  WILL
                    Your Norton?  Are you crazy, 
                    Daniel?  No way am I keeping this.

                                  HADDAS (O.S.)
                    You re smiling.  I can hear you 
                    smiling.  You re keeping it, Will.  
                    But I should probably show you a 
                    thing or two.  
                                  (MORE)

                    Greenwich tomorrow.  Meet me at the 
                    place.

      ANGLE on Will, eyes on the bike, finally nodding.  


                                  WILL
                    I ll see you there.
                          (beat)
                    Wait, Daniel...

      But Haddas is gone.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. 5:51 TRAIN FROM NEW HAVEN - DAY
1313

      The train is nearing top speed as it approaches the Pelham 
      junction where several lines converge.

      CAMERA crawls up the aisle, panning left and right to show 
      PASSENGERS drinking their morning coffee, reading the 
      newspaper, sending email, a few even talking to one another.

      Long beat where the train seems to be gliding through space 
      and time with an extraordinary smoothness, lolling easily 
      side to side with a calming, appeasing rhythm.

      Then...

      CAMERA slowly rises beside a man in a gray cashmere overcoat 
      finishing the Times crossword.

      CAMERA turns to the window...in time to SEE a train 
      barrelling along a parallel track, moving swiftly toward us 
      at a highly alarming 45 degree angle.


      We instantly know something is very wrong and unavoidable.

      Nearer and nearer, full speed, not braking...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. EISENBERG S - DOWNTOWN - DAY
1414

      Will pulls up and parks.  He s late and hustles inside but 
      doesn t SEE Daniel Haddas.

      Will sits and catches his breath.

      A WAITER sets down a cup of coffee.  Will stirs in sugar.

      Will looks back at the door when he HEARS someone enter but 
      it s not Daniel.

      The waiter watches a TV where we SEE and faintly HEAR CNN.

                                  CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)

                    focused here at home on the needs 
                    of the underprivileged.  

      The anchor suddenly stops and listens to his earpiece.

                                  CNN ANCHOR  (ON TV)
                    I m being told there are reports of 
                    a train crash just moments ago.

      The waiter turns up the volume.

                                  CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)
                    The New Haven line of the Metro-
                    North...

      CLOSE on Will, head whipping up to the TV in time to SEE 
      FOOTAGE appear on SCREEN:  the crash, hell on earth, flames 
      and billowing plumes of black smoke rising from the wreckage.  

                                  WILL
                    Please, God.

      Will stands and starts to back away.

                                  WILL
                    Please, no...

      Will reaches the door and exits out onto the 

      SIDEWALK 

      where he s swallowed up by a tide of strangers, his face 
      contorted with panic and helplessness.

      OVERHEAD SHOT of Will, running against the current of the 
      crowd.


                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. FAIRFIELD CEMETERY - DAY
1515

      A storm has just passed, another one threatens in the 
      distance.  The sky crackles with electricity. 

      A large turnout of mourners has come for the funeral of 
      Daniel Haddas, including Miles, Bob, Tanya and Victoria.  

      This is one of the oldest cemeteries in the state with 
      sloping verdant hills and huge mature tree canopies.  

      We join the service as Kale Ingram is eulogizing Haddas.

      CAMERA locates Will, head down, in the back row of mourners.  
      A shade s come down over his eyes, a buffer to keep at arm s 
      length a reality too painful to process.

                                  INGRAM
                      ...devoted husband to Joan, father 
                    to Anna, Kevin and Natalie, God 
                    rest her soul.  Grandfather to 
                    eleven who all adored him.

      As Ingram speaks, Maggie gazes steadfastly at Will.  

                                  INGRAM
                    Daniel had an ingenious, nimble 
                    mind but what I admired most about 
                    my friend was his loyalty.


      CAMERA locates a small cluster of graves behind Ingram 
      adjacent to Haddas s plot.  A black tarp is covering them for 
      the service.  Half a gravestone, flush with the grass, can be 
      seen beneath the tarp.  

      Will slowly lifts his eyes in Ingram s direction, then 
      regards the hole in the earth where Haddas will be buried.  
      He looks heartbroken, but more than that, he looks angry.

                                  INGRAM
                    We all slept a little better 
                    knowing someone with his integrity 
                    and endurance was in our lives.

      Will releases his stare from the covered graves and Ingram.  
      His eyes meet Maggie s.  She looks away.

                    Daniel was an affirming flame for

      EXT. FAIRFIELD CEMETERY - AFTER THE FUNERAL
1616

      The mourners stream away from the funeral.  Will waits his 
      turn to pay his respects to HADDAS S WIDOW.  

      She is still in shock, just going through the motions.  

      When it s Will s turn and he steps up, she snaps to life, 
      reacting uncensored, reaching out and embracing him.

                                  HADDAS S WIDOW
                    Will...

      She cries into him and squeezes him.

                                  WILL
                    I know.

      She doesn t ease her grip.

                                  WILL
                    I know.

      Will is patient and strong for her. 

                                  WILL
                    I ll make sure all of his things 
                    get to you safely.

      Haddas s widow regards Will with even more sympathy than he 
      has in his eyes for her.  She reluctantly lets go and 
      composes herself with as deep a breath as she can manage.

      Will moves away from her.  

      Maggie, who has kept her distance to this point, joins him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m so sorry, Will.  

                                  WILL
                    So am I.

      They SEE Ingram approaching with his conservative, prim WIFE.  
      Ingram steps away from her to talk to Will.

                    I ll catch up.

      Maggie walks off.

                                  INGRAM
                    We have something pressing to 
                    discuss, Will.  Daniel s position 
                    is too integral to leave open, even 
                    for the week or month good decorum 
                    would demand. 

      Ingram glances at Maggie, taking her time sauntering away and 
      frequently looking back at them with curiosity.  When she 
      SEES Ingram s noticed her, she picks up her pace.

                                  INGRAM
                    I know the full scope of your 
                    history with Daniel.  I ve always 
                    known.  So while I d like to put 
                    off this conversation, I can t.  
                    Those I answer to, upstairs and 
                      elsewhere, are eager for 
                      resolution.  

      Ingram regards Will, confirming for a last beat what he s 
      about to proffer.

                                  INGRAM
                    Knowing how closely you worked with 
                    Daniel, I assume you know the 
                    breadth of his responsibilities.


      Will looks Ingram in the eye and realizes what s coming.  

                                  INGRAM
                    I d like you to step into his 
                    position.

      Will shakes his head.

                                  WILL
                    I d say I m better off staying 
                    where I am, but I don t even 
                    believe that s true anymore.  Might 
                    be best for me to leave.

                    answer, and your resignation.

      Ingram doesn t wait for Will s reply.  He rejoins his wife.  

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DUSK
1717

      The sun sets, the city exhales, the orange-red ripples on the 
      river turn gray.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AMERICAN POLICY INSTITUTE - THE NEXT DAY
1818

      CLOSE on Will as he enters, dazed and shaken, the razor 
        intelligence in his eyes dulled.  Head down, he starts toward 
      his office.

      Just as he does every day, he passes Miles Fiedler, then Bob 
      Test, Victoria and Tanya but today he doesn t slow to talk.  
      His anguish is too raw, too intense. 

      Will finally gets to his office where Maggie is waiting. 

      She wants to say something to comfort him, she wants to help, 
      but she doesn t have the chance.


      He enters his office and shuts the door behind him.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. AMERICAN POLICY INSTITUTE - NIGHT
1919

      Time has passed.  Quieter now.  It appears that everyone we 
      know has left for the day, including Maggie.


      Will comes out of his office and is about to leave when he 
      HEARS a single phone ringing down the corridor.

      He walks on for a beat but can t shake that single, shrill 
      ring stubbornly sounding off, like Satan mouthing off to God.

      Several rings, then a brief respite, then ringing again.  

      Finally...

      Will turns and SEES it s coming from Daniel Haddas s office.

      The volume rises and rises in Will s head until he can t 
      ignore it.

      He bounds down the corridor and enters 

      HADDAS S OFFICE

      where he picks up the receiver and is about to slam it back 
      down when he HEARS...

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Knight to king s bishop three.

      Beat, Will is silent.

                                  VOICE
                    Knight to king s bishop three.

                                  WILL
                    Who is this?

      Beat.  Then...

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    He s dead, isn t he?
                          (beat)
                    Why?

                                  WILL
                    Who is this?

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    I asked why.

                                  WILL
                    It was an accident...

      The line goes dead.  

      Beat, then Will wakens Haddas s computer and does a quick 
      system search for  CHESS  

      Nothing comes up.

      Will gets up and pulls the blinds, then starts looking around 
      the office.  As many times as he s been here, he s trying to 
      see it with new eyes.

      Will starts in a corner and moves around the room s 
      perimeter.  He moves quickly but carefully.  He SEES nothing 
      that catches his eye.

      CAMERA slips between the blinds to SEE Kale Ingram exiting 
      his office and starting to walk this way.

      Back to Will, going through Haddas s file cabinets, drawers 
      and armoire.  

      Whatever he s looking for, he s not finding it.

      CAMERA moves back to the doorway to SEE Ingram approaching.

      He s just a few feet away, when he realizes he s forgotten 
      something and heads back to his office.  

      Back to Will taking a beat to stop, shut his eyes and then 
      open them again.

      CLOSE on him as he glances around the room.

      Something catches his attention...a globe fitted and sunk 
      into an antique wooden table.  

      Will SEES a HOOK keeping the globe shut.

      He unlatches the hook and opens the globe.  

      Inside, he finds a chess board.  The intricately hand-carved 
      pieces are arranged in the middle of a game.

      Will picks up a pawn and SEES initials carved into the 
      bottom:   EB 

                                  WILL
                    EB.  EB.  EB.
                          (eyes flare, he knows)

                    E...B...

      Will pockets the pawn, shuts and latches the globe, then 
      steps out of Haddas s office into the 

      CORRIDOR

      and walks rapidly away.

      CAMERA watches him go for a quick beat, then rotates around 
      to find Kale Ingram standing there.  

      Ingram saw Will exit Haddas s office.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. HOME OF DR. ED BANCROFT - ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY - NIGHT
2020

      Soaked by a bloated rain, Will pulls up to an address in an 
        eviscerated, abandoned neighborhood.  It s a dilapidated 
      hovel, bars on the windows and a heavy steel door in front.

      Before Will can knock, the inner door swings open and DR. ED 
      BANCROFT, 60, triple Ph.D., stands in a stained undershirt, 
      boxer shorts and robe, holding an oversized bowl of cereal.  

                                  WILL
                    Ed?

      Ed doesn t respond.  Instead, he takes a big bite and chews.

                                  WILL
                    Are you Ed Bancroft?

      From his disheveled appearance, the lucidity and conviction 
      in his voice are startling.  

                                  ED
                    What did Daniel tell you about me?

                                  WILL
                    You were among the brightest in a 
                    building full of bright people.  
                    Trusted.  Keys to the kingdom...
                          (beat)
                    Ed, can I come in?

                                  ED
                    Sure.

      But instead of letting Will in, Ed double-bolts the door.

                                  ED
                    Keys to the kingdom.  And then...

                                  WILL 
                    You got confused.  Things 
                      unravelled.

                                  ED
                    Daniel never would ve said that.  
                    Someone else spoke those words.  
                    You believe everything you hear?  
                    Not as advertised.  Not at all.  
                    You were supposed to be sharp. 
                    That s what he told me.  Things 
                    didn t unravel, Will.  I started 
                      comprehending.

                                  WILL
                      Comprehending what?

      He unlocks the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOME OF ED BANCROFT - EVENING
2121

      Will enters the living room which has bric-a-brac and debris 
      a foot thick on the floor.  The only furniture in the place 
      is a La-Z-Boy recliner covered in cat fur.  

      On the tiny kitchen counter, we SEE twenty oversize 
        prescription bottles.

      Will SEES a chess board on the dining room table.

      Ed SEES Will taking note of it.

                                  ED
                    A month or two, a year or two.  
                    Time s a whore.  As for whom I was 
                    playing, who do any of us ever 
                    contend with?

                                  WILL 
                    What were you comprehending, Ed?

                                  ED
                    The work we do:  genesis, progress, 
                      judgement.  Who is it used by?

                                  WILL 
                    Our employers.

                                  ED
                    You do know they hide in plain 
                    view, don t you?  

                                  WILL 
                    Who s  they? 

                                  ED 
                    They?  They s them!  What s the 
                    matter with you?

      Ed violently wipes his hand across the chess board, 
      scattering the pieces.

                                  WILL
                    Nice talking to you, Ed.

      Will starts for the door.

                                  ED
                    They must ve exposed themselves.  
                    Daniel must ve made a connection so 
                    clean they had to act.

      Will stops.

                                  WILL
                    It was a train wreck.  Turn on the 
                    TV, read the paper.  You ll see 
                    Daniel wasn t the only one lost.


                                  ED
                    Train wreck, train wreck, so much 
                      collateral damage, so much grief, 
                    no one would even dream it was all 
                    to silence one man.
                          (beat)
                    You do know they hide in plain 
                    view...

      Ed suddenly quiets, steps back and sinks into his recliner.  
      Deep in the cushions, he looks small, lost and vulnerable.

                                  ED 
                    It s too much.  It s just too much.

      Ed s voice drifts off, he averts his eyes.

                                  ED
                    All the friends I had there, only 
                    one stayed in touch, came by, tried 
                    to keep one of my feet in the real 
                    world, reminded me who I was.  


      ANGLE on Will, his frustration with Ed turning to sympathy.

                                  WILL
                    Goodbye, Ed.

      Ed is still too emotional to face Will.

      Will exits.  The moon has risen, drawing Will s nocturnal 
      shadow on the broken sidewalk.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                  ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

      INT. WILL S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING
2222

      Will is sprawled out on the couch, an open book on his chest 
      rising and falling with his breath.

      CAMERA arrives at his face, eyes closed, it looks like he s 
      finally sleeping.

      Hold this for a beat, then his eyes flutter open.  He wasn t 
      sleeping, not even close.

      He sits up, the book sliding to the ground.  He drops his 
      head to his chest, runs his hands through his hair.  

      CAMERA closes on his face and we SEE the effects of his 
      worsening insomnia.  

      His skin is pallid, eyes bloodshot and dry, but more than 
      these physical effects, it s his spirit that s fatigued.

      TIME CUT:

      Will sitting at his desk.  The same mountain of material and 
      work waits for his attention but he s staring straight ahead, 
      not even daydreaming, just lost.  

      Beat, then his eyes fall on the book Haddas gave him  BEST 
      ROAD FOOD IN AMERICA 

      Will opens it, flips around and then puts it back down.

      TIME CUT:

      WILL S POV...


      Victoria and Tanya appear in his doorway.  We SEE them 
      talking but we HEAR nothing.

      Beat, then they walk away.

      Bob Test comes after them.  We SEE him offer a few platitudes 
      but again HEAR nothing.

      TIME CUT:

      WILL S POV...

      Miles Fiedler knocks on the door and starts to talk but again 
      we HEAR nothing.  After a beat, he walks away.

      TIME CUT:

      End of the workday.  Will has not moved.  

      We SEE Maggie in the doorway talking but we don t hear her 
      for a beat.  Finally...

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will?

                                  WILL
                          (without looking up)
                      Goodnight, Maggie.

      CLOSE on Maggie, wishing she could say something to comfort 
      him but knowing that s impossible.  Beat, then she forces 
      herself to walk away. 

      TIME CUT:

      Night.

      After twelve hours seated without moving, and still no closer 
      to an answer of how or why this could happen, Will suddenly 
      stands and exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT - NIGHT
2323

      START with a view of a small town, lights twinkling beneath a 
      starless black sky.

      ROTATE to find Will on the 

      PLATFORM

      where we last saw Daniel Haddas alive.

      Will lowers his head and retraces Daniel s steps toward the 
      westbound line, the same steps he took every day, creature of 
      habit that he was.

      Will starts to take a step forward but then keeps his foot 
      aloft when he looks down at the concrete and SEES a crack.

      He walks to the edge of the platform.  No sign of a train in 
      either direction.

      He looks down the platform, clear to the other end, where he 
      SEES a BUSINESSMAN apparently waiting for his train.  The man 
      is looking right back at Will beneath a floodlight.

      Something about this businessman seems familiar.  His 
      exceptionally ordinary face.  Might this be the deliveryman 
      watching Will at the start?  We don t get a long enough look 
      to be sure.

      The businessman takes a step back and is swallowed up by 
      shadows.

      Beat where the silence and stillness become less calming and  
        increasingly unsettling.

      CLOSE on Will, glancing all around him, again in search of 
      some kind of answer and again coming up empty.  At last, he s 
      done trying.  He crosses the platform and heads down a flight 
      of stairs to the gravel

      PARKING LOT

      where he starts toward his motorcycle.

      Something makes him abruptly stop. 

      SHOT of the old, maroon Volvo sedan we saw in the parking lot 
      across from the American Policy Institute.  It s in decent 
      shape for its age and astronomically high mileage.  This is 
      Daniel Haddas s car, orphaned here the morning he died.

      Will approaches and bends down to look through the window.  

      SHOT inside the car, not the tidiest interior, filled with 
      documents, CDs and cassettes, a Buddha on the dash, a 
        dreamcatcher hanging from the rearview mirror.


      A small grin creases Will s face.

      He stands up straight again.

      There, at the far end of the parking lot, Will is surprised 
      to SEE the businessman from the platform watching him.

      ANGLE on Will, still more curious than suspicious. 

      Beat, then the businessman gets in a car and pulls out of the 
      parking lot.

      Now Will looks back down at Haddas s Volvo and SEES the 
      driver s door is unlocked.

      He opens it and leans inside.

      Will SEES a photo pinned to the sun visor by a garage opener. 

      He slides the photo out.

      Will holds it up and regards it. 

      We glimpse the picture only for a split second, just long 
      enough to know that it is a Haddas family portrait with 
      Daniel in the middle.  

                                  WILL
                    Hi, Daniel.

      Will pockets the photo, shuts the door and starts away.

      CLOSE on him as he walks toward his bike.  

      Next to Will, we SEE ascending parking space numbers painted 
      on the concrete wall.

      We SEE:  16 (occupied), 17 (occupied), 18 (empty), 19 
      (occupied), 20 (empty), 21 (empty)...

      ANGLE on Will, eyes flaring wide.

      He faces the concrete wall, then turns and starts back toward 
      Haddas s car. 

      His steps quicken.  He breaks into a run.

      We SEE the descending parking space numbers:  21, 20, 19, 18, 
      17, 16...15...14...


      PULL BACK and reveal Will is standing at space 13...where 
      Daniel Haddas s car is parked.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MAGGIE S APARTMENT - NIGHT
2424

      Maggie answers her door, half-asleep, and finds Will has come 
      to see her.  She couldn t possibly look more surprised.

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry to wake you...  

      Will moves past her into the small, brightly colored 
      apartment that straddles a fine line between lived-in cozy 
      and bursting at the seams.

                                  WILL
                    I didn t know where to go.

      Will speaks in a highly animated voice, almost manic, nothing 
      like we ve heard from him before.

                                  WILL 
                    I know how this is going to sound, 
                    but all the rituals, his rituals, 
                    how superstitious he was... 

                                  MAGGIE
                    Slow down.  

                                  WILL
                    His biggest phobia by far was the 
                    number 13.  Respected and feared 
                    it, constantly watched out for it.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will, can you lower your voice?

                                  WILL
                    He d never step on an elevator, 
                    boat, taxi or train whose serial 
                    number started or ended with 13, 
                    was divisible by 13, aggregated to 
                    13, was divisible by 13...  

                                  MAGGIE
                    Your voice, Will.

                                  WILL
                    His car hasn t been retrieved yet.  
                    It s still in the parking lot at 
                    the train depot where he left it.
                          (hesitates, then)
                    Where he supposedly left it.

                                  MAGGIE
                      Supposedly?

                                  WILL
                    His car is parked in spot 13.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    Maybe he didn t notice the number.

                                  WILL
                    He saw the number.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Maybe he needed to get to work, saw 
                    the train pulling up and it was the 
                    only space open.


                                  WILL
                    There is no way Daniel Haddas would 
                    park there.

                                  MAGGIE
                    If Daniel didn t park there...

                                  WILL
                    He never boarded that train. 

                                  MAGGIE
                    But his remains were identified.

                                  WILL
                    I know...

                                  MAGGIE
                    So how were they found there in the 
                    wreckage?

                                  WILL
                    I don t know.  I don t know.  I 
                    don t know.

                                  MAGGIE
                    What happened was horrible.  But 
                    Daniel s gone.  He boarded the 
                    train and it crashed.  He died 
                    along with 36 strangers.  Maybe 
                    there is no why.

                                  WILL
                    There s always a why.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Will...

                                  WILL
                    You just don t understand.

      Maggie regards him.  She intuitively knows there s something 
      more, and knows it s beyond reach.

                                  MAGGIE
                    How long has it been since you ve 
                    had a good night s sleep?

                                  WILL
                    I can t remember.

                                  MAGGIE
                    You need to rest.

      Will nods and lowers his head. 

                                  MAGGIE
                    This is hard.

                    Yeah.

      Beat, then Will looks up at her.

      Maggie reaches out and guides a rope of hair out of his eyes, 
      a tender gesture she s been wanting to make for years.

      Their close proximity and his broken down vulnerability 
      suddenly turn this beat intimate and volatile.

                                  KYLE (O.C.)
                    Mommy?

      They both turn to find Maggie s 5 year-old daughter, KYLE, 
      clutching her stuffed clown.  Maggie walks over and picks her 
      up.  Kyle buries her face in Maggie s neck.


      ANGLE on Will, utterly stunned.  He starts to back away.

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry.

      He quickly moves to the door and exits.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Will sits down on Maggie s stoop.

      He stuffs a hand into a pocket and draws out Haddas s 
      birthday note and reads:   Drive away.  Don t look back.  
      It s time.  Daniel 

      Beat, then Will puts it away and gets on his motorcycle.  

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                  ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      EXT. NEW YORK CITY - MORNING
2626

      The sun is rising fast, sending newborn shadows creeping up 
      the sides of skyscrapers and drawn over faces in the street.  
      A light unrivaled in its boundless possibilities.


                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AMERICAN POLICY INSTITUTE - MORNING
2727

      Things are back to normal, a busy din of activity.  Will 
      takes the usual route to his office.  

      Will enters, says brief hellos to Fiedler, Test, Victoria and 
      Tanya but keeps moving.

      Ahead, he SEES Maggie.


      She s dressed a little more casually than we ve seen, her 
        shoulder-length hair down.  She looks beautiful.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Did you get any rest?

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry about last night.  Is 
                    your daughter...

                                  MAGGIE
                    She s fine. 

      Maggie notices a sealed envelope in Will s hand.

                                  MAGGIE 
                    What s that?

                                  WILL
                    My resignation.

      This knocks the wind out of Maggie.

                                  WILL
                    There s nothing to worry about, 
                    Maggie.  I ll be gone but your life 
                    won t change much.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    You don t call working for Bob Test

                    You know they ll put him in 
                    Daniel s job the minute you turn it

                    Away.  I m going away.

      Maggie recovers enough to offer a bluffing nod.

      Will enters his office.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. RUMOHR BEACH COTTAGE - MORNING
2828

      Life is returning to a semblance of normal for the Rumohr 
      family.  The KIDS, other FAMILY MEMBERS and several FRIENDS 
      are out playing in the sun, collecting shells and sea-worn 
      glass.  A spread of fine food and wine is laid out.  The 
      period of mourning seems to be coming to a close.  

      But there is no sign of the widow.

      CAMERA angles up to the window Hugh Rumohr stood in before 
      killing himself.

      CLOSE on that window, which is open, and ENTER into the 

      MASTER BEDROOM 

      where we find Katherine on her bed taking her time looking 
      through scrapbooks and drinking a cup of tea.

      CLOSE on her, the ache of each photo like spreading salt in 
      her wound.

      The door opens just a crack.

                                  KATHERINE
                    Who s that?

      Nothing.  Then the door moves again.  


      Charlie Rumohr appears and stands in place.

                                  KATHERINE
                    Hi, there.  Are you having fun?
                          (Charlie nods)
                    Can I get you anything?

                                    KATHERINE(CONT'D)

                          (Charlie shakes his head)
                    Can I have a kiss?

      He nods and comes over to her.  She leans down and kisses him 
      on both cheeks.  He kisses her back.

                                  KATHERINE
                    That is the sweetest kiss in the 
                    world, did you know that?

      He nods and starts to walk away but then turns back.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Oh... 

      Katherine still has a smile on her face when Charlie digs a 
      hand into his pocket and pulls something out.  We don t see 
      what it is.

      He extends his hand to hers.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Poppie said to give you this.

      Katherine plays along and offers her hand.


      Charlie s hand covers hers.  

      STOP MOTION as he pulls it away and we REVEAL a small, 
      engraved note card in a sealed envelope.  It is from Hugh and 
      Katherine Rumohr s stationary.  

      Katherine knits her brow just the smallest bit and opens the 
      envelope.

      She pulls out the folded note card and opens it to find...the 
      brittle, dried up four-leaf clover.

      ANGLE on Katherine, gasping, her heart skipping a beat.  

      She manages to smile for Charlie.

                                  KATHERINE
                    Thank you, sweetheart.

      Charlie runs out of the room.

      Katherine regards the clover in her palm.  She gets up and 
      walks over to the fire.

      CLOSE on her, a fearsome, irrevocable expression as the 
      petals burn.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. DAYS INN - INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA - DAY
2929

      ESTABLISH a cheap-ass airport hotel with meager convention 
      facilities.  

      We HEAR the roar of a 747 taking off from very nearby.

      ANGLE up to the sky, snow falling from black clouds.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CAMERA moves slowly down a hallway with ornate, stained 
      carpet to a bank of conference rooms, none of which are 
      occupied except the last one.


      There is an eerie quality to the silence here.  The only 
      sound is heated air pumped from ventilation shafts.  

      The art on the walls depicts duck and fox hunts, all of it  
      mass-produced and brutal.

      Finally, we come to the last conference room where an 
      aluminum tripod displays a flimsy cardboard sign which reads:  
       WELCOME  with a smile face in the  O 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Six people, different backgrounds, different hometowns, but 
      their destination, this table, is all that matters.  

      These are the TRUSTEES, appointed for life.

      A few are already seated, a few are standing at a buffet of 
      orange juice from concentrate, burnt coffee, nitrate-filled 
      muffins and taste-free melon.


      They are all talking, laughing, glad to see one another.  
      Some show off pictures of family, some of pets.  These people 
      have known each other a long time.

      Without any prompt, the group quiets, those at the buffet 
      find their seats and the business of the day gets under way.

      ANTHONY PRICE, 48, six four, ruggedly handsome, more God than 
      mortal, looks down the table and starts.

                                  PRICE
                    As anticipated, Pendry Goss should 
                    flatline before today s closing.  
                    We re commissioning an autopsy 
                    study in the morning.  Safe to say, 
                    this is one white paper that should 
                    make for some entertaining reading.  
                    I ll have them expedite.  

      Next is YVONNE TAYLOR, 50, a voluptuous brunette, loud 
      dresser, mind sharp as a boxcutter.

                                  YVONNE
                    The analyst who found the crossword 
                    design, Daniel Haddas is his name.  
                    He s been reassigned.

      DR. THOMAS STERN, 65, has a tan from Palm Springs and an 
      unlit pipe clacking softly in his honey-colored teeth. 


                                  STERN
                    And his replacement?

                                  YVONNE
                    Someone s been identified. 

      The youngest of the group, 46 year-old DANA WHITESIDE from 
      the Chicago suburbs, speaks up.  

                                  WHITESIDE
                    What about the widow?

                                  YVONNE
                    For Hugh s audacity she deserves...

      Yvonne is cut off by BLAKE BROBITH, African-American, halo of 
      gray hair, a jolly face you expect to smile but never does.  

                                    BROBITH
                    We let her be.

      Not another word is needed for consensus to be reached.  All 
      agree, Yvonne shrugging and relenting last.

      The oldest at the table, WARREN SILLIMAN, 91, leans forward.  
      His thinking is graced by a keen, long view of history.

      He coughs.  He s about to start talking again but another 
      cough stops him.  This evolves into a locomotive wheeze.  He 
      clumsily pours himself a glass of water.

      He waves at the group to continue on.  

      After a beat...

                                    YVONNNE
                    We ve gotten some clarification on

      Maggie KNOCKS in Will s doorway.


                                  MAGGIE
                    He s ready.

                                  WILL
                    Thanks.

      Will walks out of his office and starts down the 

      CORRIDOR

      toward Ingram s office.

      As he passes Daniel Haddas s office, he glances in to find 
      MOVERS quickly and sloppily packing up his belongings.

      SHOT of a mover throwing the broom Will noticed early on into 
      a garbage bag.

      CLOSE on Will, deeply upset, enraged, by the lack of care the 
      movers are taking and by the simple fact that Haddas is gone 
      for good.

      SHOT of Will fingering the resignation envelope as he 
      approaches Ingram s office.

      Just before entering, he slips it into his jacket pocket.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. OFFICE OF KALE INGRAM - DAY

      Will enters.  

                                  INGRAM
                    Apologies again for the lack of 
                    decorum.  They just won t wait.

      Ingram gets up and comes around his desk.

                                  INGRAM
                    I need your answer.

      Will slides his hand into his jacket pocket.

      ANGLE on Will, vengeance in his heart, studying Ingram.

      Finally, Will takes his hand out of his jacket without the 
      envelope and offers it to Ingram.

      Ingram shakes his hand.

                                  INGRAM
                    What changed your mind?

      Ingram studies Will, concludes he can still be trusted.

                                  INGRAM
                    You know, I don t care.  Let s 
                    introduce you upstairs.

      FOLLOW them out into the


      CORRIDOR

      where they head toward the elevator.

      CAMERA is tight on Will.  Behind him as he walks, we SEE 
      STAFFERS turn and stare.

      Will and Ingram arrive at the elevator.  Ingram fits a key 
      into the lock and turns it.  

      The doors open.

      Ingram steps aside for Will.

      Will looks Ingram in the eyes, then boards.

      Ingram takes a step forward but then stops and doesn t enter.

      ANGLE on Will, surprised and confused.

      Ingram locks eyes with Will as the doors close.

      CLOSE on Will as the elevator starts to ascend.  

      Hold this beat for a solid five count, interminable.

      SHOT of the stress building on Will s face.

      Finally, the elevator reaches its destination.

      Just as the doors are about to open...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.
