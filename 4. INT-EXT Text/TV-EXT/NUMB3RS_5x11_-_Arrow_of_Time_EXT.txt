      bridging some shots, creating a  sort of vision: )

      AIR VENT --

      which is kicked out... then THREE MEN climb out. GRAY, lanky, 
      RAFE, tattoos and jailhouse muscle ...

      ... and BUCK WINTERS. Two years older than we last saw him, 
      and three decades harder. He passes through a MAKESHIFT ROPE 
      LADDER (made out of dental floss) and a BLANKET.

      The three men move along the shadows... dancing the crosses 
      of the searchlights...

      THE PRISON WALL --

      Where Gray swings the weighted end of the rope ladder in 
      wider and wider arcs...

      ... then HURLS it up; the anchor catches on the top of the 
      wall. 

      THE THREE MEN --

      ... and then they re pulling up the ladder... they drop it 
      over the other side and Gray is the first down... 

      As Buck climbs over, then Rafe --

      THE SEARCHLIGHT

      kisses his silhouette --


      Buck, Gray, and Rafe scramble off the wall and away... 


      The trio rises up over the hill, as the PRISON, in the 
      background, comes alive with SIRENS and LIGHTS... 

      ... sprinting toward a  75 El Dorado, waiting for them.

      door -- 

      -- revealing CHANGES OF CLOTHES inside... A FAST FOOD TRAY 
      sitting on the front seat... 

      Gray jumps in as Buck scrambles around to ride shotgun, Rafe 
      jumps in back -- the men grabbing food, starting to peel away

      Parked by the side of the road -- TWO SHERIFFS look at the

      A CRIME SCENE now -- sheriffs, U.S. Marshals, prison guards, 
      cars coming and going. 

      DAVID AND LIZ --

                    simply points in the direction of 
                      expansion; if the universe decides to 
                    contract one day... well...
