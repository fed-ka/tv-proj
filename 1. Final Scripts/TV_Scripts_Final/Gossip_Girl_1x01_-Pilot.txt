                                      COLD OPEN

      FADE IN:

      MANHATTAN SKYLINE  

      Even from a distance, it s clear.  You could get in a lot of 
      trouble in this city.  And hurtling towards it is

      AN AMTRAK TRAIN

      Over this we HEAR the voice of GOD.  Or GOD to the teenagers 
      of the Upper East Side.  The voice of GOSSIP GIRL.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Spotted on the New Haven Line.  
                    Headed towards Manhattan.  An 
                    eerily beautiful blonde...

      INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- MAGIC HOUR

      A FACE pressed against the glass.  One of the most beautiful 
      faces you ve ever seen.  But the first thing you notice is 
      the soulfulness behind this girl s gaze.  Meet --

      SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN, 17.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Long pale hair.  Dark blue eyes.  
                    Is it possible.  Is Serena back?

      Another GIRL, 17, walks down the aisle.  Then she sees 
      Serena.  Freezes, staring.  Like she s seen a movie star.  
      Serena turns - sensing she s being watched.  The GIRL moves 
      quickly.  Head down.  But as she goes, she whips out her 

      SIDEKICK.  Cop shows have guns.  Medical shows have scalpels.  
      This show has SIDEKICKS.  The girl s thumbs fly across the 
      keys.  She hits SEND:

      VARIOUS SHOTS OF --

      SIDEKICKS.  LAPTOPS.  CELL PHONES.  TEENAGERS passing a VIRUS 
      OF GOSSIP. From CENTRAL PARK to the shops of MADISON AVENUE.  
      All typing as fast as they can:

      -- SDVW HEADED TO CITY?!!

      -- 4 REALS? OMG!!  WHY?

      -- 1ST SIGHTING IN A YR!!!  SOUND ALARMS!  LOL!                                                                                      2.



      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- POWDER ROOM -- NIGHT

      This last message buzzes on a BEDAZZLED SIDEKICK.

      A face pops up in the mirror.  

      BLAIR WALDORF, 17.

      Pretty.  But will never feel beautiful enough.  The sink 
      runs.  She wipes saliva from her lips.  Rinses with 
      mouthwash.  A ritual.  Checks her SIDEKICK on the counter. 

      Her eyes narrow.  She inhales sharply.  A siren has just 
      sounded in this girl s soul.  She exits into -- 

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- DRAWING ROOM -- NIGHT

      A SOCIETY PARTY in full swing.  STAFF with trays of CHABLIS 
      wait on NYC s wealthiest, most dysfunctional DENIZENS.

      Blair heads into the party -- passing -- 

      ELEANOR WALDORF, Blair s mother.  Regal.  Impeccably dressed 
      and preserved.  The center of the party.  With other WOMEN.

                                    ELEANOR 
                    Blair, sweetie, if you re going to 
                    wear one of my designs, tell me.  
                    The slip underneath completely 
                    fights the lines.

                                  BLAIR
                          (forces a smile)
                    Thanks, Mom.  Great party...

      Blair keeps moving -- seeing across the room --

      NATE ARCHIBALD, 17.

      Handsome.  Most popular guy on the Upper East Side.  External 
      confidence hides the fact that deep down, he senses that he 
      doesn t deserve any of it -- or maybe even want it.  He s 
      with his father - HOWIE  THE CAPTAIN  ARCHIBALD.  Always with 
      a SCOTCH in hand.  And some other ADULTS.

                                  HIGH SOCIETY MAN
                    So, Nate.  Started thinking about 
                    college?

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                    Well, I m a Dartmouth man. 

      Nate takes a beat.  Aren t they asking him?                                                                                      3.



                                  NATE
                    Yes.  Dad s always spoken highly of 
                      Dartmouth.  But I d also love to 
                    look out West -- USC or UCLA --

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                    His mother doesn t want to hear 
                    about it.  Dartmouth is far enough 
                    away for her.

                                  NATE
                          (swallows, then smiles)
                    Dartmouth is my first choice.

      The Captain grins.  That s my boy.  Blair grabs Nate.

                                  BLAIR
                    Hey, Nate.  Can I borrow you?  
                          (to Howie)
                    Excuse me Captain.

                                  NATE
                    Uh, sure.  What s up --

      But Blair is already dragging Nate away.  Passing a group of 
      kids by the bar.  One of them is --

      CHUCK BASS, 17.  Future Senator or cautionary tale.  With two 
      girls in tow, KATY and ISABEL, 17.  Rosencrantz and 
        Guilderstern in Jimmy Choos.  Drinks in hand.

                                  CHUCK
                    Nathaniel - any interest in some 
                    fresh air?

      Chuck mimes smoking a joint.  

                                  NATE
                    When I get back?

                                  BLAIR
                          (naughty smile)
                    If he gets back.

      The other kids react.  Laugh. 

                        KATYISABEL
      Omigod.  How scandalous!What a slut!  We love you!

                                  CHUCK
                          (raises his GLASS)
                    To Nate.  About to have a much 
                    better time than the rest of us.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      4.

                                  CHUCK (CONT'D)
                          (as the couple moves off)
                    Wonder what brought that on?...

      Chuck gets another drink. Suddenly Katy and Isabel feel their 
      purses BUZZ.  They pull out their SIDEKICKS.  And eyes widen.

                                  KATY 
                    Omigod.  You ll never believe 
                    what s on Gossip Girl --

                                  ISABEL
                          (reading)
                    Some Dalton girl says she saw 
                    Serena on the train.  But it s 
                    probably not even her.

                                  CHUCK
                    Let s hope it is.  Things were 
                    starting to get boring around here.

      The girls raise eyebrows -- begin typing away.  And we --

      REVERSE MONTAGE.  The earlier GOSSIP CHAIN going backwards.  
      Laptops and cell phones and Sidekicks working overtime.

      INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- EVENING

      The GIRL who started it all gets a TEXT:

      -- PROVE IT!

      The train is pulling into the station.  Serena makes her way 
      down the aisle with the crowd.  The girl raises her phone.  
      Hits the CAMERA button. Serena turns and:

      FLASH!  

      INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- PLATFORMS 

      As one train pulls in another readies to leave.  Before it 
      stands the HUMPHREY FAMILY.  As different from stuffy uptown 
      society as possible.  Hip and bohemian.

      The mom, ALISON, late 30s, is hugging her kids.  DAN, 17, 
      will be fine when he gets to college.  That is little 
      consolation today.  JENNY, 15, isn t waiting for college.  
      Wants to be popular now.

                                  ALISON
                    I m sorry I have to do this.  Dan - 
                    keep an eye on your sister.  I m 
                    just a phone call away, Jenny.
                          (one final hug)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      5.

                                  ALISON (CONT'D)
                    God, I didn t realize leaving was 
                    going to be this hard.

      Her husband, RUFUS, shaggy but sweet, stands behind her.  

                                  RUFUS
                    Well, then maybe you shouldn t go.
                          (Alison shoots him a look)
                    Right.  Probably a little late for 
                    that talk.

      The train behind them WHEEZES into gear.  People hurry on.  
      Alison waves to her family.  They wave back, numb.  She gets 
      on the train.  Rufus stands with his arms around his kids.  

      They watch Alison through the window.  As the train starts to 
      pull away, Rufus puts on a brave face.

                                  RUFUS (CONT D)
                    Let s go home.  I m cooking.
                          (off their looks)
                    My first official meal as a single 
                    dad.  You want my famous grilled 
                    cheese?  Or my slightly less 
                    renowned mac and cheese?

      Rufus and Jenny start to walk away.  Dan remains.  Looks back 
      at his mom s train - and then sees behind it --

      ANOTHER PLATFORM.

      With a train that has just arrived.  And stepping off that 
      train is SERENA.  Bags in hand.  Dan is frozen.   

                                  DAN
                    Jenny... you re not going to 
                    believe this!

      As he watches Serena disappear into the CROWD...

      INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- TERMINAL

      Serena emerges from the escalator.  Looks around expectantly 
      for a familiar face in the THRONGS.  Finds a CHAUFFEUR with a 
      sign: VAN DER WOODSEN.  She sighs... must be home.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Rumors are flying.  And who can 
                    blame us?

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- BLAIR S ROOM -- NIGHT

      The door BANGS open.  Blair pulls Nate inside.  Kissing him 
      hungrily.  She pushes him toward the bed.                                                                                      6.



                                  BLAIR
                    I want to do this.  It.  Now.

                                  NATE
                    Now, now?  I thought you wanted to 
                    wait --

                                  BLAIR
                    Not anymore...

      He nods.  Sounds good to him.  They fall back on the bed.  
      Blair on top.  Clothes starting to come off...

      EXT.  WALDORF APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

      A town car pulls up.  The Chauffeur opens the door.  Serena 
      steps out.  Takes a beat.  Then heads in, past a DOORMAN who 
      seems surprised to see her.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE 
                    Upper East Side  It Girl  just up 
                    and heads for boarding school 
                    without so much as a good-bye to 
                    anyone... 

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- BLAIR S ROOM -- NIGHT

      It s a blur of lips, hips and fingertips.

                                  BLAIR
                    I love you Nate Archibald.  Always 
                    have.  Always will.

      Nate hesitates.  Just for a moment.  Her eyes search his.

                                  NATE
                    I love you too.

      Satisfied with this, she goes back to kissing him...

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- VESTIBULE -- NIGHT

      The ELEVATOR doors open.  Serena steps out. Party NOISE 
      inside.  Is she ready for this?

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    In her absence, the myth has only 
                    grown.  Everyone s got their fav 
                    Serena story.  Though it s hard to 
                    know where fact ends, and fiction 
                    begins...  Ah, the sacrifices one 
                    makes to be the life of the party.                                                                                      7.



      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- DRAWING ROOM -- NIGHT

      Serena steps tentatively into the party - and hears:

                                    ELEANOR
                    Serena van der Woodsen?!  Is that 
                    you?

      Everyone in the party stops what they re doing.  Turns. 

      ON CHUCK, KATY AND ISABEL -- 

      Surprised.  Katy absently pours champagne on Isabel s shoes.

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- BLAIR S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      Blair straddles Nate. They re about to get serious until --

                                  ELEANOR S VOICE
                    Look everyone!  It s Serena!

      Nate suddenly freezes, jolted out of the moment.

                                  NATE
                      Serena?... 

                                  BLAIR
                          (suddenly deaf)
                    Serena s at school... Kiss me.

                                  NATE
                    I just heard your mom say she s 
                    here.  Don t you think we should 
                      probably... say hi.

      A look between them.  This is not happening.  Blair exhales.

                                  BLAIR 
                    Of course.  Totally.

      Nate is up.  Tucking.  Buttoning.  Zipping. 

                                  NATE
                    You coming? 

                                  BLAIR
                    Just need a minute...

      Blair s eyes shift to her bedside table.  A photo: of SERENA 
      and BLAIR.  Happy.  Sweet.  Blair snaps the FRAME down.                                                                                      8.



      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- DRAWING ROOM -- NIGHT

      A crowd has formed.  Kids and adults alike.  Whispering. 
      ( She looks good ,  Too thin ,  I like her hair )  Watching -- 

      Serena hugs her mom - DARLA VAN DER WOODSEN, late 30s.  
      Former ballerina and rock groupie.   Holding onto her youth 
      with both hands.

                                  SERENA
                    Hey, mom.  Good to see you. 
                          (sarcastic)
                    Thanks for sending a car to get me.

                                  DARLA
                          (doesn t get it)
                    Of course, babe.  

                                  SERENA
                          (quietly)
                    Is he here?
                          (off her look)
                    They still haven t let him out?

                                  DARLA
                          (also hushed)
                    Let s not discuss it now -
                          (beat)
                    I thought you d want to see your 
                    friends.

      Serena looks up as NATE approaches.   Slows as he sees her.  
      They share a long look.  Charged.  He raises a hand for a 
      wave.  Right before she can wave back --

      BLAIR steps in front of him.  Intentionally.

                                  BLAIR
                    Serena!   Hi!

      She gives Serena the warmest smile.  Serena smiles back.

                                  SERENA
                    Hey, Blair.

                                  BLAIR
                          (hugging, too hard)
                    I m so happy to see you!  Come -- 
                    we re just about to have dinner.                                                                                      9.

                    There s somewhere I have to --

                                  DARLA
                    Serena --

                                  BLAIR
                    You re leaving?

                                  SERENA
                          (covering)
                    I m not feeling that well.  But I 
                    just wanted to say hi.  
                          (to Blair)
                    I ll see you at school tomorrow.

                                  BLAIR
                    School?
                          (more to herself)
                    So you re back for good.

      SERENA moves towards the elevator.  KATY and ISABEL share a 
      look:  WTF?  They WHIP out their SIDEKICKS.  Typing quickly.

      SERENA looks at NATE as the elevator doors close.  BLAIR 
      turns -- catches NATE looking after Serena...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE

      INT. HUMPHREY APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      The only light from Dan s MacBook screen.  He s on 
        GOSSIPGIRL.COM.  A DEFAMER/TMZ website all about the Upper 
      East Side.  Dan stares at the picture of Serena, rapt.  
      Starts to scroll through POSTS.  Some ridiculous, some mean, 
      all of them about her...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    The girl is a mystery in Lanvin

      on the final one:

      INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL -- CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

      Serena clicks her SIDEKICK shuts.  Stung.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    But if anyone can solve her it s 
                    Gossip Girl.  But I m going to need 
                    your help.  So send me all the 
                    deats.  Cause I smell a scandal...

      Serena then stares through a window at a --

      BOY, 14.  Shock of BLUE HAIR.  Sleeping in a hospital bed.  A 
      NURSE finds her.

                                  NURSE
                    Young lady - you can t be here.

                                        ACT I

      FADE IN:

      INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL -- ERIC S ROOM -- MORNING

      Serena sleeps in a chair.  Hospital blanket around her.  Her 
      brother, ERIC, stirs.  Awakens.  Despite his best efforts to 
      look like a rebel, he s a good kid.  Smart, too smart.

                                  ERIC
                    Serena?

      Serena opens her eyes.  Neck sore.  Not a good night s sleep.  
      But seeing her brother awake, she rises.

                                  SERENA
                    Eric.  Hey.  How are you?

                                  ERIC
                    You know.
                          (smiles)
                    Been better.

                                  SERENA
                    Right.  Dumb question.  
                          (she moves to him)
                    I m so glad to see you.  And I m so 
                    sorry that I was MIA - I have been 
                    the world s worst sister -- but if 
                    I d known -- 

                                  ERIC
                    Then you d be psychic.
                          (beat)
                    You re here now.  Better late than 
                    never.

      Serena wipes a tear from her eye.  They hug.  As Eric s arms 
      go around her neck, we see his wrists are freshly BANDAGED.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    Must be a lot of rumors why you re 
                    back...

                                  SERENA
                    But none of them mention you.

                                  ERIC 
                    Just like mom wants, huh?

                                  DARLA (O.S.)
                    What do I want, baby?...                                                                                    12.



      They look up to see Darla sweep in, flowing cashmere poncho, 
      leather ribbons swirling on her oversized Balenciaga bag. 

                                  DARLA (CONT D)
                    For Serena to sleep like a human 
                    being, in a bed?  Possibly wearing 
                      pajamas...

                                  SERENA
                    Morning, Mom.  You want to join us?  
                    I was going to take Eric out for 
                      breakfast.

                                  DARLA
                          (blanching)
                    Out?  He s in the hospital.
                          (beat)
                    No.  He s here, and safe, and 
                    getting better.  Let s not 
                      complicate things.  I ll get him a 
                    croissant from downstairs.

      Darla sweeps out of the room.  Serena and Eric share a look.  
      And then Serena goes after Darla.

                                  ERIC
                          (calls after her)
                    Serena -- don t --

      INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL -- CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

      Serena is on Darla s heels.

                                  SERENA
                     Let s not complicate things ...?
                          (beat)
                    Let me guess.  You ve told everyone 
                    Eric is just visiting Grandpa in 
                    Newport.

                                  DARLA
                          (a beat, then)
                    Your Aunt Carol in Miami.

                                  SERENA 
                    You re hiding him?  What are you 
                    worried he ll cost you  Mom of the 
                    Year ?   Cause I kinda think you re 
                      ineligible.                                                                                    13.



                                  DARLA
                    Spare me.  You ve been gone, 
                    supposed to be studying, probably 
                    raging, no one s heard from you in 
                    months.  Including him.  So as 
                    happy as I am to have you home...
                          (icily)
                    You have no idea what it s been 
                    like.

      Darla storms off.  Serena stung, turns back to Eric s 
      hospital room.  He s heard everything.  Forces a smile.

                                  ERIC
                    She s working on her bedside 
                    manner.

      INT. HUMPHREY APARTMENT -- MORNING

      No drawing rooms here.  The cozy, eclectic main room is 
      crammed with guitars and mementos from Rufus  band (ANTHEM). 
      Rufus is at the stove, scrambling eggs.  Dan enters in a 
      private school uniform.  Jenny looks up from the table.

                                  RUFUS
                    Guess whose dad is cool?

                                  JENNY
                    It s a trick question.

                    Yeah,  cause it can t be ours...

      Rufus mock laughs.  Tosses Dan a copy of ROLLING STONE.

                                  RUFUS
                    My wife may have left to find

                    He s very proud.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah.  Way to be forgotten.                                                                                    14.

                          (snatches back magazine)
                    That s how you get remembered...  
                    Maybe you d care if my band was on 
                    Gossip Girl.

                                  DAN
                    What?  I don t read Gossip Girl.  
                    That s like for chicks.

                                  JENNY
                    That wasn t your laptop open to it?  
                    Reading all about Serena?

                                  DAN
                          (covers)
                    Rolling Stone?  Wow.  Can I see 
                    that again?  That s great, Dad.

      Rufus gives Dan a look.  Takes his breakfast over to Jenny.

                                  RUFUS
                    Iggy, Rollins - come.

      A skinny cat (IGGY) and a fat cat (ROLLINS) jump off the 
      table and follow Rufus.  Jenny keeps working.

                                  RUFUS (CONT D)
                          (reads over her shoulder)

                                  JENNY
                    Only  cause I was never invited.

                    You got invited?  No offense if I 
                    sound surprised, since I m also 
                    never invited.                                                                                    15.

                    One of the girls in my art class 
                    saw my calligraphy.  And she said 
                    that if I addressed all the 
                      invitations, I could have one.

                                  RUFUS
                    Sounds very fair.  The sweatshops 
                    could learn a thing or two.

                                  JENNY
                    Dad, you and mom make us go to 
                    private school --

                                  RUFUS
                    For your education.  To get into 
                    college --

                                  JENNY
                    So we should just be anonymous 
                    losers who eat lunch alone and 
                    never get invited to parties.

                                  DAN
                    Why not?  Works for me.

                                  JENNY
                    Mom thinks it s a good idea.

                                  RUFUS 
                    And her judgement is always sound.

                                  DAN
                    Dad.

      Rufus pauses.  Looks between his kids.  And nods, right.

                                  RUFUS 
                    Right.  I support your mother s 
                    journey of self-discovery.
                          (kissing Jenny s forehead)
                    You want to go to a party, Jenny? 
                    Go.  You kids could use some fun.

      EXT. MADISON HOTEL -- MORNING

      Serena walks up the street.  Surprised to find, standing 
      outside the grand Carlyle-esque hotel -- Nate. In his 
      uniform, backpack slung over his shoulder.  

                                  NATE
                    Hey.  Your mom said you guys were 
                    staying at the hotel --                                                                                    16.



                                  SERENA
                    We re renovating again.  You know 
                    my mom -- if it s not broke, break 
                    it.
                          (then)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  NATE
                    I just wanted to see how you were.  
                    You seemed upset last night.
                          (notices her in last 
                            night s clothes)
                    Where have you been?

                                  SERENA
                    It s not important.  And I have to 
                    go -- I m gonna be late for school -

                                  NATE
                    Right.   Course...

      She heads past him, but he stops her --

                                  NATE (CONT D)
                    Serena --

                          (before he can finish)
                    No.  No way.

                                  NATE
                    Maybe we should tell her.  Maybe --

                                  SERENA
                    Blair can never know.  It s the 
                    whole reason I went to boarding 
                    school in the first place.  

                                  NATE
                    But you re back now.  

                                  SERENA
                    I didn t come back for you --

                                  NATE
                    I m not saying you did.  But if  
                    you re here -- it changes things.  
                    It changes everything.  

                                  SERENA
                    I don t want things to change.  
                          (smiles softly)
                    I ve really missed you.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  SERENA (CONT'D)
                    But Blair is my best friend.  And 
                    you re her boyfriend.  She loves 
                    you.  And that s how things are 
                    supposed to be.

                                  NATE 
                          (disappointed, covers)
                    No, I know... you re right.

      ACROSS THE STREET - A KID, 16 with a backpack BICYCLES by.  
      Sees them talking, intense.  Knows exactly who they are.  He 
      pulls out his PHONE, holds it up... FLASH!

      INT. CONSTANCE BILLARD SCHOOL -- CHAPEL -- MORNING

      Stained glass windows.  Doesn t smell like incense.  Smells 
      like money.  GIRLS in UNIFORM fill the pews.  One more 
      beautiful than the next.  All standing and SINGING the Hymn 
      in unison.  Blair, Katy and Is are in the front.

      Suddenly -- the doors fly open and in walks -- Serena.  Sees 
      Blair in the front, heads past --

      Jenny, who sits in the back with the ninth grade girls. 

                                  JENNY
                    She has the best shoes...

      All heads turn.  Serena s every detail -- windswept hair, 
      bare legs, slightly frayed collar on her shirt -- is 
      analyzed.  She lands at Blair.

                                  SERENA
                          (whispers)
                    Hey.

      Serena moves in next to Blair.  Speaks quietly. 

                                  SERENA (CONT D)
                    Sorry about last night.  Just 
                    showing up out of the blue.  
                    Without calling -

                                  ISABEL
                          (surprised, whispering to 
                            Blair)
                    You didn t know?  I thought you 
                    guys talked all the time.

      Serena is thrown.  Blair swallows any embarrassment.  Covers.

                                  BLAIR
                    She meant, call from the train.  Of 
                    course she told me she was coming.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                  BLAIR (CONT'D)
                          (pointed, to Serena)
                    We re best friends.

      Serena recognizes the level of Blair s unhappiness with her.  
      The singing ends.  The girls take their seats. HEADMISTRESS 
      BIANCA, petite in a Chanel suit, takes the stage.

                                  HEADMISTRESS
                    Ladies.  Please join me in 
                    welcoming back, after a year s 
                    absence, Serena Van der Woodsen.  
                      Previously serving as assistant 
                    editor of Yearbook, co-chair of the 
                    Community Outreach Program and 
                    captain of the tennis team, she was 
                    one of our most esteemed students.
                          (beat)
                    And so on behalf of the women of 
                    The Contance Billard School, we are 
                    thrilled to have you back, Serena. 

      Led by the Headmistress, the CHAPEL applauds.  Blair is 
      steaming.  Serena smiles sweetly, embarrassed.  Doesn t want 
      the attention.  And keenly aware that Blair is less then 
      thrilled about her return.

      EXT. MADISON AVE AND 85TH STREET -- MORNING

      Dan races from the crosstown bus to the one heading up town --

      INT. UPTOWN BUS -- CONTINUOUS

      Dan jumps on, winded and rumpled.  Looks for a seat --

                                  CHUCK (O.S.)
                    So Gossip Girl says you and Serena 
                    had a face off on her front porch.

      Dan looks over to see Chuck and Nate -- in the same school 
      uniform as his.  Chuck s backpack sits in the one empty seat.   
      Dan starts to move toward them --

                                  NATE
                          (evading)
                    No one even knows who Gossip Girl 
                    is.  You can t believe what s on 
                    there.  Besides it s for chicks.

      Nate and Chuck look up at Dan.  Who stands before them.

                                  DAN 
                    Hey.  Do you think, uh, you could --                                                                                    19.



      Dan looks to the bag, then to Chuck and Nate.  Chuck dead-
      eyes him.  Dan nods.  Right.  Moves off, grabs a pole.   

                                  CHUCK
                    Serena did look f-ing hot last 
                    night.  There s something wrong 
                    with that level of perfection.  It 
                    needs to be violated.  

      Dan can t help but glance over.  Stomach turned.

                                  NATE
                    You are deeply disturbed.

                                  CHUCK
                    And yet, you know I m right. 
                          (digging)
                    You re telling me if you had the 
                    chance --

                                  NATE
                          (quickly)
                    I have a girlfriend.
                          (off Chuck - so?)
                    I m not you, okay.  

                                  CHUCK
                    You could do a lot worse...

                                  NATE
                    Yeah, well I m trying to do better.  
                    Blair and I are serious --  

                                  CHUCK 
                    Real serious.  You guys have been 
                    dating since kindergarten and you 
                    haven t sealed the deal.

                                  NATE
                    Who says  seal the deal ?

      The BUS pulls up.  Nate and Chuck head to the front.  Dan 
      follows... Chuck turns around to him.

                                  CHUCK 
                    Are you following us or something?

                                  DAN
                    We go to the same school.  
                    Identical uniforms?  Kind of a tip-
                    off.

      Chuck glowers.  A beat, then Nate smiles.                                                                                    20.



                                  NATE
                    That s funny.

      They walk off.  Leaving Dan there alone.

                                  DAN
                    So... you guys wanna sit together 
                    at lunch?

      TIGHT ON:

      A beautifully hand written invitation.  MS. BLAIR WALDORF.

      INT. CONSTANCE BILLARD SCHOOL - DINING HALL - DAY

      Not your typical school cafeteria.  More Hogwarts than Fast 
      Times.  Blair sits, Katy and Isabel at her side, looking at 
      this invite.  Jenny stands nervously by.  

                        KATYISABEL
      Soooo cute.They should be framed or 
                                                    something.

                                  BLAIR
                    Not bad work...

                                  JENNY
                    Thanks.  Thank you.

      Blair flips through a shoebox of invites.  Pulls one out.

                                  BLAIR
                    And here s yours.  As promised.

                                  JENNY
                    Thank you.  I know I said thank you 
                    already but -- thank you.

      Suddenly, Blair sees Serena approaching.  Yogurt in hand.

                                  BLAIR
                    Hide your invitations.  Quick.

      Blair, Katy and Is slide their invites under their trays.  
      Jenny is confused - hide them from Serena?  As she arrives, 
      Serena glimpses bustling, hiding something.

                                  SERENA
                    So our tuition money definitely 
                    does not go to the food.

      She forces a smile.  The girls titter back.  Jenny is not 
      sure what s going on.  Serena sees her there.                                                                                    21.



                                  SERENA (CONT D)
                    Hi.  I m Serena.

                                  JENNY
                    I know.  I mean.  I m Jenny.

      They shake.  And then Serena sees - under Katy s tray -- an 
      invitation.  She casually reaches over and pulls it out.

                                  SERENA 
                    When s the party?

      Katy and Is share a look.  Uh-oh.  Hold their breath.

                                  BLAIR
                    On Saturday.  And you re kinda not 
                    invited.

      Serena is stung.  But Blair turns on the charm offensive.

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    Only because everyone thought you 
                    were at boarding school until 
                    twelve hours ago.  Now the tables 
                    are full.  Plus, Ginny used up all 
                    the invites.  But if you wanted we 
                    could try and work something out --

      Katy and Is marvel at Blair s awesomeness.  Serena doesn t 
      buy it for a second.

                                  SERENA
                    No.  That s okay.  I have a lot of 
                    stuff to do anyway.

                                  BLAIR
                    We should get going.  Unless you 
                    want us to wait for you.  Looks 
                    like you have a lot of yogurt left.

                                  SERENA
                    No.  Go ahead.

      The girls start to move.  Serena sits a beat.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Seen in the dining room at the 
                    Constance Billard School for Girls:  
                    An S and B power struggle.  Of 
                    course neither girl broke a sweat.  
                    They never do.

      Suddenly Serena rises.  Has to say something.                                                                                      22.



                                  SERENA 
                    Blair?
                          (she turns)
                    You think we could meet tonight?

                                  BLAIR
                    I d love to.  But I m doing 
                    something with Nate tonight.

                                  SERENA
                          (a little more forceful)
                    The Madison?  Eight o clock?  
                          (smiles)
                    Nate will wait.

      Blair stands there.  Her authority being challenged in front 
      of her lieutenants.  But she also can t say no...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Did S think she could waltz home 
                    and things would be just like they 
                    were?  Did B think S would go down 
                    without a fight?  Or can these two 
                    hotties work it out... 

                                  BLAIR
                    I could probably do a half hour.

                                  SERENA
                    Thanks for making the time.

      Katy and Isabel giggle at that.  Blair shoots them a look.

                                  BLAIR
                          (to Serena, like it s a 
                            threat)
                    You re my best friend.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    I wish they d hug and make up.  
                    Yeah, right.  There s nothing 
                    Gossip Girl likes more than a good 
                    cat fight.  And this could be a 
                      classic...

      OFF THE TWO GIRLS -- eying each other.  Who will blink first?

      FADE IN:

      EXT. CHRISTOPHER STREET -- AFTERNOON

      Dan and Rufus post FLYERS for Rufus  band s upcoming show.  
      Dan has a big satchel of flyers.  Rufus has a staple gun.

                                  DAN
                    You know, Dad - there s this thing 
                    called MySpace where you could post 
                    all this information on-line.  Save 
                    some trees, have a blog.

                                  RUFUS
                    Maybe if musicians spent as much 
                    time working on their songs as they 
                    do their blogs, the music business 
                    would be in better shape.

                                  DAN
                    Spoken like a true relic.

                                  RUFUS
                    Thanks, son. 

      Suddenly Dan s phone BUZZES.  He flips it open.  

      It reads:  HELP.  EMERGENCY.  MEET ME IN 20! 

                                  DAN
                    I have to run...
                          (beat)
                    Dad - are you gonna be okay?

                                  RUFUS
                    Yeah.  I mean your mom ll be back.  
                    She s always been a free spirit. 
                    One of the reasons I fell for her 
                    in the first place.  But in the 
                    end, this ll bring us closer.

                                  DAN
                    I meant with the flyers?

                                  RUFUS
                          (smiles, right)
                    Luckily staple guns are old school.

      INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL -- ERIC S ROOM -- AFTERNOON

      Serena enters.  Eric sits up, happy to see her.                                                                                    24.



                                  SERENA
                    I talked to the nurse and we are 
                    going out.  It s not like what you 
                    have is contagious.

                                  ERIC
                    And what do we tell Mom?...

                                  SERENA
                    That you were kidnapped.

                                  ERIC 
                    Oh no.  We re going shopping, 
                    aren t we?

                                  SERENA
                    I had a bad day.  I need a little 
                    retail therapy.  

                                  ERIC
                    Really?   Cause I ve had a great 
                    day.  They had this green Jell-O 
                    for lunch --

                                  SERENA
                    Uh-huh.  Funny.  Let s go...

      INT. ARCHIBALD TOWNHOUSE -- KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

      As opposed to the old money elegance of the Waldorf s 
      penthouse, everything here feels very modern. Cold.  Nate 
      sits at the large granite island.  On his laptop.  Looking at 
      --  

      GOSSIP GIRL.  A PICTURE OF HIM AND SERENA.  From today. 

      Then his dad, the Captain, enters.  In a suit.  

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                    Nate, hi.  How was your day?

                                  NATE
                    Hey, Dad.  Just heading out.  Gonna 
                    go study at Blair s.

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                    Really?  Eleanor s out of town and 
                    you guys are hitting the books.
                          (gives Nate a sly smile)
                    Things must be good with you 
                    guys...

      At this, Nate shuts the laptop image of him and Serena.                                                                                    25.



                                  NATE
                    Yeah.  Why?

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                    Just happy you re happy.  She s a 
                    good girl.  Great family.    
                          (beat)
                    Hey.  Did Blair mention anything to 
                    you about that position on 
                    Eleanor s board that is becoming 
                      available?

                                  NATE
                     Cause that s what we talk about?

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                          (covers)
                    Right.  Of course.  Have fun.  

      The Captain looks off.  Nate looks at him...

                                  NATE
                    Dad, everything s okay, right?  
                    You re home pretty early from work -

                                  THE CAPTAIN
                    Have an early business dinner.  
                    Wanted to change.   
                          (winks to his son)
                    I ll tell Mom you re at Chuck s.  
                    And not to wait up.

      Nate smiles back.  Appreciates it.  But something s off...

      INT. BARNEY S -- 6TH FLOOR -- AFTERNOON

      Dan bounds off the elevator.  Jenny stands in front of a 
      three way mirror.  Looks beautiful in a too expensive dress.  

                                  DAN
                    What is it?  What s wrong?

                                  JENNY
                    Do you like this on me?

                                  DAN
                    Wait - that s why you called me?  I 
                    thought it was an emergency.

                                  JENNY
                    A fashion emergency.  I ve never 
                    been to a big dance before --                                                                                    26.



                                  DAN
                    Uh, neither have I.

                                  JENNY
                    Mom s not here.  And Dad s allergic 
                    to department stores.  And society 
                    balls.

                                  DAN
                          (gets it, sincere)
                    You look great, Jen.  Really.

                                  JENNY
                    Too bad it s more than our rent.
                    But I think I can make it.

      Suddenly Jenny sees - coming up the escalator -- SERENA.  
      With Eric in tow.

                                  JENNY (CONT D)
                    Omigod.  It s Serena.

                                  DAN
                    Uh-huh.  Very funny.  

                                  JENNY
                    Hi, Serena!

      Dan freezes.  Seriously?  He turns as Serena waves at them.

                                  DAN
                    Um.  Wait.  What are you... You 
                    know her now?

      Jenny starts to walk over to Serena and Eric.

                                  SERENA
                    Hey.  Jenny, right?  This is my --

                                  ERIC
                    Stylist.  And personal shopper. 

      Serena smiles -- as he goes to shake Jenny s hand.  Jenny 
      sees the bandages on his wrists.  She reacts, then covers.

                                  JENNY
                    I m Jenny.  This is my brother --

      She turns but Dan has vanished... Huh.  

                                  SERENA
                    Is that your dress for the Kiss on 
                    the Lips party?                                                                                      27.



                                  JENNY
                    Kind of.  Oh, and speaking of that -

      Jenny reaches into her bag.  Pulls out an invitation.

                                  JENNY (CONT D)
                    I made you one during free period. 

                                  SERENA
                          (smiles, appreciates it)
                    Thanks that was really... nice.  

                                  JENNY
                    Well.  Good to see you.  Meet you.

      She starts to walk away - doesn t want to overstay.

                                  SERENA
                    Jenny?  That would look even better 
                    in black.

                                  JENNY
                          (best. advice. ever.)
                    Black.  Cool.  Thanks!

      From the CLOTHING RACKS -- Dan hides.  Watching from afar. 

      EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SHEEP S MEADOW -- AFTERNOON

      Chuck and Nate spark up a joint.  Hanging out together.

                                  CHUCK
                    This is some good stuff...

                    I m gonna need it.  Blair s mom is

                                  CHUCK
                    Yeah, well then maybe I should 
                    swipe some of my Dad s Viagra. 
                          (off Nate s look)
                    Or my mom s Paxil.  Nathaniel.  
                    You re about to finally have sex

                    You and Blair have been dating 
                    forever.  Suddenly there s a 
                    problem?  Out of the blue?

                                  NATE
                    There s no problem.
                          (beat)
                    Just... do you ever feel like your 
                    whole life is planned for you and 
                    you re just gonna end up like our 
                    parents.

                                  CHUCK
                    Jesus.  That s a dark thought.

      Nate looks at Chuck.  Wants to open up, not sure how.

                                  NATE
                    Since we were kids we were told 
                    what school to go to, what girl to 
                    date, what job to have, right?... 
                    But what if it s not want you want?  
                    Aren t we entitled to choose?  To 
                    be happy?

                                  CHUCK
                    Easy, Socrates.  What we re 
                    entitled to is a trust fund.  A 
                    house in the Hamptons.  Maybe a 
                      prescription drug problem.  But 
                    happiness does not seem to be on 
                    the menu.
                          (beat)
                    So smoke up.  And seal the deal 
                    with Blair.   Cause you re also 
                    entitled to tap that ass.

      Nate, embarrassed, tries to laugh it off.  Takes a hit.  But 
      doesn t feel any better.

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOBBY -- EVENING

      Serena sits.  Nervous.  Waiting.  Sees Blair enter.  Takes a 
      beat.  Rises. Smiles warmly.  Blair gives her a chilly smile.  
      They hug.  OFF SERENA -- has her work cut out for her..

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOUNGE -- EVENING

      Serena and Blair sit in a booth.  Blair has a martini.  
      Serena sips Pellegrino.  It s awkward.  Serena shifts...

                                  SERENA 
                    How s your mom doing... with the 
                    divorce and everything?                                                                                    29.



                                  BLAIR
                    Great.  So my dad left her for 
                    another man.  She s lost fifteen 
                    pounds, got an eye lift.  Been good 
                    for her.

                                  SERENA
                    I m really sorry...

                                  BLAIR
                    Yeah, I could tell.  Since you 
                    never called or wrote the entire 
                    time it was happening.

                                  SERENA
                    I know.  I was... totally out of 
                    control at boarding school.  

                                  BLAIR
                    I don t know why you even went to 
                    boarding school to begin with.  And 
                    now suddenly you re back.  You 
                    don t stay for dinner at my house.
                          (points to Serena s water)
                    You re not drinking.  What s up?

                                  SERENA
                    Some stuff happened... that made me 
                    wake up a little bit.  I guess. 
                    It s personal.

                                  BLAIR
                    And we don t tell each other 
                    personal stuff anymore?

                                  SERENA
                    Please -- just trust me?

                                  BLAIR
                    How can I trust you when I feel 
                    like I don t even know you?

                                  SERENA
                    Well, let s fix that.  I know 
                    things have changed.  I see you 
                    with Katy and Is and at school and 
                    I get it... And I don t want to 
                    take any of that away.

                                  BLAIR
                    Because it s just yours to take if 
                    you want it?                                                                                     30.



                                  SERENA
                    That s not what I mean... I miss 
                    you.  And I just want everything to 
                    go back to how it was.  Walking to 
                    school together.  Dancing on the 
                    tables at Bungalow.  Night swimming 
                    at your mom s country house...
                          (beat)
                    You were like my sister.  And with  
                    our families -- we need each other. 

      Blair softens.  Smiles a little.

                                  BLAIR
                    You missed some classic Eleanor 
                    Waldorf meltdowns.  If it wasn t 
                    such a tragedy, it would ve been 
                    funny.  Actually, it kinda was.

                                  SERENA
                    I wish I could ve been there.

                                  BLAIR
                    You are now.
                          (beat, looks at her watch)
                    I have to go meet Nate.  Kinda have 
                    something special planned.

                                  SERENA
                          (smiles, relieved)
                    I don t want to keep you.  I love 
                    you, B.

                                  BLAIR
                    I love you too, S.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Spotted at the Madison Hotel: S and 
                    B having a heart to heart.  That 
                    is, if B has a heart...

      They hug.  Emotional.  Blair, smiling, walks out...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE (CONT D)
                    So is everything right in the world 
                    again?  God, we hope not...

      Serena exhales.  That was hard.  She sees Blair s leftover 
      martini on the table.  Looks around... and takes a long sip.

      FADE IN:

      INT. HUMPHREY APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      Jenny sits at the kitchen table.  Cutting up a vintage dress.  
      Sewing machine out.  Dan enters.  Sheepish.

                                  JENNY
                    Ah.  The Invisible Man returns. 

                                  DAN
                    I figured we solved your fashion 
                      emergency, my work was done. 

                                  JENNY
                    I just had no idea you could move 
                    that fast.  She s actually really 
                    nice.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah.  You guys best friends now?

      Jenny hands Dan an engraved invitation.

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    What s this?

                                  JENNY
                    I made you one too.  It s kind of 
                    illegal but they won t notice.
                          (beat)
                    Serena s going.  If that s any 
                      incentive.

                                  DAN
                    Enough with the Serena talk.  So I 
                    hid in women s undergarments to 
                    avoid talking to her - I ve done 
                    way more pathetic stuff in my life.

                                  JENNY
                    She d probably like you.

                                  DAN
                    Cowardly virgin is her type?

                                  JENNY
                    You re nice.  And I don t think she 
                    gets a lot of nice these days.  The 
                    girls at school talk so much trash 
                    about her.   All these rumors about 
                    making meth in her bathtub -                                                                                    32.



                                  DAN
                    Bathtubs are for moonshine.  
                    Basements are for meth.

                                  JENNY
                    I heard she s living in the Madison 
                    Hotel.  Probably sitting in the bar 
                    by herself, drinking martinis, and 
                    wondering how she went from most 
                    popular to most hated.

      Dan is listening... wheels turning...

                                  DAN
                    Yes.  How very Eloise.  And sad.

                                  JENNY
                    Dad s at the gallery.  Working 
                    late.  He left money for dinner.  I 
                    was thinking Indian.

                                  DAN
                    Order without me... I m gonna... 
                    go.  Out.  OK?

      Jenny looks up.  About to say something.  Doesn t, smiles...

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOUNGE -- NIGHT

      Serena has moved to the bar.  She finishes off another 
      martini.  Clearly she s had a couple.  Doesn t see CHUCK 
      enter the lounge.  But he sees her. 

                                  CHUCK
                          (smiles, to himself)
                    I love this town.

      He slides in next to Serena.  She groans.  Ew.

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    I m going to have to tell my 
                    parents the hotel they just bought 
                    is serving minors.  

                                  SERENA
                          (smiles)
                    And if you get a drink - they re 
                    also serving pigs.

                                  CHUCK
                    I love it when you talk dirty.                                                                                    33.



                                  SERENA
                    You just love having a girl talk to 
                    you.  

                                  CHUCK
                    Actually, I prefer them when 
                    they re not talking.

                                  SERENA
                    I ve missed your witty banter.

                                  CHUCK
                    Let s catch up.  Take our clothes 
                    off.  Stare at each other.

                                  SERENA
                    Or I could get something to eat.  
                     Cause I ve been drinking on an 
                    empty stomach.

                                  CHUCK
                    Thought you didn t do that anymore.

                                  SERENA
                    Special occasion.

                                  CHUCK
                    How  bout a grilled cheese with 
                    truffle oil.  You do love truffles.

                                  SERENA
                    Yeah.  Enough to know that s not on 
                    the menu.

                                  CHUCK
                    Good thing I m connected.

                                  SERENA
                    Only  cause I m hungry...

      Serena steps off the bar stool - a little wobbly.  Chuck is 
      only too happy to put an arm around her.  Guide her out.

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- VESTIBULE -- NIGHT

      Nate steps off the elevator.  Nods thanks to the ELEVATOR 
      OPERATOR.  Takes a deep breath... Heads inside.

      INT. WALDORFS PENTHOUSE -- BLAIR S ROOM -- NIGHT

      Candles are lit for maximum romantic effect.  Blair s dressed 
      in nothing but bra and panties.  Examines herself in the 
      mirror.  Sucks in her tummy, adjusts her boobs.  Better...                                                                                      34.



      There s a knock at the door.  Nate enters.  Sees the room set  
      for seduction.  A little caught off guard, uncomfortable.

                                  NATE
                    Wow.

                                  BLAIR
                            (vulnerable)
                    Hi... Is it too much?
                          (beat)
                    I want it to be special.  

      She slides her arms around him.  Kissing him.  He s 
      resistant. She pulls him towards the bed, kissing him - 
      almost desperate.  He stops her.  She looks at him.

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

                                  NATE
                    Look.  I don t know how to say 
                    this... if it s even the right 
                    thing to do... But there s 
                    something I need to tell you.

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

      A big galley kitchen.  Chuck slides a hundred dollar bill 
      into the CHEF S pocket.  Hands Serena a plate.

                                  CHUCK
                    Alfonso - you re a stud.
                          (then quietly)
                    Now have a good night. We re 
                    closing the kitchen early.

      Alfonso gives Chuck a little wink.  Walks out.  Leaving 
      Serena and Chuck alone.  She takes a bite of the sandwich.

                                  SERENA
                    Omigod.  This is seriously so good.

                                  CHUCK
                    If you re looking for a way to 
                    thank me, I got a couple ideas.

                                  SERENA
                    It s a sandwich, Chuck.  

      He smiles at her.  Moves in.  She stops mid-bite.  Looks up.

                                  SERENA (CONT D)
                      Seriously?  This is not happening.                                                                                    35.



                                  CHUCK
                    You worried that Nate ll find out?

                                  SERENA
                          (stops dead)
                    What?

                                  CHUCK
                    Last year?  At that party?  You 
                    think I don t know why you left?

      Off Serena s look -- horrified.

      FLASHBACK

      EXT. GANSEVOORT HOTEL -- NIGHT -- A YEAR AGO

      Serena, in a small summer dress, carrying her shoes and a 
      bottle of vodka stumbles outside.  Laughing.  Right behind 
      her NATE.  This is the mythic Serena we ve heard so much 
      about.  Wild.  Free.  Dangerous.

                                  SERENA
                    C mon.  It s so hot at that party.  
                    Don t you want to cool off?

      She starts to climb into the fountain.  Nate follows.  
        Entranced...

                                  NATE
                    What are you doing?  You re crazy.

                                  SERENA
                    Save me.  I might drown...

      She pulls him into the fountain.  They tumble down into the 
      water.  SPLASH.  As they get up, soaking wet, laughing -- 
      their eyes lock.  And they KISS.

                                  NATE S VOICE
                    It was one time.  We were both 
                    pretty wasted.  You were in the 
                    Hamptons with your Dad.

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- BLAIR S ROOM -- NIGHT

      Nate sits on the bed.  Next to Blair.  She s shocked.

                                  BLAIR
                    You and Serena... hooked up...

                                  NATE
                    And I m so sorry, Blair.                                                                                    36.



                                  BLAIR
                            (processing)
                    And that was it, right?  You guys 
                    kissed in the fountain.  Nothing 
                    else?...

      Nate can t respond.  Looks down.  Blair s lip trembles.

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    I waited for you!  I thought you 
                    were waiting for me!

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

      Chuck has Serena pinned against the wall.  Serena is steely.

                                  CHUCK
                    The best friend and the boyfriend.  
                    Pretty classy, S.  I think you re 
                    more like me than you d admit.

                                  SERENA
                    That was then.  I m trying to 
                    change.

                                  CHUCK
                    I liked you better before.

      He moves in -- kissing her hard on the lips.  They struggle --

      EXT. GANSEVOORT HOTEL -- SERVICE ALLEY -- A YEAR AGO 

      Serena and Nate peel their soaking wet clothes off each 
      other.  This is charged, dangerous... As her bare legs wrap 
      around his bare back --

      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE -- BLAIR S ROOM -- NIGHT

      Blair beats against Nate.  Crying.  He tries to stop her.  
      But he lets her fists bounce off of him.  

                                  BLAIR
                    I knew it.  I always knew there was 
                    something with you guys... Get out!

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

      Chuck has Serena pinned to the wall.  She struggles - tough - 
      KNEES him in the balls.  As he grabs them, she grabs a PAN.  
      CLANG!  Smacks him in the head.  She races off.                                                                                    37.



      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOBBY -- NIGHT

      Dan enters.  Nervous.  Thinks about leaving.  Doesn t.  
      Scours the place.  Looking into the lounge.  No sign of 
      Serena.  Turns away when he collides with --

      SERENA.  Running out of the kitchen.  Headed for the 
      elevator.  She drops her purse -

                                  DAN
                    I m sorry.  Are you okay?

                                  SERENA
                    Leave me alone.

      She grabs her things quickly and runs onto an elevator.  Dan 
      looks down.  Sees that she s forgotten her SIDEKICK. He picks 
      it up like Cinderella s glass slipper.  Confused.

      He turns and sees CHUCK.  Emerging from where Serena did.  
      Pissed.  He glowers at Dan.  Who gets it.  He pockets 
      Serena s sidekick.  And exits quickly...  

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    And just when B and S had built a 
                    bridge.  It all had to come 
                    crashing down.  But dry your eyes, 
                    ladies.  The Kiss on the Lips party 
                    is only a day away.  And you know 
                    who loves parties?  Gossip Girl.

                                        ACT IV

      INT. HUMPHREY APARTMENT -- DAN S ROOM -- MORNING

      Dan s room is a shrine to literacy.  Floor to ceiling books. 
      Dan s asleep in his bed.  There s a CHIRPING that awakens 
      him.  Serena s SIDEKICK.  On his bedside table.  On screen:

      1 NEW MESSAGE.  FROM NATE.  

      SUBJECT: BLAIR KNOWS.

      EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- MORNING

      Nate sits by the pond.  Feeding the ducks.  Deep in thought.  
      Checks his cell phone.  Nothing.  And decides to dial...

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOUNGE -- MORNING

      Serena eats alone.  Her phone rings.  

                                  SERENA
                    Nate.  What?

      EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- INTERCUT

      Nate rises.  Nervous.

                                  NATE
                    Serena.  Hey.  Did you get my text?

                                  SERENA
                    I lost my Sidekick last night.  You 
                    have to stop calling me.  Blair and 
                    I had a great talk.  Things are 
                    finally in a really good place --

                                  NATE
                          (blurts it out)
                    Blair knows.

      Serena closes her eyes.  This is the worst possible news.

                                  SERENA
                    I m going to kill Chuck.

                                  NATE
                    Chuck?  What?  No.  I told her.

                                  SERENA
                    Why would you do that?                                                                                    39.



                                  NATE
                    I was trying to do the right thing.  
                    I don t know if I love her.  But I 
                    do know... that since that night - 
                    I haven t stopped thinking about 
                    you.  

                                  SERENA

                    Serena - please -- don t tell me 
                    you didn t feel anything -- that 
                    you don t --

      Serena takes a beat.  There s some truth to this...

                                  SERENA
                    Whatever we had... what we did was 
                    wrong.

                                  NATE
                    Maybe we can make it right.  Maybe 
                    we can --

                                  SERENA
                          (firm)
                    Nate, listen to me.  There s only 
                    one way to make this right.  You 
                    need to call Blair.

                                  NATE 
                    What?... No... I can t.

                                  SERENA
                    She ll forgive you.

                                  NATE
                    No she won t.  You didn t see how --

                                  SERENA
                    Yes.  She will. 
                          (deep breath)
                    Tell her you don t care about me, 
                    that you never did.  Say you ll 
                    never see me again.

                                  NATE
                    Why... why would I do that?

                                  SERENA
                    Because.  I m asking you to.                                                                                      40.



      Nate, crushed, knows she s right.  Serena hangs up.  
      Trembling.  

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOBBY -- MORNING

      Dan stands in front of the CONCIERGE, mid 40s.

                                  CONCIERGE
                    How do you know it was Ms. Van der 
                    Woodsen s if you didn t read it?  
                    And if you re not a guest at the 
                    hotel, what were you doing here?

      Dan can t believe the Concierge is Joe Friday.

                                  DAN
                    What?  Look.  I m returning lost 
                    property.  Usually that means a 
                    reward, not an interrogation.
                          (beat)
                    When Prince Charming found 
                      Cinderella s slipper they didn t 
                    accuse him of having a foot fetish.

                                  CONCIERGE
                    You re Prince Charming?

      The Concierge sees Serena exiting the lounge.

                                  CONCIERGE (CONT D)
                    There s Ms. Van der Woodsen now. 
                    Serena!

                                  DAN
                    No. What are you - omigod -

      Dan realizes he can t run.  Braces himself.  As Serena 
      approaches.  Dan tries to force a smile.  Be cool...

                                  CONCIERGE
                    Do you know this young man?

                                  DAN
                    She doesn t know me.  No one knows 
                    me - it s cool --

                                  SERENA
                    From last night.  Sorry about that.

                                  DAN
                    You remember me?
                          (to the Concierge)
                    She remembers.                                                                                    41.



                                  CONCIERGE
                    He claims he  found  your Sidekick. 

                                  SERENA
                    You found it?  Thank you.

      Serena hugs him.  This is the greatest moment of Dan s life.  
      Then they hear from the revolving front doors --

                                  DARLA (O.S.)
                    Serena!

      They turn to see Darla entering.  Carrying loads of shopping 
      bags.  She breezes towards them.

                                  SERENA
                          (forces a smile)
                    Hey, Mom.

                                  DARLA
                          (lifts a garment bag)
                    Guess what I got?  A new dress for 
                    you.  For Kiss On the Lips.  I saw 
                    the invitation on your night stand. 

                                  SERENA
                    I m not going to that...

                                  DARLA
                    But Blair is throwing it. 

                                  SERENA
                          (lying)
                    Yeah... The problem is... by the 
                    time I got the invitation... I 
                    already had plans.

                                  DARLA
                    Plans?  With whom?

                                  SERENA
                          (a beat, gestures to Dan)
                    My friend. 

      Dan and the Concierge are equally surprised.  Darla notices 
      Dan is standing there for the first time.  Points.

                                  DARLA
                    This is... your friend?

                                  DAN
                    Dan Humphrey.  Nice to meet you Ms. 
                    Van Der Woodsen.                                                                                    42.



      He extends his hand.  She doesn t shake it.

                                  DARLA
                    And what are you and Dan doing?

      Serena is stumped.  Looks to Dan.  Help.  Dan reaches into 
      his messenger bag.  Pulls out a flyer.

                                  DAN
                    We re going to a concert.  Tonight.

                                  DARLA
                          (reads it, reacts)
                    Anthem?

                                  DAN
                    Rolling Stone just named them one 
                    of the Top Ten Forgotten Bands of 
                    the Nineties.

                                  SERENA
                    Yeah.  I m a huge fan.

                                  DARLA
                    Uh-huh.  Well, this party could 
                    have been a great opportunity to 
                    announce your return.  But I guess 
                    I ll keep the dress for myself.  I 
                    am a size two now.

      Darla walks off.  Dan and Serena both exhale.  

                                  SERENA
                    Thank you.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah, sure no problem.

      Dan starts to walk away.  

                                  SERENA
                    So you ll pick me up at seven? 

      Dan stops.  Freezes.  What?  He turns.

                                  DAN
                    Wait.  You re serious?  You d go 
                    out with some guy you don t know?

                                  SERENA
                    You can t be worse than the guys I 
                    do know.  Right?                                                                                    43.



      OFF DAN -- he ll take it.  As he tries to suppress the 
      biggest smile in the world.

      INT. NELLO S -- DAY

      Upscale bistro.  Nate sits opposite Blair.  She is cold, 
      focused on eating her meal.

                                  NATE
                    ... so thanks for meeting me. 
                          (plunging in)
                    I really hurt you.  And I know 
                    that.  And I want to fix it...

                                  BLAIR
                    Really?  And how are you going to 
                    do that?

                                  NATE
                          (forcing the words)
                    I m gonna put it in the past. I m 
                    not going to see Serena again. Or 
                    talk to her.  It ll be... like she 
                    doesn t exist... like she never 
                    existed.

      Blair considers.  And then it s like flipping a switch.  All 
      things considered, this could work out rather well. She 
      smiles.  Warm.

                                  BLAIR
                    I think that s a good idea.  Let s 
                    not mention it ever again.
                          (reaching for his frites)
                    Are you going to eat these?

                                  NATE
                    Really?  That s it?   Cause you 
                    were pretty upset last night.  I 
                    mean, think it would be good if we 
                    could talk --  

                                  BLAIR 
                    Nothing to talk about.  I 
                      overreacted.  If you say it s in 
                    the past, then it s in the past. 
                    I m sure you have no feelings for 
                    her anymore...  I just feel sad for 
                    Serena.  She ll really miss you.
                          (beat)
                    What time is the limo coming?

      Nate stares at her.  So this is how it s gonna be --                                                                                    44.



                                  NATE
                    Eight.

                                  BLAIR
                    Perfect.
                          (beat)
                    Will you excuse me?...

      INT. NELLO S -- LADIES ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Blair smiles at a WOMAN exiting.  Checks to see that the 
      bathroom is empty and enters a

      STALL

      Locks the door, gets on her knees, and flips up the toilet 
      seat.  As her head goes down, we CUT TO:

      EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- DAY

      Serena and Eric walk and talk with hot dogs and sodas.

                                  SERENA
                    ... I dunno.  Hang out with a 
                    strange guy in Brooklyn?  Watching 
                    some band... 

                                  ERIC
                    Not just some band.  Rolling Stone 
                    just named Anthem one of the top 
                    ten forgotten bands of the 90s.

                                  SERENA
                    So I hear...

                                  ERIC
                    Plus, how many people get to say 
                    they ve been to Brooklyn?

                                  SERENA
                    Well that s true.  
                          (beat, smiles)
                    You are wise beyond your years...

                                  ERIC
                    That s what the doctors keep 
                    telling me.

      They land at the steps of The MET, sit.

                                  SERENA 
                    You know, we haven t talked about 
                    what happened...

                    and if you don t want to -- well, 
                    that s totally unacceptable since 
                    I m your sister.

                                  ERIC
                    Nothing happened.  I just... got 
                    sick of taking the meds.  Got sick 
                    of doctors and therapists and... 
                    Mom.  I just felt really lonely.
                          (beat)
                    Not that you d understand what 
                    that s like. 

                                  SERENA
                    I think I m starting to...

                                  ERIC
                    Then I recommend pills.  Much less 
                    messy than how I -

                                  SERENA
                    Eric!

                                  ERIC
                    Too soon?

                                  SERENA
                    Way too soon.

      He half smiles, sorry.  They sit there a beat.  

                                  ERIC
                    You really should go out with the 
                    guy tonight.  You need some new 
                    friends.  And I don t need a 
                      babysitter.

      OFF SERENA -- the kid makes some good points...

      INT. GAGOSIAN GALLERY, CHELSEA -- DAY

      Rufus works his day job.  Painting walls and hanging art.  
      He s in a splattered t-shirt and jeans.  Stops when he sees --

      DARLA VAN DER WOODSEN entering.  Heading for him.

                                  RUFUS
                    Darla.  Shopping for some more art 
                    to match your furniture...?

                                  DARLA
                    Why is my daughter going to one of 
                    your concerts?                                                                                    46.



                                  RUFUS
                    Cause we re awesome?

                                  DARLA
                    With your son.

                                  RUFUS
                    Dan scored a date with Serena?
                          (off her look)
                    Our kids were bound to meet.   It s 
                    a small island.

                                  DARLA
                    So this isn t some ploy - using my 
                    daughter to get to me?  Now that 
                    your wife left you?

                                  RUFUS
                    How do you know about Alison?
                          (off her look)
                    Look.  You made it plenty clear all 
                    those years ago it was over.  I 
                    remember sitting in the back of the 
                    tour bus, as you gave me your 
                    touching speech -

                                  DARLA
                    No need to rehash the details.

                                  RUFUS
                    So I moved on.  Got married.  You 
                    moved on too as I recall - to Nine 
                    Inch Nails, then Jane s Addiction - 
                    til you switched up rock stars for 
                      billionaires.

                                  DARLA
                    Still think you re so cute.  Washed 
                    up band.  Working manual labor in 
                    some gallery.

                                  RUFUS
                    Well, not all of us have 
                      settlements from multiple divorces 
                    to sustain us.

                                  DARLA
                    Stay out of my life.

      Darla turns and huffs out.  Rufus watches her go.  One of the 
      catty GALLERY GIRLS walks up to Rufus.  Having overheard.                                                                                    47.



                                    GALLERY GIRL
                    Wow.  Darla Van Der Woodsen is warm 
                    for your form...

                                  RUFUS
                    Let s hope not.

      INT. HUMPHREY APARTMENT -- EVENING

      Jenny, in her dress, is loading her handbag.  She looks grown 
      up and gorgeous.  Dan with her.

                                  JENNY
                    You re going out with Serena.  And 
                    I m going to Kiss on the Lips. 

                                  DAN
                    Who said this family wasn t cool.

                    I don t want to be late.  But good 
                    luck tonight.

                                  JENNY
                    I was gonna say the same thing.

      Rufus enters as Dan heads for the door.  

                                  DAN
                    Hey, Dad. I ll see you at the show.

                                  RUFUS
                    I d like to talk to you --

      Dan points to his watch.  Can t.  Bolts.  Rufus turns and 
      sees Jenny.  He stops.

                                  RUFUS (CONT D)
                    Omigod.  My daughter is a... woman.

                                  JENNY
                    You could just tell me I look good 
                    instead of turning this into a 
                    sermon on the passage of time.

                                  RUFUS
                    You look like...
                          (best thing he can say)
                    Your mom.

      Jenny smiles.  All she could hope.                                                                                      48.

      Blair gets dressed.  Struggles with her zipper.  Can t do it.

      INT. WALDORFS' PENTHOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

      Blair wanders out.  Finds Eleanor watching the news, highball

                    Why are you wearing that?  I left 
                    the Marc Jacobs on your bed.  It s 
                    from his studio.  It s not even in 
                    stores yet -

                                  BLAIR
                    I liked this one.

                                    ELEANOR
                    But the Marc Jacobs, Blair -

                                  BLAIR
                    Mom, why do you care so much?  

                                    ELEANOR
                    Because I love you, Blair.  And I 
                    know that this is the best time of 
                    your life.
                          (off Blair s look)
                    You have yet to be disappointed.  
                    So trust me when I say -- you will 
                    never be this happy, or beautiful, 
                    or thin again.  I just want you to 
                    make the most of it. 

      On Blair - this is the happiest time of her life?  How 
      terrifying...  But doesn t want to argue.

                                  BLAIR
                    I guess I have time to change.

      MUSIC UP.  MONTAGE OF:

      INT. MADISON HOTEL -- LOBBY -- NIGHT

      Dan approaches the lobby doors.  Serena stands, waiting for 
      him.  Ethereal.  How did he get here?  She forces a smile.  
      What kind of night is she in for?                                                                                    49.



      INT. TAXI -- (MOVING) -- NIGHT

      Jenny sits alone.  Heading uptown.  The city out the window 
      has never looked more beautiful.  She grins.

      INT. LIMO (MOVING) -- NIGHT

      Chuck pops a bottle of champagne.  Pours glasses for Katy and 
      Isabel, who are in full party mode.  Nate and Blair sit side 
      by side.  Chilly.  Nate takes out a joint.  Sparks it...

      INT. SUBWAY -- (MOVING) -- NIGHT

      Dan and Serena sit together.  In the window - Dan sees their 
      reflection.  Just wants to hold onto that image. 

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Spotted heading... gulp... to 
                    Brooklyn.  S. Slumming with a 
                    random.  How the mighty fall. 

      INT. BARNEY S CO-OP BUILDING -- NIGHT

      Transformed to look like Central Park.  No expense spared.  
      Into this walks Blair, Nate, Chuck, Katy and Is.  They survey 
      the party.  Who s here.  Blair s eyes narrow...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Guess that s what happens when you 
                    cross the belle of the ball. B got 
                    her party and her man.  But B drunk 
                    on power?  We prefer S drunk on 
                    vodka.  

      Then Chuck sees across the room -- JENNY.  Standing with a 
      couple other FRESHMEN GIRLS.  Pulls out his CELL PHONE.

                                  CHUCK
                    Who s the newbie?

                                  KATY
                    Jenny Humphrey.  She s a freshman.

                                  CHUCK
                          (types)
                    I love freshmen.  They re so...

                                  ISABEL
                    Fresh?

                                  CHUCK
                          (reading)
                    Nothing about her on Gossip Girl.                                                                                       50.



                                  KATY
                    Yeah, until you re done with her.

      The girls LAUGH. Chuck smiles, moves towards Jenny like a 
      lion approaching his prey.   The younger girls see him --  

                                  FRESHMAN GIRL
                    Omigod.  Chuck Bass is coming over.

      Chuck arrives.  Toothy smile.  Hand out to Jenny.

                                  CHUCK 
                    Hi.  I m Chuck.

                                  JENNY
                          (nervous)
                    Hi.  I know.  I mean.  Jenny. 

      He takes her hand.  Holds it a little too long.  Jenny 
      blushes.  Flattered.  

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Looks like little J might end up 
                    with a new boy and a ticket to the 
                    inner circle.  Or will C end up 
                    with another victim.  I told you I 
                    love parties... 


                                    END OF ACT IV                                                                                    51.


                                        ACT V

      INT. SOUTHPAW -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT

      A small indie club.  Fun.  Packed with hipsters.  Dan leads 
      Serena towards the stage.  She s never been to a place like 
      this before.

                                  SERENA
                    I m totally overdressed.  Aren t I?

                                  DAN
                    Honestly?  I don t have a problem 
                    with your appearance.
                          (off her smile)
                    C mon, I want you to meet the lead 
                    singer of the band.

                                  SERENA
                          (teasing)
                    Oh, so you re like a groupie...

      On stage -- the band is setting up their equipment.  Rufus 
      does a sound check on his guitar.  He sees Dan and Serena.

                                  DAN
                    Serena.  I d like you to meet Rufus 
                    Humphrey.  Dad - this is Serena.

                                  RUFUS
                    Serena Van Der Woodsen.
                          (off Dan s look, awkward)
                    I don t know how I know that.  It s 
                    nice to meet you.

                                  SERENA
                    Nice to meet you too.

      A GUITAR TECH comes over -- Rufus finds his excuse:

                                  RUFUS
                    I gotta tune this - excuse me -- 
                    enjoy the show --

      Rufus walks off.  Serena turns to Dan.  

                                  SERENA
                    You took me to meet your dad on a 
                    first date?

                                  DAN
                    I never really thought about it 
                    that way.  But I wish I had.  
                     Cause it s really lame.                                                                                    52.



                                  SERENA
                    I think it s cute.  

      They head into the crowd.  OFF DAN -- cute?  He ll take it.

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- NIGHT

      Kids on the dance floor.  Blair supervises.  Proud of her 
      work.  Katy and Isabel stand behind her.

                                  KATY
                    This party sucks.  I wonder what 
                    Serena is doing.

                                  ISABEL
                    I wonder if she s at an AA meeting.  
                    Maybe we should go to AA.  The guys 
                    there are really cute.

                                  KATY
                    I love bad-boys.

                                  BLAIR
                          (wheels on them)
                    Who cares what Serena s doing.  Get 
                    out there.  And look like you re 
                    having fun.

      THE DANCEFLOOR

      Where Chuck grinds on Jenny.  His hands on her hips.  She s a 
      little uncomfortable...

                                  CHUCK
                    You re a freshman, huh?  I like 
                    freshmen.  You re like a blank 
                    canvas.  Ready to be painted.

                                  JENNY
                          (nervous humor)
                    Are you trying to paint me right 
                    now?   Cause you might want to put 
                    your brush back in your pants -

                                  CHUCK
                    You re funny, Janet. 

                                  JENNY
                    Jenny.

                                  CHUCK
                    Let s talk somewhere quieter --                                                                                    53.



      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- LADIES ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      BANG!  The bathroom door flies open and Chuck leads Jenny 
      inside by the arm.

                                  JENNY
                      Definitely quieter in here.  But --

                                  CHUCK
                    But what?  Step into my office.

      He throws open a stall door.  Leads her into it --

                                  JENNY
                    Maybe we should get back -- ?

                                  CHUCK
                    Party s right here.

      He leans in.  Kisses her.  Not how she planned her first 
      kiss.  As he leans in for another - she stops him --

                                  JENNY
                    You mind if I use your office? 
                    Gotta pee.

                                  CHUCK
                          (slightly irked)
                    Make it quick.

      Jenny closes the door.  Leans against it.  Freaked.

      INT. SOUTHPAW -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT

      Rufus and his band are on stage.  For a bunch of old guys, 
      they re still pretty rocking.  Good sized crowd of devoted 
      fans.  Enjoying the show.  Including --

      Serena.  Bobbing her head.  Dan steals a sideways look at 
      her.  She catches him.

                                  SERENA
                    What?

                                  DAN
                      Nothing...

      He looks down, embarrassed. She steals a glance at him.  He s 
      sweet.  Suddenly Dan s cell phone VIBRATES.  He checks it.  A 
      text message:

      -- HELP.  EMERGENCY.  NEED YOU.  J.                                                                                    54.



      He makes a face.  Types back:

      -- FASHION EMERGENCY? :)

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- NIGHT

      Jenny gets the message back from Dan.  Starts typing again.  
      BANG!  Chuck hits the door with his fist.

                                  CHUCK
                    What the hell are you doing in 
                    there?  I miss you, Janice!

                                  JENNY
                          (typing away)
                    One second.

      INT. SOUTHPAW -- BROOKLYN -- CONTINUOUS

      Dan s phone buzzes again. Annoyed he checks it:

      -- 4 REAL.  PLEASE.  U KNOW CHUCK?

      Serena looks over.  Sees Dan reading his cell.

                                  SERENA
                    Better offer?

                                  DAN
                    It s my sister.  She s at the Kiss 
                    on the Lips party.  Having some 
                    problems with that Chuck guy.

                                  SERENA
                          (stiffens)
                    What kind of problem?

      Another TEXT buzzes into his phone: 9-1-1

                                  DAN
                    An emergency... 
                          (kills him, but --)
                    I should go.  I m sorry but --

                                  SERENA
                          (makes a decision)
                    I ll come with you.

                                  DAN
                    You don t have to. It s okay -

                                  SERENA
                    If it s Chuck?  It s not okay.                                                                                    55.



                                  DAN
                    I m sorry.

                                  SERENA
                    She s your family.  You gotta be 
                    there.

      He smiles, grateful.  They head out.  Quickly.

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- LADIES ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Chuck paces outside Jenny s door.  The Big Bad Wolf.

                                  CHUCK
                    I m sorry if I came on too strong.  
                    I just really like you.  You don t 
                    want to do anything, that s cool.  
                    We can talk.  We ll go back to the 
                    dance.  Start over.

      Jenny thinks about this... Slides the lock over.  All Chuck 
      needs.  He shoulders into the door.  And grins at her.

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    Or we can just hang here.  And get 
                    to each other better.

      He pushes her against the wall, pushing his lips onto hers.

      EXT. BARNEY S CO-OP BUILDING -- NIGHT

      A taxi pulls up.  Dan and Serena head up.  There are SECURITY 
      GUARDS manning the velvet rope out front.

                                  SERENA
                    I don t have my invitation.

                                  DAN
                          (pulls his out)
                    Don t worry.
                          (to the GUARDS)
                    She s with me.

      As the rope comes unclipped --

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- NIGHT

      Dan and Serena enter.  All heads turn.  Even Serena dressed 
      down is the most beautiful girl in the room.

                                  DAN
                    I m gonna do a lap.  Look for her.                                                                                    56.



      Dan peels off, leaving Serena suddenly alone as ALL AROUND 
      THE ROOM -- Sidekicks get whipped out.  Cell phones.  People 
      buzzing each other across the dance floor:

      -- She s here!  SVDW in the house!

      AT THE BAR --

      Blair and Nate get drinks.  Katy and Is both grab their 
      SIDEKICKS.  Reading:

                        KATYISABEL
      Serena s here?Serena s here?

      Blair and Nate both turn.  

                                  BLAIR
                    What is she doing here?  She was 
                    not invited.

      Blair goes to confront Serena - when Nate stops her.

                                  NATE
                    What are you doing Blair?  You re 
                    really going to kick her out?

                                  BLAIR
                    Did you invite her?

                                  NATE
                    What?  No.  God.  I told you -

      Nate starts to walk away.  Now Blair stops him.

                                  BLAIR
                    Do. Not. Talk. To. Her.

                                  NATE
                    I was going for a walk.

      Nate blows out.  Passes Serena.  Doesn t look at her. Serena 
      looks at Blair.  Staring daggers at her.  Blair gestures to 
      Katy and Isabel.  Who follow her away.

      Serena realizes she s all alone.  She moves off quickly to 
      the bathroom.

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- LADIES ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

      Serena splashes cold water on her face.  Turns off the 
      faucet.  And notices behind her -- under a stall door --

      Men s shoes.  And Chuck s signature plaid scarf on the floor.                                                                                    57.



                                  SERENA
                    Chuck?

      INSIDE THE STALL -- INTERCUT

      Chuck has Jenny pinned up against the wall.  Hand over her 
      mouth.  Dress unzipped.

                                  SERENA (CONT D)
                    Chuck?

      Suddenly the LADIES ROOM door opens.  Dan, eyes averted, pops 
      his head in.

                                  DAN
                    Serena?  I can t find them.

                                  SERENA
                    I did.

      Dan looks up.  Sees Serena outside the stall door.

                                  DAN 
                    Jenny?

      Jenny chomps on Chuck s hand.  He winces.  She wriggles -

                                  JENNY
                    Dan!

      Jenny squirms past Chuck - forcing open the door.  Stumbling 
      out.  Humiliated and scared.  She lands in Serena s arms.

      Serena grabs her - pulls her out of the line of fire.

                                  SERENA
                            (comforting)
                    It s okay...  You ll be okay.

      Chuck comes out of the stall.  Now faces Dan.  Dan isn t much 
      of a fighter - but seeing his sister like this changes him.

                                  DAN
                    What are you doing, man?

                                  CHUCK
                    It s a party.  Things happen.  Who 
                    are you anyway?

                                  DAN
                    How many times do I have to tell 
                    you?  My name is Dan Humphrey.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                  DAN (CONT'D)
                    I m in your class.  And that is my 
                    little sister.

      Dan hauls back and DECKS Chuck.  His hand immediately burns 
      with pain.  So does Chuck s face.  Chuck sprawls backwards 
      and WHAM.  Hits his head off the hair dryer.  Chuck THUMPS to 
      the floor.  

      Dan looks at Chuck.  Stunned. 

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    I punched someone.  I did that.

                                  SERENA
                    Let s talk about it in the car.

      As they exit, Serena stops, speak into Chuck s ear.

                                  SERENA (CONT D)
                    Don t ever touch her again.

      Chuck rolls over to his knees.  Sore.

                                  CHUCK
                    Your life is over, slut.

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- CONTINUOUS

      Dan puts his arm around Jenny.  Serena at their side.

                                  DAN
                    You okay?

                                  JENNY
                    I will be.  Just take me home.

      As they march across the dance floor - they realize everyone 
      is staring at them.  Every kid in the place is whispering, 
      gossiping, eyes narrowed.

      Dan protectively reaches for Serena s hand.  She looks at 
      him, surprised, then their fingers tighten.  Defiant.  They 
      head for the door...

      EXT. BARNEY S CO-OP BUILDING -- NIGHT

      Dan hails a taxi.  Putting Jenny and Serena inside.  Serena 
      and Dan share a look.

                                  DAN
                    So... you think I ve got a shot at 
                    a second date?                                                                                    59.



                                  SERENA
                    Only if you can top this one...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    Spotted heading downtown.  Is that 
                    S?  With D?  Looks like we ll have 
                    to learn his name now.

      They get in the cab... they don t see across the street -

      NATE.  Smoking a joint.  Watching them... together. 
        Heartbroken.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE (CONT D)
                    What will happen to N and B?  Can 
                    he really live without S?  Can any 
                    of us? 

      INT. KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY -- CONTINUOUS

      Blair watches the cab pull away from a window.  As Chuck, 
      bloody and rumpled, stumbles out of the bathroom.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    And how about C with a bloody nose 
                    and blue balls?  Good look for him.   

      Chuck limps over to Blair.  Together they face the party.

                                  BLAIR
                    She better not show her face again.

                                  CHUCK
                          (wiping his bloody nose)
                    I m actually hoping she will.

      We PULL BACK across the dance floor -- on all of these 
      CHILDREN OF PRIVILEGE... All TEXTING away... Feeding the 
      gossip chain...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE
                    The only thing more fun than going 
                    to parties is talking about them.   
                    Looks like I ll be busy.  So until 
                    next time.  You know you love me.  
                    GOSSIP GIRL...
