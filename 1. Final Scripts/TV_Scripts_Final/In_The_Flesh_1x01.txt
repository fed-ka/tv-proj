      INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 011

      CLOSE ON A JUMBO PACK OF MONSTER MUNCH - A female hand 
      reaches into frame and plucks the crisps from the shelf.

      MEGA PACK OF HULA HOOPS- Swipe... SIX PACK OF KIT KATS - 
      Again the hand swipes the chocolate. 

      THE MYSTERY SHOPPER S TROLLEY - Overloaded with comfort 
      foods. Then we spot something peaking out of the mountains of 
      junk: An old, battered SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE. 

      PAN up to LISA LANCASTER (18) pushing the shopping trolley 
      along. A normal shopper. A normal shopper with a semi 
      automatic rifle. A normal shopper in a DIRTY ARMY SURPLUS  
      JACKET. A normal shopper with a blood-encrusted BLUE ARMBAND 
      on her right bicep. The band reads  Human Volunteer Force . A 
      normal shopper in what seems to be a completely deserted 
        supermarket. 

                                    LISA
                          (On Walkie Talkie)
                      Thought you said you were on a 
                    diet, mate? (Beat) Well I ve picked 
                    you up some shortbread. 

                                    WALKIE TALKIE
                      (CRACKLING NOISE FROM WALKIE 
                      TALKIE)

                                    LISA
                    No, they don t have those. They ve 
                    got caramels. If you stick them 
                    both together in yergob it s the 
                    same thing.

      Lisa gets to a long aisle. She looks down it. Why not, it s 
      safe in here. She revs up. Then bolts it, pushing the trolley 
      full pelt. She jumps on the back (like she used to do as a 
      kid). The trolley freewheels it down the aisle at speed. Lisa 
      on the back. Face radiant. Alive. Free from... 

      CRASH.

      From behind her. Lisa cranes her neck to see what could have 
      made that sound. The trolley wheels HIT something lying on 
      the floor. The trolley goes FLYING, as does Lisa. She hits 
      the ground HARD. Her left foot twists in on itself. Lisa lies 
      on the floor for a moment, covered in bars of chocolate and 
      crisp packets... 

      A MUNCHING SOUND. 

      Lisa opens her eyes. Turns to see what her trolley hit. It 
      hit a DEAD BODY. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 1 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 2.


        CONTINUED:11

      The dead body is a fellow Human Volunteer Force fighter. 
      Cradling the dead FIGHTER is A YOUNG FEMALE (18). We will get 
      to know this zombie as AMY DYER (18)

      Lisa focuses and sees that The Young Female is cradling the 
      fighter s head so as to more easily EAT HIS BRAINS. The Young 
      Female looks up and stares at Lisa with pin prick eyes. The 
      dead eye gaze of a ZOMBIE. Lisa stumbles to her feet. The 
      Young Female Zombie does likewise. 

      Lisa looks around, searching for her rifle. Spots it inches 
      off to her right. The Young Female Zombie jerks forward. Lisa 
      dives for the rifle. Grabs it as she hits the floor and 
      points it in the zombie s direction... 

      BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG.

      The Young Female Zombie s been hit. But only in the shoulder. 
      Lisa takes careful aim and pulls the trigger. CLICK. No 
      bullets. The Young Female Zombie launches forward. Lisa 
      scrambles up, hobbles fast, her twisted left foot dragging 
      behind her. She turns into the frozen food aisle. 

      A blood curdling ROAR. Lisa looks behind her. The Young Woman 
      Zombie is keeping pace, shuffling, but shuffling with speed. 
      SMACK. Lisa s hit something. Someone. She looks up at the 
      person she s bumped into... A YOUNG MALE ZOMBIE. Teeth bared. 
      Hunger in his pin prick eyes. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD (V.O.)
                      Kieren. 

      Lisa screams. The Young Male Zombie (KIEREN) grabs Lisa s 
      head and... 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD (V.O.)
                      Kieren. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      INT. PDSTREATMENT CENTRE - DAY 122

      KIEREN WALKER (18), the Young Male Zombiefrom the previous 
      scene, now dressed in a standard hospital uniform, JUMPS back 
      out of his chair. He s scared and disoriented. He s just had 
      a vivid medication flashback. DOCTOR Shepherd (54) his 
      doctor, who s holding a medication injector gun in his hand 
      (obviously just administered a shot), gets up and goes to 
      Kieren, holds onto him. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                      Breathe, Kieren. Deep breaths. 

      Kieren, still freaked out, starts to take some deep breaths. 
      He calms a little. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 1 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 3.


        CONTINUED:22

      Doctor Shepherd takes out a medical pad. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD (CONT D)
                      Another Involuntary Recurrent 
                      Memory?

      Kieren nods. Doctor Shepherd jots it down.

                                    KIEREN
                      They re getting more vivid. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                      That s a good sign. Means the 
                      cognitive circuitry s connecting 
                      again. Like a computer rebooting.    

                                    KIEREN
                    Maybe it means I m not ready?

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                    No. It means the opposite. 

                                    KIEREN
                      I don t feel ready. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                      That s exactly why you re ready. 
                      You re feeling. 

                                    KIEREN
                      I can t - I can t even keep my 
                      contacts in - The medication, it s 
                    not just the flashbacks, all the 
                    side effects -

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                    Means your brain s responding. 
                      Repairing. That s positive. Believe 
                    me you don t want to be a patient 
                    who doesn t respond to 
                        Neurotriptyline. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Where do they go? The ones that 
                    don t respond?

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                    We take care of them. 

      An ambiguous and unsettling response. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD (CONT D)
                    Your parents. They re looking 
                      forward to seeing you again.

      Kieren gives him a look -  I highly doubt that 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 1 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 4.

                    Why wouldn t they? 

      Kieren takes a deep breath. 

                                    KIEREN
                        Because...I mdead. And I killed 
                      people. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                    No. What are you? 

      Kieren doesn t meet his eye. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD (CONT D)
                    What are you, Kieren? (Prompting 
                      him)... You are a...

                          (flat, as if reciting)
                    I am a Partially Deceased Syndrome 
                      sufferer. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                    And?

                                    KIEREN
                          (same tone as before)
                    And what I did in my Untreated 
                    State wasn t my fault. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                    Good. 

      DrShepherd ushers Kieren out of room into lobby.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. PDSTREATMENT CENTRE - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 12A2A

      KIEREN exits DrShepherd s office, looks down the corridor at 
      a long line of other TREATED PARTIALLY DECEASED PEOPLE 
      waiting for their final consultation. Kieren is one of many.

                                    KIEREN
                    Could you maybe talk to someone, 
                      Doctor Shepherd. Say that I need 
                    more time. 

                                    DOCTOR SHEPHERD
                          (shakes his head)
                    It s going to be good for you,  
                    going home.

      Kieren fixes DrShepherd with a look- That swhat you think .

      EXT. ROARTON VILLAGE - DAY 133

        A panoramic view of the small rural village of ROARTON in 
        Lancashire. It s a remote, location surrounded by woodland, 
      that s in the books as an  Outstanding Place of Natural 
      Beauty . And from this hill top view it certainly seems like 
      it. But looks can be deceiving... if you look really 
      carefully you may catch sight of a gibbet, left over from the 
      rising, in the distance.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WALKER HOUSE - DAY 144

        A detached, pebbledashhouse at the end of a culde sac. 
      Outside the house, a FOR SALE sign in the front garden. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KIEREN S BEDROOM - DAY 155

      A small bedroom. Outlines of posters on the walls, boxes of 
      music magazines under the bed. This used to be a teenage 
      boy s bedroom. Fleetingly we see a self portrait of Kieren 
      Walker.  

      SUE (47) and STEVE  WALKER (48) are showing BEN (34) and 
      JOANNE (30) around. Steve has a huge fake smile painted on 
      his face. He s nervous. He s desperate for this to go well.  

                                    STEVE
                            (nervous, babbling a bit)
                      Fantastic room if you have 
                      children... or guests...or, uh, 
                      strangers round ever.  

      Ben and Joanne nod, a bit confused.

                                    JOANNE
                    Does the bed come included?

      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LANDING - DAY 166

      METAL CORE MUSIC is heard loud as they approach a bedroom. 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 1 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 6.

                     ay?

      Steve laughs a bit too loudly. Sue knocks on the door. 

                                  SUE
                    Jem. We re coming in. 

      Sue opens the bedroom door and the noise becomes deafening. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - JEM SROOM - DAY 177

      Evil looking rock posters cover the walls. Black clothing is 
      strewn everywhere. A devil s head bong is visible. JEM WALKER 
      (18) sits upright on the bed. Jem s a flame haired punk rock 
      princess who wears a permanent frown on her pretty face. 
      She s petite and cute, but her eyes have a hardness to them. 
      As we ll learn later she s been through a lot and seen things 
      only war veterans have the misfortune to see.  

      Ben and Joanne peer in. Jem holds up her left hand and starts 
      jiggling her fingers. 

                                  JEM
                      There s a party going on, all the 
                      people are dancing... 

      Jem holds up her right hand. Makes a gun out of her hand. 

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                    ...a psycho killer bursts in and 
                      starts shooting... 

      Jem does the rat a tat tatsound effect. Pointing her gun 
      hand at her fingers. All the fingers  die . One finger is 
      left standing: her middle finger. 

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                    Only one survives: Mr. FuckOff 
                    Right Now. 

      Steve quickly closes the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LANDING - DAY 188

      Steve and Sue grimace at the shocked couple.

      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 199

      Sue, Steve and the young couple are having coffee in the 
      lounge. They re getting on. Jem, wearing an ARMY SURPLUS 
      JACKET (very similar to Lisa s) and a BLUE ARM BAND (exactly 
      the same as Lisa s), comes down the stairs. The young 
      couples  faces fall. 

                                    JOANNE
                    Oh, I- I thought the Human 
                      Volunteer Force had disbanded.

                            (resigned)
                    No, round here they re still going 
                      strong. 

      Young couple nod. Plastic smiles. But don t be fooled - an 
      active HVFis a deal breaker. They get to their feet.

      The wilds of Norfolk: an army truck drives through a flat 
      desolate windswept wasteland. Scenic it is not. Behind the 
      MAIN GATE, reinforced with electrical barbed wire, patrolled

      INT. THE LEGION - BAR AREA - DAY 11414

      Bell goes and Jem enters the bar area. We follow her and are 
      introduced to Roarton sonly drinking establishment. Very 
      rural, backwater feel. Pride of place are old framed photos 
      of HVFFIGHTERS (including one of Jem) posing with their 
      weapons and Zombie Kills (The zombies are strung up on the 
      gibbet, on the village green) and a big home-made flag for 
      the HUMAN VOLUNTEER FORCE is hung over the roaring fireplace.  

      The Legion is really the unspoken HQ of the HVF.

      Two local lads GARY (25) and DEAN (25) prop up the bar. They 
      both wear ARMY SURPLUS JACKETS and BLUE ARM BANDS (like Lisa 
      and Jem s). Gary is very physically fit (obviously a local 
      labourer) Dean is less so. Also up at the bar is BILL MACY 
      (48). Bill is a bear of a man, built like a brick shithouse, 
      he has a thick moustache and leathery sun-dyed skin. Bill too 
      has an armband and his ARMY SURPLUS JACKET has 3 yellow 
      stripes on the shoulder. On the bar next to him is a FOLDER 
      and RED HANDLED HUNTING KNIFE.

      Bill casually, morosely, is going over an old HVFcarving on 
      the bar with the knife. He turns and sees Jem. His permanent 
      frown fades. He lights up.

      Kieren thinks. The Treatment Assistant doesn t have time for 
      meaningful reflections. Kieren clocks the assistants look.

      JEM sits on a table (the best one in the pub, always reserved 
      for the HVF) next to BILL and opposite GARY and DEAN. They 
      are in the middle of a HVFmeeting.  

      Bill is passing out some photocopied rotas. We cut to Jem 
      throughout the next conversation, deep in thought. Thinking 
      about her brother coming home.

                    That said ...

      Bill grabs his bag and takes out new Walkie Talkies.

      Bill looks to Jem, who s still thinking about her brother.

        PDSsufferers chill out, play table tennis. KIEREN enters and

                    say.

      Alex takes out a pen and scribbles a websiteaddress on one 
      of the fan mail envelopes.

      opens it, in it is a BOTTLE OF PILLS. The only marking on the 
      bottle is a small LOGOof an ARM bursting through a GRAVE. 
      The arm s hand is a defiant FIST. Alex notices.

      Kieren walks with the others and spots ALEX, walking off to 
      the side, trying to be inconspicious, popping some of the 
      pills. On Kieren. Very concerned. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

        PDSpatients are in rows, in bolt restraints, waiting for 
      their daily shot of medication. Two NURSES inject patients 
      with industrial injectors as they pass along the rows. Kieren 
      is in the restraints waiting for his turn. Next to him, Alex 
      sweats profusely, with shallow breaths. He looks awful.    

                                    KIEREN
                    Mate? Alex? What did you take?

      Alex lets out a low moan. A nurse comes over.

                    taken something and I think -

      Before Kieren can finish, the nurse injects Alex with the 
      meds. Alex twitches, like normal. But then he shudders 
      violently. He CONVULSES and BLOOD pours out his mouth. 

                                    NURSE
                    Oh god. Code green!

      NURSE 2 hits a panic button on the wall. A SIREN goes off, 
      the main door unlocks and three SOLDIERS enter holding STUN 
      GUNS. Alex ROARS and BREAKS the bolt restraints. He jolts up 
      and looks around: a caged dangerous zombie released. 

      Alex sinks his teeth into the nearby Nurse 1. The three 
      soldiers FIRE their stun guns. Alex hits the ground - 
        unconscious. The bitten nurse is treated on site. He looks 
      freaked. The three soldiers pick up Alex and take him away.  

      The other Nurse takes a deep breath, picks up the industrial 
      injector and crosses to a freaked out Kieren.

                                    KIEREN
                    Where are they taking him?

      The nurse ignores, as Kieren sees Alex being taken away.

      Kieren is definitely the first occupier. It s pleasant.

      INT. FAMILY LIAISON BUILDING - GREETING ROOM - DAY 22626

      SUE and STEVE are anxiously waiting in a Greeting Room that s 
      supposed to promote a feeling of calm and tranquility. On the 
      walls there are big government issue posters of happy 
      families welcoming back their partially deceased sons / 
      daughters / dads / mums / grandparents. 

      Sound of a door unlocking. SUE and STEVE stand. Kieren enters 
      holding the white suitcase. KEITH by his side.

      Steve and Sue see their son. Their partially deceased son. 
      Last time they saw him in the flesh was in a coffin. Sue 
      stops. She breaks down. Not in that movie romantic way, but 
      in the real way, a painful primal way. Steve holds his wife.

      Kieren stands there. Seeing his mother like this (he s never 
      seen her this upset before) it hits home what his leaving 
      must have done to them both. To his wholefamily. How can he 
      ever make it up to them. He can t. Not with words anyhow. 
      After a moment. Sue composes herself and her and Steve move a 
      bit closer. Steve doesn t break down. He s holding it 
      together. When emotions are high Steve blabbers. 

                                    STEVE
                    You look - Doesn t he look -? I was 
                      expecting - well I don t know what 
                    I was - I suppose you hear stories -

                    know, be prepared - but - you know - 
                    you look well. He looks well. Even

                    It s going to take some time for

                    How s the move been?

      Steve and Sue look at each other.

                      There s been some difficulties.

      Deafening applause and cheers from the MASSIVE CONGREGATION. 
      It looks like the whole village is in attendance. They are. 

      Also in attendance is GILES WEIR MP (40), The newly appointed 
      Minster for Partially Deceased Affairs. He is seated in the 
      front pew, looking extremely uncomfortable.

                    Now the government are putting 
                    these dangerous fiends back in our 
                      community. Passing laws to protect 
                    the beasts. And they want our 
                      support. Well here we are Minister, 
                    not allof us admittedly, just the 
                    ones fortunate enough to survive. 

      Vicar Oddieindicates the pulpit. Giles Weir rises and takes 
      it. The congregation stares at him, arms folded. 

                                    GILES WEIR
                    Thank you. Thank you very much.
                          (clears his throat)
                      I understand that many of you share 
                    your vicar s concerns about the PDS
                      Domiciled Care Initiative and the 
                      PDSProtection Act. However if I 
                    could remind you that the 
                      Protection Act not only protects 
                    the Partially Deceased Syndrome 
                      sufferer, but also the - 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    And who will protect us, Minister? 

      Murmurs of Agreement from the crowd. 

                                    GILES WEIR
                      Protect you from...?

                    Your beloved
                          (spits out the term)
                      Partially Deceased Syndrome 
                      sufferers? What happens if they 
                      decide to attack again? 

      A few more, louder murmurs of agreement. 

                                    GILES WEIR
                    With all due respect, Vicar, PDS
                      sufferers didn t decideto attack 
                      anyone. When they first rose from 
                    the grave they were in a very 
                      primitive state, but now they are 
                      properly medicated and -  

                                    PHILIP
                    What happens if the medication 
                    wears off? Or they stop taking it? 
                    What then?

        Oddiesmiles at Philip who bathes in his approval. Shirley, 
      Philip s mother, looks awkward. Giles is a little thrown. 

                                    GILES WEIR
                    Well, er, young man, let me assure 
                    you that all assimilated PDS
                      sufferers must legallytake their 
                      medication. And if on the slim 
                      chance a PDSsufferer becomes 
                      tolerant, there are strict 
                      protocols in place -

                                    BILL 
                    Like before? During The Rising, 
                    when the government promised there 
                    would be troops coming to help us 
                    and then no one showed up?

      Very audible agreements. 

                                    GILES WEIR
                      Admittedly the subduing of the 
                      untreated PDSsufferers in the

                    we had expected.  

      This is it. Voices of dissent from the crowd rise even 
      louder. 

      Vicar Oddiesits back. Pleased to see his dissent has spread

      The car comes out of the woods and here they are: in the 
      village of ROARTON. Kieren spots the NEW CHURCH. Churchgoers 
      leaving it. Steve and Sue haven t noticed yet. Steve is still 
      going on about home entertainment.

                                    STEVE
                    ... it sall very well downloading, 
                    but there s something about 
                      actually physically having the film 
                    in yerhand that I find 
                      satisfying...

      Sue spots the churchgoers. Her eyes go wide.

                                  SUE
                            (pointing to churchgoers)
                      Steve. 

      Steve looks to where Sue is indicating. Out the WINDSCREEN 
      Steve spots CHURCHGOERSwalking home in the middle of the 
      road, blocking their way. 

                                    STEVE
                    What - I don t - it s only eleven?

                                    KIEREN
                      What s wrong?

                                    STEVE
                          (to Kieren)
                      I need yerto get down on the floor 
                    as flat as yercan. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Why? 

      Steve spots in his rearview mirror KEN BURTON with PHILIP 
      (23) and his mother SHIRLEY TUNICLIFFE-WILSON(56)coming up 
      to their car.   

                                    STEVE
                    Get on the floor right now!

      Kieren, confused, gets on the floor. 

      Steve takes his coat off, places it over the kneeling Kieren. 
      It s not big enough.

      Sue starts taking off her coat. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                      Quick. 

      Sue gets her coat off. Steve places it over Kieren. He s 
      hidden. Barely. 

      A TAP, TAP, TAP on his SIDE WINDOW.

      Steve rolls down the window and smiles at Ken.   

                                  KEN
                      Didn t see you two in the pews 
                      today. Missed quite the drama. 

                                    STEVE

                    yours this afternoon, Ken. Yercan 
                    tell us all about it. 

      Steve starts rolling up the window. 

                                  KEN
                    I can tell you now. You re going my 
                    way, aren t yer? 

      Steve and Sue freeze. She wants a lift in the car. 

                                    STEVE
                    Well, we don t have room for 
                      everyone. 

      Ken goes to the back door. 

                                  KEN
                      Philip and Shirley won t mind

                    Tafor the offer, Steve, but I have 
                    to speak to Shirley about 
                      something. 

                                    STEVE
                            (already rolling up the 
                            window)
                    Okay. No trouble. Bye then. 

      Steve rolls up his window.   Puts his foot down and turns 
      right into the road leading their culde sac.   Sue and Steve 
      look at each other -  Jesus, that was close . 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WALKER HOUSE - DAY 23131

      The car pulls up in the driveway. STEVE and SUE get out. Sue 
      goes to the front door. Opens it, steps inside. Steve surveys 
      the cul-de-sac. No one in sight. He opens the back door. 
      KIEREN gets out, a coat over his head, Steve quickly ushers 
      him into the house. Sue closes the door behind her. 

      In the background a curtain twitches and we see the shadowy 
      figure of a woman who we will later know as MAGGIEBURTON 
      (63).

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 23232

      STEVE and SUE stand around the kitchen table. KIEREN, pretty 
      freaked and confused, still has his dad s coat over his head. 

                                    STEVE
                      Yercan, uh, yercan take that off 
                    now if you want, son. 

      Kieren does so. He s very concerned but he doesn t want to 
      snap. His parents are going through a lot. But still...

                                    KIEREN
                    What was that about, Dad?

                    It - it was just - it s going to be 
                    fine, son. You re safe in here.

      takes a deep breath - Wow. He s really home. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 1 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 30.

      A creaking noise. Kieren looks up to see his Dad standing in 
      the hallway staring at him through the open door. Downstairs, 
      the doorbell goes. 


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - HALLWAY (FRONT) - DAY 23434

      Sue opens the front door a crack. Shirley Tuncliffe- Wilson 
      stands on the doorstep. She s changed from her Sunday best to 
      work clothes and carries a briefcase. 

                                  SUE

      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 23535

      SUE, STEVE and KIEREN sit opposite SHIRLEY as she rummages in 
      her WORK BAG for something. We notice some  Understanding 
      PDS  LEAFLETS on the coffee table (obviously given to them by 
      Shirl ). While Shirley searches in her bag she nattersaway. 

                                    SHIRLEY
                    I got a call out the blue few 
                      months ago.  This is The Department

                    in training to be a PDSCommunity 
                    Care Officer ? 

      Shirley finds the thing she was looking for. She produces a 
      INJECTOR SYRINGE GUN. A nasty looking piece of equipment that 
      looks like a tranquilizer gun for farmyard animals. Kieren 
      and his parents react -  God what s this ditzylocal lady 
      going to do with that? .

                      I said; anything to help in this 
                    brave new world. 

      Shirley starts inserting a medication cartridge into the 
      injector. It s the wrong way around.

      Shirley finally gets the canister inserted and comes towards 
      Kieren carrying the brutal looking device. Kieren backs off.

      Shirley shows them the blue catheter on the back of Kieren s 
      neck.

                      That s where the syringe goes. 

      Shirley injects the injector into the blue catheter.

      Kieren s eyes roll back in his head.

                    hey presto...

      Shirley pulls the trigger.

      Kieren begins to convulse. Steve and Sue are frozen.

                    Hold him steady now. 

      Sue and Steve do. Kieren convulses a bit more then goes limp 
      and semi conscious.

      It looks peculiar. But it makes Sue and Steve feel better and

                                    PHILIP
                      Rabids?

                      They re basic animals. Ripping and 
                      tearing to shreds. No, that sheep s 
                      brains at the village hall were 
                        carefullyhollowed out. I believe 
                    we re dealing with a new threat. 
                    The reassimilatedundead. Just as 
                      dangerous as rabids, even more so 
                    in fact, because now they have the 
                    brain power to be cunning.

                                    PHILIP
                    But there reno medicated ones 
                      living in Roarton. ARethere?

                      I hear whispers son. Whispers that 
                      cannot, and should not, be ignored.

                                    PHILIP
                    Oh right, I see. But I m still not 
                    sure how I m in a unique position 
                    to- 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    How s your mother, Philip?

                                    PHILIP
                    Mum? Oh, oh, she s very well, thank 
                    you for asking.

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    She works up at the hospice doesn t 
                    she? Or should I say, she didwork 
                    up at the hospice.

      Philip looks a bit confused. 

                                    PHILIP
                    She, uh, she still works there, 
                    sir.

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      Really. Because I visit there every 
                    week and I haven t seen your mother 
                    in a very long time.

      Philip cocks his head -  that can t be right? 

                                    VICAR ODDIE(CONT D)
                    I was so concerned as to her 
                      whereabouts, I asked MrWaybridge, 
                    the manager. Seems she handed in 
                    her notice some months ago.

      Philip reacts. This is all news to him. 

                                    PHILIP
                    But - she - she goes off to work 
                    every morning. I see her leave.

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      Perhaps she s in a new line of 
                      employment.

                                    PHILIP

                    Just gonnawatch the end of this. 

      Shirley nods. Pecks him on the cheek then goes to a fish bowl 
      on the mantle where a GOLDFISH is swimming about.  Shirley 
      taps on the glass.

      Philip shakes his head at his mum s affection for the fish.  

      Shirley waves a good night to Philip and exits.

      Philip stares at the snooker, checks his watch, checks the 
      door. On screen we see there s a number of reds...

      The folder opens. His eyes grow wide. Vicar Oddiewas right. 
      His mum is a PDSCommunity Care Officer. Inside is a pdfdoc 
      called  UNDERSTANDING PDS and two further folders  ROARTON 
      PDSCASES A-G and  ROARTON PDSCASES H-Z . The case folders 
      have little stop sign symbols next to them. PHILIP tries

      Philip jumps out of his skin. Shirley is standing in the 
      doorway in her dressing gown holding a glass of water. Philip 
      slams down the laptop.

                    What yerdoing?

      Philip gives her a sweaty smile. Shirley gives him a funny 
      look, then exits and closes the door. Philip lets out a heavy 
      sigh of relief. He opens the laptop again and stares at the 
      screen. The  ROARTON PDSCASES A-G folder has not opened. 
      Instead, a security management box has appeared and it s 
      asking for a PASSWORD.

      Philip thinks. He types in  Shirleypassword . An error box 
      pops up - incorrect password entered. Philip considers, types 
      in  Ilovephilip . Incorrect. Philip rubs his face in 
        frustration. Spots the GOLDFISH looking at him from the 
        mantlepiece. 

      Lightbulb.  He types in  ilovegoldiehawn . Nothing happens 
      for a moment then the folder opens and Philip finds himself 
      staring at a word document with names and addresses of PDS
      sufferers located in Roarton, A-G. 

      A noise from the floor above panics PHILIP and he hastily 
      reaches into his pocket.

      CLOSE ON A USBput in the laptop. CLOSE ON the folder 
       ROARTON PDSCASES A-G , the cursor moves to the Save icon. 
      CLOSE ON UPLOADING GREEN BAR - it loads. A box pops up:

                    Those special clogs. Remember those 
                      clogs? You wore them in the morning 
                    but after mum dropped you off at 
                    the bus stop, you d take them off, 
                    shove them in your backpack, put on 
                    some pumps and be back on your toes 
                    by time coach pulled up. Everyone 
                      thought you d be like that forever 
                    and no one knew why. 

      JEM gives KIEREN a challenging look.

                    But I did. You didn t want to be 
                      noticed. You thought you were 
                      strange in some way so you walked 
                      around quiet as a mouse. But I knew 
                    how to fix it. I made you a mix CD. 
                      A hardcoremetal mix CD. Mum 
                      thought I was mad to give you songs 
                    with so much swearing on it, but... 
                    but I knew it d do the trick.

      Morning.


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 35151

      The LOUNGE has an oppressive atmosphere. The curtains are 
      closed - because of KIEREN. 

      KIEREN and STEVE are playing the board game  LIFE . Steve is 
      winning by a long shot - he s got the better job, the wife 
      and two kids in the back-seat. KIEREN s  car  is trailing way 
      behind: No wife, no kids.

      KIEREN S go. He spins the wheel and moves forward to receive 
      a card informing him he s having a MID-LIFE CRISIS. 

                                    STEVE
                    Oh you re having a bad run today, 
                    son. You used to beat me every time 
                    at this.

      SUE enters the lounge. STEVE stands and SUE takes his place 
      at the board game.

                                  SUE
                    You get off to work now, love. Oh, 
                    we re playing that are we. (looking
                    at KIEREN) You used to beat me 
                    every time at this.

      Kieren considers if this is it for him. Limbo.    

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 35454

      The game is abandoned and we hear cooking sounds from the 
      kitchen next door. KIEREN sits at the family PC with the 
      envelope. clickson Internet Explorer.  Types in the web site 
      address. A box pops requesting the password. Kieren puts in 
      the password:  revelations_1.18 . 

      The screen flickers then the website smain page appears. 

      Kieren clicks on the first youtubestyle video (there are 
      three on this first websitepage). Sitting looking at the 
      camera is the one Alex called  The Prophet . The Prophet has 
      a hypnotic presence. His tone is soothing, reassuring, 
        empathetic.

                                  THE PROPHET
                      I know how you feel. I know how you 
                    feel because I was once where you 
                    are now: full of unanswered 
                      questions. Frightened. Confused. 
                      Filled to the brim with guilt. I 
                    was like you but then my heart was 
                      opened and I no longer felt afraid. 
                    I no longer felt ashamed. I felt 
                    sure of purpose. Because I finally 
                      understood wehave a purpose, 
                      brothers and sisters, a divine 
                      purpose that must be fulfilled. 
                    Make no mistake, we are truly 
                      blessed. Remember:  God shall wipe 
                    away all tears from their eyes. For 
                    when they shall rise from the dead, 
                    they are as the angels which are in 
                      heaven.  

      Sound of the back door. Kieren scrambles to stop the video. 
      He closes the websitejust as his dad opens the study door.

      gardening equipment that has been  weaponized  (a rake with 
      knife blades attached to the end, a cricket bat with nails 
      hammered through it). They look old, rusty and used. Sue 
      grabs a chainsaw. Jem grabs a LOCKED MONEY BOX.

      Takes out the SMALL KEY and uses it to open the money box. 

      Kieren s eyes grow wide as he sees Jemtaking out a SMITH & 
        WESSONMAGNUM PISTOL. Jemstarts loading the hand cannon with 
      bullets. Kieren watches in puzzled shock, his little sister 
      is a miniature Rambo. Jemsenses his eyes on her. She gives 
      him daggers back that say  this is your fault I m having to 
      do this . Outside, the sound of a VEHICLE APPROACHING.

      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KIEREN S BEDROOM - NIGHT 38383

      KIEREN sits on his bed, head in hands in a complete state of 
      shock. 

      STEVE enters and approaches his son. He places a tentative 
      hand on Kieren s shoulder. Kieren looks at him. 

                                    STEVE
                    It s going to be alright. 

      Kieren looks at his Dad then towards the window where blue 
      flashing lights illuminate the walls. 

      That does not look alright.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - JEM S ROOM - NIGHT 38484

      An exhausted Jem enters her room. She s so shattered she 
      doesn t even bother closing the door. She starts taking off 
      her clothes, getting ready for bed. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KIEREN S BEDROOM - NIGHT 38585

      KIEREN sits on his bed. Contemplating the events that have 
      just occurred. His sister did come back and save him. That s 
      something. He should thank her. He stands.

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 1 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 61.




      INT. WALKER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT 38686

      KIEREN crosses to Jem s room, sees her through the open door. 
      Jem sees him. A moment, then Jem slowly puts her gun under 
      her pillow. She ll sleep with one eye open tonight. Because 
      there are monsters in Roarton. Perhaps even a monster that is 
      sleeping in the same house as her.  

      We pull focus from Jem to Kieren. He understands why she s 
      sleeping with a loaded gun under her pillow: She s sleeping 
      with it because of him. Kieren Walker. Her rotten brother.

                                                                            CUT TO:
