    We find Jimmy is sitting at the keyboard of a fairly new
      computer.  It's a PC tower, with flat screen monitor and a
      printer all set up on a small computer desk.  Virginia looks
      over his shoulder.  Burt enters.

                                    BURT
                    Whoa.  What's that?

                                      JIMMY
                    Our new computer.

                    A woman I clean for caught her son
                    shaving his privates on something
                    called Chat-roulette.  Anyway, he's
                    off to military school and we got a
                    new computer.

                                    BURT
                    Hey, hey, hey, slow down there, Jimmy. 
                    Do you even know what the hell you're
                    doing?  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Of course he does, Burt.  It's a
                    computer, not a condom.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hilarious, Mom.
                          (to Burt)
                    Relax, Dad.  Nothing's gonna happen.

                                    BURT
                    You call identity theft nothin'? 
                    'Cause that's what happens when you
                    go on the internet, Jimmy.  Identity
                    theft.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Burt, look around.  Who's going to
                    steal our identity?

                                    BURT
                    It's not just identity theft.  There's
                    a lot of dangerous stuff out there.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You think everything you don't
                    understand is dangerous.  For cripes
                    sake, you're terrified of Sweet'n
                    Low.

                                    BURT
                    Yeah, because it makes drinks sweet,
                    but tastes disgusting when you pour
                    it in your mouth.  And nobody knows
                    why.  

                                      JIMMY

                    Of course she can have soda with
                    caffeine.  And she's lucky enough to
                    be at the age where she doesn't have
                    to drink diet.

                    This one says, "no."  This one says,
                    "never."  And this one says, "Can

                    I'm telling you, that machine brings
                    the bad stuff right into your house. 
                    If you're a repulsive shopper, you
                    wind up buying stuff on there.  If
                    you're a sex addict, there's plenty
                    of that on there.  

                                      JIMMY
                    We get it.  There's eBay and porn
                    and gambling...

      Burt walks out of the room.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Hey, ask it if they ever found that
                    city David Copperfield made disappear.  

      Burt comes back in.

                                    BURT
                    What kind of gambling?  Because a
                    little bit probably won't be a problem
                    for me.

                                                                CUT TO MAIN TITLES:


      Burt and Virginia are looking down at Hope in her bouncy
      seat.  She has green snot coming out her nose.  Jimmy is

                          (into phone)
                    There's some sort of green fluid
                    coming from her nose.  It could be
                    mucus but we don't know.  Okay, I'll
                    hold. 

      Virginia grabs a tissue and wipes Hope's nose. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (matter of factly)
                    It's just a cold.

                          (into phone)
                    Yes, she'd be a new patient.  I don't
                    know.  Hold on a sec.
                          (to the room)
                    What kind of insurance do we have?

      Burt and Virginia look at each other and laugh.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    We don't have that.

                                      JIMMY

                    Yes, hello, uh...  I don't have

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Burt finishes screwing a slide bolt lock to the outside of
      Maw Maw's door as Virginia duct tapes around the door jam. 
      Jimmy enters. 

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't believe this.  I called every
                    doctor in town and no one will see
                    me without insurance.
                          (to Burt)
                    Which they tell me most people get
                    from their boss.  
                          (noticing)
                    What are you guys doing?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Quarantining Maw Maw.  She's eighty-
                    four years old.  If she catches Hope's
                    cold it could kill her. 

                                    BURT
                    Which would mean dealing with that
                    creepy funeral director.  
                          (shivers)
                    No thank you.

      Burt drills a one-inch diameter hole in the door. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (to Burt)
                    How are we supposed to pass the food
                    through that?

      Burt holds up a funnel attached to a hose.

                                    BURT
                    I figure we can pour through this.

                    Nice.

                          (to Burt)
                    Well, when you're done with that,
                    maybe you can tell me why you don't
                    have insurance for your only employee.        Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"8.

                                    BURT
                    I can't afford it.  Besides, it's
                    unnecessary.  We're not cars, Jimmy. 
                    The human body heals itself.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Look, Jimmy, it's natural to get
                    nervous when your baby is sick.  But
                    it's normal.  You get sick, you get
                    better.  You get sick, you get better. 
                    You get sick, you die.  That's life.

                                      JIMMY
                    We can't do nothing.  What did you
                    do when I got sick?  
                          (off their looks)
                    You did nothing?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    No, obviously when you were really
                    bad, we called the doctor.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Jimmy, Burt and Virginia are where we left them.

                      Unbelievable.  I could've died.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Stop being so dramatic.  You're lucky
                    we didn't pump you full of
                    antibiotics.
                          (then)
                    Hell, you're like that expensive
                    meat they sell at those fancy stores
                    where everyone has B.O. and they
                    make you bring your own bags.

                                      JIMMY
                    No.  You did the least amount of
                    work possible, and got lucky.  But
                    I'm not just gonna wait around and
                    see what happens.  I'm taking Hope
                    to a free clinic I found on the
                    computer.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Fine, but I'm going with you so I
                    can laugh in your face when the doctor
                    tells you I was right.  

                                      JIMMY*
                    Good.  That way when the doctor tells
                    me Hope has a horrible disease I can
                    laugh in your face.  
                          (beat)
                    But I won't because I'll be very
                    sad.

      Jimmy exits.  As he passes, we see a wire hanger come out of*
      the slot in the door and try to fish the lock open.*

      The waiting room is low budget, but clean.  Several posters
      line the walls including one that reads: "How To Treat a
      Stab Wound".  A few sick people sit listlessly in the chairs. 
      A family of four, wearing clear shower caps full of white
      foam, sit under a sign that reads: "Lice Waiting Area". 

    We find Jimmy and Virginia sitting with Hope.  Jimmy is
      filling out a stack of forms on a clipboard.  Virginia hates
      being here.  She's next to GARY, a huge guy who's got his
      foot up on a coffee table, his calf all purple and scaly. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (to Jimmy, sotto)
                    You really think this is better for
                    her, Jimmy?  This place is like a
                    germ disco.  Germs come in here. 
                    They dance, they sweat, they do each
                    other and make more germs.  

      GARY offers her a snack.

                                    GARY
                    You want some corn nuts?

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (chuckling)
                    Oh, man.  You are out of your mind.

                                      JIMMY
                    How much do I weigh?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You're not filling those questions
                    out about you are you?

                                      JIMMY
                          (lying)
                    No.

      Jimmy walks over to the window.

      Jimmy fills out a form.  Virginia stares at Gary's purple
      leg.

                                      JIMMY
                    What should I put for emergency
                    contact?

                                      VIRGINIA
                      Nine-one-one.

                                      JIMMY
                    I think they want a person.

                                      VIRGINIA

                    They'll have to call him and then I
                    might get to meet him. 

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Jimmy chews on the pen while he writes.

                    Is that your pen or theirs?

                                      JIMMY
                    Theirs.  Why?

    He looks around and sees other people in the waiting room
      with similar pens.  We see Gary scratching his purple leg
      with one.  Someone picks their ear with one.  A toddler has
      two pens up his nose.  Someone scratches inside his cast
      with one.  Jimmy quickly tosses his pen and starts to spit.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      Virginia turns to Gary.  

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                          (curious)
                    If you don't mind me asking, what's
                    going on with that leg?

                                    GARY
                    This leg?  Nothing.  But this one's
                    killing me. 

      Gary puts his other leg on the table.  It's wrapped in a
      black trash bag.  He opens it and lets Virginia look in.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Ewwwwwwwwwwwww.  That is bad ass.

                                      JIMMY
                    Done!

    We angle on Jimmy talking to the Nurse behind the window.    

                                      NURSE
                    Okay.  A doctor can see Hope next
                    Tuesday at eleven A.M.

                                      JIMMY
                    But that's practically a week from
                    now.

                                      NURSE
                    We're a free clinic.  We're doing
                    the best we can.  We have one
                    thermometer. 

                                      JIMMY
                    But she could be better by next
                    Tuesday.

                                      NURSE
                    Probably.  From these symptoms I'm
                    guessing it's just a cold.

    We angle on Virginia, still in her seat.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Thank you!

      Virginia turns back to Gary and we now see that she's eating
      corn nuts with him.      Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"13.

                    You bred your huskies with wolves,
                    and then what happened?

      Sabrina is working her register.  Jimmy approaches. 

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, I went to buy some cough medicine
                    but all that's there is these cards. 
                    Do I give it to you?

                                      SABRINA
                    Sure do.

      Sabrina takes the card from Jimmy and scans the bar code,
      and her register lets out a long beep.  "Manager alerted"
      appears on the register's display.

                                      JIMMY
                          (freaked out)
                    What's happening?  Did I win
                    something?  

                                      SABRINA
                    Yep, a starring role in my favorite
                    show.  Apparently cough syrup is the
                    main ingredient used by meth labs so
                    we can't just let anybody buy it.

      A moment later, Barney emerges from his office carrying a
      bottle of cough syrup, and a flashlight.

                                      BARNEY
                    Frederick!  Frederick, guard the
                    door.

      FREDDY, a bag boy, stops mopping and lethargically crosses
    to the door.  Barney approaches Jimmy, and shines the
      flashlight into his eyes.

                                      BARNEY (CONT'D)

                          (to Sabrina)
                    Tell him I'm not a meth head.  This
                    is for my daughter Hope.

                                      SABRINA

                                      JIMMY
                    Aw, come on.

      Barney gives him the once over.

                                      BARNEY
                    Shifty eyes.  Check.  Pasty skin.

                                      JIMMY
                    I know I should brush better, but
                    I'm not a tweaker.

                                      BARNEY
                    We'll see what the database says.

      Barney walks away with the box of medicine and Jimmy's ID. 
    He goes to a big book and starts looking up Jimmy's name.

                                      JIMMY
                          (to Sabrina)
                    Great, now I've got no medicine for
                    my kid.

                                      SABRINA
                    You shouldn't give that to Hope
                    anyway.  Look it says right here:
                          (reading card)
                    "Not for children under two years of
                    age.  Consult a doctor."

                                      JIMMY
                          (at wits' end)
                    I tried to consult a doctor, but I
                    couldn't because I don't have
                    insurance.

                                      SABRINA
                    You should work here.  Everybody
                    gets insurance, even the part timers.

      Jimmy enters, holding a job application and sees Virginia at
      Maw Maw's door, pouring a pitcher of smoothie through a
      funnel/tube apparatus that sticks through a hole in the
      plastic/door.

                                      VIRGINIA

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, but it's not like she's never
                    gonna get another one.  Or something
                    worse.  She needs insurance.

      There's a bang from inside Maw Maw's door.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    No, I'm counting to ten before I
                    pour more.  Deal with it.

                    So what's your plan?

    As Jimmy holds out a cup for her to give him some smoothie:

      Burt cracks open the door, revealing the shower is on, the
      room is full of steam and he's holding Hope over his head in
      a car seat, letting her steam.

                    I'm getting her up where the good
                    steam is.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Some of us know how to treat a cold. 
                    Which is all that is.

      There's more banging from inside Maw Maw's room.

                    You can't work in that store, Jimmy. 
                    You'll be low-man on the totem pole
                    just like I was when I worked for
                    Green Thumb.  Hell, I started my own
                    business so you wouldn't ever have
                    to be that.

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Have you ever seen a totem pole? 
                    You got like six people and an eagle
                    standing on your head.
                          (re: Hope)
                    Oh, man.  I'm cramping.  I'm cramping. 
                    Take her.  

      Burt gets Jimmy to come in and hold Hope up high.  

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Listen, if you really think you need
                    insurance I'll take care of it.  

                                      JIMMY
                    How?  I thought you said you can't
                    afford it.

                                    BURT
                    Don't worry.  Your dad knows how to
                    take care of things when he needs
                    to.  I'm going to steal that parks
                    contract away from Green Thumb.  

                                      JIMMY
                    They're not gonna give you this job. 
                    Green Thumb's crew shows up in clean,
                    matching jump suits.  Half the people
                    in this town have seen you mow lawns
                    in your pajama bottoms. 

      Burt crosses into the living room.

                    Have a little faith in your father,
                    Jimmy.  You'll see.  All I have to
                    do is write up a bid.  In fact, I
                    could probably just update the last
                    one I worked on.  Virginia, have you
                    seen my proposal?  It was in a green
                    notebook.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Burt is typing at the computer.  Jimmy is nearby.

                                    BURT
                    Times New Roman, nah.  Courier, nah. 
                    Lucida Grande, maybe?  Oooh, Franklin
                    Gothic Medium.  That's the ticket.     

                                      JIMMY
                    It's a business proposal.  I don't
                    think you're supposed to do a
                    different font for every word.

                                    BURT
                    I'm just making it fun for them to
                    read.  Besides, the proposal's just
                      a formicality.  The way Thumb gets
                    these jobs is wining and dining the
                      councilmen.  That's the three d's:
                    dinner, drinks, and triple d-cups at
                    a booby bar.  I guess that's six d's
                    if you're really keeping score.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Actually, that's five d's. 

                                    BURT
                          (counts, then)
                    I'll give you that.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy enters as Virginia scurries to fix Maw Maw's dinner. 
      They speak softly so Burt doesn't hear them from the next
      room.  

                                      JIMMY
                    I gotta take that bag boy job.  He's
                    typing up a proposal with seven
                    different fonts on it.  It looks
                    like a ransom note. 

      Off stage we hear Maw Maw ringing a bell.      Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"19.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (yelling)
                    Dinner's almost ready, Maw Maw. 
                    It's your favorite: chicken colada. 

      Virginia cracks open a can of Pina Colada mix and pours it
      over a casserole of noodles and chicken.

                                      JIMMY
                    Mom, you're not listening.  If I
                    wait any longer, someone else is
                    gonna get that bagging job.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    We can help him with the proposal. 

                                      JIMMY
                    It doesn't matter.  We're a one truck
                    operation with two guys.  We're never
                    going to beat Green Thumb.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You wanna break your dad's heart? 
                    'Cause that's what'll happen if you
                    take that job.  You're basically
                    saying you have no faith in him.  

                                      JIMMY
                    But, I'm somebody's dad now too, and
                    it's my job to do whatever I have to
                    do to take care of her.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Fine.  Do what you gotta do, but
                    don't let your dad find out. 
                    Hopefully he'll get this contract
                    and you can quit before he ever has
                    to know.

      Burt enters carrying a green notebook. 

                                    BURT
                    Good news I found my old proposal. 
                    Check it out, it had a "Jerry Maguire"
                    theme.  

    He displays the cover to them.  It's a collage of different
      images from magazines cut out to show a football player with
      Burt's head mowing a football field.  There is a slogan that
      reads...        Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"20.

                    "Mow Me the Money".

                    Good, huh?  In a perfect world I
                    always pictured that they would stop
                    me in the middle of the presentation
                    and say, "You had me at I'll mow."  

      Burt exits.  Virginia turns to Jimmy.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Jimmy, if I had seen "Jerry Maguire"
                    would "Mow me the money" be funny?  

                                      JIMMY
                    Nope.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (beat)
                    You should go.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Sabrina restocks a tomato when Barney walks up with Jimmy

                                      BARNEY
                    Well, your pal passed the urine test.

                    He watched me pee.

                                      BARNEY
                    Sabrina will show you the ropes. 
                    We've got one rule around here. 
                      Excellence.  Anything less is
                      unacceptable.  Anything more is
                    unrealistic.  Just excellence.

      Barney walks off.  

                                      JIMMY
                    He watched me pee.

                    Yeah, he made Sally from produce
                    watch me pee.  Neither of us wanted
                    to be there.  It was kind of a bummer.        Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"21.

      They start to walk.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Here's what you need to know:  Behind
                    the banana bin is the only spot in
                    the store the security cameras can't
                    see that gets cell phone reception.

      They pass the banana bin and see an employee, FRANK, squatting*
      and talking on his cell.*

                                      FRANK*

                                      SABRINA*
                    And the deli guy can get you a
                    doctor's note that says you're
                    diabetic which is good because Barney
                    will let you have unlimited candy
                    and juice.  

      They pass an OLDER EMPLOYEE, BARTON, drinking O.J. from a
      carton.  They stop and Sabrina points to a clock without
      looking at it.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    That's the clock.  It's your enemy. 
                    "Working in a grocery store time"
                    moves at about one-third the speed
                    of "not working in a grocery store
                    time." 

    An employee, JOSH, walks up behind them with a box of peaches
      and notices the clock.

                                    JOSH
                    Are you kidding me?  It was quarter
                    to six forty-five minutes ago.  How
                    can it still not be six?  How can it
                    not be six?!

      They move off towards the register as Josh throws a peach at
      the clock.   

                                      JIMMY
                    Is there anything I need to know

                    He's been fixing himself up for his
                    big night out with the councilmen. 

    As Burt begins to trim his nose hairs in the mirror...

                                      JIMMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    And your grandmom's been making him
                    a cool outfit.

      Virginia appears behind him, holding up a t-shirt.  It's a
      tight Ed Hardy style like Green Thumb but says "Burt Chance"

                    If Grandpa succeeds I can quit the
                    store, but either way you'll get
                    insurance soon and be able to see a
                    real doctor.  We both will.  All I
                    have to do is keep my job secret
                    from Grandpa, but that's cool, he
                    never buys food anywhere but the gas
                    station.

      Burt walks down the aisle in his "Ed Hardy" outfit and big
      cowboy boots, whistling confidently.  

      ANGLE ON Jimmy and Sabrina by the register.

                    What the hell?  He never buys food
                    anywhere but the gas station.  

      Jimmy ducks down behind Sabrina's register.

      Burt walks up to Sabrina's register, suavely winks at her.

      Burt hands her the medicine card.  She sighs, scans it.  The
      register lets out a loud beep and "Manager Alerted" appears
    on the display.  Almost immediately, Barney emerges from his
      office carrying a flashlight.

      After a beat, Jimmy sheepishly emerges from under Sabrina's
      register.  Burt, shocked and hurt, looks at Jimmy.

                    Man-- 

                                      JIMMY
                    Let me explain--

                    No, no, no need to explain.  You
                    didn't think I could take care of
                    business.

                    I do, but--

                                    BURT
                    Fine.  If you believe in me, then
                    you don't need this job.  So go ahead
                    and quit it.  Right now.  

      Jimmy looks at Barney, then back at Burt.  There's a silence.

                    I'm getting that contract whether
                    you believe in me or not.

      Burt walks off as Jimmy turns and watches him go.  Behind
      Jimmy, Josh throws a tomato at the clock.

      Burt enters the front door and crosses into the kitchen. 
      Without acknowledging Jimmy or Virginia, he leans into the
      fridge to get a beer.  Virginia and Jimmy exchange a confused
      look.  Burt closes the fridge, opens the beer and stands
      there silently for a beat.

                    the way it is.  We took care of him

                    I don't care if it's three towns 
                    over or three states over, don't 
                    dance in one of those clubs.

                    But if you do, don't be the one they 
                    call "Dirty Angel."

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey.

                                    BURT
                    Hey.

                                      JIMMY
                    Listen, Dad, I'm really sorry about--

                                    BURT
                          (cutting him off)
                    Nope.  I was wrong.  You did the 
                    right thing.  And I'm proud of you.

                                      JIMMY
                    Thanks.

                                    BURT
                    Oh, and I got you something.

      From a nearby table, Burt grabs the vanilla half of a black 
      and white cookie, and hands it to Jimmy.

                                      JIMMY
                    Did you eat your half without me?

                                    BURT
                    No.  I mushed up my half and gave it 
                    to Hope.  That's what grandpas do.

                                      JIMMY
                    She can't have all that sugar, she's 
                    gonna be--

                                    BURT
                    Up all night.  I know.  However, 
                    that is not a grandpa problem.

      Burt hands Hope to Jimmy and heads toward his bedroom.

                    Good night.

    As he passes Maw Maw's room a foot kicks a hole through the 
      bottom panel of the door, then retracts.  Burt leans in close 
    to the hole.

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Hang in there, Maw Maw.  
                          (winking to Jimmy)
                    Hope's cold should be better in a 
                    few more days.      Raising Hope         1ARY05       "The Sniffles"32.

    He chuckles a second, and then, as in a horror movie.  Maw 
      Maw's arm shoots out through the hole and grabs Burt around 
      the neck.  As she squeezes Burt against the door...
