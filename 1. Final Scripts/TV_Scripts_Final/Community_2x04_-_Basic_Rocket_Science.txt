Greendale s hallway.

INT. ADMIN MEETING ROOM - DAY22

The RUNNER opens a door into this dark room.

RUNNER
(urgent)
City College has a space simulator.*

The silhouetted figures of DEAN PELTON and FACULTY are seated 
at a table, lit only by a projector hooked up to a laptop.

FACULTY 1
We know.

FACULTY 2
Close the door.

The Runner closes the door and moves around the table to the 
back of the room while the meeting continues.

DEAN PELTON
As I was saying.  On Monday, City 
College will be unveiling the City 
College Cosmic Pioneer, their very 
own orbital launch simulator.  

 bare-The Dean brings up photos of the CCCP, City College s
bones, two-seat space flight simulator.  City College s DEAN 
SPRECK can be seen in some of the photos, proud.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)

College is offering associate 
degrees in aeronautics.  City 
College students will be getting 
jobs at NASA.  Pretty soon, they ll 
have an astronaut on their

He brings up an example of a Greendale brochure boasting 
  Foosball!

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)
What do you think happens to our 
enrollment then? 

The Dean brings up a powerpoint animation he s prepared of a 
 campus, drawn in red, city map, on which City College s
begins growing, eventually overtaking the green dot 
representing Greendale.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)

 proud of my campus.  I but I m
 want to watch it become a don t
City College parking lot.

Murmurs of fear throughout the room.

FACULTY 1
Well, what can we do?

DEAN PELTON
We can beat them to the punch.  We 
can launch our own space simulator.  
Before they simulate their launch *
Monday, we simulate a launch this *
weekend.  We make Greendale, not 
City College, the first community 
college to pretend to put a man in 
space.

FACULTY 1*
Do we even have a simulator?

DEAN PELTON
We can get one.  For six hundred 
dollars plus towing costs.

The Dean brings up a site for the local museum.  Then promo 
photos, circa 1981, of families seated at space-age consoles.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)
In 1980, the county museum had a 
state of the art space mission 
simulator sponsored by Kentucky 
Fried Chicken, called The Kentucky 
Fried Chicken Eleven Herbs and 
 been in Space Experience.  It s
storage since  99, and they re 
looking to unload it because 
teenagers keep sneaking in and 
smoking pot in it.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING (DAY 2)44

The space bus is parked.  Dean Pelton addresses the gang. 

DEAN PELTON

You guys are an hour late. 

ANNIE
(frustrated)
Abed kept making us redo our walk. 

DEAN PELTON
I think you know the reason this *
group has been chosen for this job.  *
To atone for the obscene entry you 
submitted to the Greendale school 
flag contest.

He holds up a color printout of a simple flag design, a blue 
field behind a pink circle with arrows pointing outward.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)

symbol for the crossroads of ideas, 
 a butt.I now know it s*

The group (minus Annie) stifles snickers.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)
Keep snickering.  Pack yourselves 
with peanuts and really be 
satisfied, because guess what?  
This won.  This is now our school *
flag forever.  Proud of yourselves?*

The group is not displeased to hear that.

TROY

We submitted it anonymously.
(realizing)
Oops.

DEAN PELTON
Wrong.  One of you actually came 
forward.

Everyone looks at Annie.

The front end of the bus has been hitched and raised by a 
large tow truck, which now pulls it out of the lot.  We watch 
it go, then pan back to look at a row of handicapped parking 
spaces, across which the bus had been parked.

After a moment, Abed approaches, dressed in a flight suit.  
He stops where the bus was.  He looks around.  Finally, and 
slowly... He looks up.

We have to get back in time for 
that launch.

BRITTA
Why?

Because we earn the right to pick 
on Greendale, every day, by going 
there.  Our school may be a toilet, 
 our toilet, nobody craps but it s

to bother picking on Greendale?

Abed and everyone in Mission Control wait tensely.

ABED

Jeff looks out the window.  His POV: a wide-open pasture with 
a cow in it.  He holds his phone to the window, gets a signal.

Abed looks at the Dean.  He locates Coldwater on the map, and 
draws a line to it from Greendale.  The line goes way up past 
all the checkpoints he circled earlier.

ABED

three thumbs up.

The Dean turns away from Abed, speaks to nobody.  All is lost.

The gang sits huddled together, dejected.  Pierce is still in 
the cage.  

SHIRLEY
I guess someone will come get us 
eventually.

 8-bit Pierce runs wildly at the monitor.  We see Sanders

The Greendale quad is decorated for a ribbon-cutting

coming and takes the podium here?*

The bus screeches to a tire-smoking stop behind the ribbon.  *

CHILDREN from around the neighborhood come running after it, 
cheering.

PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures and roll video as Annie climbs *
down from the cab, walks over to the main cabin door and 
opens it.

Pierce runs out first, straight through the crowd, screaming, 
and into the distance, never looking back.

One by one, the rest of the study group exits the Winnebago, 
waving to photographers and high-fiving the crowd. 

The Dean runs up to the podium.
