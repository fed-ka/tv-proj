The speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a
hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE.
Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage.
In the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks
open the door and Ray squeezes inside.
BOUNCER
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's
not happy with you.
RAY
Is Spanky here?
BOUNCER
No, but...
RAY
Then what's the problem?
BOUNCER
Do yourself a favor and find another
place where they let you in the front
door.
RAY
But this is where the action is and
I have to be where the action is.
Look, when your old lady wanted those
alligator shoes, didn't I come through
for you? Ain't she stepping in style
now?
BOUNCER
Yeah...
RAY
Well, alright then. What do you think
about this new tie?
BOUNCER
Sharp.
RAY
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky,
too.
Ray heads inside.
BOUNCER
Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let
you in.
Ray slides through the crowd, pausing at the bar to nibble
on the neck of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS
Don't even try it.
RAY
When do you get off?
COCKTAIL WAITRESS
I get off at two, but you ain't never
getting off.
She carries a tray of drinks into the crowd. Ray shakes his
head in wonderment at her departing form. The BARKEEP steps
up as Ray pulls out his bottle.
BARKEEP
You can't drink that in here, Ray.
RAY
I sure can't drink that watered-down
swill you're serving. Give me a glass
of ice.
BARKEEP
I can't give you a glass of ice. I
can't give you anything until you
pay your damn tab.
Disregarding the warning, Ray tilts the bottle back. Shaking
his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. Ray's
eyes follow a bottle of French Champagne as it is delivered
to a nearby table.
Here sits the straight-laced CLAUDE BANKS with his girlfriend,
DAISY. She's enjoying the show. He's polishing the silverware.
The WAITER pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the
bottle on ice. Claude regards his glass skeptically.
CLAUDE
For the kind of money they charge
here, you'd think they could hire
somebody to actually wash the dishes.
DAISY
Claude. Here's to your new job down
at the bank. I always knew you'd
make something of yourself.
CLAUDE
Know what I'm going to buy with my
first pay check?
Daisy thinks she does. She leans in, eyes twinkling.
CLAUDE
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right
there on the first base line.
(off her disappointment)
What's wrong, baby?
DAISY
I was hoping you were gonna say an
engagement ring, Claude.
French Champagne shoots out of Claude's nose.
CLAUDE
Engagement ring!
DAISY
That's what respectable folks do.
Get a job, get married, start having
babies. That's what you want, isn't
it?
CLAUDE
Sure it is. I just don't see any
reason to rush into things. Damn,
look at this shirt. I'll be right
back.
Claude leans in to kiss Daisy on the lips. She offers her
cheek. He departs.
OVER BY THE BAR
Ray watches Claude make a beeline for the men's room.
Claude steps into the bathroom and approaches the sink. A
big hand falls on his shoulder and yanks him backwards into
a stall...
Claude is shoved down on the toilet by two BAG MEN in suits.
Suddenly, it's crowded in here.
BAG MAN #1
Congratulations, Claude. We understand
you finally got yourself a job.
BAG MAN #2
Guess that means you can pay Mr.
Riley the fifty bucks you owe him.
They rifle through Claude's jacket and quickly find his
wallet.
CLAUDE
Now wait a second, guys. I've got a
bill to pay out there.
BAG MAN #1
Twenty-two dollars. Not bad for a
start.
They toss back his empty wallet.
CLAUDE
Come on, fellas, that's two weeks
pay. I'm here with my girl. You gotta
leave me something.
BAG MAN #2
How about your legs?
CLAUDE
My legs? Those are good, I'll keep
the legs...
The stall door swings shut as the bag men depart.
On his way into the Men's Room, Ray squeezes past the bag
men on their way out.
Glancing around, Ray spots Claude's feet under the stall
door. He steps up to the sink, washes his hands and takes a
towel from the ATTENDANT. Scanning the assortment of grooming
products, he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff.
RAY
(displeased)
You have any of that French stuff?
As the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good
stuff, Ray palms a coin from the tip basket.
ATTENDENT
Here you go.
Ray offers the quarter, a gesture of uncommon generosity.
RAY
Keep the change.
ATTENDENT
Why, thank you, sir!
Ray pats the cologne on his face. A toilet flushes and Claude
steps over to the sink. Ray catches his eye in the mirror.
RAY
Don't I know you?
CLAUDE
I don't think so.
RAY
Sure I do. What's your name again?
CLAUDE
Claude Banks.
RAY
Claude Banks. How could I forget
that? You've got to remember me. Ray
Gibson. We went to high school
together.
CLAUDE
You went to Monroe?
RAY
(beaming)
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Ray throws his arms around Claude, deftly snatching his
wallet. Claude extracts himself from Ray's embrace.
CLAUDE
Well, I went to Jefferson, so you
must have a different Claude Banks
in mind.
Claude straightens his jacket and heads for the door. Ray
stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket.
RAY
Sorry, man. My mistake.
On the stage, the chanteuse has downshifted into a sultry
number about back-door lovers and broken dreams.
Ray steps out of the men's room and is instantly collared by
BULLETHEAD, a man who makes his living being large and
threatening.
RAY
Watch the threads, Bullethead. If
this is about my tab, I've got it
covered.
Pressed up against the wall, Ray reaches into his jacket and
produces Claude's wallet. Bullethead snatches it, inspects
it and is not impressed.
BULLETHEAD
This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've
got bigger problems than that.
He stuffs the wallet back into Ray's jacket and hustles Ray
out the back door past the bouncer who let him in.
BOUNCER
Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let
him in here?
BACK AT CLAUDE'S TABLE
Claude returns to the table where Daisy is sipping champagne.
He takes the glass out of her hand.
CLAUDE
Come on, honey, let's get out of
here.
DAISY
But I'm having a good time...
WAITER
Excuse me, sir, I believe you forgot
this.
The waiter presents Claude with the bill.
CLAUDE
The bill. Of course, the bill. We
couldn't leave without paying the
bill. Especially such an incredibly
large bill.
Claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are
slammed behind him. He bangs and shouts, but it's no use.
RAY
Save your energy, Claude. You're
gonna need it.
Ray is stretched out against the back wall. Claude is knocked
to the floor as the van lurches into motion.
RAY
Here, this belongs to you.
(tossing Claude his
wallet)
It was empty when I found it.
CLAUDE
Good old Monroe.
Ray swigs from his bottle and offers it to Claude, who isn't
interested.
RAY
What I want to know is what happened
to your cush between the time that
you got up from the table and when I
caught up with you in the Johnny?
CLAUDE
I don't see where that's any of your
business.
RAY
Did those two muscle heads shake you
down? Swear I've seen them down at
the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's
it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Busted, Claude snatches the bottle and carefully wipes off
the neck before tilting it high. Ray gets a good chuckle out
of this straight cat in the bow tie.
CLAUDE
Where they taking us, anyway?
RAY
Probably to Spanky's headquarters
down at the pier.
CLAUDE
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting
this Spanky. Give me a chance to
straighten out this whole mess.
RAY
I can't wait to see that. You slay
me, man.
Bullethead and a HENCHMAN pull Ray and Claude from the back
of the van. They find themselves in a dark warehouse filled
with crates of contraband.
CLAUDE
(sotto)
What are they gonna do to us?
RAY
You? Dine and ditch, right?
(Claude nods)
Over ten bucks?
(he nods again)
You're probably looking at a thumb.
CLAUDE
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut
it off? For ten bucks?
(Ray nods)
That include the tip?
Claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of
approaching FOOTSTEPS echoing across the vast space. Claude
and Ray peer into the darkness.
SPANKY
(from the darkness)
You picked the wrong night to fuck
with me, Ray. I just lost three men
and a truck full of Canadian whiskey.
You know what that kind of thing
does to my business? It makes me
want to lash out and hurt somebody.
SPANKY JOHNSON emerges into the light. He uses a small silver
spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril.
He glances at Claude.
SPANKY
Who's he? Friend of yours, Ray?
CLAUDE
I never saw this man before tonight.
He's a lowlife degenerate who lurks
in bathrooms. I'm a professional
man, an upstanding citizen. I go to
church on Sunday.
SPANKY
Then what are you doing here?
BULLETHEAD
Failure to pay.
CLAUDE
(rattled)
Look, Mr. Johnson, you seem like a
reasonable man. I got a good job
starts Monday. I'll pay you back
with my first pay check. With
interest. I don't want to tell you
how to conduct your business, but if
you cut off my finger you won't get
jack. Working an adding machine, I
gotta be whole.
(his fingers dancing
over imaginary keys)
I need my thumbs and all my fingers
for praying and doing good...
Spanky holds up a hand, silencing Claude.
SPANKY
The choirboy wants to keep his
fingers. Who am I to argue? Drop
him.
CLAUDE
Drop him? What does drop him mean?
Claude protests loudly as Bullethead and the henchman bind
his hands and feet. Spanky turns to Ray.
SPANKY
You gotta lotta balls showing your
face around my club. If a man's gonna
run numbers on my side of Broadway,
you think he'd have the common sense
to keep a low profile. But not Ray
Gibson.
The goons hoist Claude up on another pulley and dangle him
head first over a hole in the floor. Several feet down, the
Harlem River laps against the wooden pylons.
CLAUDE
No, not down there! That water's
filthy! Help me out here, man!
Shrugging, Ray pinches his nose and puffs out his cheeks.
The goons release the rope and Claude plunges into the water.
Spanky turns back to Ray.
RAY
You don't have to drown that fella,
Spanky. You already scared him half
to death. He didn't know who he was
fucking with.
SPANKY
But you do. What does that say about
you, Ray? What does that say about
me? I've given you a lot of leeway
over the years on account of your
father. But he didn't last long enough
to teach you the meaning of the word
respect so I guess I'm gonna have to
school you myself.
RAY
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to
get by here. You remember how it was
when you were starting out.
The henchman yanks on the rope. Claude emerges from the hole,
gasping for breath.
CLAUDE
I was supposed to wear this suit on
Monday!
The henchman releases the rope, sending Claude back into the
water. Ray reaches into his jacket. Bullethead pulls a gun
and presses it into Ray's temple. Ray gives him a look and
cautiously pulls out his bottle.
SPANKY
What's that, some of your bathtub
brew?
RAY
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Ray tosses him the bottle. Spanky uncorks, sniffs, samples
the goods. He's impressed.
SPANKY
Where'd you get this?
RAY
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get
more. A lot more. I was thinking
about going into business for myself,
but under the circumstances, I'd be
willing to take on a partner.
Once again, the henchman yanks on the rope and Claude comes
up sucking air desperately. He releases the rope, submerging
Claude for a third time.
SPANKY
I'm interested. Keep talking.
RAY
All I need is the front money and a
truck. I could be back in two, three
days tops if I had somebody to share
the driving.
Spanky considers the terms. Can he afford to trust Ray? Can
he afford not to?
SPANKY
If you fuck me on this one, I'll
spare no expense.
RAY
Understood.
SPANKY
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal.
Pick your man and get going.
Ray glances around. The pulley rope is still twitching in
the water.
RAY
I'll take the little choirboy, if
you don't mind.
SPANKY
If I was you, I'd want somebody who
can handle himself in a tight spot.
RAY
I just want somebody who won't put a
bullet in my back once the truck is
full.
Spanky sees Ray's point. He nods to the henchman, who hoists
Claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement.
Spanky plants a foot on Claude's chest and applies pressure.
A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claude's mouth as
he sputters back to life.
SPANKY
For your sake, I hope you can drive.
Somebody give him some dry clothes.
CUT TO:
THE SPINNING WHEEL OF A TRUCK
The CAMERA MOVES UP the side of the old Ford truck to find
Claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat.
Ray palms the wheel.
RAY
Tell me about that hot sketch you
were hypin' last night. She was a
choice bit of calico. You two been
seeing each other a long time? Gonna
slap the handcuffs on her and stroll
down the aisle one of these days?
Tight-lipped, Claude shifts in his seat.
RAY
Sometimes I wish I could find me a
sheba to settle down with. Suppose
I'm just a tomcat by nature.
(trying to fill the
silence)
This little rum run is gonna seriously
improve my relationship with Spanky.
He's a good man to have on your side.
He's got the capital and the
connections. That's what you got to
have in that business. Spanky's place
is pretty plush, but one of these
days I'm gonna open up my own
establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
That's in the groove, don't you think?
If Claude does like it, he's not letting on.
RAY
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a
word since we started. Least you
could do is make some friendly
conversation.
CLAUDE
Look, man, I don't want friendly
conversation. I don't want to be
your friend. I've seen your friends
and I don't like them. I just want
to do this thing and get back to New
York in time to start my job.
RAY
Start your job? What kind of job?
CLAUDE
Well, if you must know, bank teller
at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm
responsible for keeping track of
hundreds, occasionally thousands of
dollars.
RAY
That's some long green.
CLAUDE
Damn straight, it is. I got my own
set of keys because I'm supposed to
open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m.
Monday morning, there's gonna be
hell to pay.
Beat of silence. Ray laughs to himself.
CLAUDE
What?
RAY
Nothing.
CLAUDE
No, tell me what's so funny.
RAY
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds
like ladies work to me.
CLAUDE
Well, maybe I should dig around in
other people's clothes for money.
It's obviously been highly successful
for you.
RAY
Hey, you'd be surprised what you
find in other people's pockets. Just
gotta avoid them deadbeat bank
tellers. Get you every time.
CLAUDE
I didn't start out to be a bank
teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer.
Even had an offer to play short for
the Newark Eagles.
RAY
Why didn't you take it?
CLAUDE
The Negro League don't pay so good.
And you're always on the road. That
don't wash with Daisy.
RAY
You gave up baseball to be a bank
teller? I can't latch on to that.
CLAUDE
At some point a man's got to get
serious about his future. I'm sure
you have no idea what I'm talking
about.
RAY
You're talking about giving up
baseball to be a bank teller.
CLAUDE
Bank teller's just a start. I got
plans. Real plans. Not opening some
Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year
I'll be a loan officer.
RAY
A loan officer?
CLAUDE
That's right, a loan officer.
RAY
So you mean, if I needed some jack
to get my nightclub up and running,
I'd have to hype some square like
you?
CLAUDE
Uh-huh.
Ray pulls out his pocket watch. A mechanical tune plays as
he checks the time.
RAY
How would I get a loan, anyway?
CLAUDE
You need collateral.
RAY
(re: watch)
Like this?
CLAUDE
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
RAY
My daddy gave me this watch.
CLAUDE
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
RAY
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth.
You can say what you want about me,
but don't be dragging my daddy into
it. This watch means the world to
me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
CLAUDE
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Ray stuffs his daddy's watch back in his pocket.
RAY
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my
business elsewhere. And for future
reference, you are no longer welcome
at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
CLAUDE
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
RAY
When there is, you can forget about
it. And I swear to God, you ever
talk about my daddy again I'm gonna
kick your bank-telling, loan-denying
ass, you got me?
CLAUDE
Oooh...
RAY
I think I liked you better when you
kept your trap shut.
A dozen WHITE FOLKS look up as Ray and Claude push through
the door.
RAY
Man, something smells good in here.
How's everybody doing?
Nothing but sullen stares from all corners of the room.
CLAUDE
(sotto)
Maybe we oughta find another place.
RAY
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't
want a slice of that pie right over
there.
CLAUDE
I must have left my appetite outside,
which is where I think we ought to
be right now.
Claude tugs Ray towards the door but Ray won't be dissuaded.
He boldly addresses a YOUNG MAN in an apron behind the
counter.
RAY
Good evening, Billy. We'd like some
coffee and a couple of slices of
that homemade pie you've got
advertised.
BILLY
How you know my name's Billy?
RAY
It says so right there on your shirt.
BILLY
(glancing down)
That what that says?
Billy's MAMA sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and
steps up next to her son. She casts a disparaging glance at
Claude's suit.
MAMA
If you boys can read so good, how
come you missed that sign in the
window?
Claude considers the sign she's pointing to.
CLAUDE
You mean this sign? The one that
says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a
good question. Ray, how come we missed
the sign?
RAY
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all
day. We'd just like to purchase one
of those pies and we'll be on our
way.
MAMA
Those are whites-only pies.
RAY
Got any nigger pies?
Claude jabs him.
CLAUDE
Any fool could see those are whites-
only, not-for-blacks, come-on-let's-
get-the-fuck-outta-here pies. Thank
you very much.
Claude starts tugging Ray toward the door.
RAY
(sotto)
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle
Claude.
CLAUDE
(sotto)
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a
load of those crackers? Couldn't be
a mouthful of teeth among the bunch
of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight
with people like that for?
RAY
You're soft.
CLAUDE
What'd you say?
Diner patrons stare.
RAY
I said you're soft.
CLAUDE
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
RAY
I call it like I see it, and what I
see is definitely soft.
Claude narrows his eyes.
CLAUDE
Alright. You want some pie?
RAY
Yeah, I want some pie.
CLAUDE
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to
that counter and get us some fucking
pie.
Resolved, Claude stomps over to the counter.
CLAUDE
Excuse me, ma'am, I bet a brick will
turn that one right there into a
colored pie.
Claude lays down a dollar bill. Mama casually pulls a shotgun
from under the counter.
MAMA
And I bet this right here will turn
you into a colored pie.
CLAUDE
Okay, Ray, I think we can go now.
Much obliged...
Ray gives the whole place a cool once-over as Claude pulls
him out the door. Mama turns to Billy, still studying the
stitching on his shirt.
MAMA
Don't be concentrating so hard, baby.
You're liable to seize yourself again.
Ray emerges from the woods and heads down the hill toward
the juke joint. Claude hustles up next to him.
CLAUDE
I'm just gonna keep an eye on you,
make sure you don't do nothing stupid.
A ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the Mississippi.
The band is laying down some serious Delta blues, creating
an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption.
On a far side of the room, Ray is playing poker with some
LOCALS. He seems to be having a bad night. WINSTON HANCOCK,
a formidable black man, sweeps in another big pot and puffs
happily on his cigar.
OVER AT THE BAR
Perched on a stool, Claude shoots a dark look at Ray and
motions for the door. Ray waves him off and returns to his
game. Claude becomes aware of a soft, young female hand on
his shoulder.
SYLVIA
I've never seen you in here before.
CLAUDE
(staring at the hand)
That's because I've never been here
before.
SYLVIA
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
Against his better judgement, Claude's gaze follows the long,
slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on SYLVIA'S
angelic face. He is struck dumb.
SYLVIA
Can't you remember your own name?
CLAUDE
I know it begins with a "C"...
SYLVIA
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a
girl a drink?
(to the bartender)
Two bourbons.
CLAUDE
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an
eye on my friend.
SYLVIA
He looks like he can take care of
himself.
The drinks arrive. She places a shot glass in Claude's
reluctant hand. She winks provocatively and slowly pours the
whiskey down her throat. Instinctively, Claude tosses back
his shot.
CLAUDE
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's
never happened before.
SYLVIA
You're cute. You have any money,
Claude?
CLAUDE
Ten dollars. But I need it to get
home.
SYLVIA
Why would you want to go home? It's
so early.
The bartender refills their glasses.
BACK AT THE POKER TABLE
Winston considers his cards, hardly looking up as a WAITRESS
lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of
it. He glances at Ray, who casually considers his cards.
RAY
I'll take two.
The dealer tosses Ray a couple of cards.
INSERT -- Ray fans his cards to reveal a full house.
After considering the other players at the table, Ray pushes
what's left of his money into the center of the table. The
three other PLAYERS fold with disgust. Winston squints long
and hard at Ray, then pushes everything he has into the center
of the table.
WINSTON
I'll see that...
Winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some more
money on the pile.
WINSTON
And while we're at it, let's sweeten
the pot.
RAY
Looks like my sugar bowl's empty,
Mr. Hancock.
WINSTON
(reaching for the pot)
That's just too damn bad, ain't it?
RAY
Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through
with you yet.
Ray checks his cards again. He looks at the pot, it's a lot
of money. With this hand, there's no way he can lose. He
places his daddy's pocket watch on top of the pile. Winston
checks the time piece.
WINSTON
That'll cover it.
Ray lays down his hand.
RAY
Full boat, ladies doing the paddling.
WINSTON
Four threes.
Ray sits back, stunned. Winston rakes in his winnings. The
game is over for the night. The three other players head to
the bar.
WINSTON
Don't take it too hard, New York.
Have a round on me.
Winston tosses a silver dollar to Ray, who snatches it out
of the air. Winston drops his hat on his head and moves
through the crowd and out the door.
WAITRESS
Can I get you something?
Ray shakes his head. Carefully, she begins to clear the table.
Suddenly, he grabs her wrist. Winston's glass tips over. Ray
flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of
cards.
RAY
Looks like he had a whole lot of
nothing in his hand until you came
along.
WAITRESS
(wrenching free)
You're hurting my arm.
Ray dashes into the street, glancing both ways. No sign of
Winston. Damn.
Ray walks slowly down the hallway to Room 13. He is about to
knock when he hears the sound of lovemaking from within.
Ray opens the door and peeks in. Sylvia's on top and in
charge. Claude is concentrating real hard. Ray smiles to
himself and closes the door.
Claude hitches up his suspenders as he comes down the stairs.
He finds Ray having a drink at the now-empty bar.
CLAUDE
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
RAY
Here I am.
CLAUDE
Guess we better get going, huh?
RAY
Still got that ten dollars?
CLAUDE
Well, not exactly. See, I met this
girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing
girl. Her name's Sylvia.
RAY
That jelly you were talking to right
here?
CLAUDE
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs
this operation, and they ain't got
the money for it. Their church took
up a collection but they were still
short...
RAY
So you made a generous contribution.
CLAUDE
What can I say? When the spirit moves
me.
RAY
That was mighty charitable of you,
Claude. Looks like we both got fucked
tonight.
CLAUDE
What are you talking about?
RAY
While you were upstairs doing God's
work, I was getting jack-legged by a
fool with four threes.
CLAUDE
You lost all our money in a card
game?
RAY
He even got my daddy's watch.
CLAUDE
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --
(off Ray's glare)
I mean, how the hell are we gonna
get home without any money?
RAY
We've still got 36 cases of rum.
That's better than money.
In a holding cell, Ray tests the window bars. Solid.
Meanwhile, Claude sits on a cot brooding darkly. Through the
bars, we see the rednecks laughing and passing around a bottle
of bootleg rum with the DEPUTY on duty.
RAY
Man, this is gonna delay everything.
Spanky's gonna be pissed.
CLAUDE
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky.
Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a
name is Spanky, anyway? You're
responsible for this situation. I
blame you for everything. If it wasn't
for you, I'd be home having a hot
meal right now.
RAY
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing
up on the beach at Coney Island right
now.
(mocking Claude)
"I need all my thumbs and fingers
for praying and doing good."
The jailhouse door opens and Sheriff Pike walks in. He pauses
to give the prisoners the once-over. There's a fresh bandage
over the cut on his cheek.
PIKE
What do we have here?
DEPUTY
Billy Bob and the boys found them
down down under the hill with Winston
Hancock. He was dead. Looks like
murder.
PIKE
You don't say.
DEPUTY
Looks like they was running rum. Got
thirty six cases of evidence out
back. You want I should call in the
federal prosecutor?
PIKE
Let's not drag the feds into this. I
can think of better uses for that
rum than letting it collect dust in
some government warehouse up in
Nashville.
Pike winks at his deputy, then turns to regard the prisoners.
PIKE
Besides, why bother with bootlegging
when we got us a clear cut case of
murder?
RAY
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained
to your associate here, there's been
a mistake. We didn't kill anybody.
Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen
to work for a very important man in
New York.
CLAUDE
That's right. Does the name Spanky
Johnson mean anything to you?
PIKE
Afraid not.
RAY
Mr. Johnson is very well connected.
If you were to let us go, I guarantee
he would show you his appreciation,
if you know what I mean.
PIKE
Are you offering me a bribe?
RAY
I'm just trying to pay the toll on
the road to justice.
PIKE
You may be able to buy your way out
of trouble up in New York City, but
down here we take murder seriously.
CLAUDE
Look, man, how many times we gotta
tell you people, we didn't kill that
guy!
PIKE
Well, if that's the case, then you
don't have anything to worry about,
do you?
Pike turns his back on the prisoners and checks the time on
a gold pocket watch -- Ray's pocket watch. But from his cell,
Ray can't hear the mechanical tune.
PIKE
Time to get home to the missus. See
y'all in the morning.
In the cell, Claude turns to Ray.
CLAUDE
The man's gotta point. We're innocent,
after all. I just gotta get a good
night's sleep on this filthy mattress.
Keep our heads on straight, stay
cool, what's the worst thing that
could happen to us?
SMASH CUT TO:
The CAMERA Scorseses in on the JUDGE'S face...
JUDGE
Life!
The gavel comes down with a thundering crash. Stunned, Ray
and Claude resist the BAILIFFS' efforts to remove them from
the courtroom.
RAY
Life?! How long is life? We were
just walking back to the truck. We
didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
CLAUDE
Life?! What's life mean? There's no
way I can do life. I got a job starts
Monday morning!
They continue to protest loudly as they are dragged bodily
through the door.
LONG-CHAIN CHARLIE, a white prison sergeant, sits behind the
wheel. A shot gun hangs within easy reach.
The CAMERA MOVES BACK past grim-faced PRISONERS with their
hands and feet shackled. We arrive at Ray and Claude sitting
in grim silence as the bus lurches along.
Double bunks line the walls, with a footlocker for each
inmate. As usual, there's a poker game going on.
HOPPIN' BOB
Okay, ladies, got some fresh meat
for ya!
All activity comes to a halt as the new men shuffle into the
cage wearing their prison-issue "ring-arounds." Hoppin' Bob
slams the metal doors shut behind them.
HOPPIN' BOB
We ain't got no wallflowers at Camp
8. Everybody gotta dance eventually.
But don't worry, they won't try
nothing tonight. That would take all
of the fun outta the courtship.
The INCORRIGIBLES hungrily eye the new men in total silence.
Claude sticks close to Ray as they shuffle toward their
assigned bunks. The CAMERA SETTLES on a much younger WILLIE
LONG.
Wincing with each movement and covered in grime from the
day's labors, the new men bring up the back of the chow line.
COOKIE, the grub-slinger, slaps a large dollop of an
unidentifiable substance onto Ray's tray.
RAY
What is that?
COOKIE
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except
we're outta beef, so I had to
improvise.
RAY
Can't I get one of those steaks you
got grilling back there?
COOKIE
Those are for trusties, unless you
got thirty cents or two packs of
cigs.
Another prisoner lays down some tobacco and gets a juicy
steak. Ray grabs a hunk of corn bread and makes his way to
the back of the room. Claude steps up, holds out his tray
for Cookie.
CLAUDE
Excuse me, I don't like it when the
food touches each other, so if you
could just --
(SPLAT!)
-- keep everything separate.
Disappointed, Claude turns to discover that the only seat
left is next to Ray. Scowling, he limps toward it.
Jangle Leg's eyes follow Claude as he approaches the table.
Biscuit smacks him.
BISCUIT
Eyes front, mister!
Claude sits down and promptly goes to work scraping his burnt
toast with his knife. The irritating sound slowly brings the
entire room to dead silence. All eyes fall on Claude. Scratch,
scratch, scratch...
COOKIE
(stepping up)
Problem with the toast?
CLAUDE
It's fine now.
Cookie glowers and takes a seat.
RAY
Stop aggravating people. Just eat
your food.
As the room returns to normal, Claude starts polishing his
fork with his shirttail. Irritated, Ray shoots him a look.
CLAUDE
This fork is filthy.
RAY
The fork is the least of your worries,
Claude.
Undeterred, Claude breathes on his fork and polishes it some
more. Disgusted, Ray pushes aside his plate.
RAY
What's your name?
WILLIE
Me? Willie Long.
RAY
What are you in for, Willie?
WILLIE
That's a long story...
RADIO
When he was 13 years old he killed a
son-of-a-bitch with a claw hammer.
WILLIE
They never proved that.
CLAUDE
What a second, you've been in here
since you were thirteen?
RAY
What about you, Radio?
RADIO
Armed robbery.
JANGLE LEG
Damn liar. Bitch killed his sister
with an axe.
RADIO
She was my half-sister. Shit, I ain't
the son-of-a-bitch who poisoned my
own parents.
BISCUIT
(protective)
They deserved it. Very strict.
POKER FACE
What about you, Biscuit? You nearly
skinned your poor old landlady alive.
COOKIE
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus
with his bare hands.
RAY
You killed Santa Claus?
BISCUIT
(scolding)
On Christmas Eve.
POKER FACE
He wasn't the Santa Claus, he was
just wearing the suit and ringing a
bell.
WILLIE
What did you guys do?
The whole table waits expectantly for their reply.
RAY
I kinda lost track of how many people
we killed that night. Must have been
15 or twenty -- not counting women
and children. It was a real bloodbath.
All that screaming...
CLAUDE
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him.
We didn't kill nobody. We were
railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
RAY
He just blocked it out. Nigger's
crazy. He's the one who did all the
stabbing. He's capable of some heinous
shit.
(thumbing down the
table)
How 'bout him down there?
At the end of the table, GOLDMOUTH, a hulking specimen, snarls
menacingly, flashing a glittering set of teeth.
WILLIE
Goldmouth? They say he was born out
back behind the shithouse. That's
what they say.
RAY
You all been here a long time. Doesn't
anybody ever escape from this place?
WILLIE
They run but they never get too far.
RADIO
Couple years back, Cookie made it
clear to Greenville.
RAY
Greenville, that the nearest town?
WILLIE
(nodding)
It's a two-day walk if you don't get
lost. Take a mighty cagey country
boy to navigate the woods and bayous
between here and there.
BISCUIT
Those dogs they got can sniff a skid
mark in your underpants from a half-
mile off.
RAY
Alright, well, let's say you make it
to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
COOKIE
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
POKER FACE
That's where they nabbed him.
COOKIE
Didn't even get to have my peach
cobbler.
WILLIE
The most important thing they got in
Greenville is a train that heads up
north.
Just then, Goldmouth stands up, casting a shadow over Claude.
GOLDMOUTH
Hey, girl, you gonna eat your corn
bread?
Claude looks up, considering his options.
CLAUDE
No, man. I want you to have it.
RAY
Wait up there, Claude. You give that
guy your corn bread and the next
thing you know you'll be ironing his
shirts and clipping his toenails.
GOLDMOUTH
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
RAY
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I
love corn bread.
Ray picks up his corn bread and takes a huge bite out of it,
rolling his eyes with enthusiasm.
RAY
I thought my mama made good corn
bread but this is really something
special.
Ray looks at the faces around the room, smiles broadly.
Goldmouth is getting embarrassed.
RAY
Who knew I'd have to come all the
way down to this here prison, deep
in the asshole of the great state of
Mississippi, to find such a tasty
piece of corn bread?
The prisoners begin to laugh. Ray's got them now.
RAY
And who knew that in this great corn
bread-making institution I'd come
face to face with the biggest,
ugliest, stinkiest, ugliest gold-
mouthed negro in the entire world.
Now get out of my face before I lose
my appetite!
On Sundays, the mess hall also serves as a chapel. From a
makeshift pulpit, the blind REVEREND CLAY and his DAUGHTER
lead the congregation of convicts in a rousing chorus of
"Down by the Riverside."
Reclining on a straw mattress, Claude watches intently as
Daisy gets dressed. The rickety door reverberates with a
loud pounding.
HOPPIN' BOB
(off)
Time's up, Banks! We got a crowd
gathering out here!
Claude leaps from the bed and slams his fist against the
door.
CLAUDE
Woman came all the way from New York,
goddamnit! We'll come out when we're
good and ready!
Daisy quickly buttons up her dress.
CLAUDE
Did you go see my cousin Maynard
like I asked you in my letter?
DAISY
Of course I did. He said he'd file
an appeal right away. You didn't
tell me he was so good looking.
CLAUDE
Yeah, that side of the family has
all the looks and none of the brains.
I hope he don't mess things up.
DAISY
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer
to me. His offices take up an entire
floor of that big, new building on
125th Street, and he was using all
these words I never heard before. He
even offered me a job.
CLAUDE
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real
nice. You won't have to work long.
I'll be back soon enough. After I
start work at First Federal Bank of
Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in
style. Everything will get back to
normal again. That's a promise.
Daisy smiles weakly and looks away. She doesn't have much
faith in this promise.
DAISY
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to
know if he should file the appeal on
behalf of your friend, too.
CLAUDE
Ray Gibson?
(thinks about it)
No, no. He's the reason I'm in here,
Daisy. For all I know, he's got a
record a mile long. I got a better
shot of getting out of here on my
own. You tell Maynard to think about
me, concentrate on me. Understand?
DAISY
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Ray and Claude continue their conversation as they lather up
for a shave.
RAY
You want out of this place, don't
you? Don't tell me you're starting
to like it here.
CLAUDE
No, I don't like it here. Look around.
There's nothing but ass. Male ass!
Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm
getting out of here.
RAY
What does that mean?
CLAUDE
Forget it.
RAY
I'm not gonna forget it. What does
that mean? If you've got a plan, I
think I have a right to know about
it. I told you my plan.
CLAUDE
Getting a map from a chubby chef
named Cookie? Dragging our asses
through the swamps in search of some
worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan,
that's a vacation for two in the
hole. When you've got a map to New
York City, you get back to me.
Claude splits. Scowling, Ray finishes up his shave.
Moonlight streams through the barred windows of the cage.
Exhausted from the day's work, each man stretches out
painfully in his bunk.
JANGLE LEG
Sure was hot out there today.
COOKIE
Still too hot to sleep.
RADIO
Every bone in my body feel like a
big son-of-a-bitch dog got hold of
it.
GOLDMOUTH
I can't wait 'til Sunday.
CLAUDE
What's so great about Sunday? Monday's
right after it.
Restless, Radio rolls over.
RADIO
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that
nightclub of yours?
RAY
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
RADIO
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure
would like to see that place when
you get it up and running.
RAY
You should have come by last night,
Radio. You woulda had yourself some
fun.
WILLIE
Last night? What are you talking
about, Ray?
RAY
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly
blew the roof off the joint.
POKER FACE
Who?
RAY
Satchmo.
GOLDMOUTH
You mean Louis Armstrong?
RAY
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by
the club whenever he's in town.
CLAUDE
Hey, do we have to listen to this
bullshit? I'm trying to get some
sleep around here.
"Shut up, Claude!" echoes around the room. Irritated, Claude
thumps his pillow and turns his back on the room.
RAY
Yeah, things were hot last night,
but you'll never guess who's playing
tonight.
BLAM! A high horn note sounds.
SMASH CUT:
CLOSE-UP -- Biscuit, all dolled up and flashing a million-
dollar smile. She begins to sing.
BISCUIT
A tisket a tasket...
Biscuit is up on a makeshift platform in the bunkhouse,
lipsyncing to Ella Fitzgerald. But its not the depressing
bunkhouse anymore, it has transformed into Ray's Boom-Boom
Room. PULL OUT SLOWLY as Ray, decked out in a sleek tuxedo
steps in front of the CAMERA. He speaks into the CAMERA as
he walks...
RAY
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab
heading uptown. All the drivers know
Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
GOLDMOUTH (O.S.)
Hey, Ray...
Ray looks to his left, sees Goldmouth in the old bunkhouse.
GOLDMOUTH
Where am I at, man?
RAY
(in nightclub)
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta
watch the front door.
The CAMERA PANS off Ray to Goldmouth, in a tuxedo, at the
front door of the nightclub with two lovely ladies. He waves
to himself, sitting on his bunk. Himself waves back, smiling
like a kid in a candy store.
Willie is behind the bar, serving drinks to three gorgeous
SKIMMIES.
WILLIE
Hey, Ray, I could get used to this!
CLOSE ON Cookie sitting a table eating a huge porterhouse.
The CAMERA DOLLIES around to find Ray eating with him.
COOKIE
Ray, my man, this steak is like
butter!
RAY
Made just for you, Cookie.
COOKIE
How about some steak sauce?
RAY
No problem. Oh, boy!
Ray motions to a busboy clearing a table. It's Claude.
RAY
How about some Worchestershire sauce!
And clean that damn table.
Claude grimaces.
CUT TO:
Willie laughing, Goldmouth laughing, Poker Face in the bunk
laughing.
POKER FACE
Hey, Ray, I know you got some
gambling!
CUT TO:
Ray at a craps table holding a pair of dice. He looks at
Poker Face on his bunk.
RAY
C'mon, Poker Face, what's a club
without some dice?
The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Ray throws the dice. A perfect seven.
The CAMERA PANS UP to Poker Face in a tux clutching a fistful
of cash.
POKER FACE
Lucky seven! My nigger! Let it ride!
Across the room, Jangle Leg, in a tux, sits at the piano.
Radio, also in a tux, beats on the drums.
JANGLE LEG
Sing, girlfriend!
Biscuit sings the song, smiling lovingly at her man. Everyone
is having a great time in Ray's Boom-Boom Room, until...
Whistles blow. At the front door, Hoppin' Bob appears with
FIVE TRUSTIES dressed in police outfits. The incorrigibles
scatter.
RADIO
Hey, Ray, looks like trouble!
A hard white light from Hoppin' Bob's flashlight shines
directly into the CAMERA.
CLOSE ON Ray, in his bed, back in the old bunkhouse. The
music stops abruptly. He shields his eyes from the harsh
light. Hoppin' Bob is looming over him. It's back to reality.
HOPPIN' BOB
You don't shut up, you're gonna spend
the rest of the night in the hole,
Gibson! That goes for the rest of
you girls, too. I don't want to hear
another peep about no Boom-Boom
fucking Room!
A loud burst of flatulence cuts through the darkness. Hoppin'
Bob turns his flashlight on Cookie.
COOKIE
Sorry, Cap'n.
Scowling, Hoppin' Bob steps out of the cage and locks the
door behind him. The men slowly settle back in.
RADIO
(whispering)
Pretty good story, Ray. Didn't much
care for the ending though.
Lights out at Camp 8.
Claude rips open the letter. A profound disappointment settles
over him as he reads the news from cousin Maynard. Bitterly,
he crumples up the letter and tosses it down.
Radio's pulling in some jazz music out of New Orleans.
Prisoners hit their bunks as the floorwalker does the nightly
head count. He stops at Claude and Ray's empty bunks, glancing
around, puzzled.
Claude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel. TWO
WHITE TEENAGERS bolt up in the backseat where they were
necking. After a beat -- group scream. The half-dressed
teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road.
Claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars
to life.
CLAUDE
Come on, Ray, time to go!
RAY
I'm stuck!
Claude sees Ray caught up on the fence, then hears the sounds
of the approaching posse. If he floored it right now, he
might make it. But he can't just leave Ray hanging there.
An OLD BLACK PRISONER delivers a frosty mint julep to
SUPERINTENDENT ABERNATHY who rocks slowly in his chair. At
his feet, his 10-year-old daughter MAE ROSE is playing jacks.
Her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel.
MAE ROSE
Look, daddy. They caught those two
men who escaped last night.
Mae Rose is pointing down the drive, where Dillard and a
couple of trusties march Ray and Claude toward the house.
ABERNATHY
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're
convicts. And nigger convicts to
boot. Can you say nigger?
MAE ROSE
Nagger?
ABERNATHY
No, nigger.
MAE ROSE
Nigger.
ABERNATHY
That's my girl.
Bound by leg irons and handcuffs, Ray and Claude are deposited
at the bottom of the stairs.
DILLARD
Here they are, Superintendent. We
tracked 'em all the way to the
Tallahachie.
ABERNATHY
That's quite a ways. I'm glad you
New York boys could see some of our
lovely countryside while you're down
here. What do you say, Mae Rose? How
should we teach these two a lesson?
Mae Rose considers their faces. Ray and Claude look like
they've been to hell and back.
MAE ROSE
A night in the hole?
ABERNATHY
Better make it a week.
Dillard nods and turns Ray and Claude around. As they march
back down the drive, Abernathy takes sip of his mint julep
and affectionately pats Mae Rose on the head.
Ray slumps to the floor, propping his feet against the wall.
RAY
Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks
for coming back for me.
Claude considers his bleak surroundings. It's a small,
uncomfortable space, not even big enough to lie down. Just a
tin bucket for a toilet.
CLAUDE
Don't mention it.
RAY
(off)
Hell, you'd probably be half way to
New York by now...
CLAUDE
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it.
Ever.
The prisoners are gathered around a table, laying out money.
As usual, Poker Face is keeping tabs.
COOKIE
I'll take Claude to die on Wednesday
for fifty cents.
POKER FACE
Wednesday for two bits. And don't
forget you already owe me a steak.
BISCUIT
I'll take Claude for Friday. That's
my birthday.
With an ear to his receiver, Radio slaps his money on the
table.
RADIO
Weatherman says a heat wave's coming.
I say neither one of 'em son of
bitches gonna last past Thursday.
POKER FACE
I told you before, I don't take
pennies. Two cigarettes or one nickel
minimum. What about you, Willie?
Gonna get in on this action?
WILLIE
I got a crispy new dollar bill says
both of them gonna make it.
This gives the men pause. Willie tosses his money on the
table.
POKER FACE
Now that's what I call a bet.
GOLDMOUTH
It's a mighty long shot, Willie.
Nobody ever made it a week in the
hole.
JANGLE LEG
Not in August, anyway.
But Willie leaves the money where it is.
POKER FACE
Who else has some guts around here?
Poker Face makes notations as the betting resumes.
A slot at the bottom of the door opens. A tin plate of mush
slides through and the slot closes. Slumped in the corner,
Claude reaches for the food -- but a RAT beats him to it,
scampering out of the shadows and leaping onto the dish.
A commotion and wild screams come from Claude's cell. Ray
leaps to his feet, shouting through the wall.
RAY
Claude? You alright?!
Claude continues to stomp the rat.
CLAUDE
Can't take it no more, Ray! Die,
motherfucker! Gotta get the fuck
outta here!
Claude pounds against the door, raising a holy racket. We
continue to cut back and forth between cells as needed.
RAY
Keep it together, Claude. You wake
up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
CLAUDE
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting
outta here one way or the other!
Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Claude continues shouting and pounding.
RAY
All right, man, just settle down.
We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll
get outta here real soon.
CLAUDE
How the fuck are we gonna do that,
Ray?!
Ray looks around his cell. Claude's pounding is bound to
wake up somebody soon.
RAY
We'll just get off at the next stop.
CLAUDE
(stops pounding,
confused)
Say what?
RAY
That's right, we'll get off at the
next stop. The train's pulling into
the station right now.
CLAUDE
The hell you talking about? What
train?
RAY
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred
and Sixty First Street.
Claude focuses on what Ray is saying and starts to breathe
easier.
CLAUDE
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's
Yankee Stadium.
RAY
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers
are playing a double-header against
the Red Sox.
CLAUDE
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
RAY
I don't know. Who do you want?
CLAUDE
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
RAY
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right
here in the program. He's warming up
right now. Man, we're so close to
the field I need cleats. How'd you
get such good seats?
CLAUDE
I know people.
RAY
They must be the right people. Whoa,
there goes the hot dog man. Let's
get a couple. Damn, that smells good.
Nothing like a ballpark hot dog,
huh?
CLAUDE
You get ketchup?
RAY
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot
dog? Mustard's what you want.
CLAUDE
I can't eat it with mustard.
The men crowd around the windows.
RADIO
What's going on? Are they alive or
dead?
GOLDMOUTH
Don't look too good.
POKER FACE
They're not moving.
The inmates of Camp 8 cheer for the American soldiers up on
a makeshift movie screen. Instead of black and white stripes,
the prisoners now wear blue twill. In an audience of new
faces, the CAMERA FINDS some familiar ones. Ray and Claude
are surrounded by their crew -- Willie, Radio, Poker Face,
Cookie, Biscuit, Jangle Leg and Goldmouth. A decade has
passed.
Ray and some of the fellas are playing poker. Dillard's voice
drifts in through the open window.
RAY
(mouthing along)
If you step outside the gun line
without my permission, you will be
shot. If you trip and fall over the
gun line, you will be shot. If you
spit, if you pee, if you stick your
ass out and take a dump over the gun
line, you will be shot...
He lays down his cards and rakes in the pot.
The men of Camp 8 paint a fence along the drive leading up
to the big house.
RADIO
I heard Camp 12 got themselves a son-
of-a-bitch used to pitch for the Mud
Hens.
GOLDMOUTH
That boy got a year for jay-walking.
RAY
Judge must have money riding on the
championship.
CLAUDE
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the
mound. All I know is when this
season's over Camp 8's gonna have
pork chops.
Just then a U. S. Army Jeep swerves past the men and parks
in front of the mansion. Young CAPT. TOM BURNETTE helps MAE
ROSE out of the car. The prisoners stare furtively at her
long legs and curly blonde tresses.
POKER FACE
Looks like little Mae Rose has grown
up.
BISCUIT
And out.
COOKIE
Mmm-mm, that girl's got gams.
CLAUDE
She's got it all. And it's firm and
round and fully packed.
RAY
You shred it, wheat. That there is
fresh water.
Next to them, Can't Get Right stares openly, mesmerized by
her beauty. Ray nudges him.
RAY
Be cool, man. You can look, just
don't drool.
Up at the mansion, Abernathy and his WIFE come out onto the
porch, all smiles.
ABERNATHY
How was the honeymoon? Am I gonna be
a grandaddy soon?
MRS. ABERNATHY
Don't pay attention to the
superintendent, Tom. You're going to
stay for supper, aren't you?
TOM
Afraid not. I'm shipping out this
afternoon.
The prisoners steal glances as Mae Rose kisses her new husband
goodbye. She gives them quite a show, raising her leg behind
her just like Betty Grable. Then Tom climbs into the Jeep
and pulls away.
Mae Rose takes a long glance at the prisoners. The men all
look away -- except Can't Get Right who stands there smiling
innocently. Mae Rose gives him a little wink, then turns her
back and bounces up the steps.
Inside, a woman screams in agony. Then, the HEALTHY CRIES of
a new-born baby.
Superintendent Abernathy paces anxiously in front of a white
curtain surrounding Mae Rose's bed. Suddenly, Mrs Abernathy
staggers out from behind the curtain with a stricken look on
her face. She tries to speak, but words fail her. Her legs
go wobbly and she faints dead away.
ABERNATHY
Uh, doctor...
The DOCTOR steps from behind the curtain, drawing it behind
him. He checks Mrs. Abernathy's pulse.
DOCTOR
She'll be fine. She just had a bit
of a shock.
ABERNATHY
Is Mae Rose okay?
DOCTOR
She's doing just fine.
ABERNATHY
And the baby?
DOCTOR
(vague)
He's a big one.
ABERNATHY
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look
at him.
Abernathy pushes past the doctor and yanks open the curtain.
Mae Rose is propped up in bed, looking exhausted.
ABERNATHY
Well, where is he? Where's my new
grandson?
The NURSE turns around, cradling the baby in her arms.
Abernathy gently pulls back the soft blanket. His eyes widen
with horror upon discovering that the newest member of the
Abernathy family is black.
Ray passes around his latest batch of buck as the men discuss
Can't Get Right's professional prospects. The thump-thump of
the ball on the wall outside plays over.
POKER FACE
You really think they'll let him out
of here just to play baseball?
WILLIE
Why not? Boy's got God-given talent.
CLAUDE
God may have given it, but Claude
Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
RAY
Damn straight. I expect those
Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
CLAUDE
Crawfords.
RAY
Whatever.
COOKIE
(glancing out the
window)
Heads up, here comes trouble.
A dark mood hangs over the men. Jangle Leg sits stoically as
Radio fiddles with his receiver. Nearby, Poker Face and Ray
play a listless game of gin rummy. Claude is thumbing
distractedly through a dog-eared copy of Baseball Digest.
RADIO
Hey, fellas, I got Chicago.
But nobody can muster much enthusiasm for this news. Radio
shrugs and drops down on his bunk.
Just then, Can't Get Right walks past heading for the door.
He's dressed in civilian clothes, his bindle slung over his
shoulder.
CLAUDE
Hey, Can't Get Right, where you going?
Why you dressed like that?
Can't Get Right holds out a piece of paper which Ray
scrutinizes.
RAY
It's a pardon from the governor.
CLAUDE
Let me see that.
The incorrigibles gather around for a glimpse at Can't Get
Right's ticket to freedom.
CLAUDE
Where'd you get this?
Can't Get Right nods out the window. Stan Blocker is waiting
by his car.
Up on the porch, Claude brings a tray of minted iced tea to
Superintendent Wilkins, who sets aside his bible and washes
down a couple of pills.
Before going back inside, Claude can't resist taunting Ray,
busy trimming a hedge out in the hot sun.
CLAUDE
Oh, yard boy, these pansies could
use some attention over here. Perhaps
some fertilizer would restore their
exuberance.
Claude fills Wilkins' water glass as the Superintendent takes
a bite of lamb chop and winces in pain.
WILKINS
Damn dentures slipping again.
Everything falls apart when you grow
old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches
on.
CLAUDE
Yes, boss.
WILKINS
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at
the end of the summer, gonna try to
enjoy what few years I have left.
What do you think of this place?
It's one of those new retirement
communities down on the Gulf.
Claude glances at a glossy brochure. From outside, Ray peers
suspiciously through the dining room window as he hacks at a
rose bush.
CLAUDE
Ocean views, palm trees, two heated
swimming pools and a golf course --
sounds a damn sight better than that
infirmary across the way where I'm
gonna end up.
Claude returns the brochure.
WILKINS
I apologize, Claude. That was rude
of me.
CLAUDE
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot
more than a colorful brochure to
hurt my feelings.
WILKINS
You been on the farm for quite a
spell, haven't you?
CLAUDE
Over forty years now. Me and Ray
Gibson out there.
Wilkins glances over at the window. Ray ducks out of view.
WILKINS
Forty years. That's a long time for
any crime, even murder.
CLAUDE
It's a hell of a lot longer when
you're innocent.
WILKINS
Half the men in this prison swear
they're innocent. Don't you think
that's kinda funny?
CLAUDE
You have to forgive me if I don't
laugh.
Claude pushes back into the kitchen, leaving Wilkins to think
this one over.
Ray and Claude are getting ready for bed.
RAY
You and Wilkins sure are getting
chummy. You two planning on going
steady, or something?
CLAUDE
He's just a lonely old man. He likes
to talk.
RAY
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to
talk, too. So why don't we start by
talking about what kind of a plan
you're working on?
CLAUDE
I'm not working on a plan.
RAY
You can't fool me, Claude. I know
you got something brewing.
CLAUDE
Goodnight, Ray.
Claude punches his pillow and turns off the light.
Ray hacks a rose bush down to the nub. From the garage comes
the sound of an engine turning over. Wilkins' 1973 Lincoln
Continental convertible lurches down the drive with Claude
at the wheel. He screeches to a halt inches from Ray's legs
and climbs from the car.
RAY
What the hell are you doing?
CLAUDE
Don't touch that car.
Claude pulls out a hanky and buffs Ray's finger print off
the hood.
CLAUDE
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he
asked me to fill in for him.
RAY
You haven't driven in 40 years, you
ain't even got a license. Man's taking
his life in his hands, putting you
behind the wheel! Where you taking
him?
CLAUDE
Greenville. We're picking up the new
Superintendent at the bus station.
Ray scowls as Claude straightens his chauffeur uniform and
heads up the path to the mansion.
Wilkins pours a frosty drink and offers it to Pike.
WILKINS
Lemonade?
PIKE
I prefer bourbon.
WILKINS
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor
in the house.
PIKE
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Pike pulls a flask from his jacket and tilts it high. Claude
enters from the kitchen with the two steaming bowls of gumbo.
WILKINS
Hunting's been pretty good on the
farm the last few years. It's one of
the perks of the job. If you're
interested, tomorrow I could show
you some of my favorite spots.
PIKE
You don't have to twist my arm.
(digging in)
Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
WILKINS
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all
for tonight.
CLAUDE
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
WILKINS
Goodnight, Claude.
Pike nods coldly. Claude steps back into the kitchen.
PIKE
If you don't mind my saying, you
seem mighty familiar with your house
boy.
WILKINS
I believe in treating the convicts
with respect, if that's what you
mean.
PIKE
(sarcastic)
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
WILKINS
If somebody deserves respect, Mr.
Pike, they receive it from me, convict
or no convict.
Pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy
spoonful of gumbo.
A gurney carrying Pike's body is lifted into the back of a
van by two COUNTY CORONERS. Nearby, a distraught Wilkins
tells his story to a couple of SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES.
WILKINS
...I was drawing a bead on a bird
when Mr. Pike just stepped into my
line of fire.
DEPUTY #1
Where were the two convicts when the
shot was fired?
WILKINS
They were busy loading up the truck.
We got him back here as quick as
possible, but... I just feel terrible
about this...
Ray and Claude watch through the window as Wilkins talks to
the deputies.
CLAUDE
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
RAY
He knows nobody wants to hear the
truth.
One of the deputies pats Wilkins sympathetically on the back.
Then he and his partner put away their notebooks and head
for their vehicle. Wilkins heads up the steps and into the
house.
WILKINS
Well, I think they bought it. One of
the deputies belongs to my church.
Visibly shaken, Wilkins takes a seat, wiping the sweat from
his brow with a handkerchief.
WILKINS
I realize there's no way... There's
nothing I can say to make up for
forty years... I'll have Charlotte
prepare those pardon papers right
away.
Wilkins winces and swallows a couple of pills from his box.
WILKINS
Claude, mind helping me to the
bathroom?
CLAUDE
(giving him a hand)
Sure, boss.
WILKINS
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
"Oprah" blares on the television. Old convicts linger about
in various states of repose and decay. A young ORDERLY pops
to the music on his Walkman as he pushes a cart through the
ward.
Over at a table, Ray and Claude play poker with Willie, a
SHAKY OLD JUNKIE and TWO YOUNG GANG BANGERS. The currency on
the table isn't poker chips, it's pills of various sizes and
colors.
GANG BANGER #1
Two Percodan.
CLAUDE
I'll raise you.
GANG BANGER #1
What the fuck are those?
CLAUDE
Keeps your cholesterol down.
GANG BANGER #1
I look like I give a shit about my
cholesterol?
GANG BANGER #2 takes a quick hit of cocaine from a bullet.
He notices Ray staring at him.
GANG BANGER #2
You want a bump, G?
RAY
I wouldn't be putting that shit up
my nose. That came in in somebody's
ass. It's like you're sniffin' ass.
Maybe that's your thing, but it ain't
mine.
Ray pushes his bet to the center of the table. The shaky
junkie folds. Willie tosses in some pills and turns to Gang
Banger #2.
WILLIE
Looks like it's up to you, stinky
ass sniffer.
Glaring, Gang Banger #2 flips a big pill into the pot.
CLAUDE
Thorazine? Well, that's a little
rich for my blood.
He tosses down his cards. The shaky junkie attempts to light
a cigarette. The match slips from his trembling fingers and
falls into his lap.
CLAUDE
Damn fool gonna set this place on
fire one of these days.
Gang Banger #1 folds. It's back to Ray.
RAY
I got three stool softeners left.
(to Gang Banger #2)
That oughta be right up your alley.
The remaining players match the pot. Gang Banger #2 reveals
his cards. Willie frowns. Ray lays down his cards and
victoriously sweeps his winnings into a paper cup. Across
the room, Nurse Humphries enters with a tray of snacks. She,
too, is showing the years.
NURSE HUMPHRIES
Who wants Jell-O?
The magic word. The poker players join a stampede of oldsters
in a clatter of canes, walkers and artificial limbs. Ray and
Claude are left alone at the table.
RAY
Hey, where you going? We got money
on the table here!
Claude glances around to ensure that he's not overheard.
CLAUDE
You know, Ray, I've been chewing on
what you said this afternoon. I think
I got a plan.
Ray gives Claude a long look.
RAY
Are you trying to tell me after all
this time you finally have a plan
for busting out of here?
CLAUDE
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
RAY
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear
it. It's probably all fucked up,
anyway.
CLAUDE
You don't want to hear it, you don't
want to hear it. There's no shame in
that.
RAY
It's too late for plans.
CLAUDE
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson
say that. Hell with you then. You'd
only slow me down anyway.
Ray turns away as Claude walks off. A DODDERING INMATE stands
nearby slurping on Jell-O. His robe hangs open.
RAY
Hey, man, cover that shit up!
Disgusted, Ray discards his own Jell-O. He pulls out his
daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. The little
mechanical tune nags at him. He snaps the lid shut and
considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
An ALARM BLARES as the place fills with smoke. Wearing a
robe and slippers, Nurse Humphries runs among the prisoners,
helping them out the door.
Ray dodges flames as he presses into the inferno.
The CAMERA MOVES PAST a FIREMAN hosing down the truck, past
another group of soot-stained FIREMEN eating breakfast, and
pauses in front of two lockers. A couple of FIREMEN emerge
from the showers wrapped in towels and open their lockers.
They share a look.
FIREMAN #1
(to the room)
Alright, which of you hambones took
our clothes?
