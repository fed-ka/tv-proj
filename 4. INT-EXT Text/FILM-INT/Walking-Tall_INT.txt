SHERIFF WATKINS
You were gone a while huh?
CHRIS
8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months
back he fell asleep at the wheel and
uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man
and a good sheriff.
The family are eating takeaway.
CONNIE
I wish you would have told me you were
coming I would've cooked.
CHRIS
This is great.
MICHELLE
So what are you gonna do now that you're
home?
CHRIS
Well I was planning on working at the
mill, your letters never mentioned that
it was closed.
CONNIE
We didn't wanna bother you with our
problems when your father got laid off.
DAD
I got my business, you saw the furniture
outside.
CONNIE
I substitute at the elementary school,
Michelle pitches in. We try to keep
things simple.
A kid walks in.
MICHELLE
Pete! This is your Uncle Chris.
CHRIS
Hey Pete.
MICHELLE
Sit down, say hello. Last time he saw
you you were barely walking.
PETE
And now I'm camping.
MICHELLE
I said you could sleep on the couch.
It was Chris' room first.
CHRIS
Your tent's gonna take on water. I could
show ya how to rig it.
PETE
Doesn't look like it's gonna rain to
me Colonel.
MICHELLE
Pete, cmon sit down, have somethin to
eat.
CHRIS
First of all I was a sergeant. I worked
for a living.
PETE
Did you ever smoke anybody?
CONNIE
Pete!
MICHELLE
Pete!
PETE
Y'know, Papa's still got your gun locked
up in the garage. Think you could teach
me how to shoot?
CHRIS
I figured that'd be scrap metal by now
dad.
DAD
No, I'm still hoping that you'll melt
that thing down on your own.
CHRIS
Sorry Pete.
PETE
Whatever. I'm outta here Mom.
MICHELLE
Okay, be back by ten.
PETE
Ten thirty (as he walks out)
MICHELLE
Ten!
DAD
Remind you of anyone?
We can see from the window that it's raining heavily outside.
Chris sets about unpacking his things. Pete comes in looking
wet.
PETE
Ok it rained. Happy?
CHRIS
No. Why dontcha crash on the floor?
Pete looks at him.
CHRIS
Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash
on the bed.
PETE
uh uh. (starts walking out)
CHRIS
Pete. (hands him a towel). Keep ya dry.
PETE
Did you really kill people?
Chris looks at him.
The place is packed with gambling tables and attractive women.
FRIEND
Not bad huh?
CHRIS
Not bad.
RAY
Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling
needs under one great big roof. You
got your ATM machine, tellers to cash
your paycheck, and when you're here
you don't gotta worry about those lil
things like child support, rent, the
laws of mathematical probability.
WORKER
Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to
invite you to the VIP lounge.
RAY
Oh, 'Mister' Hamilton.
JAY
Heyyy, the dream team!
CHRIS
Nice place.
JAY
Yeah well. Welcome to my world. Look
tonight, all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how
much. And if you need a lil female companionship...
done. Alright? Have a good time.
CHRIS
Where you goin?
JAY
Don't you worry about me, I've got a
few things to do. Enjoy.
RAY
Just remember, nothin in here's free.
C'mon, this place is nothin but fake
boobs and real assholes if ya ask me.
Just water for me.
FRIENDS
Here's to you Chris.
They all down some drinks. They lead Chris down a corridor.
FRIEND
Don't say we never did nothin' for ya!
FRIEND 2
Don't worry, everybody's a lil scared
the first time. Get in there, sit back
and enjoy.
Chris' friends have led him to a stripping booth, his friend
inserts the money.
FRIEND 2
If you're not back by morning we'll
send a search party for you.
CHRIS
Bye! No drinking.
His friends leave, closing the door behind them.
A screen goes up and a striptease begins. The lady is dressed
in the style of a firewoman and has a pole in the center of the
stage. She dances around the pole and removes clothes.
STRIPPER
So you from here or just visiting.
CHRIS
Lil of both, I grew up here.
STRIPPER
So you've seen all the old faces.
CHRIS
Could say that.
STRIPPER
Your voice sounds very familiar.
The lights come on.
STRIPPER
Chris...
CHRIS
Deni..
The screen goes down again, Chris leaves the booth.
FRIEND 1
Look who's back.
FRIEND 2
So, good surprise?
FRIEND 1
Told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candy? (A girl is dancing on
their table)
CHRIS
Hey Candy. (to the guys) Let's go.
CROUPIER
6! Easy 6 for a win!
JIMMY
(To some girls) We can do a 6.
JIMMY
(To Chris) We're gettin killed out here.
I need you to put 200 down for the bet.
CHRIS
No, hell no.
FRIEND 3
Look at them (Nods to girls).
CHRIS
Ok.
CROUPIER
Five hundred on 6?
JIMMY
Yes, I'm in. Boom! Gimme some dice.
Chris notices something odd, he looks concerned.
CROUPIER
Lookin' for a 6.
CHRIS
Jimmy. Don't roll. Gimme the dice.
CROUPIER
Lookin' for a 6. Ohhhhh.
The dice have landed and it's a 7. Jimmy hangs his head.
CHRIS
(To the croupier) You're good, but I
saw it.
CROUPIER
Saw what?
CHRIS
I saw the switch.
CROUPIER
Hey this is a clean game asshole.
CHRIS
Yea?
CROUPIER
Yea.
CHRIS
Let's see about that.
Chris puts a load of money on the table.
CHRIS
Bet you I'll roll a seven.
CROUPIER
It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not
your roll. Call security.
Chris has taken the dice.
CHRIS
Put your bets down on the pass line.
These dice are comin up seven.
JIMMY
Chris, why don't we just let it go?
CHRIS
No, we gonna let it ride Jimmy. The
dice are comin up seven.
CROUPIER
It's not your roll sir.
Chris rolls the dice and sure enough it's a seven.
COMMISSIONER
No folks, no payout.
CHRIS
(To croupier) Why don't you just take
care of that bet and we're even.
CROUPIER
Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate
bet, you're not the shooter. It's not
your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir.
SECURITY GUY
Is there a problem?
CHRIS
Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded.
Does your boss know about this? Just
gimme my money.
The security guy grabs Chris around the neck. Chris elbows him
and throws him onto the table. The croupier takes a fighting
stance. Jimmy taps Chris on the shoulder.
JIMMY
Come on, let's go! let's go!
More security men appear, one of them knocks Jimmy out. A whole
fight breaks out, Ray gets knocked out. Chris beats off several
security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and
a baton to the face. Chris wakes up on a table under a light.
BAD GUY 1
(Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special
forces? I'll take that.
Chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again.
BAD GUY 2
What are you doin?
BAD GUY 1
(Has a scalpel in his hand) Special
forces... special treatment.
He rips open Chris' shirt.
BAD GUY 2
This guy knows Hamilton!
A struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up.
DOCHRIS
(To Chris' family) Folks, he's pretty
banged up, inside and out. Whoever did
this left him for dead. A lesser man
wouldn't have survived.
SHERIFF WATKINS
I'm gonna need a statement from him
Doctor.
DOCHRIS
He's in no condition to give you one.
SHERIFF WATKINS
I'll also need a copy of your write-up
along with toxicoloy, blood alcohol
level and so on.
MICHELLE
What are you talkin about Stan?
SHERIFF WATKINS
I'm just tryin to get some facts here.
MICHELLE
Oh come on you need to be out arresting
whoever tried to kill my brother not
testing his BLOOD.
SHERIFF WATKINS
I'm just doing my job Michelle. Ok?
I understand how you feel. But we still
don't know yet who started all of this.
CONNIE
Well it wasn't Chris.
DAD
Just find out who did this to him Stan.
SHERIFF WATKINS
I'll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really
will. In the meantime I have to file
a full report. You lemme know when I
can talk to him.
The doctor nods.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Thank you.
DOCHRIS
He's gonna be fine Michelle.
MICHELLE
Thanks.
Ray goes into a room and takes a big bunch of flowers from there.
NURSE
BEAUTIFUL flowers!
RAY
Thank you, they're for my best friend.
RAY
Hey sarge, so much for our VIP... status.
Don't they teach you any fighting skills
in the army.
CHRIS
How did you do?
RAY
Not good. But I tell you, that guy was
feelin me this morning.
Chris begins to laugh but is in pain.
RAY
You okay?
CHRIS
Some homecoming hey.
RAY
I don't know if you've noticed but this
aint exactly home any more.
A montage ensues with Chris on the couch, sometimes with Ray,
other times with Pete. Chris is recovering, and is exercising
by the end of it.
Chris pulls the cover off an old truck. He smiles and gets in.
He starts the engine.
DAD
Changed the plugs a while back.
CHRIS
Appreciate that Dad.
DAD
I might've had serious issues with your
career choice but just didn't seem fair
to take it out on an innocent truck.
Where you headin?
CHRIS
I was goin into town to get some supplies.
Wanna come?
DAD
Let's go.
DAD
Ya whole life, all you wanted to do
was get outta here. What made you come
back.
CHRIS
You gonna think I'm crazy. I been thinking
about the mill. When I was a kid goin
to visit you at work, the smell of that
fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.
DAD
Mmm I remember a lotta nice things before
the mill closed.
CHRIS
When did they go outta business? (Nods
to a closed supply store).
DAD
Closed about six months ago. There's
a home depot about fifteen minutes up
the road.
CHRIS
And that? (Nods to an adult XXX shop)
DAD
Don't ask.
They laugh.
CHRIS
Excuse me.
An officer is on the phone ignoring him.
CHRIS
Excuse me.
The sheriff comes out.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and
about, you're lookin spiffy.
CHRIS
I'm here to press charges.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Well this isn't about that incident
at the casino a while back is it?
CHRIS
Yea, it is.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Cause that matter's closed.
CHRIS
Did you look into it?
SHERIFF WATKINS
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.
CHRIS
An internal investigation.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Chris, I know you're familiar with the
term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's
what the casino is. Since the mill closed
down that casino is the main source
of revenue in this town. So, case closed
basically. I'll see ya.
CHRIS
I'm not gonna let this stand.
SHERIFF WATKINS
Excuse me? What did you say to me?
CHRIS
I said I'm not gonna let this stand.
SHERIFF WATKINS
You're lucky to be alive right now,
that's all you need to be concentrating
on. This is my town ok, I'm the sheriff
here. I'll tell you what will stand,
not the other way around. Now please
get out of my building.
Deni is at the door.
DENI
Hey.
CHRIS
Hey.
DENI
This belongs to you.
She hands him a leather jacket.
CHRIS
I appreciate that, I thought this was
history.
DENI
Coulda left it in the trash but I...
CONNIE
Deni? Nice to see you dear.
DENI
Hi Mrs Vaughn.
CHRIS
Can I talk to you outside for a second.
Mom I'll be right back.
Connie is on the phone.
CONNIE
And where is he?
LAWYER
I advise you to give this offer more
than a little serious thought. If you
go to trial you stand to do 18 years.
This is a sweet plea, normally they
wouldn't even put it on the table but
your military record can't be ignored.
Three months home arrest, some community
service. Pretty generous offer Chris.
CHRIS
But I'd have to plead guilty.
LAWYER
Look at it from the other side. There's
over a dozen witnesses, none of em are
gonna paint a very flattering picture.
We see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris.
WORKER
He started bustin up the machines...
GIRL
There was a gunshot..
WORKER
Went crazy...
GIRL
Complete psychopath.
CHRIS
They're only offering me this deal just
to keep me quiet.
LAWYER
Well I still say you should take it.
CHRIS
I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.
CASINO GUARD
Our job is to keep order. But there
was no chance of that. Me and my men
we were just tryin to control him. He
was highly trained, violent, very dangerous
person.
PROSECUTOR
So dangerous, so violent, so highly
trained that he despatched six of the
casino staff single handedly. His weapon
of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which
in his hand became a devastating force
with one aim, to hurt people, destroy
property.
WORKER
He went directly for everything. He
just came in and took over the place.
PROSECUTOR
You said he broke your arm.
WORKER
Yea that's correct, my right forearm.
Both bones with a single shot. It was
crazy.
CASINO GUARD 2
You know, toss out a coupla drunks now
and then. Guys try to grope the girls,
but ah nothing with this sort of violence.
PROSECUTOR
Did he give you any kind of advanced
warning? A chance to defend yourself.
CASINO GUARD 2
We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was
on a mission. Besides, he seemed to
be too busy enjoying himself from what
I could see.
PROSECUTOR
So from what you saw, it seemed like
he had some kinda purpose?
CASINO GUARD 2
I think he had a point to prove yeah.
WORKER
I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh
came in and started swingin.
GIRL
I was tryin to get outta there.
JUDGE
Mr Crow, you may present your client's
case.
CHRIS
(To his lawyer) You're fired.
CHRIS
Your honor, I'd like to plead my own
case.
JUDGE
Order, order. Mr Vaughn, if you choose
to represent yourself and not be represented
by legal counsel you realise that you
can't then claim a mistrial on that
basis.
CHRIS
Yes I do.
JUDGE
Very well Mr Vaughn.
CHRIS
I don't deny anything that was said
here today.
JUDGE
Does that mean you're changing your
plea to guilty?
CHRIS
I'm not guilty of anything. Except standing
up for myself when the law wouldn't.
OPPOSITION
Objection. He's trying to introduce
prior events your honor.
JUDGE
Sustained. Mr Vaughn stay on point.
CHRIS
I grew up in this town. People used
to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't
have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
JUDGE
Mr Vaughn we're not here to listen to
civic speeches.
CHRIS
And they wouldn't have stood around
while drugs were being sold to kids.
OPPOSITION
Objection.
JUDGE
Sustained. Mr Vaughn you're close to
being held in contempt.
CHRIS
I was justified in what I did, and if
you acquit me of these charges I'm gonna
run for sheriff. And if elected, I'm
gonna fix this town.
JUDGE
Order, order. Mr Vaughn you are now
charged with contempt.
CHRIS
And I will make sure that THIS (He opens
his shirt revealing huge scarring) never
happens to anyone again without punishing
those who did it.
JUDGE
I order the jury to ignore what they
have just seen. Mr Vaughn take your
seat. Order! Order!
JUDGE
Mr Forman, has the jury reached a verdict?
FORMAN
We have your honor.
JUDGE
Will the defendant please rise.
FORMAN
We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not
guilty.
The crowd breaks into cheer. Chris takes a tag from his piece
of cedar wood which is laying on the evidence table.
CHRIS
This is mine.
The crowds fade away with chants of 'Sheriff Vaughn'.
Chris takes a look around.
Chris is in the room with a shotgun.
DAD
Why does it always have to be your fight?
CHRIS
You might need this.
DAD
No. I put my guns down a long time ago.
CHRIS
You're just being stubborn.
DAD
You and me both boy. Chris, listen.
You be careful.
CHRIS
I will.
Booth is locked up, Ray is taunting him through a loudspeaker.
RAY
Please step away from the vehicle. Now
Mr Booth are you still upset over that
body cavity search? WOOOOOOOO! I forgot,
you got no vehicle. Please disperse,
there is nothing to s...
Chris has walked in.
CHRIS
Can I talk to you?
RAY
Yeah.
CHRIS
Over here?
RAY
Sure.
CHRIS
I'm gonna stay with him tonight. I need
you to take care of my parent's place.
RAY
You think they're gonna take it that
far?
Chris hands him the shotgun.
RAY
I'm with you man, I'll check in later.
CHRIS
Kay.
NIGHT TIME
Deni comes into the police station.
DENI
Don't shoot.
CHRIS
Hey
DENI
Hi. How's the food around here? Brought
you special treats. Salmon, Fried Chicken,
Potato Salad. You got cups?
CHRIS
Don't you have to work tonight?
DENI
Hmm I quit. I figured you know, you
were making some changes around here,
I could make a few myself.
Chris grabs her and they kiss.
Ray is on the couch and has just woken to a noise.
RAY
Who's that?
PETE
It's Pete. Want something to eat?
RAY
No I'm good man.
CHRIS
I gotta get a bigger bed.
DENI
No, no you don't.
DENI
I'm hungry.
CHRIS
Got leftovers...
DENI
Mm mmm, I want pancakes, and eggs, and
bacon.
A loud explosion happens, it's Chris' police truck outside.
BOOTH
WOOOOOOOOOOOO! I told you Vaughn! Uh
ohhhh. Who needs to step away from the
vehicle now Vaughn? Truck for truck
baby, that's right, truck for a truck.
Chris steps towards the front of the building but men outside
open fire, Chris ducks for cover.
CHRIS
(To Deni) Get down!
RAY
Pete, somethin's burnin.
Men with machine guns are still firing at the police station.
Deni's screaming, Booth is cheering.
CHRIS
Take that and get in there.
Chris gives Deni a pistol.
RAY
Pete?
Ray steps into the kitchen but gunmen have infiltrated the home.
A fight breaks out and Pete flees. Ray jumps onto the back of
a gunman.
Chris shoots up the floor with a shotgun and breaks a hole in
it.
Ray stabs the gunman with a potato peeler and knocks him out
with a frying pan.
CHRIS
(To Deni) Come here.
They get down into the hole in the floor.
CHRIS
When I say 'now' start shooting, over
there. Stay low.
Booth is now under fire and is scared.
BOOTH
Vaughn you gotta get me outta here!
Two other gunmen in stocking masks are holding the family hostage
upstairs.
DAD
I know who you are.
GUNMAN
Oh yeah?
The gunman takes off his mask and hits him with a pistol.
GUNMAN
(Calling downstairs) Burke?
GUNMAN 2
Check it out.
He goes downstairs to find Burke dead on the kitchen floor. He
follows traces of blood across the floor.
Chris is making his way towards Booth under fire.
BOOTH
C'mon! Get me outta here man!
CHRIS
What's it worth to you? Where's the
lab?
BOOTH
Screw you!
Gunshots hit near booth.
BOOTH
Ok! Ok! Hamilton's operation is at the
mill ok! It's at the mill now get me
outta here.
The gunman enters a room, Ray is there pointing a shotgun at
him.
RAY
Drop it!
CHRIS
Stay down!
Booth is standing and gets shot dead.
Ray shoots the gunman, who falls to the floor.
UPSTAIRS
MICHELLE
Ray!
GUNMAN 2
Stay down!
Booth is dead so Chris leaves him there.
RAY
(To gunman's body on the floor) Hey..
you okay?
UPSTAIRS
Gunman 2 looks away for a second and Michelle kicks him down
the stairs. As he tumbles down Ray reloads his shotgun. The two
begin firing at each other, taking cover behind the furniture.
WATKINS
Tried to warn ya Chris. Didn't want
this to happen.
One of the men outside has a canister. Watkins gives him the
nod and he begins walking towards the station. Chris is beneath
the floor and shoots him in the legs. The two remaining men outside
open fire again. Another gunman tries to approach but he's shot
in the legs as well. Watkins enters the station and fires repeatedly
at the floor.
WATKINS
Come get some! WOOOOOOOOO!
CHRIS
Deni! Now!
Deni fires off some shots. Watkins is distracted by the shots,
Chris appears in the floor hole and blasts Watkins at close range
with a shotgun.
CHRIS
Deni.... Deni.
Chris climbs out of the hole and they hug.
Shots are still being fired in the lounge. Ray and the gunman
begin to wrestle. Ray wins and punches the man repeatedly. Chris
has come back to the house and tries to pull Ray off the man,
Ray mistakenly hits Chris in the face.
RAY
I'm sorry!
Chris helps Ray over to a chair, Ray has taken a shot to the
leg.
The injured gunman from the kitchen appears brandishing a pistol.
GUNMAN
You stabbed me... with a potato peeler??
Chris and Ray hold up their hands. He aims at Ray but he's shot
in the back of the head by Dad who is approaching down the stairs.
CHRIS
You gonna be ok?
Dad nods.
The mill is dark, Chris is finding his way around using a torch.
He finds Jay sitting.
JAY
Hey Chris.
CHRIS
Get up Jay.
JAY
Just a sec. Remember we used to play
hide n seek up here?
Jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound.
JAY
That was my favourite sound.
CHRIS
Get up!
Jay stands up and holds up his hands.
JAY
Look... Chris... just...
Jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch. Chris falls
into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over
it.
Jay hits more switches, powering up the machinery.
JAY
You wanna know what my new favourite
sound's gonna be? The sound of you screaming
like a little bitch.
Jay hits Chris in the stomach with a pole a few times. Chris
grabs the pole and they both fall. Chris has hurt his leg. Chris
stumbles off into the woods. Jay grabs an axe and goes after
him, he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large
earthy embankment. At the bottom they come to their senses and
begin fighting again, Jay with his axe and Chris with a log he's
ripped off a tree. Chris knocks Jay out by hitting him hard in
the legs.
CHRIS
You're right Jay, this does change our
relationship. This is my town, you're
under arrest.
Chris and Ray are packing everything, the place is boarded up.
CHRIS
That oughta do it. WHAT are you doin?
RAY
Gettin some souvenirs, I'm gonna miss
the place!
CHRIS
That's how it starts. Next you'll be
accepting bribes, setting speed traps
all over town, cuttin up trucks. Not
to mention the cavity searches.
RAY
Speakin of which, do you think Jay's
got a casino in the pen?
CHRIS
Could be.
RAY
Runnin the shower tower with the felons.
He's probably blowin on somebody's dice
right now.
They laugh as they drive off. The mill makes a horn noise.
RAY
That's lunch.
CHRIS
Let's go pick my old man and grab somethin
to eat.
RAY
I'm with ya buddy.
