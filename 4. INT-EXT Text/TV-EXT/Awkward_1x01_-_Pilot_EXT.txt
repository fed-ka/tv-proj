      Students gossip in a quick series of shots:

    By the lockers...

                                  SPORTY BOY
                    That girl was in my Western Civ 
                    class last year.  I had no idea she 
                    was huffing spray paint...

    In the bathroom...

                                  NERDY GIRL
                    ...my mom s manicurist s friend s 
                    therapist was at the hospital when 
                    that girl came in.  I swear, it was 
                    pop rocks and coke... 

      Under the bleachers...

                                  STONER BOY
                    ....dude, way.  I heard when they 
                    pumped that girl s stomach they 
                    found like seven hundred pills. 

                                  STONER GIRL
                          (popping a pill)
                    What kind of pills?

    In the hall...

                                  EMO BOY
                    ...no, it was auto-erotic 
                      asphyxiation.
                          (tightening a skinny tie)
                    I love that girl.


                                  JENNA
                    I m officially losing it!

      Tamara and KEIKO (16, an Asian tomboy, sharp in wit, remedial 
      in brain) are at her side.  They huddle around her, worried.

                                  TAMARA
                    Breathe in and out.  There s no 
                    need to pull a Britney.                                                                                    16.


                                  JENNA
                      Everyone s treating me like I m in 
                    a bad  Lifetime  movie.

                                  KEIKO
                    You can be the one with Kristen 
                    Stewart.

                                  TAMARA
                    Kristen was date raped.    

      Keiko takes Jenna s bag as they walk down the hall.

                                  JENNA
                    You guys know I would never try to 
                    hurt myself, right? 

      Keiko and Tamara exchange quick glances.  Sure...

                                  KEIKO
                    We know, J.  

                                  TAMARA
                    I m hitting shuffle on the subject. 
                    What s with this all-school 
                    assembly on the first day?

                                  KEIKO
                    No idea.  But if it gets me out of 
                      Pre-Algebra, I m down.

                                  JENNA
                    Can we hide in the back?  I can t 
                    handle anymore lookie-loos. 

                                  KEIKO
                    Don t stress it.  No one s looking 
                    at you.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      All the students in a crowded auditorium looking at Jenna. 

                                  MAN (O.C.)
                    Teenagers at risk are incredibly 
                      vulnerable.

      We are:


      It s lunch time. Students mill about on a grassy quad 
      chatting, flirting and eating their mid-day meals. 

      ANGLE ON Jenna trying to sit comfortably on the grass but 
      falling to the side with no back support.  Keiko finally 
      helps her lean up against a nasty TRASH CAN.  Tamara stands 
      over them with a look of disgust.

                                  TAMARA 
                    She cannot sit against that.

                                  KEIKO
                    You have a better option?

      They look around.  There s no better option.                                                                                     22.


                                  JENNA
                    Gravity sucks. I ll take what I can 
                    get.  

      Keiko spreads out a napkin and wedges it between Jenna s back 
      and the trash can, adjusting Jenna just right.

                                  KEIKO
                          (laughing)
                    I wish you could see yourself.

                                  JENNA
                    Really?  Cuz I don t. 

      Jenna spots Matty in the crowd. He s hanging with a GROUP OF 
      CHEERLEADERS.  It s hard to watch. As she looks away, she 
      notices the not-so-subtle stares of students directed at her.

                                  JENNA 
                          (at wits end)
                    What is the fascination with me?!   

                                  KEIKO
                    You had a dance with death.  Like a 
                    bad car crash on the side of the 
                    road.  Everyone wants a peek.

                                  JENNA
                    Next person who stares is gonna get 
                    the evil eye.

                                  TAMARA
                    An evil eye, in your condition, is 
                    not gonna translate.  Just take 
                    your panties off and flash your 
                    cooch.

                                  JENNA
                    It s a plan. Just help me get my 
                    panties off and we re all set.

                                  BOY (O.S.)
                          (on a microphone)
                    Are you ready to rally?!

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    Perfect timing.  My school spirit 
                    was at an all time high.

      PAN TO a pep rally starting on the small outdoor AMPHITHEATER 
      STAGE led by JACKSON NARDUCCI (16, handsome, preppy, a leader 
      on campus).  The crowd of kids gives him half-assed CHEERS.                                                                                     23.


                                    JACKSON
                          (into mic)
                    I can t hear you!  

      The crowd cheers with a modicum more enthusiasm.  

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    We ve got a big football game today 
                    and there s no better way to get 
                    pumped up than with our...WHEEL OF 
                    PEP! 

      A GIRL pushes  THE WHEEL OF PEP  onto the stage.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    I need two guys and two girls to 
                    make this a fair fight.  Do I see 
                    Sadie Saxton raising her hand?

      ANGLE ON SADIE SAXTON (15, fat with a pretty face and 
        cheerleader. Despite her size, she s the queen bee and a 
      certifiable bitch) She flicks him off.  No way.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Sadie, get up here!

      Sadie reluctantly acquiesces as she abruptly jerks the lip 
      gloss out of a nearby Cheerleader s hands and applies it to 
      her own lips. 

                                  KEIKO
                    Looks like Sadie  Six Ton  might be 
                    hittin  seven tons.

                                  TAMARA
                    With all her money, you d think 
                    she d get some lipo. 

                                  JENNA
                    We don t know what her life is 
                    like.  Maybe she eats to fill a 
                    void.

                                  TAMARA
                    The only void she has is in 
                      personality.  She s a prima 
                      bitcherina who buys her popularity. 
                    I mean, how does a girl- who can t 
                    even jump two feet in the air- get 
                    on a pep squad?  

      Enroute to the stage, Sadie rudely walks past Jenna s crew 
      and TOSSES what she s eating at the trash. She misses, 
      nailing Jenna in the head.                                                                                      24.


                                  SADIE
                          (disingenuous)
                    So-rry

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    I never appreciated Sadie s 
                      bitchiness but I understood it. 

      Jenna looks at what hit her-- a half eaten  DietZone  bar. 

                                  JENNA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    She was hungry. 

      As soon as Sadie s on stage she grabs the mic.

                                  SADIE
                          (into mic)
                    Matty McKibben also wants to play.

      The other cheerleaders push Matty to the stage. On stage, 
      Sadie grabs his hand. Concerned, Tamara checks on Jenna who s 
      struggling to eat a sandwich with her one good arm as her 
      eyes are locked on Matty.

                                  TAMARA
                    We don t have to watch this. 

                                  JENNA
                    I m fine.  

      Jenna takes a big bite and chews with frustration.

                                  JENNA (V.O.) 
                    I wasn t fine.  Despite all my 
                    external wounds, my heart was 
                    probably gonna take the longest to 
                    heal.  And I was tired of the pain.  

      A MEATHEAD JOCK joins Sadie and Matty on stage with Jackson. 

                                    JACKSON
                    We need one more girl. One more....

      The crowd goes quiet. 

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    ...girl.

      PAN TO see what has shut everyone up. It s Jenna, a fierce 
      look in her eye and her hand- the good one- in the air.  


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    25.


                                      ACT THREE


      Tamara tries to push Jenna s hand down but she keeps it in 
      the air.  

                                  TAMARA
                    Your meds are malfunctioning.  

      Jenna awkwardly builds momentum to stand up. 

                                  JENNA
                    If everyone s going to stare then I 
                    might as well get on stage.  

      All the students on the green remain quiet as Jackson points 
      to Jenna.

                                    JACKSON
                          (into mic)
                    We have a taker. Come on down!

      She looks at her worried friends.

                                  JENNA
                    I know what I m doing.

      The sea of students part as Jenna carefully makes her way.

                                  JENNA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      Confession: I had no idea what I 
                    was doing.  But I couldn t look 
                    back.  At all.

      Jenna tries to look back but she can t turn her head.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Jenna stands close to Sadie. Sadie 

                                  SADIE
                    Personal space...ever heard of it?
                          (to Matty)
                    Save me.

      Jenna steps back, mortified, hitting Jackson.

                                    JACKSON
                          (off mic)
                    Name s Jenna, right?                                                                                    26.


      She nods. 

                                    JACKSON
                          (into mic)
                    Jenna, spin the wheel! 

      She spins the low rent wheel, landing on  SEX EXCHANGE .

                                    JACKSON
                    Sex Exchange is the name of the 
                    game and here s how it works: Our 
                      contestants will now pair up into 
                    teams of two...

      Sadie immediately grabs Matty, leaving Jenna with the Jock.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    ...then, they will go behind their 
                      individual partitions and race to 
                    change into each other s clothes.  
                    Whichever team gets dressed first, 
                    wins.  

                                  SADIE
                          (to Matty)
                    This is gonna be a joke.

      Jenna looks at her partner and motions to her cast. 

                                  JENNA
                    Should we even bother?

                                  MEATHEAD JOCK
                    Hell yeah!  We re in to win it!  Go 
                    team!

      He high-fives her bad arm. She winces.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    My partner was delusional. A case 
                    study in taking one too many in the 
                    head.  There was nothing to do but 
                    suck it up.

                                    JACKSON
                    Ready, set, GO!

      Jenna and the Jock head to their partitions on one side of 
      the stage, as Matty and Sadie head to theirs on the other 
      side.

      BEHIND JENNA S PARTITION--                                                                                    27.


      Jenna struggles taking off her clothes with her brace and 
      cast as the Jock s CLOTHES fly over to and hit the ground 
      around her. 

                                  JOCK (O.C.)
                    Hurry! Hurry! 

      Jenna easily gets her skirt off and passes it over to the 
      jock while the crowd cheers on the race.

      IN THE AUDIENCE--

      The crowd goes crazy as the clothes fly.

      BEHIND JENNA S PARTITION--

      Jenna is now stuck getting off her shirt. She tugs and pulls 
      and... finally gets it off, tossing it over.  

      ON THE STAGE---

      Matty s rushes out, swimming in Sadie s cheer uniform.

      Then, the Jock hits the stage, snug in Jenna s outfit.

      BEHIND JENNA S PARTITION--

                                    JACKSON (O.C.)
                    It s down to the girls.  Is it 
                    gonna be Sadie? Or is it Jenna?

      Jenna struggles to pull over the Jock s jersey.  She s stuck.   

                                  CHEERLEADERS (O.C.)
                    Go Sadie! Go Sadie!

      Fuck that, Jenna motivates and rethinks her strategy. Quickly 
      she maneuvers into his clothes by putting them on upside 
      down.  Her hands go into his jeans and head through the fly 
      and she puts on his jersey like a skirt.  

      Dizzy but determined, she stumbles out from behind the 
      partition and...

      ON THE STAGE--

                                    JACKSON
                    We have our winners!   

      Still disoriented, Jenna shrugs off the loss just as the Jock 
      grabs Jenna s good arm and raises it into the air.                                                                                       28.


      She s confused.  She looks across at Matty- who s alone.  
      Then- out to the audience-  Tamara and Keiko on their feet 
      cheering with a small crowd.  Realization of her win sets in 
      as a GROUP OF BURN-OUTS start to chant:  

                                  BURN-OUTS
                    Jenna! Jenna! Jenna! 

      She takes in the adulation of her tiny victory as we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The pep rally is over and the crowd on the quad is 
      dispersing. Jenna, now back in her own clothes, and glowing 
      from head to cast, comes out from behind the partition.

                                  TAMARA (O.C.)
                    Hamilton! You re an animal.

      Jenna walks over to the stage steps where Tamara and Keiko 
      are waiting.

                                  KEIKO
                    And you brought a whole new meaning 
                    to gettin  in a guy s pants.

      Suddenly, an onslaught of Cheerleaders push past them, 
      rushing over to Sadie, back in uniform and hysterically 
      crying.  

                                  JENNA
                    What happened to Sadie?

                                  TAMARA
                          (elated)
                    She couldn t fit into Matty s 
                    clothes. 

                                  JENNA
                    No...

                                  KEIKO
                    It was karmic intervention.

      Jenna looks over at Sadie.  Feels for her.

                                  JENNA
                    Can you guys meet me at the 
                    lockers? 

      The nod and leave as Jenna heads over to Sadie who s now 
      being consoled by her posse: LISSA, KARLI and VAL.                                                                                    29.


                                  SADIE
                          (through tears)
                    I ve never been so humiliated.  I 
                    hate that freak.  

                                  LISSA
                    It was a stupid pep rally. 

                                  KARLI
                    Already forgotten.

      Jenna cautiously pops her head in.  

                                  JENNA
                    Are you okay?

      The girls whip their heads like swords at Jenna.

                                  SADIE
                    No, I m not okay.  You picked that 
                    game on purpose!

      Is she kidding? 

                                  KARLI
                    Cruel much?

                                  JENNA
                    I just spun the wheel of pep. It 
                    could ve landed on anything.

                                  VAL
                    Lame cop out.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                      Misunderstandings were quickly 
                    becoming my specialty. 

                                  JENNA
                    Well, for whatever, I m sorry.

                                  SADIE
                      Puh-lease, I don t need someone 
                    like you to feel sorry for me.   

      Jenna s speechless as Sadie and company pivot her out.

                                  JENNA (V.O.)
                    It s true when they say that no 
                    good deed goes unpunished.   

      Jenna turns around and smacks right into...                                                                                     30.


                                  MATTY
                    Hey.

                                  JENNA
                    Hi.

      They look at each other.  Frozen.  He wants to say something 
      but the words aren t coming....

                                  MATTY
                    I...uh...

                                  KARLI
                    Matt-y! 

      The moment is lost.  

                                  MATTY
                    ...gotta go.

      Matty heads to the other girls. Disheartened, Jenna turns, 
      barely missing Matty looking back at her.  His stare is 
      wistful, inspired and maybe even... full of regret.

                                    JACKSON (O.C.)
                    Don t let her get to you.

      Jenna looks over to Jackson wrapping up the pep rally set.  

                                    JACKSON
                    Sadie loves to play the victim. 
                    You, however, have some serious 
                    backbone.

                                  JENNA
                    Which is about the only thing not 
                    broken on me.

                                    JACKSON
                    Not many people could ve done what 
                    you did today.

                                  JENNA
                    You mean when I added insult to 
                    injury?

                                    JACKSON
                    You were brave.

      Jenna takes this in as Lissa appears at the stage.

                                  LISSA
                    Babe, you gonna come grab some fro-
                    yo with us or not?                                                                                    31.


                                    JACKSON
                    I m having a conversation.

                                  LISSA
                    We only have ten minutes before the 
                    bell.

                                    JACKSON
                    Then, go without me.

      Unlike Matty, who thinks with the crowd, Jackson thinks for 
      himself.  Lissa walks away, annoyed.  

                                    JACKSON
                    So impatient.

                                  JENNA
                    Girls. 

                                    JACKSON
                    I better wrap up my stuff.

                                  JENNA
                    Yeah, my friends are waiting.

                                    JACKSON
                    Stay out of trouble, Jenna. I wanna 
                    see you around.

                                  JENNA
                    You will. I m sorta hard to miss.
