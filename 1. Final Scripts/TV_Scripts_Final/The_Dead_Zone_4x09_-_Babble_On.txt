          FADE IN:

  11EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

          A full moon illuminates the facade, casting ominous
          shadows.  A television flickers in a first level window...


  22NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE - INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          JOHNNY is sprawled across the couch, asleep; the remote
          control balanced precariously on his chest.  He stirs,
          sending the controller flying -- hitting the floor with a
          THUD.  A deafening burst of STATIC explodes from the
            television... Johnny bolts upright, now very much awake.

          He retrieves the remote, pressing buttons -- the television
          remains on.  He tosses it down, crossing to the front
          panel...  manually pushing off.  The static roars on. 
          Finally, he finds the plug and jerks it out of the wall. 
          SILENCE.  He turns his back on the set as it roars back
          to life again.


  33HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          Phone to his ear; the static still audible in the b.g...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you hear that?  That's the
                        brand new top of the line, Hi-Def
                        television you sold me...
                                (beat)
                        If I knew why it was making that
                        sound I wouldn't need you.

          He passes a set of closed double doors.  Hearing what
          sounds like MUFFLED POUNDING from within.  Johnny reacts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me call you back.

          Hanging up.  He slowly turns the knob and OPENS the door...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Hello...?          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - TEASER - 3/18/05 - PINK       2.


  44INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

            A virtual tomb, undisturbed for years.  Sheet-covered
          furniture.  Endless cardboard boxes.  Cobwebs abound. 
          Johnny cautiously ENTERS the room.  Uneasy silence, until
          the SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING is heard behind him.  Startled,
          he spins...


          NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY'S POV

            A mysterious FIGURE stares out a window.  His face obscured
          by shadows.  He appears to be CRYING.


          JOHNNY

          reacts to the intrusion, instinctively grabbing the first
          weapon he can find -- a dusty desk lamp.  Brandishing it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who are you? 

          No response.  Johnny takes a half step forward.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How'd you get in my house?

          Johnny steps slowly forward, his free hand reaching out
          and gently touching the man's shoulder from behind.


          THE FIGURE

          His HEAD SPINS QUICKLY around towards Johnny -- his facial
          features are grotesquely distorted; an indistinguishable
          blur of flesh and hair (scraggly beard).


          JOHNNY

            backpedals...  horrified he stumbles backwards, falling
          to the floor.  The boards beneath him begin to CREAK and
          GROAN; then collapses, swallowing Johnny whole...


  55INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - JOHNNY FALLING

          through an opaque cloud of swirling dust and debris; the
          world virtually whited out.  A beat of free fall before
          he hits the ground.  Disoriented, Johnny wobbles to his
          feet; recapturing his bearings... blindly stepping into
          the white abyss... choking on the putrid air... twisted
          fingers of light streak past, as he notices various POWDER
          COVERED OBJECTS... SHOES, BRIEFCASES, AN ACCORDION, A
          BANJO AND A TROMBONE.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - TEASER - 3/18/05 - PINK       3.


    5CONTINUED:5

          He looks ahead towards an undulating chasm of WHITE LIGHT
          and powers towards it...


  66EXT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

          Johnny stumbles into the bright sunlight of day, gasping
          for air... his visibility limited by the thick dust cloud
            obscuring the landscape.  He spots what appears to be a
          lifeless BODY face down a few yards way, covered in ashen
          soot; a virtual ghost.  Johnny reacts.  He spins to another
          BODY to his left... then one to his right, as a large
          ashen HAND grabs his shoulder from behind.  He SPINS around
          only to be confronted by a MAN'S FACE.  It's a horrifying
          sight, only the man's eyes are visible through a mask of
          fine gray powder.  He grabs Johnny by both shoulders as
          if trying to make him understand his problem.  Then he
          slowly OPENS HIS MOUTH -- producing the mechanical WHINE
          OF AN ELECTRIC CIRCULAR SAW...


  77INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          Johnny spasms to consciousness; covered in perspiration. 
          It was only a NIGHTMARE.  The television is nothing but
          STATIC, as he sits up and checks the time... 7:13AM.


  88INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny descends the stairs, as we HEAR another volley of
          POWER TOOLS and HAMMERING.  Protective tarps drape
            displaced furniture; the house clearly under renovation. 

          A small WORK CREW traverses the FRAME, directed by a
            clipboard toting FOREMAN.  He smiles as he sees Johnny.

                                        FOREMAN
                        Mornin' Mister S.  Hope we didn't
                        wake ya?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (surveys the mess)
                        How much longer, Hector?

                                        FOREMAN
                        I'd guess another week.  Two tops!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Two more weeks?






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - TEASER - 3/18/05 - PINK       4.


    8CONTINUED:8

                                        FOREMAN
                        You're looking at sanding and
                          refinishing two thousand square
                        feet of custom flooring.  The
                        good news is, whoever laid the
                          original hardwood really knew
                        what he was doing.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (slightly reflective)
                        My father.  He was quite a
                          craftsman... so I've been told.

                                        FOREMAN
                        From the looks of it, he must
                        have cut and installed each board
                        by hand.  You don't see this kind
                        of work anymore.

          Johnny SNEEZES.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Great, now I'm getting a cold.

                                        FOREMAN
                        No cold... dust.  It's all over
                        the house.  Oh, that reminds me,
                        have you decided what you want to
                        do with the office?

          Off Johnny's reaction; a nerve struck...


  99INT. HERB'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - JOHNNY

          stands amidst the same packing boxes and covered furniture
          from his dream.  Drinking them in with uncertainty...

                                        FOREMAN
                        It doesn't look like anyone's
                        been in here for years.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Almost thirty.

          Johnny is clearly not comfortable in this room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This was my father's office.  His
                        sanctuary.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - TEASER - 3/18/05 - PINK       5.


    9CONTINUED:9

                                        FOREMAN
                        You let me know what you decide. 
                        It'd be a crime to ignore a room
                        like this.

          He walks away, closing the doors behind him.

          Johnny considers the space, then gently pulls the sheet
          off a massive mahogany desk, admiring its dimension.  He
          then uncovers a leather arm chair and a built-in bookcase. 
          He studies the books, then reaches to open the cabinet  --
          WHOOSH! 


  1010INT. HERB'S OFFICE - VISION 

          The fingers of sunlight recede as day becomes night. 
          Johnny is now in the office, but it's different, like it
          used to be.  A small boy, YOUNG JOHNNY dashes through the
          open doorway and stops suddenly...

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        Daddy? 

          Johnny follows the boy's gaze across the room to where
          another UNIDENTIFIED MAN stands looking out the window,
          his back to CAMERA (the same MAN from his NIGHTMARE).

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        You run along now.  Daddy's got
                        things he needs to do.

          YOUNG JOHNNY, crestfallen, walks out of the room.  

          VISION JOHNNY steps slowly towards the mysterious man. 
          He has tears welling up... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dad? 

          Just as he reaches for the Man's shoulder, there's a
          POWERFUL CRASH from behind him.  He turns quickly to see
          HIMSELF holding a massive sledgehammer.  He swings down,
          driving the hammer into the floorboards.  A hailstorm of
          splintered debris.  He reloads, swinging down again...
          and again... a sense of overpowering desperation in his
          eyes... WHOOSH!


  1111RESUME - INT. HERB'S OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny backs away from the cabinet, overwhelmed with
            emotional stimulus.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - TEASER - 3/18/05 - PINK       6.


    11CONTINUED:11

          As he glances around the now empty office...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  1212INT. HERB'S OFFICE - DAY

          BRUCE leans over a corner of the oversized desk, his
          fingers hooked on the sides; preparing to move it.  Johnny
          is at the other end.

                                        BRUCE
                        This thing must weigh a ton. 
                        Where we supposed to take it
                        anyway? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm gonna put it in the garage
                        until someone can pick it up.

                                        BRUCE
                          I thought this was your father's
                        desk?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You gonna help, or not?

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, but if I get a hernia,
                        you owe me big time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        On three.  One, two, three...
                        lift!

            Straining against the weight, it's too much for them.

                                        BRUCE
                        I told ya' it was too damn heavy.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (oddly determined)
                        Maybe we can grab a few of the
                        workers to help.

          Johnny seems out of sorts.

                                        BRUCE
                        Dude, are you alright?  You seem
                          a little stressed.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I haven't been sleeping very well.

                          Everybody has bad dreams.  It's
                        the brain's way of processing the
                        stuff we don't want to deal with. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right.  Listen, help me get these
                        boxes out to the garage.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is all this stuff?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly sure.  Most of it
                          belonged to my father.

                                        BRUCE
                        These things belonged to your
                        father and you've never looked at
                        them?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He died when I was a kid.  I barely
                          remember the man.  

          Bruce finds a leather-bound photo album.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, family photos!

                                        JOHNNY
                          I really don't want to...

          Bruce flips open the book.

                                        BRUCE
                        Check out mini-Johnny!

          Johnny can't help but take a look.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (drinks it in)
                          I haven't seen these pictures
                        since I was... I can't remember.

          A faded photograph: YOUNG JOHNNY (7) alongside VERA.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        That your mom?

          Johnny studies the page with nostalgic satisfaction.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's her.

                        Yeah, she was.

          Bruce flips to another page.  A picture of Little Johnny
          and Mom at the pool.  A MAN stands off away from them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who's the dude scowling in the
                        corner?


          SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS

          All featuring HERB SMITH, in his mid thirties (Johnny's
          age).  He carries a distant stare in each picture,
            virtually expressionless and physically detached from his
          family.  As if burdened with a secret ripping him apart
          from the inside out.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's in almost every picture.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's my father.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man.  My bad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're right, it's weird.  I mean,
                        he's there, but he's not.  Like
                        he was afraid to get too close.

          Bruce can see how hard it is for Johnny to look at these
          old pictures.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's hard to know what's goin' on
                        in somebody else's head. 
                        Especially when you never knew
                        the guy.
                                (beat)
                        So what are you gonna do with all
                        this stuff?

          As Johnny considers the question...


  1313INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          PURDY is lecturing a TRIO OF STUDENTS.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT ONE - 3/18/05 - PINK     10.

                        So it's not only through God's
                          blessings that we know His love,
                        it's also through our hardships
                        and our trials.  It's in these
                        dark times that God's strength is
                        truly known and understood.

          He checks his watch.

                                        PURDY
                        And I fear you will all know this
                          darkness if I make you late for
                        your next class.

          The youngsters laugh and disband.  Purdy escorts them to
          the door.

                                        PURDY
                        Make sure you tune in to my
                          ministry broadcast this week,
                        it's all about breaking down
                          barriers in the attempt to find
                        that inner strength. 

          He OPENS the door to REVEAL Johnny.  He holds a large box
          in his arms.  The students exit.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, what a pleasant surprise.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was wondering if we could talk?

          Purdy senses his discomfort; gesturing him in...

                                                                        TIME CUT TO:

          Purdy pours himself something to drink.  Johnny stands
          near the window.

                                        PURDY
                        Can I offer you some iced tea? 
                        Passion fruit.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... thank you.

                                        PURDY
                        How can I be of service?

                        I was cleaning out my father's
                        private office and I found some
                        things.  I'm sure he'd want the
                          ministry to have them.

                                        PURDY
                        I don't know what to say.  This
                        is profoundly generous. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's mostly old photographs. 
                          Actually, you're in quite a few
                        of them.

                        Am I?

          Purdy reacts to Johnny's preoccupied gaze.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, is there something else
                        on your mind?

          Johnny wrestles with the question, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know this sounds strange, but
                        I've been thinking about my father
                        lately.
                                (becoming emotional)
                        It's just that he would have been
                        around my age when he... when he 
                        died.  And here I am, a grown man
                        and I have no memory of him.

                                        PURDY
                        Your father was a cherished friend. 
                        His death was tragic and untimely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Was he happy?  Because I gotta
                        tell ya, I look at these pictures
                        and I don't see a doting father
                        and loving husband.  I see
                          something else.  Something...
                          familiar.

                        Herb was like all accomplished
                        men... complex and unpredictable. 
                        But there's one thing you must
                          believe.  He loved you and he
                        loved your mother.

                        really need to know?

          Johnny can't tell if he's being supported or handled.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been having dreams... visions.

                        I feel like I'm losing control.

          Purdy sets his drink down, retrieves a card from his desk
          drawer and offers it to Johnny.

                        The phone number of a trusted
                        friend.  A doctor who specializes
                        in these matters.

                                        JOHNNY

                          I assure you, it's confidential.

          Johnny eyes the card, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to deal with this myself...
                        in my own way.

          He EXITS; Purdy watches him go, clearly concerned and
          conflicted.  What does he really know?


  1515INT. SMITH HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

          The front door opens, as Johnny ENTERS the house.  He
          slips his jacket off, then SNEEZES.

                        Welcome home.

          He crosses to the foyer closet (stepping directly onto
          the recently exposed hardwood floor) and opens the door. 
          Johnny's surprised to find the closet empty except for a
          solitary WHITE COAT.  He lifts it out and REALIZES it's
          actually...

          jacket and thrashes wildly up against a two-way mirror.

                                        HERB
                        You have to let me out before
                        it's too late!  Before they all
                        die!  


    15B15BRESUME JOHNNY

          As he flashes out of this very disturbing moment in time. 
          Still holding the jacket, Johnny looks slowly up into the
          mirror on the inside of the closet door and sees the
            reflected image of...


          REVERSE P.O.V. - MAN

          He stands directly behind Johnny but facing away.  It's
          the same FIGURE we saw in his original office VISIONS and
          NIGHTMARES.  Johnny is reluctant to turn, maybe even
            afraid...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dad?  Is that you?

          The MAN stands perfectly still.  Johnny finally musters
          his courage and TURNS...

          NEW ANGLE

          The MAN is gone.  It's beginning to become too much.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it?!

  1616INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny bolts upright, again ripped from a restless slumber. 
          Once again, it's all been another bizarre hybrid
            NIGHTMARE/VISION.  He checks the clock on the night
          stand... 11:25PM.  He hesitates, then reaches for the
          phone and dials...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Reverend, it's Johnny. 

          Off the sheer desperation in his eyes...

          A small stand-alone brick building.


  1919INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

            A compact space with dated furnishings.  We FIND Johnny
          alone in the waiting area.  He sits on the near end of a
          long leather couch.  An elderly looking RECEPTIONIST
          appears...

                                        RECEPTIONIST
                        Mister Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right.

                                        RECEPTIONIST
                        The doctor will be right with
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

          She EXITS.  Johnny glances around the empty waiting room,
          then RISES to grab a magazine, as he sits the CAMERA
          REVEALS...

          A LITTLE GIRL

          Now sitting at the far end of the couch.  She's blonde,
          around eight years old and holding a distinguishable
          looking RAG DOLL.  She doesn't make eye contact at first.


          JOHNNY

          slightly taken aback by her sudden appearance.  Did he
          not see her?  He isn't sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello.

          No response.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your doll's very pretty.  What's
                        her name?

          She just plays with her doll.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't see you when I came in. 
                        Are you here alone?

          Before she can respond, the office door opens REVEALING 
          DR. RANDOLPH JENSON.

                                        JENSON
                        Mister Smith?

          Johnny RISES.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny.  John.

                                        JENSON
                        Won't you come in, John?

          Johnny moves for the door, then hesitates a beat, looking
          back at the little girl... occupied with her doll.


  2020INT. JENSON'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          An eclectic arrangement of antique furniture.  A half
          dozen framed diplomas adorn a panelled wall.  An archaic
            psychoanalysis couch draws Johnny's attention and concern.

                                        JENSON
                        Most people choose to skip the

                          Randolph Jenson. 

          Jenson extends his hand.  Johnny regards the gesture with
          odd reservation.  Jenson astutely reads the cue, retracting
          his hand; gesturing to a pair of chairs.

                                        JENSON
                        Won't you have a seat?

          Johnny obliges, sitting.  Jenson follows suit directly
            opposite.  An awkward BEAT, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not really sure why I'm here. 
                        I mean, I'm actually not a big
                          believer in this sort of thing.

                                        JENSON
                        You mean talking?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just think people give up on
                        themselves too fast.  That they're
                        too quick to dump their troubles
                        on somebody else's door step.

                        But not you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, no... I mean, I just don't
                        think we can expect someone else
                        to solve our problems.  No offense.

                                        JENSON
                        None taken.  In fact it's quite
                          interesting.

                        Being both a skeptic and a psychic.

                        Gene Purdy told me you might be

                        He said you were a young man of
                        unique vision.  And that he
                          believed you were suffering.

          Johnny considers the notion of his pain...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been having these dreams...
                        Nightmares actually.

                        About?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure exactly.  It's like
                        I'm walking through a cloud of
                        dust.  I'm not sure where I am...
                        or what's happening around me.

                                        JENSON
                        Are you alone?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  There are others.  Men and
                        woman, children maybe.  They're
                        all covered in dust.  I can't see
                        their faces, but somehow I sense
                        they're pain.
                                (beat)
                        And there's the Man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't see his face either, but
                        there's something about him. 
                          Something familiar.

                                        JENSON
                        Is the Man also in pain?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.  He seems to be in more pain
                        than anyone.  This must all sound
                        crazy to you.

                                        JENSON
                        Crazy is a label.  A brand name. 
                        Like Chevy or Chrysler.  I'm

                        all means and send me a bill?

                                        JENSON
                          Textbook explanations aren't what
                        you came looking for.  There's
                          something else.  Something that
                        scares you.  Something about
                          yourself.

          Johnny reacts, rattled by the insinuation.  He rises to
          his feet...

                        couch.  She was blonde, carrying
                        a rag doll.  I assumed she was

                        Hasn't for nearly thirty years.

  2222INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny stands in the center of the empty room; cavernous
          and foreboding.  Silent contemplation.  He kneels down,
          running the palm of his hand across the freshly sanded
            hardwood.  Then, sprawls out on his back.  WHOOSH! 

          Johnny hears the distinctive SQUEAL of hard rubber tires
          on wood... peering down between his feet to SEE... 


  2323INT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT - VISION

          YOUNG JOHNNY on a skateboard gliding directly towards

          OF HIMSELF whizzes past.  Vision Johnny can't help but
          break a smile at the sight of himself.


          P.O.V.

          We're riding the skateboard, navigating through a maze of
          rooms and corridors... rounding a corner into the living

          NEW ANGLE

          as Young Johnny glides through a set of familiar doors,
            disappearing within... Vision Johnny excitedly follows...


  2424INT. HERB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny notices Young Johnny stopped and staring at
            something just behind the desk.  We HEAR a POUNDING SOUND
          from behind the desk.  Vision Johnny steps cautiously up
          behind the boy.  Immobilized by what he sees...


          HIS P.O.V. - HERB

          on his knees behind his desk, hovering over a gaping hole
          in the floor; the boards ripped away.  He's wearing his
          familiar rumpled suit and has the beginning of a beard. 
          A claw hammer tight in his slightly bloodied right hand
          as he tears at the opening in the floor and MUTTERS to
          himself --

                                        HERB
                        They can't see it.  They won't
                        believe... they won't understand...

          He STOPS in mid-sentence as his hollow eyes slowly rise
          to meet those of Young Johnny... 

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        Daddy?

          Herb's eyes are red and fraught with emotion.  Both happy
          and slightly bothered to see his little boy in this
          disturbing moment... as if caught in the act.   He brings
          a finger to his lips, 

                                        HERB
                        Shhhhh!

          He RISES and shuffles across the room and quietly closes
          the office doors.

          He returns to his previous position.

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        What are you doing, Daddy?  

                                        HERB
                        I can't explain, but maybe you'll
                        understand someday.  I pray you
                        will.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT ONE - 3/18/05 - PINK     21.


    24CONTINUED:24

          His hands tremble and his eyes fill with tears.  He starts
          to reach out to touch the boy's face, then decides,
            reluctantly, not to touch him.

                                        HERB
                        You have to go now.

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                                (begins to cry)
                        But I don't want to leave you.

                                        HERB
                        We'll be together again.  I
                          promise.  Now go. 

          Young Johnny picks up his board and walks towards the
          office doors...

                                        HERB
                                (softly)
                        Johnny? 

          Young Johnny OPENS the door and TURNS...

                                        HERB
                        Our secret. 

          Young Johnny nods and EXITS.  WHOOSH!

  2525RESUME - INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.  He looks to his left,
          spotting an oddly familiar looking sledgehammer resting
          against the wall.


  2626HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

          Johnny MOVES QUICKLY towards us carrying the heavy hammer
          in both hands.  There's a disturbed look in his eyes as
          he BLOWS THROUGH FRAME.


  2727HERB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny steps to the spot behind the big desk... spreading
          his feet, he grips the big hammer with both hands and
          hoists it high above his head...  violently swinging it
          down with a powerful THWACK!  (Exactly the way we saw him
          do it in an earlier VISION).  The iron head pierces the
          floor, obliterating the wood.  He reloads, swinging down
          again and again.  Finally, Johnny lowers himself to the
          floor.  He reaches down into the dark hole, slowly lifting
            something out.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT ONE - 3/18/05 - PINK     22.


    27CONTINUED:27

          His reaction tells us how significant and disturbing a
          find it is...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (low, to himself)
                        This isn't possible.

          As we REVEAL... the RAG DOLL.  Dirty and covered with
          cobwebs, but undoubtedly the same one held by the phantom
          Little Girl in Jenson's waiting room.  As he holds the
          doll, WHOOSH...


  2828EXT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - DAY - VISION

          White, lifeless FORMS are all around, as Johnny drifts
          through the clouded Vision...  Suddenly he sees them,
          those OBJECTS, only now he can tell what they really are... 
          a CLARINET, twisted and covered in dust, then a TROMBONE,
          an ACCORDION and a BANJO... his attention drifts...
          startled by the image of a SMALL BODY face down.  He
          reaches and TURNS the body over as we SEE it's the LITTLE
          GIRL from Jenning's office.  WHOOSH! 


  2929RESUME - HERB'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Johnny tosses the doll on the floor and catches his breath.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  3030INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny, alone, stares across at the leather couch that
          the mysterious Little Girl had previously occupied.  The
            Receptionist APPEARS...

                                        RECEPTIONIST
                                (surprised to see him)
                        Mister Smith?  Did you forget
                        something?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (covering)
                        Uh, yes I did.  My... wallet.

                                        RECEPTIONIST
                          I haven't seen it.  Maybe it fell
                        between the cushions.

          She starts to search, but Johnny cuts her off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's alright.  I'll just take a
                        quick look around and be on my
                        way.

                                        RECEPTIONIST
                        Very well.

          She smiles and walks away.  Johnny hesitates, as if
          standing on a precipice, then quickly crosses to the far
          end of the couch and sits... WHOOSH! 


  3131INT. WAITING ROOM - CIRCA 1977 - DAY - VISION

          Johnny watches a middle-aged WOMAN pace nearby, repeatedly
          consulting her watch; her clothing period style.  She
          reacts as the inner office door opens, producing the Little
          Girl and a YOUNG DR. JENSON.

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                        We made some real progress today,
                        didn't we Ally? 

          The Little Girl doesn't answer.  Vision Johnny RISES and
          steps closer. 

                                        MOTHER
                        We'll see you next week, Doctor.

    31CONTINUED:31

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                        Of course.  Good day. 

          The Mother leads Ally past Johnny and out the front door. 
          Then Young Jenson TURNS and looks directly at Johnny.

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                        I'll be right with you, Mister
                        Smith. 

          For a second, Johnny's sure he's talking to him, until...

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        What?  

                                        HERB'S VOICE
                        Thank you, Doctor.

          Jenson exits as Johnny spins around to see Herb sitting
          behind him, having just watched the same exchange.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (stunned to see him)
                        Dad?  

          Herb seems different, dressed in neatly pressed suit and
          tie and clean shaven.  His eyes are seemingly fixed right
          at Johnny...

                                        HERB
                        Looks like somebody got lost. 

          He RISES and crosses towards Johnny; almost as if he sees
          him.  He reaches out, his hand passes through Johnny, as
          he reaches for intended target -- the left behind rag
          doll.

          Johnny watches curiously as Herb examines the toy.  His
          expression conveys some kind of inner pain or torment. 
          Like he's in the beginning of something horrible.  WHOOSH! 


  3232RESUME - WAITING ROOM - DAY - JOHNNY

          Johnny flashes out of this disturbing vision, his confusion
          replaced by an angry realization...


  3333INT. JENSON'S INNER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Jenson dictates into a large, reel-to-reel type tape
            recorder.

                        Despite any physiological
                          impairment, the patient continues
                        to exhibit an aversion towards
                        verbal communication.  It's my
                        hope that continued psycho-therapy
                        will eventually unlock... 

          The door bursts open -- Johnny ENTERS...

                                        JENSON
                        Mister Smith?

                        Why didn't you tell me about my
                        father?

                                        JENSON
                        I'm not at liberty to discuss my
                          patients.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have a right to know.

                                        JENSON
                        And your father has a right to
                        have his privacy protected.  Even
                        behind the curtain of death.

          Johnny swipes a stack of books off a shelf; demonstrative
          rage.  Atypical Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm going to find out what's
                          happening here, I promise!

                                        JENSON
                        Tread lightly, Mister Smith, it's
                          a harrowing journey when you mine
                        the depths of another man's soul. 
                        You may not like what you uncover.

          Johnny EXITS.  Jenson watches him go, disturbed.

                                                                  INTERCUTTING WITH:          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT TWO - 3/18/05 - PINK     26.


  3535INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          Johnny paces with the phone.  Bruce watches curiously.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something bad happened to my
                        father, Walt.  Something this
                        Jenson guy knows about.

                                        WALT
                        We've been down this road.

                        What about his files?  You could
                        confiscate them.

                                        WALT
                        On what grounds?  A doctor can't
                          disclose personal information
                        about his patients, past or
                          present.  That's the law.

          Dial tone.  Walt reacts.

          Johnny hangs up, his frustration growing.  He SNEEZES.

                                        BRUCE
                        What did he say?

                        He can't force Jenson to tell me
                          anything.

          Johnny retrieves Ally's rag doll.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all connected to this.

                        I still don't get it.  Why would
                        your father hide some little girl's
                        doll under the floor in his office?

          PUSHING TIGHT on Johnny's face, as...


  35A35AFLASHBACK - HERB'S OFFICE

          Herb kneels over the hole in the floor and whispers to

          As he suddenly puts it together...

                                (the light goes on)
                        Maybe he left it for me.  But why

          Johnny SNEEZES again.

                        Damn dust!

          Bruce has a sudden thought...

                                        BRUCE
                        It's the house!

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        BRUCE
                        Think about it.  All the sanding,
                        the dust in the air, the floors
                        laid by your father's own hands...
                        It's unleashed a hailstorm of
                        psychic energy.  Psychic memories.

                                (catching on)
                        Connecting me directly to my

                        Maybe he's trying to tell me
                        something.  Something nobody else
                        was willing to talk about.  Not
                        Purdy.  Not Jenson.  Not even my
                        mother.  It's like he's reaching
                        through my Dead Zone.

                                        BRUCE
                        There's one for sure, it's going
                        to take more than visions and
                        nightmares to figure out what's
                        going on.

          Johnny seems quietly inspired by the challenge...          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT TWO - 3/18/05 - PINK     28.


  3636EXT. JENSON'S OFFICE - NIGHT - P.O.V.

          Jenson locks up his office.  Heading to his car, he backs
          up and drives past a...


          PARKED SUV

          As Johnny sits up in the front seat, then OPENS HIS DOOR...


  3737INT. JENSON'S OFFICE - STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

            A muffled CRACK and the window slides open.  Johnny climbs
          into the dark office.  A narrow spot of light snaps on...
            illuminating a row of steel file cabinets.  Johnny rifles
          through them.  Unable to locate the object of his search,
          he shines the light around the room until he locates a
          smaller, more secured looking metal file cabinet.  Locked! 
          He locates a screwdriver, forcing it into the lock...
          CRACK!


          FILE DRAWER

          Manilla folders, sorted by patients' last name.  He flips
          through.  Sanders... Sloan... Smith.


          JOHNNY

            retrieves his father's file, slowly opening it...


          CLOSE - ON JENSON'S NOTES

          A photo of Herb (pajamas and a beard) is clipped to a
          typed patient evaluation.  Certain key words highlighted...
          Manic depression... Paranoid delusions... Schizophrenia...


          JOHNNY

          reacts to the revelation that his father might have truly
          been insane.  He flips to the next page.


          CLOSE - ON THE DOCUMENT

          COMMITMENT PAPERS.  MOVING down the page to reveal the
            signature of VERA SMITH... Johnny runs his finger over

          Vera holds the same document in her hand, fighting back
            overwhelming emotion.

                                        VERA
                        Promise me you won't hurt him.

          She glances through the reflection in a large, TWO-WAY
          MIRROR.  IN AN ADJOINING ROOM... 

          Two ORDERLIES subdue an agitated Herb; fitting him with a
          straight jacket; BROCKMORE on the chest.

                                        HERB

                        don't understand, it's real! 
                        They're all going to die!  

            A Younger Jenson (40) fills a syringe.  Bleeding it of
          air before plunging it into Herb's arm as he makes a final
          impassioned plea...

                                        HERB
                        You have to warn them!  Please,
                        before it's too late...

          Herb succumbs to the powerful sedative, as Jenson glances
          back through the mirror at a distraught Vera.  The room
          suddenly floods with blinding white light... WHOOSH! 


    38A38ARESUME - INT. JENSON'S OFFICE - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny is suddenly startled as the LIGHTS FLASH ON.  He
          TURNS to see Jenson standing at the door, one hand on the
          light switch, the other leveling a small caliber
          revolver...

                                        JENSON
                        Don't move, Mister Smith!

          He shows him the gun permit.  Walt casts a concerned look
          across at Johnny, who sits in the back of his patrol car.

          WHOOSH!  


  4949INT. CAFETERIA - REALITY

          Walt, at Johnny's side...

                                        WALT
                        You coming?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, right behind you.


  5050INT. ABANDONED CORRIDOR - LATER

          Johnny, Walt and Rogers stand before an imposing steel
            bulkhead; rusted and badly pitted by time and neglect.

                                        ROGERS
                        We're slated to begin renovations
                        this summer.  Until then, the
                        east wing's been sealed off.

          Rogers slips a large key into the lock and turns it.

                                        ROGERS
                        Are you sure this is what you
                        want to see?

                                        WALT
                        This is perfect.  Thank you.

          Rogers regards Johnny's obvious intensity and walks off.


  5151INT. DERELICT EAST WING - CONTINUOUS

          The massive door swings opens with a loud CREAK.  Johnny
          and Walt enter to find a long-neglected corridor stretching
          out before them, an unsettling house of horrors.  Walls
          smeared with dirt and other unidentified substances. 
          Fluorescent fixtures hanging from frayed wires above. 
          The tile in shambles, littered with garbage and debris.

                                        WALT
                        You absolutely positive you want
                        to do this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have no choice.  I need to find
                        out what happened to him.

          Johnny runs his fingers over faded block letters painted
          on the wall.  We hear a WHOOSH, then he turns to Walt;
          pointing...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (moving)
                        This way.


  5252INT. TREATMENT ROOM - SECONDS LATER

          They stand in a windowless concrete room.  A small metal
          table and chair is all that remains.  Walt watches silently
          as Johnny slips into the chair, placing his hands on the
          table.  WHOOSH! 


  5353INT. TREATMENT ROOM - CIRCA 1977 - VISION

          Johnny sits in the same spot, now wearing a white hospital

          uniform.  The room refreshed... freshly painted and
          appointed.  He has become Herb.

                                        YOUNG JENSON (O.S.)
                        Are you hearing the voices now,
                        Mister Smith? 

                                          JOHNNY/HERB
                        They're not voices.  I told you
                        that a hundred times! 

          Young Jenson steps into FRAME.

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                        Then how do you explain it?  These
                        things you claim to know...  things
                        that couldn't possibly be real.

          Johnny squirms, a caged animal; a prisoner in his own
          skin.  His fingers pressed to his temples. 

                                          JOHNNY/HERB
                        It's not important.  I just want
                        it to go away!  You just need to
                        stop it and make it all go away! 

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                                (to an orderly)
                        Prepare the isolation room.

                                          JOHNNY/HERB
                        No... I can't be left alone! 

          He explodes, leaping from his seat.  Flipping the table
          enraged.  Cornering Jenson, grabbing him... 

                                          JOHNNY/HERB
                        We have to do something... We
                        have to stop them before it's too
                        late! 

          Jenson stares back into Johnny's wild eyes...

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                        You can't save everyone, Mister
                        Smith.  No matter how hard you
                        try.


          JOHNNY

            reacting.  The message somehow transcending the vision.

          RESUME SCENE

          an ORDERLY grabs Johnny/Herb, peeling him off Young Jenson.  

          A NURSE (40) steps to Young Jenson's side.  She wears a
          name tag on her blouse: LYDIA DAVIS.  She seems warm and
          comforting in a place full of pain and isolation.

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                          Three-hundred milligrams of
                          chlorpromazine and put him in
                          restraints.

          Nurse Davis regards the order with concern...

                                        NURSE DAVIS
                        Doctor?  I've worked with this
                          patient.  He's not usually violent.

                                        YOUNG JENSON
                        It's for his own protection.

          Nurse Davis crosses to Johnny.  He struggles against the
          grip of the orderly, who adjusts his hold; Nurse Davis
          offers Johnny a smile.  Her tone gentle.  Comforting.

                                        NURSE DAVIS
                          Everything's going to be okay. 
                        You have my word...

          Johnny regards her kind eyes... WHOOSH! 


  5454INT. TREATMENT ROOM - REALITY

          Johnny whirls out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was a nurse.  She was kind. 
                        My father trusted her.

          Off Johnny's conviction...


  5555INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny sits on a bench in the waiting area.  We see him*
          open a bottle of Tylenol, take a couple from the bottle*
          and wash them back with some water.  Walt appears holding*
          a sheet of paper.

                        I don't think she's gonna be too

          rocker in the next room.  Staring off.  Listless.


          NEW ANGLE - ON THE DOORWAY

          Johnny and Walt are flanked by her adult son, MARK (40).

                                        MARK
                        You say your father was one of

                        Many years ago.  I'm trying to
                        find out exactly what happened to
                        him and I thought maybe she'd be
                        able to help.

                                        MARK
                        I'm afraid you might be
                          disappointed.

                        It's gotten worse the last few
                        months.  Doctors call it
                          progressive senile dementia.

                          Similar.  Mom remembers things,
                        just not clearly.  She get's
                          confused, like she might think
                        you're me or somebody else from
                        her past.  She was a nurse for
                        nearly fifty years.  If she's
                        able to help, she will.

          Johnny nods his appreciation, crossing into the next room.

          NEXT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny eases into a chair by her side...

            disoriented, but still with eyes of compassion and love. 
          She slowly turns her head.  Regarding Johnny with odd
            recognition.  She offers a delicate smile...

                                        LYDIA
                        Honey, where have you been? *

          Johnny considers the moment, and realizing she's mistaken
          him for someone else...

                                        JOHNNY

                          I already gave the children their
                        bath.  Those babies want to wear
                        me out.  You aren't even dressed
                        yet.  Supper's almost ready.

                        Supper?  That's great, I'm
                          starving.  What are we having?

          She giggles; childlike innocence.

                                        LYDIA
                        Pot roast, silly... you know we
                        have pot roast every Sunday.

          She suddenly becomes frightened, disoriented...

                        Are you alright?

          Her whole demeanor has shifted now, darker and frightened.

                                        LYDIA
                        It's so dark here.  The day's

                        Yes, ma'am... I'll do that...

          Off Lydia's angelic contentment...


  6060EXT. SMITH HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny tears into the room and finds the doll up in his
          closet.  He holds it; both fearing and loathing...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want me to see?!

          WHOOSH!

  6262INT. ALLY'S BEDROOM - CIRCA 1977 - VISION

          Johnny is suddenly in the bedroom of a little girl; pink
          and frilly... dolls everywhere... a rocking horse. 
          Suddenly disoriented.  He TURNS...

            REVEALING Herb standing over a sleeping ALLY, watching
          her expressionless.  He kneels down beside her...

                                        HERB
                        Forgive me, Jesus, I don't
                          understand...

          Ally's eyes open, suddenly aware of Herb's presence.  She
          freezes, petrified.  Her breathing intensifies.  A deer
          in the headlights.

          NEW ANGLE - INCLUDE JOHNNY WATCHING

          Herb offers her a consolatory smile.

                                        HERB
                        Don't be afraid, I'm not going to
                        hurt you... I just need to ask
                        you some questions.

          He slowly reaches out to her, fingers hovering just above
          her arm.  Trembling, uneasy; uncertain... he makes contact.

                                        HERB
                        Lord, forgive me for the things I
                        do. 

          Ally screams... a blood curdling shriek.  She retracts
          from the contact, leaping out of bed.  Scampering away...

          Herb crumbles to the floor and begins to cry...

          Johnny steps towards him, his heart breaking; compassion
          and disgust at the same time.  As he passes the window,
            something catches his eye.  He steps to the glass, his
          expression reading utter disbelief...


          JOHNNY'S P.O.V.

          A man stands waiting on the sidewalk... young Gene Purdy.
          WHOOSH!

  6565INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Purdy at his desk, perusing a manuscript... basking in a
          rousing Vivaldi concerto.  A door SLAMS O.S. drawing his
          attention.

                                        PURDY
                          Hello... who's there?

          He rises, crossing to kill the music.  He TURNS, startled
          to discover Johnny in his doorway.  A disturbing glare.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny?

                        You're going to answer my questions
                        and you're going to do it now!

                                        PURDY
                        I don't understand.

                        My father broke into a house and
                        terrorized a little girl.  You
                        took him there.  I want to know
                        why?!

          Purdy knew this day would come...

                                                                        TIME CUT TO:


  6666INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny paces; a powder keg of emotion.  Purdy is seated.

                                        PURDY
                        Your birth marked the beginning
                        of a wonderful time for your
                          parents.  They had everything
                        they'd ever dreamed of.  Then,
                        around the time of your seventh
                          birthday, something changed.

                        Changed how?

                                        PURDY
                        Your father came to me.  He was
                          confused.  Despondent.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why?

                                        PURDY
                        He wouldn't say.  I pressed him
                        on the subject and he finally
                          admitted that he'd begun to see
                          things... things that weren't
                        always there.  That's when I
                        introduced him to Jenson. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        The same doctor you sent me to.

                                        PURDY
                        I hoped you'd discover what I
                        could never tell you.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Couldn't?  Or wouldn't?

                                        PURDY
                        You have to understand, I made a
                        solemn promise to your father.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What kind of promise?

                                        PURDY
                        He was afraid you'd only remember
                        the lost soul he'd become, not
                        the righteous man he truly was.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about Ally?  Was stalking
                        her the actions of a righteous
                        man?

                                        PURDY
                        Herb didn't know what was happening
                        to him... he felt himself slipping
                        deeper into the darkness.  For
                          whatever reason, he believed she
                        was the key to whatever was
                          haunting him.

                        And you just went along to offer
                        moral support?

                                        PURDY
                        Your father asked me to go with
                        him.  He was afraid he might do
                          something he'd regret.

                                        JOHNNY
                        To the girl?

                        To himself.

          Johnny looks back at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You turned your back on him.  You
                        and my mother sent him off to die
                        in that crazy house.

                                        PURDY
                        It was our only choice after he

                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (flares)
                        Answer the question!  Was my father
                        like me?!

                                        PURDY
                        Quite the opposite.  Heaven
                          bestowed upon you a divine
                          responsibility.  What happened to
                        your father was nothing born of
                        God.

          Johnny swims a raging current of emotions, then...

          Purdy considers the implications of the moment...

                        My name is Johnny Smith... Herbert
                        Smith was my father.

          The mention of his name sends a chill up her spine.

                          wrong... but I think... I think
                        he had a good reason.  Something
                        that compelled him to find you.

          She involuntarily reaches out...


          CLOSE ON THE DOLL

          as her fingers take hold, along with Johnny.  A connection
          made... WHOOSH!          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT FOUR - 3/18/05 - PINK    48.


6969A HARROWING VISION SEQUENCE

          People running, screaming... blood streaming down their
          faces... debris raining down from above... twisted steel...
          concrete... and a blast of powdered dust...

            A hellish scene as people fall, trampled; succumbing to
          the caustic atmosphere.  VISION JOHNNY watches the chaos
          surrounding him.

          We FIND present-day Allison, REVEALING only her bloodied
          and battered face; covered in a layer of white ash.  Having
          just suffered a violent death... WHOOSH!


  7070RESUME ON JOHNNY

          As the doll slips from his grasp, thrust from the vision;
          shaken.  By the time he regains his composure... Allison
          is already fleeing through the lobby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ally, wait!  You don't understand!

          She bolts into an open elevator, marked GARAGE; frantically
          pushing buttons.  Desperate to get the doors closed.

          Johnny rushes the elevator -- he can't make it.  He stands
            helpless; defeated.  His attention shifts, something O.S.
          catching his eye as he steps over to a wall-mounted office
          directory, scouring the list...


          OFFICE DIRECTORY - JOHNNY'S P.O.V.

          endless names and companies.  We land on ALLISON POTTER &

          with sudden clarity.  He takes off, running through the

          The dedication ceremony is gearing up... a podium set up
          out front; packed with VIP guests.  The Jazz Quartet
          entertains a large crowd of spectators; men, women, and
          excited children.

          milling through the crowd; keeping watch by the main
            entrance.  Other DEPUTIES in the b.g. Something nearby
          catches Walt's eagle eye -- 

          A large GAS COMPANY TRUCK pulls up to the building, a
          burly CONSTRUCTION CREW hard at work around a tangle of
          flexible piping descending an open manhole.

                          connected to a doll my father
                        came in contact with.  He thought

          Purdy ENTERS.  Johnny in a hospital bed; his arm wrapped,
          his face scratched and bruised.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Seems appropriate that I'd end up
                        here.  Allison?

                                        PURDY
                        She's fine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nobody else got hurt?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT FOUR - 3/18/05 - PINK    56.


    82CONTINUED:82

                                        PURDY
                        Not a soul.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good.

          An awkward lull, then...

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, about our last
                          conversation...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Forget it.  In some strange way,
                        I actually admire you for keeping
                        your promise.  There's not much
                          integrity left in the world.
                                (beat)
                        I still can't quite get my head
                        wrapped around it.  I mean, if my
                        father really did see that building
                          collapse... it would mean he was...
                        he'd have to be...

          He just can't say the word.

                                        PURDY
                        Does it really matter anymore? 
                        It's what you carry in your heart
                        that's important, Johnny.  And
                        your father carried you in his
                        until the very end.
                                (beat, then remembers)
                        Oh, I was digging through the
                          material you brought me, and I
                        found something I believe you
                        missed.

          He hands Johnny a business envelope.

                                        PURDY
                        I'll check in on you later.  God
                        bless you, Johnny.

          Purdy EXITS.  Johnny holds the envelope, then opens it
          and draws out a B/W photograph.


          REVEAL - PHOTOGRAPH

          Another candid old photograph from Johnny's childhood. 
          Only this one is different.  In this photo, Herb Smith
          isn't isolated and detached.  In this photo, he's holding
          young Johnny in his arms... and they're both smiling.

          RESUME ON JOHNNY

            reacting, moved.  Then he sets the picture on the night
          stand and climbs painfully out of bed... he crosses to
          the closet, where his personal effects are stored in a
          plastic bag.  He reaches in and draws out the rag doll...
          WHOOSH!


  8383INT. HERB'S OFFICE - CIRCA 1977 - VISION

          Herb PACES, slightly agitated and muttering to himself...

          Vision Johnny watches, helpless to do anything to ease
          his father's fragile mind (this is Herb before he was
          sent to Brockmore, but after he began seeing Jenson). 

                                        HERB
                                (to himself)
                        It isn't right... They need to
                        know... they need to see it. 

          Young Johnny ENTERS...

                                        HERB
                        They'll know when they see it. 
                        They'll believe...

          He STOPS as he TURNS and SEES Young Johnny... 

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        Daddy? 

                                        HERB
                        Johnny.  You shouldn't be in here,
                        son.

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        I saw the people, Daddy.

                                        HERB
                        People?  What people?  

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        In the building.  She told me
                        they're all going to die.  That
                        there would be a big explosion.

                                        HERB
                        Who told you? 

          He brings his hand up to REVEAL the rag doll...

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY
                        We can't let them die, can we
                        Daddy?  

          Off this unbelievable moment, the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

                                        YOUNG JOHNNY'S VOICE
                        Can we...?

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
