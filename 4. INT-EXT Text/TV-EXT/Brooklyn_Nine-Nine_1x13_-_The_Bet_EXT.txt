  Jake is in his Mustang.  He lays on his HORN, yelling.  
  NEIGHBORS and PASSERS-BY stop and look, annoyed. 

                              JAKE
                Amy Santiago!  Date Time!  Time to date!
                      (to a passing gawker)
                Hi there.  Sorry, I m taken.  The woman 
                who lives in that apartment loves me.

  Amy sticks her head out the door. 

                              AMY
                Peralta, this outfit is ridiculous. 

                              JAKE
                  Should ve thought of that before you 
                spent all year losing our bet.  Chop 
                chop, there s a lot of embarrassing to do 
                and not a lot of hours to do it in.

  Jake lays on his HORN again.  Amy exits.  She is wearing a 
  very puffy, bright blue dress with a big bow on the butt.  
  She looks like she just stepped out of a  90s Bat Mitzvah.

                              AMY
                Happy? 

                              JAKE
                Yes!  You look like every girl I ever had 
                a crush on at every Bat Mitzvah.  Let me 
                see the bow.

  She turns around.

                              JAKE
                Just like Jenny Gildenhorn.  I wish you 
                had braces.  Should we get you braces?  
                No -- that s too much.

  Jake exits the car.  He looks quite handsome in a tuxedo...  
  until he walks around to open Amy s door and we see that he s 
  wearing cargo shorts and sneakers.  

                              AMY
                Nice shorts.

                              AMY
                Do I really have to wear this all night?

                              JAKE
                You know the rules.  The date begins now 
                and ends at midnight.  I decide what you 
                wear, what you eat, and where we go.  Oh, 
                and there s one last rule. 

  He takes Amy s hands and looks deep into her eyes. 

                              JAKE
                No matter what happens, you re not 
                allowed to fall in love with me.

                              AMY
                Won t be a problem.

  Jake drives away and we reveal his car is dragging CANS and 
  has A SIGN that reads: 'Just Lost A Bet.'

  A TRUCK pulls up.  Jake and Amy perk up... but it rolls on.

  She reaches into his bag.

                That s what I said.  And the judge, a 
                stuffed owl, agreed.  He was later 
                  disbarred for accepting bribes.  I was a
