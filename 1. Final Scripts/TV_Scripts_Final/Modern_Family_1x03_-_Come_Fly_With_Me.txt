                                        ACT ONE


      INT. DUNPHY HOUSE - DEN - DAY11*

      Phil is planted on the couch watching a ball game as Claire 
      passes through.  She sees a bag of garbage by the door.*

                                  CLAIRE
                    I thought you were taking out the 
                    garbage.

                                  PHIL
                    I am.

      He stands and takes a step backward toward the garbage, never *
      looking away from the TV.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Phil.

                                  PHIL
                    I m getting it now.

      He takes another half step.  Irritated, Claire grabs the bag, 
      opens the front door, and nearly walks into DYLAN.

                                  DYLAN
                    Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.  Waiting for 
                    Haley.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Did you ring the bell?

                                  DYLAN
                    I texted.  She ll be down in a 
                    minute.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Tell her I said hi.

                                  PHIL
                    Dylan!  D to the Y to the --

                                  DYLAN
                    Hi, Mr. Dunphy.

                                  PHIL
                    You re just in time for the end of 
                    the game.       MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              2.


                                  DYLAN
                    I m not much of a baseball guy. 
                          (to Claire)
                    Haley says hi.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I was being --

                                  PHIL
                    Come on.  I ll catch you up. 

      Phil pats the couch.  Dylan hesitates.

                                  PHIL (CONT D)
                    Come on, I don t bite.

      Pats the couch again.  Dylan sits very awkwardly, like a cat 
      getting into a swimming pool.  He keeps as much distance from 
      Phil as he can.  Suddenly, Phil snarls at him, rabid dog-
      like.

                                  PHIL (CONT D)
                    Kidding.
                          (then re: TV)
                    Okay, see that guy?  Tying run.  
                    He s been stuck on second base 
                    forever.  I think he s gonna try 
                    and steal third.      
                          (then)
                    So, how s it going with you and 
                    Haley?

      Dylan is uncomfortable.  Is Phil baiting him or has he 
      unknowingly stumbled onto a truth?

                                  DYLAN
                    I think I m just gonna wait in the *
                    car.*

                                  PHIL
                    Knock yourself out, brah.*

      Dylan exits.*

                                  PHIL (CONT D)
                          (to Claire)
                    He s a little jumpy, isn t he?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Gee, maybe teenaged boys don t like 
                    hanging out with their girlfriends  
                    dads.        MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              3.


                                  PHIL
                    I thought we were past that.  I m 
                    all about taking it to the next 
                    level.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I thought you were all about 
                    keeping it real.

                                  PHIL
                    Yes, but the whole point of keeping 
                    it real is so that you can take it 
                    to the next level.  Did you really 
                    not know that?

                                  CLAIRE
                    You haven t exactly taken it to the 
                    next level with my dad.

                                  PHIL
                    What are you talking about?

                                  CLAIRE
                    We ve been married sixteen years 
                    and you still walk on eggshells 
                    around him.

                                  PHIL
                    What?  Are you kidding?  Jay and I 
                    are total buds!


      PHIL INTERVIEW22

                                  PHIL
                    Jay and I are  buds  with kind of 
                    an invisible asterisk.  He s not *
                    a... talker.  Or a hugger.  Once he 
                    ran over my foot with his car.  To 
                    be fair, he had just given up 
                    smoking.  But, basically, we re *
                    buds.

      INT. JAY & GLORIA S HOUSE - DAY33

      Jay is assembling the pieces of a remote control plane.  
      Gloria and Manny are getting ready to go out.      MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              4.


                                  MANNY
                    I wish I could stay home with you 
                    and fly toy airplanes.

                                  JAY
                    They re not toys, Manny.  They re  
                    models and they re very 
                      complicated.  You want to fly one 
                    of these you have to know all about 
                    airfoils, drag, lift, and thrust.  
                    These are all principles of 
                      aerodynamics.

                                  MANNY
                    The box says twelve and up.

                                  JAY
                    Where?

      Manny points it out.

                                  GLORIA
                    You can fly toy planes with Jay 
                    next time.  Today I want you to 
                    spend time with Luke.

                                  MANNY
                    Why?

                                  GLORIA
                    Because his mother invited you, so 
                    you go.  Family should be close.

                                  JAY
                          (re: box)
                    I m pretty sure this is a typo.

                    Men need their hobbies.  Manny s 
                    father had many hobbies.  Like 
                    hiking in the desert, or that kind 
                    of skiing where they drop you from

      Claire, Gloria, and Manny are in the kitchen.

                                  GLORIA
                    Manny brought his favorite game to 
                    play with Luke.

      Manny pulls a board game from a bag.      MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              7.

                    It s called EMPIRE.  You use *

                    Luke ll love that.  He s in the 
                    back yard.

      During the following banal dialogue, the camera catches Manny *
      looking out the window, where he sees Luke bouncing 
      mindlessly on the trampoline, a box on his head.  Manny puts 
      the game back in the bag.

                    I decided to make more of an effort 
                    with Jay.  Our relationship s 
                    always been stuck in that primal 
                    place where we started.  He s the 
                    old silverback protecting his 
                    females.  Then this younger, 
                    stronger gorilla comes swinging in, 
                    beating his chest.  Naturally the 
                      ape-ladies come running, presenting 
                    their nice scarlet behinds.  Papa 
                    ape wants to stop all that, but he 
                    can t.  That s just life.  I m not 
                    the enemy.  The enemy is poachers.

                          (then)*
                    Gloria, no...

      We see that Gloria is taking a picture with her phone.  
      Mitchell is also capturing the moment on a new video camera.

      Cameron feels Jay s arm.

      As the others (except Jay) playfully encourage him, Dylan *
      reluctantly joins in the hug.*
