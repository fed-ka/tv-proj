      HANK DOLWORTH, 40s, lies awake.  Not by choice.  Lights out, 
      head on his pillow, staring at his ceiling.

                                  HANK
                    Now.

    He turns to a bedside clock.  4:23.  A beat.  Another.  4:24.  
    He refaceshis ceiling and restarts his countdown:

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                      Fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty --

      LATER, he channel-surfs an old Magnavoxvia remote.  At this 
      hour, it s infomercial after infomercial for Rascals, bladder 
      control medications, etc..  Hank s in bed alone, a bachelor 
    as evidenced by the upkeep of his room: clothes not put away, 
      a ragged comforter, newspapers on the floor.  At first 
      mention of The Clapper, he turns off the TV.

      LATER, he s lying perfectly still now, pillow over his eyes.  
      Dead silence.  Then: any suspicion he s actually dozed off is 
      destroyed when he delivers a thunderous raspberry.


    He ties a robe over his t-shirtand boxers as he pads into 
    his LIVING ROOM.  He stops at a pile of mail accruing below 
    his mail slot and sifts through it with his toe.  Bill, bill, 
      overdue notice, second notice.  He bends over to pick that 
    one up and strains his back.  Fuckit, he ll get it later.

    He wanders into HIS KITCHEN and takes down a drinking glass.  
      Opens his fridge and removes a carton of milk.  It feels 
      light so he shakes it and peers inside.  Empty.

                                  HANK
                    Super.


      Body-Builder unloads groceries, muscle powders mostly, as the 
      bulldog waits for a treat that won t come.  DING-DONG!

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Winston, stay.

    AT HIS FRONT DOOR, Hank s on the front stoop, baseball-
      capped, skimmer and chlorine in his hands.  He s picking wax 
    out of his ear as Body-Builder answers the door.                                                                                    5.



                                  BODY-BUILDER (CONT D)
                    Yeah?

                                  HANK
                    Hey, cumtaclean your pool.  S okay
                    I go  round back?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    I m sorry?

                                  HANK
                    I m the pool cleaner.  You re Mr. 
                    Ehrengard?Am I saying that okay?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    No.  I mean: my name s not 
                    Ehrengard.

                                  HANK
                    This is411 Sierra Mar?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Yeah.

                                  HANK
                    You don t have a pool needs 
                    cleaning?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Don t have a pool.

                                  HANK
                          (just stares at him)
                    You sure?

      MEANWHILE, IN THE BACK YARD, Britt hops over a perimeter 
      fence, landing soundlessly.  He keeps low, in stealth-combat 
      mode, as he scours the yard, then creeps toward a rear door.

      BACK AT THE FRONT, Hank verifies the address on a work order.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Says here 411 Sierra Mar.  Can I 
                    ask a favor?  My cell just crapped
                    out on me, you mind if I borrow 
                    your phone, call HQ and find out 
                    where the hell I m supposed to be?  
                    It s a local call, promise.

      Body-Builder glances at the truck out front: Gomez Bros. Pool 
      Cleaners.  Big but not bright, he shrugs what the hell.                                                                                    6.



    IN HIS KITCHEN, Winston slurps at a water bowl as, outside, 
      Britt tries a door handle, locked.  He ducks down when Body-
      Builder enters the kitchen to fetch his cordless.  Once he s 
      gone, Britt resumes his b&e, reaching through a doggie door 
    and extending his arm up to unlock the knob.

    AT THE FRONT DOOR, Hank eyes the unkempt interior: looks like 
    his place.  Body-Builder returns with the phone; Hank dials.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  Nice house, by the way.

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    It s a messy right now.  Just split 
                    with the wife, it was her job to 
                    clean the place.  You married?

                                  HANK
                    Not that I know of.

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Smart man.  My ex, first she moves 
                    out, then all she does is bitch I 
                    won t let her take any furniture.  
                    I tell her,  You want it, you ll 
                    have to steal it. 

                                  HANK
                          (his call answered)
                    Hey, Martha, I m here over at 411 
                    Sierra Mar and I got a little 
                    problem...

    IN THE KITCHEN, Britt searches for Winston, who s wandered 
      into the living room.  Britt tries to coax him back. 

                                  BRITT
                    Pssst. C mere, boy.

      Britt scours the shelves.  Nabs an energy bar/pockets it. 
      Finds dog treats.  Waves one in the air for Winston s benefit 
    but the dog s wary.  He has no choice but totip-toe into the 
      living room to get him.  Hank (still on the phone with some 
      confused fellow he dialed at random) clocks him enter.

                                  HANK
                    ...sorry?  411 Sierra Madre?  Well, 
                    that makes a difference.  Okay, 
                    Martha, you re a peach.

      Britt scoops up Winston and tiptoes back the way he came, 
      flashing a mischievous smile at Hank, Body-Builder none the 
      wiser.  Hank hangs up and returns the phone.                                                                                    7.



                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Thanks again.


      Hank and Britt, regulars here, are greeted as such.  Britt s 
    on his cell as Hank finds seats at the counter.

                                  HANK
                          (to another REGULAR)
                    Hiya, Hughie.

                                  REGULAR
                    Hank.  Ever hear the one about 
                    Sammy Davis, Jr. s favorite song?

                                  HANK
                          (he has, from him)
                     Please Don t Talk About Me One 
                    Eye s Gone. 
                            (hisWAITRESS approaches)
                    Dottie, that a new apron?

                                  DOTTIE
                    Save it.  Two with everything?  
                    Your partner want fries?

                                  HANK
                    Hey, Short Straw: you want fries?

      Britt, john-bound, shoots him a thumbs-up/middle-finger.

                                  DOTTIE
                    That s a confusing gesture.

                                  HANK
                    He s a confused man.  Hughie, I 
                    tell ya what happened to me last 
                    night?

                                  HUGHIE
                    You just sat down.

      Britt enters the men s, still on his call; he stops a PATRON 
    at the next urinal from flushing.

                                  BRITT
                    -- no, that s fine, we ll keep him 
                    here at the office until then.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    9.

                                  BRITT (CONT'D)
                          (hangsup; to the Patron)
                    Thanks for waiting.

    He proceeds into a stall to puke his guts out.

      BACK WITH HANK at the counter, Hughie a captive audience --

                                  HANK
                    -- not only was the milk empty, I 
                    couldn t remember finishing it in 
                    the first place.  Senility.
                          (Hugh cups an ear: huh?)
                    Senility.  A sign you re getting 
                    old.  Like...

    As Hank indicates  loss of hearing,  he notices someone 
      sitting farther down the counter getting up.  He follows her 
      form as she begins to pass.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Hey, lookahere.

      GRETCHEN DOLWORTH, Hank s ex, stops.  A few years younger 
      than Hank but in much better repair.  Smart, stylish, Hank 
      blew it when he let her slip away (and he knows it).

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (a smile)
                    Hey.

                                  HANK
                    What reyou doing here?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Working my lat sand tri s, whatya
                    think I m doing here.

                                  HANK
                    Good to see you.  Say hi to Hughie.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Hi, Hughie.

                                  HUGHIE
                    Hello, Hank s ex.

                                  HANK
                    Can you sit a second?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Can t.  Things.  Though I do need 
                    to talk to you.                                                                                    10.



                                  HANK
                    I mailed this month s alimony.  
                    Sorry, I had to --

                                  GRETCHEN
                    -- postdate the check three weeks?  
                    I got it, don t sweat it.  Things 
                    are going that well, huh?

                                  HANK
                          (eyes on Winston outside)
                    We just closed a major case.

      Gretchen smiles, always aware when Hank s full of shit. 
      Then, out with her news:

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I m putting 298 up for sale.

                                  HANK
                    What?  You love that house...

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I also love to eat.  And the way 
                    the book market s going, I gotta 
                    choose between the two.  

                                  HANK
                    If you re having trouble with the 
                    mortgage, I can...
                          (they both know: he can t)
                    You sure?  You put so much work --

                                  GRETCHEN
                    We both did.  Yeah, I m sure, 
                    thanks.  It s time anyway I made a 
                    change.  The first open house is 
                    today.  I thought you should know.

      Hank s not only shocked, he s devastated by this: the last 
      monument to their marriage is to be auctioned off.  But he 
      does his best to disguise it, throwing up his hands: if 
      that s what you want, that s the way it is.  

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Thanks for understanding.  I better 
                    run.  Talk to you soon?

    She kisses him on the cheek and exits.  He watches her go, 
      still in love.  Britt returns.                                                                                    11.



                                  BRITT
                    Was that Gretchen?  What s she 
                    doing here?

                                  HANK
                    Her lat sand her tri s.
                          (to change the subject)
                    How s our client?

                                  BRITT
                    Stuck at work.  Office policy, she 
                    can t have pets there.

                                  HANK
                          (plucking dog hair from 
                          his sleeve)
                    Why, I wonder.
                          (then, as their food 
                            arrives, he makes a 
                            decision)
                    Say, Dottie, could you add on an 
                    order to go?  Grilled tuna on 
                    wheat, onion rings and a coke.

                                  BRITT
                    We going to go see Mags?
                          (Hank nods/checks if he 
                          can cover this)
                    Dots, one more burger, too.  
                      Protein-style, no onions.

                                  HANK
                            (cash-strapped)
                    Who the hell for?


    ON WINSTON, chomping down his burger, fed to him by Britt.  
      Hank stretches his back as he watches the floors climb.

                                  HANK
                    You have to do that here?

                                  BRITT 
                    You d rather I do it in the truck?
                            (pointtaken)
                    Gretchen was looking good today.  
                    You two should give it another go?
                          (there s nothing Hank 
                          would like more; he 
                            dismisses it with a wave)
                    C mon, you should ask her out.  
                    Tell her that milk story.                                                                                    12.




      They exit the elevator, Britt carrying Winston, Hank the to-
    go bag.  They approach a door:  MARGARET TYLER, ATTORNEY.   
      Before they enter, though, Hank stops Britt.

                                  BRITT
                    What?

                                  HANK
                      Shh-shh-shh-shh.

    He signals: listen.  Britt tilts his head to hear what s 
      going on inside when:

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          ( Close To You  again)
                    Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum...

                                  BRITT
                    Motherlover.


    The to-go bag lands before MAGGIE TYLER, early 30s; she rips 
      into and devours its contents like a lion with an early 
      Christian.  Hank and Britt sit, awed by her ravenousness.

                                  HANK
                    Remember the Jaws ride at 
                    Universal?  

                                  BRITT
                     Keep your hands and arms inside 
                    the tram at all times. 

                                  MAGGIE
                          (eating, unintelligible)
                      Upyoursyoumothers.

      Maggie moans, sated, and leans back in her desk chair; she is 
      eight months pregnant and looks about to pop.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    Whose pooch?

                                  BRITT
                      A client s.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Jesus, you guys aren t taking lost 
                    dog cases now, are you?  It s not 
                    gotten thatbad?                                                                                     13.



                                  BRITT
                    More of a search and rescue.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Well, make sure it doesn t pisson 
                    the carpet, huh, it s seiseland 
                    it s new.  Now: what prompts the 
                    pleasure of your company?

                                  HANK
                    Other than to witness this Olympic 
                    display of gluttony?  Why do you 
                    think, Mags?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Cause you need a job maybe?  Well, 
                    I got nothing.  At least, nothing 
                    right for you.

                                  HANK
                      C mon.We re housebroken.  We ve 
                    got our shots.  Britt just learned 
                    which fork to use with a salad 
                    course.  Throw us a bone.

    She takes them in, unable to deny:

                                  MAGGIE
                    There is onething.  But I was 
                    gonnarefer it to Baranskeyand 
                    Katz.

                                  BRITT
                          (scoffs)
                    Please.  Ask Baranskeyand Katz to 
                    find their dicksthey d start 
                    checking each other s asses.

      That stops the conversation cold for a sec.  Hank revives it:

                                  HANK
                    Who s the client?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Mr. L.B.Lindus of San Marino.  A 
                    missing personscase, think of the 
                    novelty.  It s full-freight, if you 
                    can remember what that means.

      Hank and Britt sneak a glance: full-fucking-freight!

                                  HANK
                    Sounds good.                                                                                    14.



                                  MAGGIE
                    Of course it sounds good.  It s 
                    actual work.

    She studies them, not sure whether to let them have it.

                                  HANK
                    C mon, Mags.  Who brought you the 
                    sandwich?
                          (then, re: Britt)
                    You gonnadeny this smile?

      Britt, prompted by Hank, smiles.  Maggie relents.

                                  MAGGIE
                    OK.  But only because I m a 
                      sentimental slob.
                          (shejots an address)
                    Head over right away.  Leave the 
                    dog in the truck and wear a tie.

                                  HANK
                    May your first child be a masculine 
                    child.

    She hands over the address and they start out.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Oh, there s one other thing.

                                  BRITT
                          (stopping)
                    Uh-oh.  She s got that  means 
                    business  look.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Got a call yesterday.  Apparently 
                    the LAPD put you on their Christmas 
                    list.  Naughty side, not the nice.

                                  HANK
                    Why?!
                          (she looks at him: you-
                            know-why)
                    We followed the book on that!  We 
                    didn t do anything illegal --
                          (Britt has to laugh)
                    -- that anyone could possibly 
                    prove!                                                                                    15.



                                  MAGGIE
                    I don t have to tell you it was 
                    your old pal Gustafson who flagged 
                    you.  Whatever bad blood is between 
                    you, well, it s bad.  So watch 
                      yourselves.  Because, as well we 
                    know, when the LAPD gets a hard-on 
                    they tend to stick it somewhere.

      This weighs on Hank.  They go.

                                  BRITT
                    Thanks, Mags.  We ll both walk a 
                    little straighter with that in 
                    mind.  Call if your water breaks.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Mr. Dee, Mr. Dum.  Go with God.


      Hank and Britt are led through the house.  Hank s buttoned 
    his shirt and wears a tie now; Britt s still in his t.

                                  BRITT
                    What is it about here reminds me of 
                    your place?

                                  HANK
                    Indoor plumbing.
                          (offBritt s appearance)
                    Tuck in your shirt at least, huh?

                                  BRITT
                    Not wearing a belt.


    ON A PHOTOGRAPH OF ELENORE, 19, brunette, cozily arm-in-arm 
      with another GIRL, a blonde.  They re at an  emo  party, a 
      cross between gothand punk.  Hank and Britt study the pic as 
      Lindus jots down Elenore s cell, license plate, car model.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    We found this hidden in her room.  
                    That s Elenore on the left.  I 
                    can t say I was shocked.  Ellie 
                    never showed much interest in boys 
                    in high school.

                                  HANK
                    Pretty girl.  We should probably 
                    take a look around her room 
                    ourselves.  Might be something, an 
                    address book --

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Is that necessary?  I mean, I feel 
                    strange enough siccing a pair of 
                    private eyes on my daughter.  
                    Having you toss her room...                                                                                    20.



                                  HANK
                    We d be very careful.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                          (he holds firm: no)
                    Besides, we ve been through it, 
                    Philip, Esther and I.  All we found 
                    was that picture and a parking 
                    ticket.

                                  HANK
                    Of course.  This is enough to get 
                    started on anyway.
                            (hescratches his scalp, a 
                          signal to Britt)
                    We should get going.

      Britt nods: signal understood.


      Lindus walks them out.

                                  HANK
                    Any idea who this other girl in the 
                    picture is, by the way?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I suspect that s Laura.  Ellie 
                    mentioned her a few times.  Last 
                    name Prince or Price, I can t 
                    remember.

      Britt fidget-grunts.  Hank and Lindus try to ignore him.

                                  HANK
                    You never met her?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    No.  She dropped Ellie off here 
                    once but didn t come inside.
                          (offanother fidget-grunt)
                    You alright?

                                  BRITT
                    Curry for lunch.  Always goes 
                    straight through me.

      Hank blanches.  Lindus points the way to the john.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Down the hall, past the stairwell, 
                    first door on the left.                                                                                    21.



                                  BRITT
                    Thanks.

      Hank shoots Britt a look: you have to do that here, now? 
      Britt shoots one back: yeah, I do, and goes.

                                  HANK
                    You don t happen to have that 
                    parking ticket still, do you?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Paid it. 

      Hank snaps his fingers: too bad.


      Britt smiles at the housekeeper on his way to the bathroom.  
      Soon as she s passed from sight, he darts upstairs. 


      Britt enters.  He canvasses a hope chest, then wanders into 
      Elenore s closet.


      Lindus hands an envelope to Hank.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I had this check cut as a retainer.  
                    Maggie Tyler didn t tell me who to 
                    make it out to.

                                  HANK
                    I should mention, Mr. Lindus --

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    -- please: Bing--

                                  HANK
                    -- because Elenore is not a minor, 
                    all we can do is find her for you.  
                    We can t force her to come home.

      Hank at last sees the figure on the retainer: holy shit.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I thought you said you were willing 
                    to bend the law when necessary?                                                                                    22.



                                  HANK
                    Bending the law is one thing, 
                    kidnapping is --

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I m sorry, I was kidding.  

      Lindus smiles and Hank joins him, unconvinced.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS (CONT D)
                    All I want is to talk to my 
                    daughter.  Make sure she s okay.  
                    The sooner I can do that, the 
                    happier we ll all be.
                          (asBritt returns)
                    Feeling better?

                                  BRITT
                    Much.  Nice towels in there.  You 
                    should take a look.

      Hank, demurring, offers his hand to Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Mr. Lindus.  We ll be in touch.


      Britt plays percussion on the steering wheel and sings as 
      Hank leafs through Elenore s diary.  Both he and Hank feel 
      good, filled with the bonhomie which comes from employment; 
      even Winston s in a chipper mood.                                                                                    23.



                                  BRITT
                     You ve got a thing about you.
                    I just can t live without you.
                    I really want you Elenore near me. 

                                  HANK
                    Full-freight for a runaway rundown.  
                    Son. Of. A. Bitch.

                                  BRITT
                     Your looks intoxicate me.
                    Even though your folks hate me.
                    There s no one like you Elenore 
                    really. A-bow-bow-bow-bow. 

                                  BOTH OF THEM
                     Elenore gee I think you re swell 
                    and you really do me well, you re 
                    my pride and joy --  

                                  HANK
                      -- etcetera.   Take a left here.

                                  BRITT 
                       Etcetera?   Really?

                                  HANK
                    Would I lie to you?  About that?  
                    Take a left.

                                  BRITT
                    What are you gonnado with the 
                    money?  Pay bills probably.  I know 
                    what I m gonnado.  

                                  HANK
                    Get a new polo pony?

                                  BRITT
                    Buy a really awesome hammock.
                          (Hank laughs)
                    What?

                                  HANK
                      I wouldabet the farm you were 
                    gonnasay  trampoline.   Take a 
                    right here.

                                  BRITT
                    Where we going?

                                  HANK
                    Places.  Take a right.                                                                                    24.



      Britt turns and before he knows it --


      A handful of PROSPECTIVE BUYERS roam the place as Hank and 
      Britt enter.  It s been a few years since Hank s lived here 
    and he stops to take it in.

                                  BRITT
                    Wow.  She did a lot of work in 
                    here.  These floors are new.
                          (then, bored)
                    Shouldn t we start looking for this 
                    girl?

      Hank nods/holds up a one-secfinger as a REALTOR approaches.

                                  REALTOR
                    Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Any 
                    questions about the property?

                                  HANK
                          (takes out their retainer)
                    Yeah, I have one.  If I give you 
                    this check as a deposit right now, 
                    how quickly can you get all these 
                    yokels out of here?

    Off Britt s reaction: hey, wait a minute--


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    25.


                                        ACT TWO


                                  HANK
                    Hi, I need to speak to a 
                      supervisor, please.
                          (he sput on hold)
                    Stop pouting.

    At the wheel, Britt looks glum.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    I mean it.  Makes you look effete.

                                  BRITT
                    I m not pouting.  I m fuming.

                                  HANK
                    Which is worse, I d think.

                                  BRITT
                    What are you doing buying a house?  
                    You could barely afford lunch an 
                    hour ago, how are you going to pay 
                    a mortgage?!  That check was half
                    mine.

                                  HANK
                    As is the deposit on the house now.

                                  BRITT
                    What, I m supposed to live with you 
                    too now?  Katie would love that.

                                  HANK
                    I bet she would.

                                  DMV SUPERVISOR ON PHONE
                      Supervisor.  How can I help you?

    As Britt continues to fume, Hank drops his voice:

                                  HANK
                    This is Detective Mark Gustafson, 
                    LAPD Robbery-Homicide.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  HANK (CONT'D)
                    Our computers are down here, 
                    wondering if you could run a plate 
                    for me?

                                  DMV EMPLOYEE
                    I ll need an ID voucher.

      Hank flips his visor to reveal a post-it with a list of LAPD 
      detective names and numbers.  He finds  Gustafson. 

                                  BRITT
                    Are you sure you wanna --

                                  HANK
                          (he is)
                    973-658-004.

                                  DMV SUPERVISOR
                          (the number checks out)
                    OK, Detective Gustafson, what s the 
                    plate number?

    As Hank reads off Elenore s plate --


    The place s barren but for a threadbare couch here and a half-
      rotted mattress there: clearly it s a crash pad for more than 
      just one person.  The Hipster leads Hank through.

                                  HIPSTER
                    What reyou doing walking your dog 
                    in this neighborhood anyway?

                                  HANK
                    Just driving through, Winston had 
                    to go.  Tell the truth, so did I. 
                    Dummy me figured I didn t need to 
                    leash him.  
                          (helooks around)
                    Sweet pad.  What s the rent on a 
                    place like this?

                                  HIPSTER
                    Why, you think I m squatting?

                                  HANK
                          (hands up: whoa)
                    I m just here to get my dog.
                          (hespies a makeshift 
                            RECORDING STUDIO)
                    Hey, you re a musician!

                                  HIPSTER
                    What couldagiven you that idea?

                                  HANK
                    I played bass in college.  You done 
                    anything I might veheard?                                                                                    29.



                                  HIPSTER
                    Man, if you dheard my stuff, then 
                    my stuff would be bullshit.

      Hank s CELL RINGS. 

                                  HANK
                    Excuse me.
                          (heanswers)
                    Hey, honey.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


    The anti Barnes & Noble: small, quaint, well-appointed.  
      Gretchen s the owner/sole employee.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    My realtor just phoned to say you 
                    strolled in half an hour ago and 
                    took my house off the market.  My
                    house.  What the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  HANK
                          (keeps his tone familial, 
                          for Hipster s sake)
                    I sensed a certain reluctance on 
                    your part this morning about 
                    selling so I took action.

    As Hank chats, his eyes canvass the space.  A sticker on a 
      guitar case matches the logo outside:  Dirty Sanchez.   The 
      Hipster, meanwhile, heads to a door to the parking lot. 

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You know how hard it is to sell a 
                    home in this market?!  You know how 
                    much harder it ll be when it falls 
                    out of escrow because your check 
                    bounced?

                                  HANK
                    It won t bounce.

                                  HIPSTER
                          (let s go)
                    Dude.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Not to mention how inappropriate, 
                    how wildly invasive--                                                                                    30.



                                  HANK
                    Honey, we ll talk about this later.
                          (hehangs up)
                    My wife.  She s a pistol.


    -- and it s obvious the moment they step inside how wildly 
    out of place they are.  Because this joint is emos-only.A 
      dozen or more oddballs stare at them hostilely, hair-dyed and 
      bobbed, ears, eyes and noses pierced.  

      Hank and Britt scan the place: no sign of the Hipster or 
      anyone resembling Elenore.  Hank approaches a BARISTA.

                                  BARISTA
                    Can I help you?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, you serve coffee here?
                          (shedoesn t get it)
                    City Health Inspectors.  Doing a 
                    surprise sweep on local food 
                    service establishments in the area.

    He opens Elenore s diary, as if it s his inspection notebook.

                                  BARISTA
                    My manager s not here right now.

                                  HANK
                    S okay, we don t need him.

    Two places Hipster could ve gone: hallway to the johns or the 
      kitchen.  Britt takes the former, Hank the latter.

                                  BRITT
                    I m gonnamake sure the  lavoslos 
                    manos are posted --

                                  BARISTA
                    -- wait, I can t let you --                                                                                    33.



                                  HANK
                    -- miss, you wanna keep that  B 
                    over your coffee grinder you ll let 
                    us take a look-see --
                          (to COOKS in the kitchen)
                    -- perdon, hermanos.

    He spies an OFFICE DOOR and heads straight to it --

                                  BARISTA
                    -- you can t go in there --

    -- to find inside, a CABAL OF EMO TOUGHS, Hipster included, 
      huddled around a desk, discussing something very secret and 
      likely illegal.  Because everyone shuts up fast.

                                  HANK
                    Sorry to interrupt, fellas.What 
                    is this, a band meeting? 

      MEANWHILE, Britt checks out the back hallway: a supply 
      closet, a unisex bathroom (in use) and an alarmed emergency 
      exit.  FLUSH!  The bathroom door opens and --

    -- a BLONDE GIRL emerges.  Britt smiles as she passes, then 
      stops cold.  He follows her back into the coffeehouse.

      BACK IN THE OFFICE, the emo-toughs are on their feet, 
      surrounding Hank, as the Hipster whispers to the CABAL 
      LEADER, informing him of Hank s appearance at his factory.

                                  EMO TOUGH
                    What the hell you want, old man?!

                                  HANK
                    Searching for someone.  Maybe you d 
                    look at a picture.

    As Hank flashes the photo of Elenore, he notes a set of 
      building blueprints pinned to a wall.  Beside it, a slogan: 
     GO ORGANIC! CHEMICALS KILL!

                    What is that, a bank?

                                  EMO TOUGH
                    You a cop?

                                  HANK
                    Me?  No...
                          (he scoffs)
                    Used to be.                                                                                    34.



      Hank s not getting any more popular in here.  The Cabal 
      Leader gives instructions to Hipster who darts out.

    OUT FRONT, Britt maneuvers to get a clean look at the Blonde 
    and at last he succeeds: it s Elenore, hair dyed.

                                  HIPSTER
                    Laura.
                          (sheturns)
                    We gotta go.

    She exits with him.  Britt debates following them, opts to 
    get Hank instead.  In the kitchen he finds him under assault, 
      getting roughed up as emo-toughs push him out of the office.

                                  HANK
                    Fellas, what the hell, I m not 
                    trying to steal your eyeliner --

      Britt makes a quick example of one emo by popping him square 
    in the nose.  As the boy goes down, Britt pulls Hank out.

                                  BRITT
                    She s here.

                                  HANK
                    Who?  Elenore or Laura?

                                  BRITT
                    I m not sure.


    WE HEAR HopetonLewis s rocksteadyclassic  Boom ShakaLaka. 

      KATIE NICHOLS, 20s, winsome, a heartbreaker at first, second, 
    and forty-fifth glance, lip-syncs the lyrics as she dumps 
      bargain-brand pasta into a pot of boiling water.  

    IN QUICK CUTS, she alternates between prepping dinner-on-a-
      budget (cheap bottle of red, microwaved meatballs, salad 
      tossed via zip-locbag) and studying for a vet school exam.  
      A KNOCK AT HER FRONT DOOR draws her away to --


      Hank picks at his penne, hiding his disappointment, as Katie 
      reads Elenore s diary.  Britt swills a Budweiser.

                                  KATIE
                    Wow.  This is weird.  Elenore 
                    barely ever mentions herself in 
                    here.  It s all Laura, Laura, 
                    Laura.

                                  HANK
                    Maybe she s in love.

                                  KATIE
                    Uh-uh.  This isn t love.  Maybe 
                      schizophrenia but not love.  
                    Elenore is either batshitobsessed 
                    with this girl or batshitthinking 
                    she isthis girl or...                                                                                    37.



                                  HANK
                    Or?

      Katie s stumped.

                                  BRITT
                    Or she s dyeing her hair and 
                    calling herself Laura cause it s 
                    the new black.  Does it matter?  If 
                    she loves this girl or thinks she s 
                    her or thinks she s Foghorn 
                    Leghorn.  We just have to find her 
                    and tell Daddy.

                                  HANK
                    Sure.  But it might helpto know. 
                    Thanks, Katie.  For your insight.

                                  KATIE
                    Ask a vet student for a psych run-
                    up.  I like your guys  style.  Now 
                    if you two don t mind, I have a mid-
                    term in the morning.

      Hank notices: there is a subtle but palpable tension between 
      Katie and Britt tonight.  He tries to break it.

                                  HANK
                    On what?

                                  KATIE
                    Equine dentistry.

                                  HANK
                    No shit.

                                  KATIE
                    Did you know that mares are twice 
                    as likely to suffer from gum 
                    disease as stallions?

                                  HANK
                    That s female horses, mares?

                                  KATIE
                    Hence  the old grey mare, sheain t 
                    what she used to be. 

                                  BRITT
                    Did you know that bears, since the 
                    very beginning of their existence, 
                    shitin the woods?                                                                                    38.



      Katie exits, unamused.Britt studies the paystubHank found 
    in Elenore s diary earlier.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    What s the plan?  Find where Laura 
                    works, hope Elenore isn t far off?
                          (off Hank s glare)
                    What?

                                  HANK
                    You re some terrific boyfriend, you 
                    know that?  

                                  BRITT
                    I didn t say anything!

                                  HANK
                    Exactly.  That girl loves you, you
                    treat her like a chair.

                                  BRITT
                    You think I should buy a house I 
                    can t afford, prove my love to her?

      That punch lands.  Hank clears his plate, snags Britt s Bud 
    as he goes.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Hey, I wasn t done with --

                                  HANK
                    Yes you were.


      Katie does dishes.  Hank joins her at the sink, plucking up a 
      dish rag to help dry.  She tries to stop him but he insists.

                                  HANK
                    You cooked dinner.  Least I could 
                    do is pretend to clean up.

                                  KATIE
                    Sorry it was pasta again.   Write 
                    what you know, cook what you can t 
                    burn.                                                                                     39.



                                  HANK
                    I ever tell you: back during my cop 
                    days, whenever we answered a 
                    domestic abuse call, we d take the 
                    woman aside and offer to kick the 
                    shitouttaher dude for fifty 
                    bucks.  You interested?

                                  KATIE
                    Fifty?

                                  HANK
                    I ll give you a friend rate: forty.
                          (then, off her sadness)
                    There something going on you wanna 
                    talk about?

    She shakes her head but soon can t help confess:

                                  KATIE
                    I wanna have a baby.

      Hank waits for more, then:

                                  HANK
                    Right this very moment?

                                  KATIE
                    Sooner than later.

                                  HANK
                    You tell Laughing Boy this?

                                  KATIE
                    Last night.  He said he wasn t 
                    ready to  pull the goalie.   Then 
                    went out and got hammered.  He 
                    didn t say anything to you?

                                  HANK
                    But I smelled it on him all day.

                                  KATIE
                    You know, it s been a lot of fun 
                    living in Neverneverlandwith you 
                    two.  But I m gonnahave to become 
                    a real person soon.

                                  BRITT
                          (from the next room)
                    Hank!  Pooch is waiting!

      Hank ignores him.                                                                                    40.



                                  HANK
                    Just be patient with him.  I m sure 
                    by the time he s ninety he ll pull 
                    his head out of his ass.

                                  KATIE
                    With you as a role model?
                          (thatstings a little)
                    Sorry.

                                  HANK
                    Don t be.
                          (a kiss to her temple)
                    I think you ll be a spectacular 
                    mother.

      Hank exits.  

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    OK, Messy Marvin: mount up.

      Britt appears in the doorway, facing Katie.

                                  BRITT
                    You want anything from out in the 
                    world?

    She shakes her head, pretending nothing s wrong.  He goes, 
      pretending to believe her.


      They drive in silence. 

                                  HANK
                    You know what you d do we didn t do 
                    this for a living?

                                  BRITT
                    Play for the Dodgers.  I d say 
                    Angels but I ve never seen myself 
                    as an American Leaguer.  Why?

                                  HANK
                          (reticent at first, then:)
                    I ve been thinking lately...about 
                    pulling the ripcord on this thing.

                                  BRITT
                    Say that again non-euphemistically.                                                                                    42.



                                  HANK
                    Every morning I wake up I feel it 
                    in my knees.  I m past it.
                          (thisamuses Britt)
                    I m serious.  Today in the 
                      coffeehouse those mascara thugs 
                    scared the shitouttame.  Besides 
                    how s this look, my running around 
                      dognappingand chasing down lesbian 
                    debutantes at my age?  Left here.

      Britt pulls the truck into an OFFICE BUILDING s parking lot.

                                  BRITT
                    You areshittingme, right?

                                  HANK
                    Hand to God.  I m thinking about 
                    retiring.


      A logo reads:  JAKUEHN& ASSOC. PAYROLL CO.   Hank and Britt 
      traverse the dark, empty office floor with flashlights.

                                  BRITT
                    In this economy?  To do what?

      Hank hasn t thought that far ahead.

                                  HANK
                    You realize you d have the most to 
                    gain if I did.  You d be sole 
                    partner.

                                  BRITT
                    Of what?  And there s no such thing 
                    as sole partner, there s just sole.
                          (then, struck)
                    This isn t about Katie, is it?

                                  HANK
                          (it is, sort of)
                    What, no, of course not.

                                  BRITT
                    I know she worries about money.

                                  HANK
                    I m sure she s got a lot of 
                    concerns about you, pal, but 
                    whether you re Fortune 500 material 
                    or not isn t one of  em.                                                                                    43.



    At file cabinets they thumb through employee records.

                                  BRITT
                    So why?

                                  HANK
                    I told you --

                                  BRITT
                    Why really?  Don t give me that 
                    Danny Glover I m-too-old-for-this-
                      shitshit.Your knees ache, your 
                    back s sore.  OK, I weep for you. 

    At the office s elevator bay, a SECURITY GUARD steps onto the 
      floor, doing his nightly rounds.  He hears the murmur of our 
      guys  voices and tracks them. 

                                  HANK
                    It doesn t feel like a grown man s 
                    job anymore.  I come home, I don t 
                    feel I ve earned it.  And that s 
                    okay for a while, when you re 
                    young.  But my while s up.

    For the first time Britt suspects Hank might be sincere about 
      this and it terrifies him.  He comes to a file  Price, Laura  
    and hands it off.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Laura Price.  Employee since March 
                    at the Gilbert Chicken Farm.  Huh.  
                    I ve known a lottathings a pretty 
                    girl lldo for a buck but never 
                    cutting heads off chickens --

    And that s when Hank gets hit in the eyes by a beam of light.  
    He and Britt turn, squinting, to discover the Security Guard, 
      flashlight leveled at them.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Sorry.  You guys almost done here?

      Hank holds up the file: indeed they are.  He reaches into his 
      pocket for cash for Oscar.

                                  HANK
                    How s the wife, by the way?  Due 
                    any day now, right?                                                                                    44.



                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    I didn t tell you?  It s twins.

      Hank reaches back into his pocket for more cash.


      CLEMMONS, a clip-on/comboverplant manager, studies the 
      Elenore-Laura picture.  His office is adorned with western 
      memorabilia -- cowboy art, horse paperweights, etc..

                                  CLEMMONS
                    Which one am I supposed to be 
                    looking at?

                      BRITTHANK
      Either.Both.

      Still some residual anger between them from the night before.  
      Hank and Britt stand across from him, by a window overlooking 
      a giant processing room below.  Off Clemmons  look --

                                  HANK
                          (Texas in his voice)
                    One of  em s the girl we re looking 
                    for, one is her friend.  Either 
                    look familiar to you?

                                  CLEMMONS
                          (he looks again)
                    Nope.  But I do have over three 
                    hundred employees here.

                                  HANK
                    Would you mind checking your 
                    records?  Your payroll company J.A.
                    Kuehnand Associates says Laura 
                    Price has been on the job here 
                    since March.

                                  CLEMMONS
                    They told you that?

      Hank nods.  Clemmons knows that s bullshit.And Hank knows 
    he knows.  He appeals to him as a pal.

                                  HANK
                    Listen all we need is a home 
                    address or phone number.  My buddy 
                    here, he s Ms. Price s brother, 
                    they re estranged from birth and, 
                    well, there s an inheritance to be 
                    split.                                                                                    46.



                                  CLEMMONS
                          (not going for it)
                    I m sorry, gentlemen.  Company 
                    policy is all employee records are 
                      confidential.


      Hank and Britt exit past a SECRETARY.  Under their breath:

                                  BRITT
                    Think he s calling the cops on us?

                                  HANK
                    I would be.

      Hank stops, spotting something.  Britt follows his gaze to a 
      portrait on the wall: the Gilbert Board of Directors, front 
    and center Lawrence Bingham Lindus III.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          (to the Secretary)
                     Scuseme, ma am, that s not L.B.
                    Lindus in that picture, is it?

                                  SECRETARY
                    Yes, that s Mr. Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Dang-it-all, I haven t seen Bingin 
                    ages.  Wha she doin on the board?

                                  SECRETARY
                    His family founded the company.  
                    Rather his wife s family.  When 
                    Gwen Gilbert passed on, Mr. Lindus 
                    took over as chairman.

    Our boys share a look: interesting.  As they go:

                                  BRITT
                          (mocking Hank s accent)
                    Y alltake care y all.


      They pass through the hangar-sized room of WORKERS in aprons, 
      surgical masks, hair nets and latex gloves prepping 
      decapitated chickens.  As they take in the defeathering, 
      gutting and quartering of chickens:                                                                                    47.



                                  BRITT
                    Hey, while we re here, maybe you 
                    should fill out a job application?  
                    Since you re looking for something 
                      respectable to do.

      Hank just squints at him.


      Britt and Hank are in with other derelicts.  Britt keeps 
      vigil for the first knucklehead who tries to fuckwith them.  
    Off one guy s glance --

                                  BRITT
                    Hey, you walk over here, I will lay 
                    you out and shitin your mouth.

    No one s gonnafuckwith them.  Britt notices: Hank looks 
      burdened with a thought.  

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    You okay?  You look like somebody 
                    stole your monkey.

                                  HANK
                    Something about this is wrong.  
                    This job.  We re in over our heads.  
                    We re a couple of scroungers, get 
                    this back, find that person.  We re 
                    not bright enough for something big 
                    and this just became something big.

                                  BRITT
                    Cause some kids with too much eye-
                    liner tried to dose a bunch of 
                    chickens?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    51.

                                  BRITT (CONT'D)
                    Last night you say you want out 
                    cause this job s not dignified 
                    enough, now you re wringing your 
                    hands cause we have an actual case.  
                    Get back on the lithium already.

                                  GUARD (O.S.)
                      Dolworth!Pollack! 


      Britt floors it, speeding to Laura Price s address.

                                  BRITT
                    Triple our fee.  One second I 
                    thought he was gonnacan us for 
                    sure, the next it s triple 
                    overtime.  Three times...that s...

                                  HANK
                          (as he check his 
                            voicemail, not as 
                            ecstatic as Britt)
                    Our annual nut, in one swoop.  Got 
                    a message from Gretchen.  She wants 
                    to meet.

                                  BRITT
                    Is that a good thing or bad?

                                  HANK
                    Don t know.

                                  BRITT
                          (studying his partner)
                    Hey.  Keep your eyes on the prize 
                    here a little longer, huh?

      Britt stomps the gas.


    As Laura loads necessities into a box:

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    I met Elenore at a PETArally a few 
                    months ago.  She seemed nice, 
                    committed.  When she first started 
                    copying me, I was flattered. 
                    Dressing like me, adopting my 
                    causes as her own.

                                  BRITT
                    Dying her hair to look like yours.

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    That s when it started getting 
                    weird.  Especially when I heard 
                    someone call her Laura.  Found out 
                    she was introducing herself as me 
                    at rallies, starting petitions in 
                    my name --

                                  HANK
                    -- getting jobs in your name?  
                            (she sconfused)
                    You ever been employed by Gibson 
                    Chicken Farms?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Her dad s company?  Do I look like 
                    someone who would slaughter 
                    chickens for a living?

    Her place is wall-to-wall  Meat Is Murder  posters.

                                  BRITT
                    When s the last time you saw 
                    Elenore?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    A week ago.  She started talking 
                    about all the chemicals they put in 
                    the feed there and how it gave her 
                    mom leukemia and how she had a plan 
                    to scare people into never eating 
                    chicken again.  She was preaching 
                    to the choir and even I was freaked 
                    out.  I guess I didn t hide it very 
                    well.  A couple days later they 
                    tried to break in here.                                                                                    55.



    She indicates a door where a window panel has been broken and 
      a lock hammered at.

                                  BRITT
                    Who s they?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Her little platoon of emo-freaks.  
                    They re like moonies, she s got  em 
                    wrapped around her finger.

      Hank and Britt study Laura: she seems genuine enough.

                                  HANK
                    Where are you going now?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    My folks  place.  They re in Cabo 
                    for the week.

                                  HANK
                    They know a good lawyer? 

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Probably.

                                  HANK
                    You re gonnaneed one.  The police 
                    are looking for you.
                          (beforeshe asks)
                    The less you know, the better.  Go 
                    home, call a lawyer, then go with 
                    him to turn yourself in.  Got it?

    She goes to her bathroom for a few final items.  Britt 
      wanders up to Hank, whispers:

                                  BRITT
                    You believe her?

      Hank nods.  Notices a rock club flyer on the fridge.  It 
      reads  Dirty Sanchez. 

                                  HANK
                          (calling out to her)
                    Hey, what s Dirty Sanchez?

                                  BRITT
                          (voice low)
                    Ah jeez, you don t wanna --                                                                                    56.



                                  LAURA PRICE
                    It s a band I used to like.  Guess 
                    who s dating the lead singer these 
                    days?

      Britt reads the flyer. 

                                  BRITT
                    Says they re playing tonight.

      Hank pockets it: they have their lead.


      MUSIC BLARES.  Hipster s on stage with his band, crooning 
      unintelligibly, his audience a nodding herd of emo s.

    In the back, by the bar, is Britt, baseball-capped, trying 
    not to look too old here.  He spies across the audience --

    -- Elenore Lindus, standing slightly apart from the others, 
      grooving with the music, exchanging smiles with Hipster.

      Britt exits.


      Britt keeps the truck at a creep as Hank holds his cell out 
    the window, waiting for a signal to appear.  Nothing.

                                  HANK
                    Try around that bend.  Maybe if we 
                    get away from this hill.


      Silence inside.  No movement.  Passing an entry table, Britt 
      picks up a framed photo: Laura Price and her parents.

                                  BRITT
                            (whispering)
                    Laura Price s folks  place?  The 
                    ones in Cabo?

    Our guys proceed to, through a kitchen and down to a BASEMENT 
    REC ROOM where they find --

    -- six freshly dead bodies, scattered in various poses of 
      death throes.  Hipster among them.  No sign of Elenore.

    The ecstacy plate lies conspicuously clean in the middle of a 
      pool table.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Where s Elenore?

      Hank spies a light coming from within a bathroom.  He cracks 
    the door open --

    -- and there s a Blonde Girl slumped over, with a large hole 
      blown out the back of her head.  A revolver lies at her feet, 
      ostensibly dropped by her.  Hank tips her head back --

    -- it s Laura Price.                                                                                    63.



                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    That s --

                                  HANK
                    Not Elenore.

      They step back into the rec room, surrounded on all sides by 
      corpses.  They ve never seen anything like it.

                                  BRITT
                    Hank.  This is too big for us.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      HUSTLING WITH HANK AND BRITT as they tear ass out of here.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    ...go, go, go...

      As they pass the framed photo on the entry table --

                                  HANK
                      ...fingerprints, fingerprints...

      Britt uses his t-shirtto wipe it down, then the door knob. 


      Hank waits for his cell to get a signal again, then dials:

                                  HANK
                    Mr. Lindus?  Do notcome to the 
                    address I gave you, sir.  I can t 
                    explain over this phone.  Go home, 
                    we will come to you. 

    He hangs up.  Britt s and Hank s minds race.

                                  BRITT
                    What the hell did we just step 
                    into?                                                                                    64.




      When Lindus has closed the door behind them:

                                  LINDUS
                    Gentlemen, what s going on --

                                  HANK
                          (voice low)
                    Sir, you need to contact a criminal 
                    attorney now.  I m afraid your 
                    daughter may be in serious trouble.

                                  LINDUS
                    What kind of --

                                  HANK
                    The less you know the better.  
                    Elenore was with a group of 
                    friends.  Something happened.  As 
                    far as I know she s unharmed.  
                    However, we don t know where she is 
                    now.

                                  LINDUS
                    She s upstairs.  

      That stops them.

                                  HANK
                    I m sorry?

                                  LINDUS
                    She returned about thirty minutes 
                    ago, when I was out coming to meet 
                    you.  I came home, she apologized 
                    for disappearing like she did and 
                    went up to take a shower.
                          (theguys are bewildered)
                    If you don t believe me...
                          (he calls upstairs)
                    Ellie!  Can you come down here for 
                    a moment?!

    Our guys share a glance, then look up as Elenore Lindus 
      descends the stairs, robed, fresh out of a shower, towel 
      covering wet hair.                                                                                      65.


      It s her alright, same girl they saw at the rock club, same 
      girl who walked into Laura Price s family home tonight.

                                  ELENORE
                    Hello.

                                  LINDUS
                    Honey, this is Mr. Dolworthand Mr. 
                    Pollack, the men I hired to find 
                    you.  I just wanted to show them 
                    that you re home safe and sound.

                                  ELENORE
                    Not a scratch on me.  Sorry to put 
                    everyone to so much trouble, I m 
                      kindaembarrassed.  Can I go back 
                    up now, Dad?

                                  LINDUS
                    Sure, sweetie.

    As she goes back up, she pulls the towel from her head.  Hank 
    and Britt clock brown locks revealed beneath. 


                                  HANK
                    We re gonnakeep the check.  This 
                    isn t our fight.  We re gonnakeep 
                    the check because it solves a 
                    myriad of problems, shut our 
                    mouths, forget this ever happened 
                    and hope to God no one saw us 
                    leaving that house.

                                  BRITT
                    You sure?  If Gustafson ever finds 
                    out we left that scene, he will 
                    screw us and hard.  I ll go along 
                    with it because I could use the 
                    money.  But if we do this, we gotta 
                    do it all the way.  I don t wanna 
                    get a call from you some night 
                    saying you can t live with it.  
                    Okay?

      Hank nods.  


      A QUICK MONTAGE OF HANK GETTING READY FOR BED: he undresses, 
      brushes his teeth, splashes water on his face, turns off 
      lights in the hallway.


    His clock reads 1:15 a.m..  He lies, head on his pillow, eyes 
      open.  Just as we met him.  

      Then he reaches over and grabs his cell off a bedside table 
    and dials.  After a moment:

                                  HANK
                    I can t live with it.

                                  BRITT S VOICE
                    Neither can I.
