      The logo is on screen, as MISS FOSTER steps forward, at
      the front.  She's 40s, handsome, strong.  She addresses
      the audience, 40 PEOPLE or so, scattered about, taking

                    weeks.  And the fat, as they say...

      ON SCREEN, GRAPHIC, the logo does a little spin, the jingle
      sings: The Fat Just Walks Awaaaaay! 

      CUT TO DONNA, in amongst the audience, as a WOMAN near to
      her pipes up - PENNY CARTER, late 20's, sharp.

                                      PENNY
                    Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I
                    could..?  I'm Penny Carter, Science
                      Correspondent for the Observer  

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    Oh yes.  You've written quite a
                    bit about us already. 

                                      PENNY
                    And I'm not about to stop.  But
                    there's a thousand diet pills on
                    the market, and a thousand conmen
                    stealing people's money.  How do
                    we know the fat isn't going straight

                    But if you want the science, then
                    I can oblige...

      She nods up to the PROJECTION BOOTH.

      The projected beam of light flickers, changes.

      The next reel starts up, GRAPHICS showing a pill, and a
      layout of the Human body, with arrows going from the pill,
      to the body, then flowing round the bloodstream.

                    The Adipose Capsule is composed of
                      a synthesised mobilising lipase,
                    bound to a large protein molecule. 
                    The mobilising lipase breaks up
                    the triglycerides stored in the
                    adipose cells, which then enter
                    the bloodstream... [etc.]

      But during this, on Donna, watching, suspicious.  And then
      PAN UP to see behind her, THE DOCTOR, in the PROJECTION
      BOOTH WINDOW.  (Not seeing Donna, just watching the screen.)

      FILM PROJECTOR whirring away, manned by a BLOKE.  The Doctor

                    But can I ask, how many people
                    have taken the pills, to date?

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    We've already got one million
                    customers within the Greater London
                    area alone.  But from next week,
                    we start rolling out, nationwide.

      The sales floor.  Divided into those American-style
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      cubicles, as functional as possible, like Keanu Reeves's

      on headsets, all cold-calling the spiel.  'Good morning, I

      Adipose Industries...' 'Good morning, I represent...' etc.

      TRACKING TO FIND DONNA, walking in - on edge, cautious,
      armed with a clipboard - she grabs a spare chair, pulls it
      over to a CUBICLE, where CRAIG, 20, is at work, on headset.

      cautious, on edge - he grabs a spare chair, slides it across

      his side - a small white cardboard box, full of 21 pills
      in packets, information leaflets, etc.

                    an Adipose Industries pendant...

      But Donna's taking the pendant out of the box.  Simple
      gold chain with a gold representation of an Adipose capsule.

      He's already taken the pendant, holds it up, examines it.

      CU on the gold Adipose capsule. 

      CUT TO Donna & Craig.  He's now taking off his headset, to
      look at her properly, as she puts the pendant in her pocket.

                                      DONNA
                    I'll just keep this for testing.  
                    And I just need a list of your

                    Just over there, by the door.

      WIDE SHOT, as she pops her head up over the partition. 
      The only face visible among the rows of cubicles.

                                      DONNA

                    Lovely.

      She pops back down, gone - and in that second -

      - THE DOCTOR pops his head up, far across the room.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And that's the printer, over there?

      And he pops back down -

      - as Donna pops back up, looking towards the printer.

                                      DONNA
                    Does it need a code?  Last place I
                    worked, the printer needed a code.

                                      CRAIG OOV
                    No, I can do that from here.

      And she pops back down -

      - as the Doctor pops back up, looking round.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Has it got paper?

                    Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked.

      But the Doctor gives an 'oops!' and ducks down, seeing -

      MISS FOSTER striding in.  With 2 SECURITY GUARDS, her
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      permanent escort.  She goes to the centre, claps her hands.

                    Everyone!  Excuse me!  If I could
                    have your attention!

      Heads pop up all around the cubicles, some standing, some
      just with eyes over the partitions.  Donna stands up...

      As the Doctor slowly stands up...

      Miss Foster takes a single step forward, just in time to
      completely mask the Doctor from Donna's POV, and vice versa. 

                                    MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)
                    On average, you're each selling
                    forty Adipose packs per day.  It's
                    not enough!  I want one hundred
                    sales, per person, per day, and if
                    not, you'll be replaced.  Cos if
                    anyone's good at trimming the fat,
                    it's me.  Now back to it!

      All heads duck down, Donna sinking back down as -

      Miss Foster clears Donna's previous POV, revealing the
      Doctor, just ducking back down into the cubicle.  To Claire:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Anyway!  If you could just print

      WIDE SHOT, as she stands, hurries over to the printer -

                    Thanks then -

      - before he can look in Donna's direction, he's pulled
      back down again!  By Claire, holding out a piece of paper.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    What's that?

      CUT TO Donna, at the printer.  She grabs all the papers,
      heads for the door -

      And as she swings it open, foreground, and disappears
      through the door - in background, the Doctor stands -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...that contravenes paragraph 5

      And he hurries away, going across to the printer.

      No papers, nothing.  Eh?!  He lifts the photocopier lid,
      checks all round, no sign of them.  Damn.

      CUT TO CLAIRE, as the Doctor reappears.  Big smile.

      She's gone.  On Donna, wondering if she's wasting her time.

      ROGER sitting, THE DOCTOR prowling round the room.

                                      ROGER
                    I've been on the pills for two
                    weeks now, I've lost 14 kilos!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    That's the same amount every day?

                                      ROGER
                    One kilo, exactly.  You wake up,
                    and it's disappeared overnight. 
                    Well, technically speaking, it's
                    gone by ten past one in the morning.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...what makes you say that?

                    That's when I get woken up.  Might
                    as well weigh myself at the same
                    time!  But it's driving me mad -
                    ten minutes past one, every night,
                    bang on the dot, without fail...
                    the burglar alarm goes off.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE DOCTOR on the floor, prodding the back door's cat flap
      with the sonic.  The flap swings to and fro, harmless. 
      ROGER kneeling beside him, fascinated.

                                      ROGER
                    It was here when I bought the house. 
                    Never bothered with it, really,
                    I'm not a cat person. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, I've met cat people, you're
                    nothing like them. 

                                      ROGER
                    Is that what it is, though?  Cats,
                    getting inside the house?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Well, that's the thing about cat
                    flaps.  They don't just let things
                    in.  They let things out as well.

                                      ROGER

      Nice bathroom, bit lived-in.  STACY's now with hair down,

                    That's all right!

      She sits, fiddling with the GOLD PENDANT.  Just out of
      boredom.  She holds it up, in the light.  Nothing special.

      Then she just holds it normally, looking round the room.
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      CU Donna's hands as, without thinking, she starts to unscrew
      the two halves of the gold capsule...

        www.thewriterstale.com
      CUT TO THE BATHROOM.  Stacy gasps.  Not pain, but a sudden
      feeling in her stomach.  She clutches it.

      CUT TO LIVING ROOM, Donna stops fiddling with the capsule.

      CUT TO BATHROOM, the sensation's gone, Stacy recovers,
      holds her stomach.  What the hell was that..?

      CUT TO LIVING ROOM, Donna starts to fiddle again, unscrewing
      the capsule...

      CUT TO BATHROOM, Stacy feels something again, holds her
      stomach.  What's happening..?

      CUT TO LIVING ROOM, Donna still screwing & unscrewing the
      two halves, without even looking at what she's doing.

      CUT TO BATHROOM, Stacy lifts up her top.  Smooths the skin
      of her stomach.  Then horrified, as...

      FX: the skin on her stomach moves.  Like something is
      writhing underneath.  Pushing the skin out...

      She's not in pain, just scared, as she looks in the mirror.

      FX: her stomach keeps moving, just one central area, like
      a little fat mole is buried underneath, trying to get out.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 1 - Shooting Script - 21/09/07         Page 12.




      Smart, shiny, windows looking out on to the city.  But an
      alarm blares!  MISS FOSTER spins round in her chair -

      On her COMPUTER, a map of London, one red light flashing. 

      Miss Foster uses her WRISTWATCH as a COMMS DEVICE -

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    We have unscheduled parthenogenesis!

                    Bring them home.

      BATHROOM, CU STACY boggling, looking down, as...

      FX: STACY'S skin stretches out - and nothing is actually
      breaking through, no broken skin, no blood - instead, the
      stretching skin is whitening and smoothly dividing off
      into a separate entity, like amoebas separating...

      FX: and the lump plops free!  With Stacy standing by the
      sink, it just drops down into the bowl, and her stomach
      just twangs back to normal.  And the lump is...

      FX: an ADIPOSE, standing in the sink-bowl.  About the size
      of a bag of sugar.  And almost the same shape.  A white
      lump of fat, Pilsbury Dough Boy in texture, with rudimentary
      arms and legs, black-dot eyes, a mewling mouth, with one
      little fang.  It's strangely sort of cute.  Like a soft
      toy.  It seems to be waving, little stumpy arms, at Stacy.

      Stacy is just boggling.

      LIVING ROOM, Donna goes to the hallway door, calls up:

                                      DONNA
                    You all right up there?

                    ...yeah.

      FX: the ADIPOSE is mewling at her, a bit like 'mummy!'

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    The Adipose has been witnessed. 
                      Activating full parthenogenesis.

      And in her other hand, she's got a GOLD CAPSULE - she takes
      hold of it, twists it -

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Underneath her trousers, one of her buttocks is now starting
      to move, a shape squirming under the fabric...

      CUT TO DONNA, by the living room door, calling up.

                    hall.

      STACY twisting round to see in the mirror, as...

      FX: an ADIPOSE struggles up over the waistband of the back
      of her trousers!  Mewling!  Free!

      CUT TO Donna, getting a bit concerned now -

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    Have you lived here long?  Stacy? 
                    You all right?

      FX: BATHROOM, 2 ADIPOSE now in the sink, waving.  Whispered:

                    What are you?  What are you?

      But then - oh God - more movement - under her t-shirt,
      more shapes, lots, shifting, her stomach, at her shoulder,
      on her back, on her thigh, writhing under her clothes.

      CUT TO STAIRS, DONNA, now heading up.

      CUT TO BATHROOM, Stacy desperate, now trying the press the
      bumps in her clothing back in to her skin...

      Donna now outside the door, little knock.

      Donna rattles the door, it's locked -

      Inside, Stacy's still struggling with the writhing bumps -

      Donna starts to thump the door.  Bangs it.  Shoves it.

      Then Stacy shudders, lets go of the bumps, screams -

      separate pieces - twenty separate ADIPOSE, plop!, tumbling
      to the floor, in amongst her falling, empty clothes -

      FX: on the FLOOR, in amongst the fallen clothes, a NUMBER
      OF ADIPOSE waddle about, heading for the walls, with one
      still emerging from the clothes.

      Donna hears something, stops shoving, listens...

      A tiny giggling, a scurrying noise, from the bathroom.

      Donna shoves again, shoves hard -

      CU on the bolt, flying off, the door flies open - !

      Donna in the doorway, stares.

      Her POV: Stacy's clothes on the floor.  Then looking up...

                      digital-stitch specifically for...

      Looks up, looks round, aware that he's talking to himself.

      WIDEST SHOT POSSIBLE of the TARDIS.  The ancient, slow
      creak of the vast, empty space. 

      The Doctor, alone.

      THE DOCTOR strides along the corridor -

      He's heading for a door, opens it.  A tiny little STOREROOM,
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      mops & buckets, etc.  No light.  He gets inside, his hiding
      place, and he sonics the lock.  A big clunk!  Locked.

      Clean, smart, large room.  DONNA hurries in.  There's at
      least 5 cubicles in a row.  She goes to the furthest one.

      Inside, she bolts the door.  Then lowers the lid on the
      toilet, to use it as a chair.  Sits.  Looks at her watch.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    she's been on those Adipose pills,
                    she says she looks marvellous -

      But Donna suddenly hangs up - she's heard footsteps -

      CUT TO OUTSIDE THE CUBICLES, as the door slams! open -

      MISS FOSTER & 2 SECURITY GUARDS stride in, like
      stormtroopers, the guards now armed with GUNS.  Miss Foster
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      stands centre, utterly confident.

                                    MISS FOSTER
        www.thewriterstale.com
                    We know you're in here.  So why
                    don't you make this nice and easy,
                    and show yourself?

      Donna in the cubicle, lifts her feet up, terrified.

                                    MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)
                    I'm waiting.
                          (silence)
                    I warn you.  I'm not a patient
                    woman.  Now, out you come.

      Silence, Donna so scared, trapped.

                                    MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)
                    Right, we'll do it the hard way. 
                    Get her!

      The guards move - kick the door in on the first cubicle,
      wham!, one guard kicking, the other ready with his gun -

      Empty.

      Donna terrified.

      They kick in the second cubicle - wham! - empty -

      Donna clutching her knees, helpless -

      They kick in the third cubicle - wham! -

      And there's PENNY CARTER!  Hiding!

                                    MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)
                    There you are.

      On Donna.  Eh?!

      As the guards haul Penny out, she's furious -

                                      PENNY
                    I've been through the records,
                    Foster!  All your results have
                    been faked, there's something about
                    those pills you're not telling us -

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    Oh, I think I'll be conducting
                    this interview, Penny.

      And they're hauling Penny out of the door, gone.

      Beat.

      Then Donna opens her cubicle door a fraction, peers out.
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow

      The room now dark.  MISS FOSTER striding ahead, PENNY being
      dragged along by the 2 SECURITY GUARDS -

                                      PENNY
                    - you've got no right to do this! 
                    Let me go!!

      Behind them, through the door they first came through,
      DONNA peeks through a tiny gap.  In pursuit!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FX: office empty.  At the windows, the CRADLE is descending,
      THE DOCTOR sliding down into shot, then sonicking the cradle
      to stop, so he can see into the office -

      But he ducks down out of sight - oops! - as MISS FOSTER,
      the 2 SECURITY GUARDS frogmarch a struggling PENNY in -

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    Sit there!

                    I'm phoning my editor -

                    I said sit!

        Secretaries' area, dark.  DONNA creeps towards MISS FOSTER'S
      OFFICE - it's got glass interior walls, but with blinds
      drawn, though there's still a glass panel in the door.

      Donna crouches below the glass in the door.  Listens.

      CONTINUES INTERCUT WITH SC.67, MISS FOSTER'S OFFICE.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MISS FOSTER now behind her desk, facing PENNY.  The GUARDS
      have just tied Penny's wrists to the chair with flex, and
      now they stand back, on duty, behind Miss Foster.

      INTERCUT with DONNA listening, crouched low, outside the
      office door; THE DOCTOR crouched low, outside the window.

                      A beautifully fat country.  Believe
                    me, I've travelled a long way to
                    find obesity on this scale.

                    Come on then.  Those pills.  Miss
                    Foster.  What are they?

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    You might as well have a scoop. 
                    Since you'll never see it printed. 
                          (holds up a capsule)
                    This... is the spark of life.

                                    MISS FOSTER
                      Officially, the capsule attracts
                    all the fat cells, and then flushes
                    them away.  Well, it certainly
                    attracts them, that part's true. 
                    But it binds the fat together, and
                      galvanises it, to form a body.

                    my name.  I chose it well.  Foster,

                    are my children.

      She opens the desk drawer, reaches in, plucks out...

      At the same time, the Doctor has to see... so, putting his

      of the office, the Doctor & Donna a few feet further towards
      the back, so there's a clear space between the Doctor &
      Donna, who are directly opposite each other.) 

      The Doctor lifts his head up... looking left, to the desk.

      Donna lifts her head up... looking right, to the desk.

      Then the Doctor looks straight ahead, seeing -

      Donna looks straight ahead, seeing -

      The Doctor!!!!

      Donna!!!??!

      Big long moment, both just boggling, open-mouthed.  Then,
      all shot through the glass, in silence, big gestures:

      Donna's just so thrilled, she waves!  Big smile!

      The Doctor: but, but, but, why, what, where, when?

      Donna points at him - you!!  I was looking for you!

      The Doctor: me?  What for?

      Donna does a little mime:  I, came here, trouble, read
      about it, internet, I thought, trouble = you!  And this
      place is weird!  Pills!  So I hid.  Back there.  Crept
      along.  Heard this lot.  Looked.  You!  Cos they...

      And on 'they', she gestures and looks towards Miss Foster.

      Who is staring at her.  As are the guards.  Penny, too.

      Donna freezes.  Oops.

      Miss Foster then looks at the Doctor.  Calm:

      below her - she's clinging to the hanging left-hand-side
      cable.  (There's, say, a spar of metal, formerly part of
      the winch, fixed to the cable, and Donna's actually holding
      on to that; she could never hold on to cable alone.)

      Miss Foster falls to her knees, in agony -

      THE DOCTOR & DONNA run along - the Doctor running to his
      STOREROOM from sc.54, yanks open the door, starts throwing
      out mops, buckets, etc.  Donna stands back, bemused.

                                      DONNA
                    Well, that's one solution.  Hide
                    in a cupboard.  I like it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I've been hacking into this thing
                    all day, cos the Matron's got a
                    computer core running through the
                    centre of the building, triple-
                      deadlocked, but now I've got this -
                          (the sonic pen)
                    - I can get into it -

      And he's heaving at the ENTIRE BACK WALL of the storeroom -

      Which creaks and pulls away, like A HIDDEN DOOR -

      Behind it, floor to ceiling: a COMPUTER WALL.  Very distinct
      design, all golden curves and lights.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 1 - Pink Amendments - 03/10/07           Page 40.




      PENNY tied up again, as MISS FOSTER stands back, the two
      SECURITY GUARDS sliding back the wall behind her chair -
      revealing an IDENTICAL COMPUTER WALL to the storeroom's.

      As Miss Foster goes to it, starts pressing buttons -

                    What does that thing do?

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    It's the Inducer.  We'd planned to
                    seed millions, but if that man's
                    an alien and he's alerted the Shadow
                      Proclamation, then the first one
                    million Humans will have to do -

                    Find him, and the woman.  Don't
                    waste time, just kill them.

      The Guards run out -

                    Just enough to stun them!  But
                    why's she wired up a tower block,
                    what's it all for..?

      Then he keeps working, intent.  And in the pause, DONNA's
      looking at him.  Properly, now.  Then, quiet & smiling

                    Yeah.  Well, no, I had this friend,
                    Martha, she was called, Martha
                    Jones, she was brilliant.  And I
                    destroyed half her life.  But she's
                    fine, she's good.  She's gone.

                    I had that one day with you, and I
                    was gonna change, I was gonna do
                    so much.  Then I woke up the next
                    morning, and it's the same old
                    life.  Like you were never there. 
                    And I tried, I did try, I went to
                    Egypt, I was gonna go barefoot and
                      everything.  But then it's all bus

      She looks at him. 

      The moment suspended.  Just magic.

      He smiles.
