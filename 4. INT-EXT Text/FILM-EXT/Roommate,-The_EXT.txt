SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.
She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just
above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.
No parents.
She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the
other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring
through the building's window at...
Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their
parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.
A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it
all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on
the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm
windows.
Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.
SARA
Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met
this really cool biker? He's taking
me to Mexico this weekend.
(BEAT)
Hello?
(BEAT)
Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding.
Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a
work/study ad on the wall.
SARA
Everything's great.
(BEAT)
No, she's not here yet so I got to
choose my side of the room.
She tears a tab off the flyer.
Establishing shot of Carnegie, a solid red-brick dorm.
Establishing shot of a proud frat house. Students piled on a
giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the
front door. Music blasts out of the windows.
It's the middle of the day and students carry their books
everywhere.
Establishing shot of a big college cafeteria.
Sara enters the Design building.
A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms
against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as
she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.
SARA
(LOUD)
Tracy.
She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against
hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.
She starts walking down the street, away from the club.
Weary and unnerved.
An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No
cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black
soft top sits next to an ancient pump.
Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,
sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.
MAN (0.S.)
Can I help you out?
She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station
attendant. His name tag: "Rick".
Rebecca sizes him up.
28.
REBECCA
I'm fine. Just in a hurry.
She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,
treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the
"Full Service" sign.
RICK
Just doing my job.
She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the
gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of
hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.
REBECCA
All done.
She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it
back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.
RICK
You have a little something.
No, she doesn't.
He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her
cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.
RICK (CONT'D)
The hell?
His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.
REBECCA
Sorry.
But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him
head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
Sorry again. Rick.
The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every
direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.
Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.
RICK
You spoiled c---
He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She
absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.
29.
The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is
still ticking up.
He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him
and drops the still pouring nozzle.
A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls
out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the
pump.
REBECCA
Pussy.
She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in
gasoline.
Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup
of hot, sobering coffee.
Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.
Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the
car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for
the door.
Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores.
Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor.
Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes.
SARA
That is so cool.
REBECCA
No graffiti in Des Moines?
SARA
Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy
loves Rick." Nothing like this.
Rebecca pulls out her camera.
REBECCA
Hey, smile.
Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.
SARA
Both of us.
32.
They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca
clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo
parlor in the background.
REBECCA
Now that's one "art form" I don't
get. Needles into skin? No thanks.
SARA
I have a tattoo.
Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes
that she's serious.
REBECCA
Really?
Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over
her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily".
SARA
My older sister. She died when I
was nine.
REBECCA
Oh, I'm sorry.
SARA
(pats her heart)
This keeps her with me.
REBECCA
I always wanted a sister.
Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they
walk down the street.
Sara, in shorts and warm-up jacket, runs down the sidewalk.
Her head's on a swivel, taking in the city sights.
Sara finishes off her run strong, striding out the last ten
yards to the dorm. She catches her breath and hears a kitten.
Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds
a STRAY KITTEN. She's cute as they come, a black-and-white
furball.
SARA
Hey there.
34.
The kitten purrs.
SARA
Look at you.
She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs.
SARA
No collar, baby?
Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching.
CUT TO:
Establishing of life at the quads.
It's night and there's not a soul in sight.
AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks
ten yards behind them, waiting until...
Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down
different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up.
SARA
Hey. How was the party? Are you
still the beer bong queen?
But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.
TRACY
Listen... something is up with your
roommate.
SARA
What do you mean?
TRACY
She was outside my room this
morning.
SARA
Doing what?
TRACY
Waiting for me. I opened my door...
and there she was. Just sitting
there, staring. Like some psycho.
SARA
Are you sure?
42.
TRACY
You don't believe me?
SARA
No, it's just... why would she do
that?
TRACY
Why don't you ask her? I've gotta
go...I'll see ya later.
Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy
turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes
catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building.
Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway.
Tracy leaves in a hurry.
Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she
walks. Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee.
SARA
Hey. How'd you know when my class
got out?
Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.
REBECCA
I'm your roommate.
Sara smiles and grabs a cup.
SARA
Thanks.
CUT TO:
They walk through the quads. Other students are around, some
strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class.
SARA
Listen... Tracy told me something
kinda weird. She says you... scared
her this morning.
Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.
REBECCA
What?
SARA
Yeah.
44.
REBECCA
It's more like she scared me. She
was racing to the bathroom like she
was gonna hurl. She almost knocked
me over.
A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.
SARA
The girl does like to party.
Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.
Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from
Irene: "where r u?!?!?!"
SARA
I gotta go meet Irene.
(raises her cup)
Thanks for the coffee.
Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.
Sara gets out of a cab. She looks up at a big building.
Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees.
Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As
they reach the fork in the path...
SARA
I guess I'll see you later.
REBECCA
Sara...
(SHE TURNS)
Last night. I was just worried
about you.
SARA
You don't need to worry about me.
I can take care of myself. Okay?
Rebecca slowly nods.
REBECCA
Sara. We're good, right?
A beat. Sara nods and smiles.
Stephen and Sara walk on a tree-lined path. Holding hands. He
checks his watch.
STEPHEN
Should we head back home?
They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,
jungle gym, etc.
SARA
The question is "whose home?"
STEPHEN
Hmmm...
SARA
I'll make you a bet. I go back to
your place or you take me home to
my twin bed and roommate.
STEPHEN
What's the bet?
She eyes the jungle gym.
CUT TO:
Sara and Stephen are each hanging from the jungle gym. This
has been going on for a few minutes. Both straining.
Stephen's worse off.
STEPHEN
This is kind of a stupid bet.
SARA
Why'd you agree?
STEPHEN
Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid
guy.
SARA
Making me laugh isn't going to help
you.
They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much
more in control as Stephen is straining.
54.
He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He
catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him
fall. She then lets go, victorious.
SARA (CONT'D)
I was a gymnast until I hit a
growth spurt my freshman year.
Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this
close". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful
shove.
SARA (CONT'D)
So I win.
He gives her a playful shove back.
STEPHEN
So.
She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.
SARA
So...let's go back to your place.
She gives him a seductive grin.
Carnegie Dorm on a bright, clear morning.
As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking
by herself.
SARA
Tracy!
Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she
didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her.
64.
SARA
Tracy... hey.
TRACY
Oh, hey.
Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle.
Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's.
SARA
I heard you changed dorms.
TRACY
Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a
better vibe.
SARA
Well, we should get together. Like
grab a bite or something. Right?
REBECCA (O.S.)
Sara!
Sara turns and waves at Rebecca.
SARA
Hi.
Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara.
TRACY
(TO SARA)
I'll call you.
But she's already walking away.
SARA
Tracy?!
REBECCA
What was that about?
SARA
I don't know. She just walked
away.
REBECCA
Well, she's always been a flake.
65.
Sara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters.
Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen.
Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go
home for the holiday.
SARA
Sorry about not staying. But,
Rebecca...
STEPHEN
I get it.
(KISSES HER)
I'm going to make out with my
pillow and pretend it's you.
SARA
Just say you'll miss me.
STEPHEN
I'll miss you.
Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives
Stephen an "I win" look as Sara closes the door.
82.
Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion
that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous.
Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the
mansion. Sara is in shock.
SARA
This is your home?
REBECCA
It's my parents house. It was
never a home.
It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.
Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts
discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.
REBECCA
Is everything okay?
SARA
Yeah. It's just...
She wants to ask her about that medication.
SARA
Nice to see where you come from.
REBECCA
(EMBARRASSED)
Come on.
Sara's running through the quad.
Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in
the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the
elevator, heading straight to the stairs.
Sara is going for a run through the city. She stops at an old
art deco apartment building.
She walks out the door. Looks around. And takes off running
again.
CUT TO:
Sara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back
at her dorm room window... but she doesn't.
Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down.
Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank.
Sara heads to class, walking faster than usual. Bumping into
people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca
before Rebecca spots her.
She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks
back at the quads.
Sara locks the front door and heads back home.
She walks down an empty quad. She slows at the sight of...
Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of
the quad.
No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the
side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca
keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the
pavement, listening to her Walkman.
Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other,
preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.
Five...
But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little
further and turns around.
Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?
102.
Sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house.
JASON, a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in
front of Sara's dorm. He's talking into his cell phone.
JASON
Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front
of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm
at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210.
Call me, okay?
He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the
door before it closes.
Sara comes fast-paced down the sidewalk. She enters Irene's
building.
Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot
hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes
to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes.
Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling
Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She
grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.
SARA
(CRYING)
Ohgodohgodohgod.
The more she screams, the more she loses her grip.
114.
Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her
arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.
Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets
her cry. He smiles.
STEPHEN
Okay I've got you. Everything is
gonna be okay!
He pulls her halfway in the window...
But a shadow rises behind him.
IRENE
STEPHEN!!!!
A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.
Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.
Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...
Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and
lets go of her.
115.
She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen
disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for
leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in
time to see...
Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps
to the floor, revealing:
Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.
Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the
window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.
Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.
SARA
Stephen.
Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it
out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes
violently in her hand.
Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on
the floor.
REBECCA
You won't do it. We're fr--
Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.
Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in
frustration. She drops the gun.
Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara
pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...
Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her
knuckles white, and...
CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.
She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...
Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of
Rebecca's purse everywhere.
Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt
Sara.
REBECCA
Friends help each other. They take
care of each other.
Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.
116.
SARA
Rebecca. We were never friends.
That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her
eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from
the floor, and slams her against the wall.
She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns
red. Redder...
But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.
Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The
utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's
shoulder blades.
Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She
won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...
Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-
consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out
and grabs Sara's hand.
Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from
around Rebecca's neck.
Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.
STEPHEN
(GROANING)
Sara.
She races over to him. He's barely alive.
SARA
Stephen. Hold on.
She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen
and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.
He looks into her eyes and smiles.
She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.
It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in
much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in
front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.
She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.
117.
She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about
look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They
don't say anything. Don't know what to say.
