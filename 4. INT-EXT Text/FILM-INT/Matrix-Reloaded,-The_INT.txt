The NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit
facing
backwards.
TRINITY,
MORPHEUS,
TANK,
and
NEO,
the
former
Thomas
Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away
from
them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.
It's been a mere TWO DAYS
since the realization of NEOS POWERS
and
the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into
the
interior
of the
ship, and
the crew
is cold,
tired, haggard,
and
stressed beyond
belief as
they can
only watch
the action in
their
knocked-out ship.
MORPHEUS is on a headset.
MORPHEUS
"Niobe, theyre closing."
NIOBE
"How many?"
MORPHEUS
"Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred."
NIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her
ship
with her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as
they streak over the dark surface.
NIOBE
"Youve got a gift for understatement."
THE
FREEDOMS CAPTAIN,
a silhouette
in a
dark cockpit,
is flying
blind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBES ship.
His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.
As she does, we see her
bare shoulder fall into view, a
WHITE RABBIT
tattoo is conspicuous.
They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.
MAN
"Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em."
NIOBE (V.O.)
"Too many!"
MAN (V.O.)
"Theyre on me! Shit! Losing power!"
NIOBES Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something
on
a console.
CIRCA
"Multiple bogies closing!"
NIOBE
"No shit."
CIRCA
"From the front!"
Niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. Several
objects
are closing in fast.
CIRCA
"Are they - "
She doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters
launch a massive
volley of missiles.
From afar, they
look like dark
irises
surrounded by
a corona
of flame.
At first,
we can't
tell
exactly what they
are, until their
fiery trails rip
straight at the
SEPHORA cockpit.
CIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by.
A massive
swarm off
missiles blasts
by the
cockpit. The individual
warheads
swerve
at
the last
second,
blowing
SQUIDDIES apart,
or
casting them to the ground aflame.
Niobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a
wing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,
with
huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to
the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.
NIOBE
"They're ours."
DEFENDER ONE (V.O.)
"Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning."
The crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they
leave
the scene of aerial carnage behind them.
NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He
relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly
enters
a cave, and starts
to descend. The blue
wash of the ship
shows rock
walls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back
into
the earth.
TANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.
TANK
"We're home."
TRINITY
"Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."
NEO
"What's that?"
MORPHEUS
"A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that
just saved us constitute the first ring."
NIOBE (V.O.)
"Neb crew, you can relax now."
MORPHEUS
"For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home."
FADE OUT
and
FADE INTO:
TRINITY'S
CABIN.
At
first
we
see
only
stars
twinkling, faraway
diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the
darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork
terminates in the metal ring going
around her room. It's a much
more
hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The
articles
she's collected during
her time in
the resistance dot
the cabin. An
unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits
of
loved ones.
Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO
is
sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside
him
with her head on his lap.
Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a
photo
of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,
laughing
as they are
seated around the
table. Morpeus, Tank,
Dozer,
Switch,
Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's
an
unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.
Gently,
placing
Trinity's head
down,
NEO stands
and
examines the
photo.
She awakens.
TRINITY
"I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher..."
NEO
"Who is this guy?"
TRINITY
"Who?"
NEO points to the mystery man.
TRINITY
"That was... I... forgot his name."
NEO
"What happened to him?"
TRINITY is sullen.
"He didnt make it."
NEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up,
awakening.
NEO
"Was he like me?"
TRINITY nods.
TRINITY
"Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo."
"Aren't you tired?"
NEO
"No. I've never been a big sleeper."
TRINITY
"I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."
He turns to her, questions in his eyes.
NEO
"How many 'ones' have there been?"
TRINITY
"That's not the point."
NEO may not think so.
TRINITY
"You are him. Youre mine."
NEO
"But what does it mean, to be The One?"
TRINITY
"I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you."
NEO
"So, now what?"
TRINITY
"Now, Zion will give us a new mission."
The hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in.
MORPHEUS
"We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes."
HE closes the hatch and disappears.
NEO
"Does he ever knock?"
TRINITY
"Not on his ship."
CUT TO:
The crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes
to
a rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank
unlocks
the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into
the
tarmac with a resounding smash.
CUT TO:
NEO is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the
bag.
Hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet.
CHOI
"So, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?"
TRINITY nods,
herself in
disbelief. NEO
picks his
head up
off the
table.
NEO
"Kicked... kicked Smiths ass."
CHOI eyes MORPHES and NIOBE coming toward them.
CHOI
"Hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, Neo? Like Morpheus?"
NEO
"Morpheus? Yeah, I smacked him around, too."
MORPHEUS arrives just
in time to
hear the last
part. He stands
and
grins down at NEO.
MORPHEUS
"So, you can smack me around, Neo?"
NEO
"Oh yeah. Anytime."
MORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into
the
booth. He stands before them.
TRINITY
"Hows Tank?"
MORPHEUS
"Hes on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son
shes lost in this war."
His comments set a sober tone.
MORPHEUS
"The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But,
thats not giving us a rest."
TRINITY
"Let me guess. Weve been ordered back out anyway."
MORPHEUS
"Yes. This is another special op. Im in command, Niobe and Trinity
are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon."
FLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.
MORPHEUS
"We dont know exactly what hes capable of. He may be just tapping
his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from
him, as he does from us."
CHOI
"Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight
back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?"
MORPHEUS
"Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi."
DUJOUR
"Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
to death."
CHOI
"Oh my God thats so funny. My point is, dont we need some r-and-r?
Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five,
right? Shit. Im glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus..."
MORPHEUS
"You dont have to go, Choi. Volunteers only."
TRINITY
"Hes got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?"
MORPHEUS
"We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our
ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our
entry. And Neos."
CHOI
"Fuck. Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do."
MORPHEUS
"He is the One."
DUJOUR
"You havent lost the faith, have you Choi?"
CHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down.
CHOI
"Well, these are the times that try mens souls. Heres to victory."
They watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance.
MORPHEUS
"Power up. Sleep mode."
CHOI
"Aye aye, capitano."
MINIMAL cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark.
The ships OPERATOR, a lean Asian
kid with a gaze like a
laser scan,
sits behind
NEO, whos
sitting at
the operators
console with
his
hands on the abbreviated keyboard. Trinity sits with them, her feet up
as she observes.
NEO
stares
at
the
screen. Its
a
huge
syllabus
of Matrix
code
characters. He struggles to learn the complex code.
NEO
"Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine, right?
RAZOR nods.
RAZOR
"You catch on quick, man."
NEO
"I know these symbols from the hacking trainer. But how come its so
hard to find them on the keyboard?"
TRINITY
"Your brain knows what to do. But it has to associate characters with
your body."
RAZOR
"Its muscle memory, Neo. Think of the space bar and your thumbs nail
it. Because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. But
think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit
the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."
NEO
"Where did these symbols come from, anyway?"
RAZOR
"Most of it is from the old Japanese. Its Katakana. See, the machines
arent binary. No zero and one. Theyre quantum-based, so instead of
an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all
numbers between zero and one."
NEO
"All numbers between zero and one. That could be an infinite number of
numbers."
RAZOR
"Not could be, it is."
NEO is astounded.
NEO
"Holy shit. How many calculations per second?"
RAZOR
"How many CPS? Well, thats kind of hard to estimate. Put it this way:
picture all the particles in the known universe. Not just atoms, but
sub-atomic particles that compose atoms."
NEO
"OK. At last count that was what, a gazillion, right? Two gazillion?"
RAZOR barely smiles at the joke.
RAZOR
"Well, its up there. In any case, the number of calculations per
second the Matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of
particles in the known universe."
NEO
"Woah."
TRINITY
"Thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds
within their PCs."
NEO
"OK. Thats why it looks like reality. They have the computing power
to create entire worlds."
RAZOR
"Right."
NEO
"So, if we hack into the Matrix, why cant we just change the code
while were at it?"
RAZOR
"No, no. See, its not that simple. The machines, the programs that
code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the agents, they are code.
There are different types of agents, many work unseen with no
interaction in the matrix. Then, there are the enforcers, the ones we
know all too well."
NEO
"Right."
RAZOR
"Well, my point is, the machines code and recode the Matrix by pure
will. Interaction with the Matrix, the physical act of being there,
by default, allows people to change their environment - the Matrix.
They move objects, make sound, affect cause."
NEO
"Like reality."
TRINITY
"Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the fabric of reality in the
Matrix can be rewoven. Some can reach beyond normal cause. Their
affects on the Matrix are deeper than average. They have learned to
change it according to their needs. But they dont have total control.
Thats why we need operators like Razor here. But you, you go further
than any of us can."
NEO
"How?"
RAZOR stands
and taps
Neos skull.
He stretches,
grabs a
Japanese
style
wooden
sword, and,
out
of boredom,
starts
performing slow,
precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.
RAZOR
"The equipment you carry up here. Youre a freak. A good freak. Youre
neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. This, combined
with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the
reality of the Matrix."
NEO
"How did I end up as... a freak?"
RAZOR practices the same strike a few times.
RAZOR
"Good question. The Machines create people through cloning, since,
obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. Theoretically, all clones
in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. They
shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."
NEO
"OK, so how do you explain me?"
TRINITY
"Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were all born inside.
NEO
"Well, what separates us from others?"
TRINITY
"For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children
in the Matrix. Theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines
never predicted. Some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.
Others seem to have psychic powers."
RAZOR looks up to see MORPHEUS,
hanging back as he listens. He
comes
forward.
MORPHEUS
"And others are able to change the reality of the Matrix itself."
HE points to Neo.
MORPHEUS
"Discussing history, are we?"
RAZOR shakes his head.
RAZOR
"Im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. Hes stuck in
the 20^th century. Hes got no skills, man. Without us, hes
helpless."
MORPHEUS
"In the Matrix, without him, were helpless."
TRINITY
"Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?"
MORPHEUS
"Not until we reach broadcast depth. Its slow going out there. I
guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. We have time
to rest and ready."
CHOI,
RAZOR,
DUJOUR, and
CIRCA
are sitting
around
the operators
console, feet up, eating. On the screens are patchy images of
TRINITY
and NEO standing together in
the GLADE. Its like theyre
watching a
soap opera.
TRINITY and NEO are looking in their direction.
ON THE interface chairs, the bodies of TRINITY and NEO lay supine.
THE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear
off the screen and into the darkness.
RAZOR puts his hand on CIRCAS shoulder and sighs.
RAZOR
"So romantic."
CIRCA calmly pats his hand and removes it, holding it in front of him.
CIRCA
"Im sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I."
AGENTS
JONES and
BROWN sit
across from
each other,
a steel
table
between them.
They stare
at each
other for
what seems
like a long
time. There is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst
neat
stacks of file folders.
AGENT JONES
"Our defeat is worrisome."
AGENT BROWN
"As is the loss of our colleague."
THEY ARE BOTH seething with anger. AGENT JONES grinds his molars.
JONES
"We cant defeat them. You saw what happened."
JONES
"We have a backup copy of Agent Smith..."
JONES stands and walks toward the massive panoramic window. The city
spreads before him.
JONES
"A backup is not good enough. We need to upgrade ourselves to meet the
new threat."
BROWN opens a large file folder.
BROWN
"Hes being rebuilt. But I have an alternate plan. Why fight the
humans, when we can let them fight for us?"
JONES
"The terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot.
This was the cause of our defeat."
BROWN
"Mr. Thomas J. Anderson is not unique. Over the decades, many humans
have developed... techniques for manipulating the Matrix. Techniques
too primitive for us to understand. Most never realize their
potential, but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are
recorded here."
ANGLE ON the book as BROWN flips through. Street shots of people
from
all walks of life. Young rebels, corporate suits, junkies, housewives.
JONES turns on AGENT BROWN.
JONES
"Do you have anyone in mind?"
ANGLE ON the book. It stops
on a page dedicated to someone
who looks
like NEO, but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude. There
are
photos of him on
a motorcycle with a
blonde, photos of him
drinking
with his gang friends.
BROWN
"Gregory Lowfield. He exhibits the traits we saw in Mr. Anderson."
MANS VOICE (O.S.)
"Mr. Anderson no longer exists. Our enemy now is the one called...
NEO."
ANGLE ON: THE DOOR
AGENT SMITH walks in, grinning. There
is a new swag to his
walk, and
his hair is longer, tied back.
BROWN
"Youve been recreated."
SMITH flexes his arm, examines his hands, and feels his hair.
JONES
"And you have more hair."
SMITH turns to him, examines the photos on the table. They lock
eyes.
On
the same
wavelength, they
transfer knowledge
without speaking.
SMITH looks at the photo on the table.
SMITH
"I know what youre thinking. What we need is our own Neo..."
JONES
"If its possible."
SMITH
"Ill make it possible."
WE ZOOM in on the grainy photo of NEOs doppledanger. Quiet at
first,
growing
louder as
it grows
dark, we
here the
rumble and
roar of
motorcycles.
The cop sets his paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the
pack exploding down the highway, with GREGORY surfing his bike.
ANGLE ON: the radar gun. Its flashing 125 MPH
COP
"Holy shit. Drunk ass punks."
WE look
through the
windshield as
the cop
drives down the highway,
calling in his
stop-vehicle report. He
suddenly sees something
that
makes him slam on the brakes.
COP
"Holy shit!"
ANGLE THROUGH the
cops windshield. The
ten bikers, with
GREGORY at
their center, are
parked in the
middle of the
road, looking at
him
casually."
The COP is
lying half-on the
seat, taking cover.
The handset relays
only static. He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregorys voice.
GREGORY
"Dont try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating
ass."
TINNY RADIO chatter fills the
red-lit cockpit over the steady
hum of
the
engines. The
nose of
the chopper
points to
the ground
as
it
focuses on GREGORY and CHANDRA, who are ripping down the highway.
CU on the cockpit instruments, centered on the airspeed indicator. The
needle is pushing to the max, going through 150 knots.
PILOT (V.O.)
"Holy shit, hes outrunning us."
CUT TO:
THE ENGINE smashes in through
the console, pushing the cops
apart as
the glass windshield explodes and
their seats slide forward into
the
console, smashing them like jelly.
CU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA
WITH
HIS
HAND
still
on
the
grille,
CHANDRA
AND
GREGORY remain
untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop
back into REAL
time and see
the cruisers body
rip over and
around
them. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission
remain still against
GREGORYS HAND. The
cruiser was gutted,
like a
banana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them,
silent now, flips and explodes.
THE ENGINE block is suspended a few
feet in the air. It drops to
the
ground with a thud.
GREGORY and CHANDRA get to their
feet and run into the early
morning
desert.
CU: GUTTED CRUISER
UNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering
wheel
is smashed deep
into his mouth,
splitting his jaw
open. Wet, broken
chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just
before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS.
The ship is
quiet. RAZOR sits
at the operator
console, smashing the
keyboard as he forces Tetris pieces into place.
CHOI is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop. He speaks into
his headphones.
CHOI
"OK, try it here."
RAZOR halts his video game playing and flashes to a different
screen.
Lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits
the
ENTER key with a flourish. The screen flashes, and the familiar scroll
of the MATRIX cascades down the screens.
RAZOR
"Holy shit."
CUT TO:
CHOI
"What? Tell me you got signal."
RAZOR (V.O.)
"No fucking shit I got signal. Dude, theyre changing it."
CHOI is annoyed.
CHOI
"Are you using the right pulse wave?"
CUT TO:
RAZOR
"Shut the fuck up and get back here."
THE
MATRIX
scroll
pours
down
at
a
streaking
pace.
Its almost
impossible to make out the individual characters.
CHOI comes up behind RAZOR
CHOI
"Oh my God. What are they - "
RAZOR
"Theyre changing the Matrix."
CHOI
"Call Morpheus."
RAZOR patches into MORPHEUS cabin through the headset.
ITS dark, but
quiet classical music
can be heard.
Hes not in
bed
alone. NIOBES shaded form can be made out behind him.
MORPHEUS sounds awake,
but looks anything
but. He grabs
the buzzing
handset only an arms length from him.
MORPHEUS
"Im here."
RAZOR
"Sir, you gotta get down here."
MORPHEUS starts
dressing as
he talks.
He puts
a reasurring hand on
NIOBES shoulder.
MORPHEUS
"Proximity alarm?"
RAZOR
"The Matrix, sir. The coding is going nuts."
MORPHEUS
"Be right there."
MORPHEUS hangs
up the
phone and
jumps into
his boots.
He turns to
NIOBE as he works.
MORPHEUS
"It sounds bad. Theyre readjusting quicker than we thought."
NIOBE jumps up and dresses quickly.
NIOBE
"Already?"
MORPHEUS
"It appears that they are learning their lessons."
NIOBE shakes her head.
"Morpheus, how much are you going to tell him?"
MORPHEUS pauses.
MORPHEUS
"Tell Neo? About his predecessors, I suppose?"
NIOBE, dressed, nods.
MORPHEUS
"He is the -"
NIOBE puts a finger to his lips.
NIOBE
"Six came before him, Morpheus."
MORPHEUS shakes his head slowly.
MORPHEUS
"To me, none came before him. The Oracle told me I would find the one.
It is prophecy. You havent seen what he can do."
NIOBE
"What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time?"
MORPHEUS
"There are lots of ifs. How about this one: What if we lose faith in
our cause?"
HE disappears through the door, leaving Niobe standing in the dim
light.
MORPHEUS leans over RAZOR and CHOI.
MORPHEUS
"Talk to me."
RAZOR
"Not good, boss, I gotta compile a new descrambler."
MORPHEUS nods.
MORPHEUS
"Do it. Were at broadcast depth?"
CHOI
"Yes sir."
MORPHEUS
"We have to download our mission specs. Move aside, I have to log into
the mainframe."
MORPHEUS
takes
over
RAZORS
seat.
The
scrolling
code disappears,
replaced by the small words: ZION.dtr1.mnfr4m3 LOGON.
MORPHEUS pushes
the keyboard
under the
console so
its hidden
from
view. He taps at the
keyboard. Hidden password appears on
the screen
in the form of: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.
SCREEN: LOGON ACCEPTED. WELCOME, MORPHEUS.
MISSION SPECS DOWNLOADING...
DOWNLOADED
LOGOUT COMPLETE
MISSION TYPE: INFILTRATION / DESTRUCTION
TARGET: MATRIX MAINFRAME
MORPHEUS eyes open slightly when he reads the screen, but he
regains
his
composure
quickly. RAZORS
mouth
drops open,
and
CHOI starts
cracking up.
CHOI
"The mainframe? Haha. Its a joke, right Morpheus? Is today April 1^st
?"
NIOBE appears behind them.
NIOBE
"Its not a joke. We have The One. We must do it now."
RAZOR
"But theyre altering the code already. I cant even read it yet."
MORPHEUS turns and faces them.
MORPHEUS
"We have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do
it."
RAZOR
"Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is
in Antarctica. Well never cut through it all."
MORPHEUS
"You havent seen The One in action."
RAZOR looks dubious, and turns to the screens.
MORPHEUS
"Can you hack in?"
RAZOR pounds the keys. The Matrix disappears, replaced by his program.
RAZOR
"Getting you in is no problem. Maintaining the input/output and
helping you is the problem. Thats how they killed savior number four,
if I remember right. They cut the signal and trapped him in there."
MORPHEUS spins the chair, then stops it. Their faces are inches apart.
MORPHEUS
"We dont speak of the past."
RAZOR
"Excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir."
HE turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding.
CUT TO: NEO
Hes standing at
the edge of
some equipment on
the Main Deck.
Hes
heard every word. He rounds the corner. The others catch sight of him.
The same thought is on everyone's mind: How much had he heard.
MORPHEUS
"Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the crew. Razor, whats the ETA for
getting us in there?"
RAZOR shakes his head.
RAZOR
"I dunno. Just gimme an hour, Ill probably have caught up to them."
MORPHEUS walks up to NEO.
MORPHEUS
"Come with me."
CUT TO:
MORPHEUS and
NEO sit
together. The
cockpit lights
are dimmed down,
only the EMP pulse button glows.
Outside the ship, in the dark
mists
of the underworld,
patches of eerie
phosphorescent moss glow
on the
walls. Occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.
The two of them watch the deadly outside world.
MORPHEUS
"Were deep in their territory."
NEO
"I see that."
MORPHEUS stares out at the night, deep in thought. He turns to NEO.
MORPHEUS
"Are you rested?"
NEO
"Yes."
MORPHEUS
"You know now, that you had predecessors."
NEO
"Yes. Ive heard things."
MORPHEUS
"What types of things?"
NEO
"That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
special. But they ended up dead."
MORPHEUS nods slowly.
MORPHEUS
"Its true. There were others. And I didnt tell you right away.
Because you were not ready."
NEO nods.
MORPHEUS
"Does this anger you?"
NEO
"I dont know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I cant decide
whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be."
MORPHEUS
"You shouldnt be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracles prophecy.
Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."
NEO
"What?"
MORPHEUS
"The destruction of The Matrix."
MORPHEUS looks out into the darkness.
MORPHEUS
"Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world
for you, and to baptize you by fire. But from here on out, no one
knows."
NEO
"Can we ask The Oracle."
MORPHEUS
"Not in this life."
NEO is confused.
MORPHEUS
"No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher
turned on us."
NEO is taken aback.
NEO
"But she must have known, if they came to her."
MORPHEUS
"Perhaps she did."
NEO shakes his head.
NEO
"I cant believe it. I dont know, Morpheus, if Im prepared for this
war. Im not a soldier. How, how are we going to win?"
MORPHUES
"For decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world,
without a conclusion. Now, after nearly a century of war, were at a
standstill. The only way that we can see to win is by destroying their
source of energy. We have to pull the plug on them. We must crash the
Matrix."
MORPHEUS grins slyly.
MORPHEUS
"Remember, when I told you, that Ill show you how deep the rabbit
hole goes?"
NEO
"Yes."
MORPHEUS
"I brought you deep, yet I no longer know the way. No one does. With
every second we sink deeper than before. You are our guiding light,
now. Your powers exceed mine a millionfold. I have shown you the path
to victory, Neo. Lead us down it."
MORPHEUS, NEO, TRINITY, CHOI, and
NIOBE are on the chairs
as theyre
being JACKED IN by CIRCA and RAZOR.
CUT TO: RAZOR jumps in the
operators chair, his hands blur over
the
touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the Matrix.
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"Were going straight for the throat, people."
ANGLE ON: RAZOR and CIRCA
typing like made at their
keyboards. RAZOR
hits the ENTER
key. They look
on, transfixed with
anticipation. The
screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt. The slap each others
hands and continue hacking.
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"We have the advantage of surprise. They wont expect us to return so
soon."
THE FIVE
of them
stand, immobile,
around a
ringing phone
as their
minds filter in to their body images. They are dressed practically
in
denim
and leather,
like blue
collar workers.
Their dress
wouldnt
attract the slightest
bit of attention,
except for the
padded coats
and tote bags filled with firepower.
CIRCA
"Keep your eyes out for changes, theyre modifying things. Dial 0
for operator."
MORPHEUS holds his celly to his ear.
CIRCA (O.S.)
"And have a nice day."
HE drops the phone into his pocket. They turn to him.
MORPHEUS
"Niobe, youre the liasion to our operators. Neo, what do you have for
a game plan?"
NEO
"Where is the mainframe?"
MORPHEUS
"The Metacortex building."
NEOs jaw drops.
NEO
"What the fuck? Thats where I worked."
CHOI
"And what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video
games? You were working for The Man."
TRINITY
"Its true, Neo. Metacortex employs humans to write code for the
Matrix."
NEO
"I thought I was working on a fucking database."
MORPHEUS
"They keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing.
Thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people. But, that
doesnt matter."
NEO recovers.
NEO
"How bout this? I just walk up to the Metacortex building and blow it
up?"
CHOI laughs.
CHOI
"What, by power of will?"
NEO nods. CHOIS smile fades. He looks to the others.
CHOI
"Hes joking right?"
MORPHEUS shakes his head.
MORPHEUS
"Well fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. If youre
able to accomplish this mission, well phase back into the ship. Stay
in contact. If you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately."
AGENT BROWN is staring down at
the ground. ACROSS THE STREET, NEO
is
walking toward his building.
BROWN
"Hes back."
AGENT SMITH and JONES stare
down into the plaza. The
building shakes
slightly as it descends.
FROM the three
streets that enter
the plaza, military
vehicles pour
in. Hundreds
of troops
discharge and
form a
L-shaped circle around
NEO. Tanks
rumble in,
and the
Apaches whirl
to a
hover. Panicking
civilians rush out of the kill zone.
NEO stands calmly, continuing his work.
CU: TANK GUNNER
HIS eye is glued to the tank
site and his trigger finger on the
fire
button.
POV: TANK SITE
The green crosshairs sit on NEOS chest.
CU: NEO
His eyes open, but the building continues to collapse. He stares up at
a mirrored window, and somehow, straight into the eyes of:
CU: AGENT SMITH
SMITH
"Open fire."
A WALL of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines.
The tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on NEO as we
drop into bullet time.
THE bullets sizzle
as tracers burn
off their backs.
The draw toward
him like
slugs. Thousands
of bullets
fired at
perpendicular angles
close
in on
him. As
they draw
close to
one another
along almost
perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce.
The bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to
burn.
The world
is in
stop motion
as the
bullets stop,
turn 180
degrees, and
suddenly accelerate
back at
their origins.
Faster and
fast they fly, until we drop back into REAL TIME.
THE SKIRMISH line
of troops is
ripped apart by
a hail of
their own
bullets.
CU: MACHINE GUNNER. With an M-249 SAW, he blazes away at NEO, only
to
be shredded by his own bullets. A
private takes a shot at NEO, and
a
bullet slaps into his
shoulder. REALIZING whats happening,
he drops
his weapon.
THE SOLDIERS are dropping like flies. The firing quickly subsides.
NEO stands
alone in
the center,
unharmed. He
turns to the skirmish
lines.
THE
surviving soldiers
drop
their weapons,
and
run. Panic
ensues. Only a few officers, NCOs, and soldiers too amazed to think of
running remain.
NEO is targeted on an LCD screen.
PILOT
"Fox One."
THE missile bears down the chopper.
CU: PILOT
HES TOO stunned to move. Mouth agape, he can only watch as:
TANK COMMANDER
"Fire!"
THE GUNNER pulls the trigger.
THE gunner screams as the BREECH explodes, blocking our view.
THE
EXPLOSION shakes
the building.
The scene
below is
a complete
route. Black smoke billows up
from the flaming wrecks. The
remaining
tanks arent retreating
- the crews
are piling out
and running. The
Apache helicopters turn tail and run.
AGENT JONES
"The plan is not working."
AGENT SMITH
"No shit."
AGENT BROWN enters the room.
AGENT BROWN
"What about your protg?"
AGENT SMITH
"Hes not ready yet. Ill deal with this myself."
AGENT JONES
"You cant beat him."
AGENT SMITH
"Ive been altered. Im Smith, 2.0."
AGENTS BROWN and JONES look at one another.
CU: SMITH
HE clenches his teeth, as though hes girding himself for something.
SMITH
"Kill the others. Ill take care of this."
RAZOR is at
his operator chair,
surrounded by consoles.
Some of the
Matrix code screens are in blue, others in red, at least one in green.
The code
on the
green screen
starts pouring
down at
an incredible
rate.
RAZOR
"Fuck."
HE hits something on the keypad.
RAZOR
"Theyre about to pull something. Processing power is pouring into the
agent programs and theyre locking onto your 3-D grid displacements.
THE GHOST program
is loaded. We
see 3-D images
of Morpheus and
the
others flash across the screen.
SMITH STANDS alone, his comrades have disappeared.
THE glass before him shimmers.
RAZOR bangs away at the keyboard.
RAZOR
"Four fucking agents, no wonder so much processing power is devoted to
them."
Razor stares at the data pouring down the screens.
RAZOR
"No goddamned way."
His headphone chimes.
RAZOR
"Operator."
RAZOR
"Theyre putting all the coppertops to sleep. They froze the Matrix."
MORPHEUS
"Why?"
RAZOR
"All processing power is being re-diverted to the agent program."
NIOBE stands at the edge of the building and points down.
NIOBE
"Morpheus, look!"
DOWN on the ground below them, theres a swarm of AGENT Smiths
GREGORY hurtles down the stairs, one at a time.
RAZOR dials the phone. MORPHEUS picks up.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
"Yes."
RAZOR
"Theyre hitting your ghosts."
MASSIVE attack of STATIC bursts on the line.
RAZOR
"What the - "
THE LINE goes dead.
CHOI and TRINITY hide
in the shadows of
an empty room, watching
the
battle. TRINITYS cell rings. She answers silently.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
"Lets go. Laxe Three."
TRINITY
"What about Neo?"
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
"We can do nothing to help him. Well only get in his way."
THEY leave the room.
GREGORY stumbles
into the
lobby. Slumbering
bodies lie
everywhere,
slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on the ground.
THE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a
broken
and dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to
her. The tach is redlining as
the
car rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover.
TRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.
"Shift."
MORPHEUS does so,
and the tires
squeal again when
she releases into
second, then
third. In
a few
seconds theyre
over 60
on the
busy
street.
THEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up
the breakdown lane.
Once they hit
a straightaway Trinity
floors it,
and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.
MORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured
into
the seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the
broken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.
The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.
MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.
MORPHEUS
"Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself."
TRINITY pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. Her face tightens,
and
she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world
out,
which
is
good,
as
they suffer
constant
close
calls
as Morpheus
controls the wheel from his awkward spot.
When she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. With BOTH hands.
MORPHEUS pulls out
his cell and
tries the line.
Its still full
of
static.
TRINITY
"Any luck?"
MORPHEUS
"None. Theyve killed city-wide comms."
TRINITY
"Then the agents are out of touch with each other."
MORPHEUS
"They cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our
exits, and find the Neb. Well try the desert. Communications might be
working there still."
TRINITY
"What about Niobe?"
MORPHEUS
"She knows to meet us there."
THE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that
no sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to
THE
ORACLE.
NEO exits an
elevator. Recomposed and
dressed normally, he
walks up
and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.
A tall black woman, one of the Oracles priestesses, comes out of
the
stairwell and recognizes NEO.
PRIESTESS
"Neo."
HE turns
and looks
at her.
She smiles,
but as
Neo looks at her, a
flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the
smile returns.
PRIESTESS
"The Oracle is anxious to see you."
NEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are
covered,
and NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess moves
into the dark kitchen.
NEOs eyes
adjust to
the darkness.
He hears
something squish as he
steps, and looks down.
The tattered rug
is a swamp
of dark, congealing
liquid. NEO reaches
down and touches it with his fingertips. Its half-dried blood.
He stands, his eyes adjusted to
the dark now. The walls are
chipped,
covered in bullet holes.
In slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks
AGENT
BROWN. NEO turns to the
kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES
appear. They
all draw their .45s.
NEO stands
still as
they walk
up to
him and
put their guns to his
head.
AGENT SMITH scoffs.
NEO
"I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you,
to destroy you."
AGENT JONES
"What are you waiting for?"
NEO
"I realized, that I cant destroy you - "
HE nods at SMITH
NEO
" - without destroying the Matrix itself."
SMITH
"You killed me too easy last time."
BROWN
"And if you kill us - "
HE nods at JONES
BROWN
"Well only come back like him."
BROWN nods to SMITH.
NEO
"I know."
SMITH breathes deep, and drops his gun. The others follow suit.
SMITH
"So, why dont you take it all down?"
NEO
"The Matrix?"
SMITH
"Yes."
NEO
"I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."
SMITH snorts.
SMITH
"I take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this?"
NEO looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.
NEO
"How many people are in it?"
SMITH holsters his weapon. He speaks matter-of-factly.
SMITH
"Six and a half billion."
FOR NEO, the numbers are too huge to imagine.
BROWN scoffs.
BROWN
"Could you destroy us?"
ITS a serious question for Neo. But he nods. He knows his potential.
NEO
"I could."
SMITH
"What does that make you feel like? God?"
HE is amused by the idea.
JONES
"This is getting tiresome. Where do we go from here?"
NEO
"IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Ill
let you live."
SMITH
"Idiot. We dont care about life, we care about victory."
NEO
"Why?"
JONES
"So our kind... prevails."
NEO
"You mean, lives."
SMITH
"Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us
first."
BROWN
"But you didnt. Youre not as tough as you think."
NEO
"Well see."
THE three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door
of the apartment. NEO opens it,
and stops, his face meeting a
flying
FIST. His vision
FLASHES with the
impact, and he
staggers back into
the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.
GREGOR steps into the room, tall and BAD.
NEO holds up a hand.
NEO
"Stop! I dont want to fight you! Youre human!"
GREGORY
doesnt
answer.
He
smashes
a
side-kick
into
NEOs gut,
doubling him over.
THE kick carries
such an impact
that a pale
concussion wave flashes
past Gregor. It sends NEO crashing out the window.
GREGORY stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the
three
agents. Theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below.
The building
starts trembling.
We hear
rapid-fire impacts,
growing
louder and coming faster.
THE FLOOR EXPLODES
as NEO crashes
up through the
concrete, throwing
the agents away as
he embraces GREGORY in
a bear hug. THEY
blast up
through the ceiling. WE follow them up through three more floors, bam,
bam, bam. Each concrete floor smashes GREGORY in the head.
NEO stands. Offscreen,
we can here
choking breaths. Neo
looks down.
Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through
the chest by snapped, rusty rebar.
He takes one last breath, and
his
eyes half-close.
NEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole.
CU: GREGORY
HIS eyes
blink, and
he follows
NEOs departure.
Choking, unable to
breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. Theres nothing for him
to grab to pull himself off the steel.
His eyes clenched
shut, Gregor levitates,
by force of
will, pulling
his body off the rebar.
The corrugated bars make wet,
sucking sounds
as the pull through his body.
Finally, he gets to a twisted
piece of
bar, and cant make it over. Hes losing all his breath, all his
life
force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest.
WITH one
last, wiggling
effort, he
works it
through him. HIS mouth
opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of
the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more,
CUT TO:
MORPHEUS tries his cell again. This time, it reaches the Neb.
RAZOR and CIRCA are both operating the consoles.
RAZOR
"Operator."
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"Good to hear youre still there."
RAZOR
"Jesus, you too. Where the fuck are you?"
MORPHEUS
"About two hundred miles east of the city, on highway 315. We need an
exit."
RAZOR
"Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest stop."
MORPHEUS
"I dont remember an exit there."
RAZOR
"Gimme five minutes."
MORPHEUS
"Out."
RAZOR clears the
screen in front
of him and
cracks his fingers.
He
looks at Circa.
CIRCA
"Theyre OK?"
RAZOR
"Gotta get em out. They need an exit program."
CU: Keyboard.
RAZORS fingers
fly at
inhuman speeds
over the keys.
Data
pours down
the console
as he
blazes away.
Finally, he
hits
enter so hard it rocks the station.
RAZOR
turns to
Circa as
Matrix code
resumes its
cascade down
the
screens.
RAZOR
"Yes! Did you like that?"
CIRCA just rolls her eyes.
MORPHEUS phone rings. He answers. Its Razor.
RAZOR
"Exit ready sir."
MORPHEUS
"Check the phone for bombs."
CIRCA looks over some data and shakes her head.
CIRCA
"Its clear."
RAZOR (O.S.)
"Its all set. Theres a pair of cops at the rest stop, though."
MORPHEUS
"Not a problem."
THE Countach pulls into
the meager rest stop,
not more than a
water
fountain, toilet house and phone booth.
A police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders.
A ROOKIE cop, his
face to young for
a razor, is shaking
as he peeks
through a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists
who
just wasted his partner. He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his
service pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs.
RAZOR and CIRCA see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen.
RAZOR
"Fuck, fuck fuck!"
TRINITYS body spasms violently against her harness as her life
signs
go berserk.
Shes not
dead, but
death is
only seconds
away. Circa
screams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity
from which he derived his name.
CIRCA stands over
Trinity as the
rebels blue eyes
flutter open. Her
whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs
Circa.
CIRCA
"Youre safe, youre safe!"
RAZOR pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen.
RAZOR
"Crazy mothers!"
CIRCA has
removed Trinitys
interface, but
shes having
a seizure.
Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the
cover
off a wicked hypo.
RAZOR
"Whats wrong with her?"
CIRCA
"Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit."
CIRCA straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest.
RAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.
CIRCA
"All right."
SHE punches
some keys.
MORPHEUS 3-D
avatar flashes
on a
console,
along with a massive array of weapons.
CIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair. Razor is triumphant.
RAZOR
"Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking agent! He gave up!"
MORPHEUS, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.
MORPHEUS
"Where is Neo?"
CIRCA
"Havent heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of
the Matrix."
MORPHEUS appears enraged. He looks at Neo, supine on his chair.
MORPHEUS
"Why does it still exist? Why hasnt he destroyed it yet?"
RAZOR
"Maybe he cant."
TRINITY is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like
hell.
TRINITY
"Is he even alive? Is he captured?"
RAZOR
"Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Havent locked
onto him since."
MORPHEUS
"What? Why not?"
CIRCA
"Call me crazy, but I think hes masking his own displacement
signature."
RAZOR
"His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back
and forth."
MORPHEUS
stares at
the data
on the
screens. The
Matrix lives.
He
pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at
an
incredible rate. Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers.
MORPHEUS
"I found him once. Ill find him again."
We
go deeper
into the
miasma of
green symbols,
swallowed by
the
blackness of the screen, and emerge into:
The apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a
leather couch, watching
whatever on the
tube with the
sound off. He
absentmindedly
manipulates a
quarter over
and around
his fingers.
Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter.
Holding it between his
thumb and forefinger, he
folds it in half
as
though it was a disk of bubble
gum. He folds it again, then rools
it
as though its a musket ball.
Chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. She reaches
points the remote at the TV, but Gregory puts his hand over it to
get
her attention.
GREGORY
"So, you really dont have any idea how you got here?"
CHANDRA
"No. I only remember being on the bike."
GREGORY sighs.
GREGORY
"Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we
got this place?"
She looks at him, annoyed.
CHANDRA
"Duh. We broke in. We dont own a penthouse."
GREGORY
"What if I said we did?"
CHANDRA
"Id say youre insane."
She finally gets the remote and changes the channel. The volume
comes
on, louder and
infinitely more tinny
and obnoxious than
anything in
life. Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space.
NEO sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring
ahead.
Hes
in the
belfry of
an ancient,
destroyed cathedral,
among the
pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap.
FROM here, in
downtown, we can
see the modern,
uptown section, with
its
gleaming
skyscrapers. METACORTEX
still
stands, illuminated
by
searchlights.
NEO sits and broods. Isolated, his world turned upside down and
right
side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank.
Again, he tries his cell phone.
Static. He collapses it and puts
it.
Just as it leaves his mind, it rings. The face flips open.
NEO puts it to his ear without speaking.
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"Neo."
NEOS grim expression is melted by relief.
NEO
"Morpheus! Holy shit! You wont believe what happened."
MORPHEUS
"I know."
NEO
"I couldnt do it. Morpheus, theres a problem."
MORPHEUS has the headset on. He stands and surveys NEO.
MORPHEUS
"Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix exists."
MORPHEUS isnt happy about what he has to tell his protg, but
there
is no bending his will. The others look on soberly.
MORPHEUS
"Neo, the Matrix... its not real. And its up to you to end it."
Everyone is watching
Morpheus, and no
one can quite
believe what is
happening.
MORPHEUS
"You know what needs to be done. Time is short. Make up your mind. The
only way youre getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction."
Morpheus kills the connection.
MORPHEUS drops the headset on
the operations console. He types
a few
commands on the keyboard, then addresses the crew.
MORPHEUS
"No one goes in. Hes on his own."
He leaves the main deck.
Trinity stares at Neo for a moment, her face fighting for composure No
one looks at her. She walks away, then leans against the bulkhead, her
body shaking.
