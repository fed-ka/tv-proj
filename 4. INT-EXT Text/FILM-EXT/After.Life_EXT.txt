A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.
Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old
trees onto statues of grieving angels.
3.
A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of
violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home.
Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town
in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a
red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the
vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.
The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind
her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...
... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on
her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The
DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.
Anna locks her car.
Heads towards the main building.
Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.
ANNA
Shouldn't you be home?
JACK
My mom's picking me up.
(BEAT)
It's my birthday. We're going to
MacDonald's. Then on Saturday my mom's
taking me to Busch Gardens. We're
going to ride the Alpengeist.
(EARNESTLY)
Continually voted one of the top ten roller
coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is
a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.
ANNA
(tries to keep a straight-face)
I didn't know the park was open yet.
JACK
My mom's friends with the manager.
They're opening it specially for me.
She knows he's lying again.
Smiles sadly.
ANNA
Sounds like fun.
JACK
Yes.
It will be fun.
10.
They reach Anna's car.
Stand in silence for a moment.
ANNA
Jack. Those boys.
Do they bother you
a lot?
Jack hesitates.
Then slowly nods his head.
ANNA
You know you can always talk to me about
it if you want to.
He nods.
Anna's clearly worried about him.
ANNA
You sure you don't need a ride?
Jack shakes his head.
Anna glances at her watch.
ANNA
Well.
I better run.
JACK
Where are you going?
ANNA
(HESITATES)
I have to go to a funeral.
My old piano
teacher.
JACK
(with sudden interest)
Can I come?
ANNA
No Jack.
Funerals are very private
affairs.
JACK
I've never been to a funeral.
ANNA
It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway
wouldn't your mom worry about you?
JACK
(SHRUGS)
Not really.
ANNA
I'm sure she would. I'll see you
tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful
birthday.
Jack nods disappointed.
Anna watches him walk away then
gets in her car.
11.
Jack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then
unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange
jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up
and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own.
Anna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill
with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon.
Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window.
Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door
handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when
the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a
freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.
Anna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel
driveway. She stops. Stares out over the cemetery.
FATHER GRAHAM (O.S.)
...certain hope of the resurrection to
eternal life through our Lord Jesus
Christ, who died and rose again for us.
Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of
her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the
keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag.
She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary.
She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back
her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.
16.
Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her
hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.
Anna closes the car door.
It's still raining hard outside.
Her hair, perfect minutes ago, is now bedraggled. Her make-
up's running. She places her hands on the steering wheel.
Trying desperately to pull herself together.
Suddenly. THUMP. Anna jumps. Turns. Paul's at the car
window. He thumps the glass again. Anna hits the locks.
Paul grabs the door handle.
PAUL
Anna. Open the door. Please. I want
you to come with me. I want to...
Anna can't hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING
onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive.
Paul stumbles aside as Anna's car pulls away. She stops
at the parking lot exit a short distance away.
20.
Anna looks up into the rearview mirror.
ON REARVIEW MIRROR
Paul stands forlornly in the rain.
Their eyes meet.
ANNA'S CAR
She hesitates.
For a moment we think she might go back
to him...
... but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul
alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt.
Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers
battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows
past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway.
Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the
dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to
side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she
dials a number. She looks up...
a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.
ANNA
Shit!
Anna swerves into the next lane.
We hear the blaring
horn from the car behind her.
ANNA
(into rear-view mirror)
OK. OK. I saw you.
(MUTTERING)
Jerk.
The cell phone connects.
We hear Paul's answering machine.
ANNA
Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?
I
just don't want it to end like this.
Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat.
Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass.
A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes.
21.
ON METAL PIPES
The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other.
CUT TO BLACK.
Paul pulls up to a suburban house. Walks quickly to the
door, a supermarket bouquet of flowers wrapped in
cellophane in his hand. He rings the bell. No-one
answers. He rings again. Knocks hard on the door.
PAUL
Anna!
Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the
driveway's empty. He heads back to his car.
Paul's on his cell phone as he drives.
He gets Anna's
voice mail again.
PAUL
(INTO PHONE)
It's me again. I must have just missed you
at home. Call me when you get this. OK?
Eliot watches Beatrice's car drive away.
Paul waits in his car outside the Mother's house.
The
wilting flowers on the passenger seat beside him.
PAUL'S POV
Beatrice's car pulls up. Diane gets out.
Pulls the
wheelchair out of the car.
PAUL'S CAR
Paul grabs the flowers.
Paul strides over as Diane helps Beatrice into her
wheelchair.
30.
PAUL
Mrs. Bryant.
Beatrice doesn't acknowledge him.
Paul turns to Diane.
PAUL
Hi Diane.
I need to talk to Anna.
Diane can't look him in the eye.
PAUL
What's wrong?
DIANE
I think you better come in.
Eliot steps out of the Funeral Home.
Heads towards Paul.
ELIOT
Can I help you?
Paul turns to him.
Pulled away from his thoughts.
PAUL
Mr. Deane?
ELIOT
Yes.
PAUL
My name's Conran.
Paul Conran.
Eliot smiles.
Holds out his hand.
ELIOT
Of course. The lawyer.
(off Paul's surprised look)
It's a small town. In my line of work
you get to know everyone eventually.
As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely.
As
if he senses something.
33.
PAUL
I'm Anna Bryant's fiance.
ELIOT
That's strange. She wasn't wearing an
engagement ring.
PAUL
Well not quite fiance...
ELIOT
I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.
PAUL
I'd like to see her.
ELIOT
I'm afraid the viewing isn't until--
PAUL
I'd need to see her now.
If that's
possible.
ELIOT
I'm sorry. It's not possible.
You're
not family and--
PAUL
Please.
It'd only take a minute.
ELIOT
I understand. But--
PAUL
NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Paul quickly controls his anger.
His eyes smart with tears.
PAUL
I tried to stop her.
She didn't hear me.
Paul's voice breaks with emotion. He can't go on. Eliot
gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car.
34.
ELIOT
Mr. Conran.
There really is nothing I
can do. I'm so sorry.
Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head.
Eliot
watches him get into his car and drive away.
Jack furiously cycles through empty streets. Past
identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns. He
stops suddenly. Considering something. Then turns and
cycles away purposely.
Eliot walks out of the funeral home. We pull back. Jack
stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot
looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack
steps back quickly behind a tree.
The tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves. A
sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage. Their
leaves ripple. Languid and fluid like a wave. RUSTLING
EERILY. The sound almost malevolent.
Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted
windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of
Anna just before the accident).
As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He's
low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and
makes a left turn.
54.
Eliot replaces the pump nozzle.
Walks over to the cashier.
CASHIER
Thirty-four fifty.
In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out
of the gas station. Eliot doesn't notice him as he pulls
out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he
frowns. Something's wrong. He checks his pockets again.
He can't find his keys. He walks quickly away.
CASHIER
Sir.
Your change.
Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued,
Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.
Eliot's at a red light. Drumming his fingers in
frustration as he waits for the light to change.
55.
Eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery.
Eliot reaches the front door. It's slightly ajar.
He
pushes it open. Steps warily inside.
JACK'S POV
Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening
in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.
DRIVEWAY
Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at
the window. Calmly. Curiously.
Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush.
Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance.
Paul drives aimlessly past strip malls. He stops at a
red light. Lights a cigarette. Just then he notices
something across the street. He looks puzzled.
Paul gets out of his car.
Quickly walks over to the
store window.
ON STORE WINDOW
A RED-SLIP on a mannequin.
Just like ANNA'S RED SLIP.
STREET
The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily.
Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the
plate glass. Stunned.
76.
Eliot prunes a low hedge by the front door.
PAUL (O.C.)
Deane.
Eliot turns.
Paul's clearly agitated.
ELIOT
Mr. Conran.
A pleasure.
Eliot stands stiffly.
Rubs his back.
ELIOT
I love gardening, but I'm not sure
gardening loves me anymore.
PAUL
She's not dead is she?
ELIOT
(AMUSED)
Mr. Conran.
PAUL
Someone saw her.
ELIOT
I'm sorry?
PAUL
One of Anna's students.
(nods towards the funeral home)
In the window.
ELIOT
Do you mean Jack?
Paul's momentarily taken aback.
PAUL
You know him?
ELIOT
Of course I know him. He's often round
here. He seems to have a strange
fascination with death. He's eleven
years old Mr. Conran. And like all young
boys has a vivid imagination. Now if
you'll excuse me--
PAUL
I don't think he imagined it.
I think he
really saw her.
77.
ELIOT
Maybe you just want to believe he saw her.
PAUL
Fuck you.
Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home.
ELIOT
Mr. Conran!
The sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to
himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like
everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over
Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure.
For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is.
JACK
You said you could teach me.
Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave.
Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him.
ELIOT
It's only a hole in the ground.
I'm
digging it for--
JACK
Miss Bryant.
ELIOT
Exactly.
For Anna.
She belongs here.
JACK
Because she's dead.
ELIOT
No.
Because there's no life left in her.
Jack carefully considers Eliot's words.
ELIOT
Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm
the only one who can see all these
corpses. Wandering the earth
aimlessly. All they do is piss and
shit. Suffocating us with their
stench. Doing nothing with their
lives. Taking the air away from those
who actually want to live. I have to
bury them all. I have no choice.
(BEAT)
Now there's two of us.
83.
Eliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a
moment then reaches for the shovel.
Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the
driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress
and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.
Anna approaches her mother's house.
Paul opens the door.
He's not surprised to see her.
Beatrice stands just behind him.
A black shawl over her
head and arms.
Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as
he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's
room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out
of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.
Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home.
It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the
wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.
He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge.
Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches
down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.
FROM THE BUSHES
Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.
FUNERAL HOME
Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's
caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly.
A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.
MAN'S VOICE
What the fuck are you doing here?
The Figure lowers the flashlight.
It's Tom.
TOM
I'm taking you home.
CLOSE ON black earth.
A trowel digs into the soil.
88.
We pull back. Jack's just finished digging a hole in the
flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid.
The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly
replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He
pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the
faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.
JACK
Don't be scared. It's better this way.
Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters
in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still
covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the
delicate flowers.
The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open
grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.
The TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin.
Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could
sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.
FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)
We have but a short time to live. Like a
flower we blossom and then wither. In
the midst of life we are in death.
The grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles
flicker on top. In the b.g. MOURNERS head to their cars.
Paul and Tom stand by the grave.
TOM
You sure you're going to be OK?
94.
PAUL
Yeah.
Thanks Tom.
Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.
Paul unlocks his car. He's about to open the car door
when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack's
observing him carefully.
PAUL
You said she was alive.
95.
JACK
I never said she was alive.
I just said
I saw her.
Paul simply nods his head.
Too drained of emotion to react.
PAUL
You need a ride?
Jack shakes his head.
PAUL
OK.
See you.
Paul opens the car door.
JACK
Mr. Conran?
(PAUL TURNS)
Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.
Paul nods. Gets in his car.
Jack looks up at the
Funeral Home.
JACK'S POV
Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.
Paul sprints across the lawn to his car.
Eliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF.
97.
Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as
he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a
slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.
PAUL
Come on.
Come on.
He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind
curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner.
A bright white light sweeps through his car.
Paul's
momentarily blinded.
THE SCREEN FLASHES TO WHITE.
Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any
traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago.
Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the
car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.
ON REARVIEW MIRROR
An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.
Blasts past.
CAR
Paul looks through the front windshield.
Nothing.
He
frowns. Where did the ambulance go?
UP AHEAD
We see the Funeral Home.
Bone white in the moonlight.
The cemetery next to it.
Eliot's White Van sits by the side of the road.
Paul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the
distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.
98.
Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then
the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes
away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.
Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.
Her fingernails torn and bloody.
Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.
Her
body slumps limply like a rag doll.
PAUL
Anna.
I'm here. Please God.
Anna.
He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life
left in her. He's about to give up when...
Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.
Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.
ANNA
Paul?
PAUL
Baby.
Thank God.
Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.
She looks round.
Dazed. Turns back to Paul.
ANNA
You came back for me.
PAUL
I came back for you.
You're safe now.
ANNA
Promise?
PAUL
(SMILES)
Promise.
Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He
turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's
something unnerving about the silence.
Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.
Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the
dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.
PAUL
Anna?
Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone
crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.
99.
PAUL
Anna!
Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.
Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees
appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his
jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on
Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.
We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.
Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC
fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.
Paul frantically runs into the parking lot.
Still
calling out for Anna.
PAUL
Anna!
Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on.
Paul
looks at the car nervously.
He heads over to it.
Apprehensive.
Then... the car door
slowly CLICKS open.
Paul stops.
Stares into the car.
There's no one there.
