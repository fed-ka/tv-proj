          sleeping late.  With a smile on his face.  Then we see
          why.  REBECCA enters, wearing his shirt.  She looks better
          in it than he does.  She slips up to Johnny and gently
          nuzzles him awake.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (groggy)
                          ...hey...

                                        REBECCA
                        Hungry?

                                        JOHNNY
                        On so many levels.

          They kiss.  Apparently this is not their first night
            together.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (can smell it)
                        What's for breakfast?

                                        REBECCA
                        It's a surprise...

          He playfully touches her arm.  We hear a mini-Dead Zone
          WHOOSH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Toaster waffles?

                                        REBECCA
                                (he's right damn it)
                        Not very psychic.  It's all you
                        had.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I wasn't expecting company.

          Smiling, Rebecca pulls away.

                                        REBECCA
                        C'mon, I'll make some bad coffee.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I love it when you talk like that.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT - TEASER - 4/26/04 - YELLOW       2.

          She exits as Johnny pulls on some sweats and a t-shirt. 
          Then he reaches for his cane, triggering a REAL WHOOSH.  A
          thunderclap of pain hits Johnny above the left eye. 
            Instantly Johnny senses he's not alone.  He turns to see...



          slumped against a wall, looking weary.

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...you... how long have you been
                        there?

                                        WEY
                        Here?  Just a few seconds... but
                        I've been waiting a long time.

          Johnny has to fight to control the pain. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want?

                                        WEY
                          Reverend Purdy lied.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        WEY
                        About Mike Kennedy.  You knew
                          something was wrong the night
                        they set you free -- you didn't
                        know what, but you felt it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How could you know that?  You
                        weren't here.

                                        WEY
                        I just know, okay.  Get the truth
                        from Purdy.

          And with that, he drops the cane top, and the VISION ENDS.

          Johnny presses the heel of his palm to his forehead, hit
          with a fresh wave of excruciating pain.

                                                                                  CUT TO:



            following her down the hall as she floats two cups of bad
          coffee back to the bedroom. 

                                        REBECCA
                        I hope you like your coffee black,
                        your milk went out of date two
                        weeks ago... Johnny?

          As she rounds the corner into the bedroom...

                                        REBECCA
                        JOHNNY!  Oh my god... Johnny...

          A wider view REVEALS what she's reacting to: Johnny passed
          out on the floor.


  44OMITTED



          Lots of glass and reflective surfaces.  Off to the side, a
          computer work station with several monitors.  Johnny and
          Rebecca sit in front of a desk covered not in papers and
          files, but with puzzles and various building toys; a
          playground for the mind.  Across from them sits DOCTOR
          JAEGER wearing custom surgical greens.

                                        REBECCA
                          Johnny... you were passed out on
                        the floor.

          Jaeger absentmindedly plays with a small wooden finger
          puzzle as he listens to Johnny and Rebecca.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT - TEASER - 4/28/04 - BLUE-2       4.


    6CONTINUED:6

                                        JAEGER
                        ...and according to your medical
                          records, you've had these blackouts
                        before correct?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.

                                        JAEGER
                        And they're associated with your,
                        "dead zone" the "visions" you've
                        been experiencing since emerging
                        from your coma?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not all my visions... just certain
                        ones.

                                        JAEGER
                          Fascinating.

          Jaeger sets the puzzle down, having solved it as he sat
          there.  Johnny picks up the puzzle to look at it,
          triggering:


  77VISION BLAST

            A machine gun burst of two-frame visions of brain surgery
          images.  Ouch.



          He could have done without that.  He keeps his reaction to
          himself as Jaeger continues.

                                        JAEGER
                        Johnny, brain damage is not a
                        static condition, it evolves.
                          Sometimes for the better, such as
                        when you emerged from your coma...
                        but more often, we see things
                        take a sudden turn for the worse. 
                        These blackouts and memory losses
                        you've been experiencing are
                          actually seizures that indicate
                        serious problems deep within your
                        brain.  They could be a precursor
                        to a life threatening stroke, or
                        even worse, you could slip back
                        into a coma.

                          I understand that, but I've always
                        felt like I was living on borrowed
                        time since my accident.  It's
                        just something I have to live
                        with.

                                        JAEGER
                        Maybe not.  After carefully
                          reviewing your medical history,
                        I'm cautiously optimistic that we

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Rebecca follow Jaeger into his imaging lab, a
          large clean room featuring a state of the art (plus some)
          MRI/PET scanner and a smaller adjoining Control Room full
          of equipment racks and computer monitors, with a window so
          the operator can view the patient while scanning.

                                        JAEGER
                        Medical science has made huge
                        strides Johnny in the study of
                          Neuroanatomy -- the functioning
                        of the brain.  With MRI's, and
                        P.E.T. scans, we can now pinpoint
                        and surgically treat brain tumors
                        and strokes that were, until quite
                          recently, inoperable.

                                        REBECCA
                        Are you saying you think you can
                        remove Johnny's Dead Zone?

                                        JAEGER
                          Actually, we would remove the
                          diseased part of the brain causing
                        his symptoms, the headaches,
                          blackouts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And my visions?

                                        JAEGER
                        My belief is that your visions
                        are a unique state of consciousness
                        arising from a specific part of
                        your brain.  Somehow your accident
                          awakened this dormant region.  If
                        we can find it, and discover how
                        it works, we may be able to
                        surgically alleviate, or at least
                        control the negative side effects.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you think this is possible?

                                        JAEGER
                        Let me show you something.          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT - ACT ONE - 4/26/04 - PINK        7.


  9A9AIN THE CONTROL ROOM

          Jaeger sits in front of a large flat screen monitor,
          navigating his way through Johnny's medical history. 
          Thumbnails of various x-rays and MRI results fill the
          screen.  Jaeger clicks a few levels into a scan series,
          then double clicks on a file, opening a P.E.T. scan series
          full screen.

                                        JAEGER
                        When I was reviewing the records
                        sent over by your doctor, I found
                        this incomplete scan -- the
                        technician wrote a note that this
                        scan was redone because, "patient
                          suffered temporary hallucination
                        during image capture."

                                        JOHNNY
                        I remember that.  I didn't
                          hallucinate, I had a vision of a
                        little girl who had an MRI right
                        before me.

                                        JAEGER
                        What did you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Her funeral.  She had a brain
                        tumor.

                                        JAEGER
                        And you got this vision from
                          touching something she had touched?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's how it usually happens.

          Jaeger opens a file revealing a 3-D P.E.T. scan that is
          incomplete, only two thirds of the brain in 3D.

                                        JAEGER
                        There, that red blur, that glare --
                        that occurs nowhere else in all
                        the other scans -- only when you
                        had a vision.  Somewhere in that
                        red blur might just be the source
                        of your Dead Zone.

          Off Johnny's reaction...



          Reverend Purdy leans into Johnny's open front door, finding
          the house dark.

          Johnny's voice echoes from back inside the house.

          The view follows Purdy through the dark house, where he
          finds Johnny sitting in the darkened living room.

                        Johnny?  What are you doing in
                        the dark?

          Johnny turns on a dim lamp.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Fighting off a migraine.  Thanks
                        for coming.  I'm not supposed to
                        drive or I would have come to
                        you.

                                        PURDY
                        Not a problem.  You said you wanted
                        to ask me something?

          Johnny studies Purdy for a long beat, making him nervous.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why did you lie?

                        What do you mean?  ...about the
                        trust fund?  I told you.  We made
                        some bad investments.  You'll be
                        made whole, I promise.

                        I don't care about the money. 
                        There's something else.  Something
                        about Rachel's murder.

                          suspect.

                        seen the future... I haven't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The truth will out Reverend.  If
                        there's something you know about
                          Rachel's murder or Kennedy's
                          suicide, you need to come forward
                        with it.

          Purdy's not ready to go there, not yet.  Johnny keeps
          working him.

                        Walt is having Mike Kennedy's
                        body exhumed, they're going over
                        everything again. It's only a
                        matter of time till we know what
                        really happened.

                        I don't need your protection.  I
                        need the truth.

                        The truth is, I don't know who
                        killed Rachel Caldwell.  Or why
                        Mike Kennedy killed himself.  I
                        just know these are not ordinary

                        had written -- about your visions
                        of the future.  I was afraid...

          Purdy knows he's said too much.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Afraid of what?

          The CORONER is just finishing a second autopsy on Mike
          Kennedy when Johnny and Walt arrive.  They watch as the
          coroner covers Kennedy's body, getting a glimpse of his
          sawed open skull.

                                        DR. SURMAN
                        You're early Bannerman, my report
                        won't be ready for forty-eight
                        hours.

                                        WALT
                        But if I know you, you've already
                        made up your mind... what did you
                        find out?

                                        DR. SURMAN
                        Same as the first time.  Probable
                          suicide.  I can't rule out homicide
                        to a medical certainty, but there's
                        nothing here to support changing
                        the cause of death.

          Johnny looks at the specimen bags, particularly one with a
          whole lobe of brain.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that what it looks like?

                                        DR. SURMAN
                        Right frontal lobe.  You can see
                        where the bullet passed through. 
                        Size of the hole matches the
                        caliber of the gun found in his
                        hand.

                                        WALT
                        Did you find the slug?

                                        DR. SURMAN
                        Most of the bullet went straight
                        through and shattered the driver's
                        window.  We found it nearby. 
                        There were also numerous bullet
                          fragments we removed today.

          Johnny points to another evidence bag.

                        These?

                                        DR. SURMAN
                        Yes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I touch them?

          Surman looks to Walt, as if to say, "Don't ask me this."

                                        WALT
                        I'll take responsibility.

          Johnny opens the bag with the bullet fragments and pours
          them out on his hand, triggering:


    10E10EVISION: FOLLOWING THE BULLET (FORMERLY SCENE 60)

          As it reforms into a whole bullet, the VIEW RAMPS IN tight
          on the now spinning bullet and the PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS so
          we are now watching the bullet unscrew its way backwards
          out of Mike Kennedy's head.  Our view continues to follow
          the bullet, panning it back to the gun to reveal:

          Sonny Elliman, gloved hands wrapped around Kennedy's limp
          fingers on the gun.  The bullet retreats back into the gun
          as it swallows the muzzle blast and we relive the moment
          Elliman pulled the trigger.  The real time gunblast ends
          the vision.



          He winces, a sympathetic shock of pain cracking through
          his skull.  Surman reacts to Johnny, then looks over her
          shoulder to make sure nobody is seeing this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        AHH... my head.

                        You all right?

          Johnny nods "yes."  He pulls Walt away from the coroner so
          they can talk privately.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Elliman.  It was Sonny Elliman.

                        Kennedy was knocked out. Elliman
                        put the gun in his hand and pulled
                        the trigger.  Why would Stillson
                        want Mike Kennedy dead?

                        Maybe there's something I missed.



          After hours. Purdy stares at his large ornate bible, reading
          and re-reading passages of Revelations.  There's something
          very OCD about his behavior.  Apparently he's got the
          spirit.

          EXTREME ON THE BIBLE 

          Apocalyptic phrases and words, as if spinning through his
          head in a jumble.

          PURDY

          Flipping pages, re-reading, as if it would somehow change
          if he just keeps checking.

          JUST THEN - GREG STILLSON

          Appears in the doorway.

                                        STILLSON
                        Glad to see you're getting some
                        use out of that bible I gave you.

                                        PURDY
                            "Congressman..."

                                        STILLSON
                                (re:bible)
                        Yes sir, the deluxe edition. 
                        Back when Daddy and I sold the
                        good book door to door, one of
                        these deluxe illustrated editions
                        was the grand slam of sales...
                        Daddy would sell one of these, he
                        could lay up drunk for a full
                        week before we'd have to get back
                        at it... Good times.

                                        PURDY
                        What do you want?

                                        STILLSON
                          I suppose by now you heard they
                        dug up poor Mike Kennedy?

                                        PURDY
                        Yes...

                                        STILLSON
                        Now what do you suppose prompted
                        that?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm sure I wouldn't know.  You'll
                        have to ask Sheriff Bannerman.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did seem awful convenient, Mike
                        taking the blame for Johnny Smith.

                                        PURDY
                        What's your point?

                                        STILLSON
                        My point is, don't let Smith take
                        you down with him.  He and
                          Bannerman couldn't frame me for
                        Rachel Caldwell's murder so now
                        they're poking around Mike
                          Kennedy's death looking for
                          something they can use against
                        me.  But they aren't going to
                        find anything are they?  ...are
                        they?

                                        PURDY
                        Not from me...

                                        STILLSON
                        Good.  Because the only one who's
                        going to be hurt by Smith digging
                        into Mike Kennedy's past is you.

          Off Purdy's look.



          Rebecca is ready to pounce on Johnny.

                                        REBECCA
                        Who was it?  Who was driving the
                        car?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I couldn't see his face, but she
                        knew him.  The killer kept saying,
                        "What did you tell Smith about us."

                                        REBECCA
                        You said before you thought she
                        had an affair with Stillson. 
                        Maybe he thought she told you...

                                        JOHNNY
                        He must have thought she told me
                          something worth killing her for...

                                        REBECCA
                        So it was him.

          Johnny and Walt exchange a look, their thoughts echoing
          Rebecca's.

          FADE IN:

          CONTINUOUS

          Rebecca sits with Johnny as he lies back in the same
          position he is in on the beach, except now he is on the
            patient-sled about to be fed into the P.E.T. scanner.  His
          body strapped down, his head locked into a halo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...It helps just to hear your
                        voice.

                                        REBECCA
                        Try and imagine yourself listening
                        to the waves... smell the salt
                        air... feel the sand between your
                        toes...


  2222MIXED REALITY - THE MRI ON THE BEACH

          Johnny is concentrating on Rebecca's words, trying to will
          himself out of that hospital room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm feeling it...

                                        REBECCA
                        Good.  They're going to insert
                          something into your neck now, but
                        I want you to ignore the pain...
                        just picture yourself lying on
                        that warm sand...

          As a NURSE inserts a nasty looking catheter into an artery
          in Johnny's neck...

                                        REBECCA
                        Stay on the beach Johnny... let
                        the pain go... and come back to
                        me on the beach...


    22A22AJOHNNY ON THE BEACH - INTERCUTTING

          JOHNNY EXPERIENCES himself on the beach, Rebecca gently
          rubbing his chest with her hand.

                                        REBECCA
                        How does that feel?

                        Much better...


  2323IN THE IMAGING LAB

          Her hand comig to rest on his chest, Rebecca looks to Dr.
          Jaeger who signals they are ready.

                                        REBECCA
                        They're getting ready to start
                        now Johnny, so I have to go...
                        but I want you to stay on the
                          beach... listen to the waves,
                        feel the warm sand... and just
                        drift away...


  2424JOHNNY ON THE BEACH

          Eyes closed, resting on a dune, a smile on his face.


  2525JOHNNY IN THE SCANNER

          Wrapped tight in velcro straps, immobilized as he begins
          the journey into the jaws of the scanner.


  2626JAEGER AND REBECCA - IN THE CONTROL ROOM

          She joins Jaeger in the control booth.

                                        JAEGER
                        Nice job... I know it hurts like
                        hell, but any anesthesia would
                        alter the scan.  You've done this
                        before?


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT - ACT TWO - 4/26/04 - PINK       21.

                        Just a little guided imagery.  I
                        use it sometimes on the traumatized
                        kids I work with.

          Jaeger and a LAB TECH start navigating their way through a
          series of on-screen menus.  Through a window, they watch
          Johnny in the next room, now completely inside the scanner.


  2727JOHNNY ON THE BEACH

          Still buried in sand.  Jaeger's voice echoes from somewhere
          down the beach.

                                        JAEGER
                        We're going to inject the
                          radioisotope now Johnny.  You may
                        hear a little noise from the
                          scanner, just try to ignore it...

          A low buzz-buzz-buzz becomes perceptible to Johnny.


  2828JOHNNY IN THE SCANNER

          Inside the scan room, the BUZZ-BUZZ-BUZZ is deafening as a
          powerful electron gun blasts Johnny's skull.


  2929CONTROL ROOM

          Jaeger and Rebecca watch as the first batch of scans, each
            representing a slice of Johnny's brain, are displayed on
          the monitors.  With a few keystrokes, Jaeger combines the
          slices into a three dimensional view of Johnny's brain,
          which he manipulates with a track-ball, viewing the scan
          from several angles.

                                        JAEGER
                        Great.  We have an excellent
                          baseline.
                                (then to Rebecca)
                        You can see the areas of brain
                          activity, the brighter colors,
                        here in the frontal lobe. We're
                          literally "seeing" him imagine
                        your beach.

                                        REBECCA
                          Incredible...

          Jaeger signals the nurse in the room with Johnny, who wheels
          over a heavy lab cart with a small vice bolted to the top. 
          In the vice: a baseball.

                        Johnny we're going to try and
                        trigger a vision now by touching
                        an object to your hand, but I
                        want you to just relax and let
                        the vision happen... ready?

  3131JOHNNY IN THE SCANNER

          As the lab technician maneuvers the vice-gripped baseball
          so it touches Johnny's hand , triggering:


  3232JOHNNY ON THE BEACH

          The baseball in his hand.  We HEAR THE ROAR OF A CROWD...


  3333VISION - BASEBALL STANDS

          Doctor Jaeger sits in the crowded bleachers with his TEN
          YEAR OLD SON.  As Johnny watches from the row behind them,
          Jaeger and his son jump to their feet along with the rest
          of the crowd, cheering a home run.  In SLOW MOTION, Jaeger's
          son stretches with his mitt to reach the incoming home run
          ball...


  3434JAEGER

          Hits the "scan" button, firing off a scan.

  3737IN THE CONTROL BOOTH

          Jaeger and Rebecca watch as another series of scans becomes
          a 3-D model of Johnny's brain.

                                        JAEGER
                        What did you see Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your son catching a home run.

                                        JAEGER
                                (blown away)
                          ...that's... right...

          Jaeger puts both scans up on the screen, rotating them for
          comparison.  In the VISION SCAN Johnny's brain is
          essentially dark, except for a blurry glow from deep inside.

                                        JAEGER
                                (to Rebecca)
                          There... look... that glow near
                        the amygdala - this area of the
                        brain integrates the senses and
                        links our emotions to memories...
                        But the image is very undefined. 
                        We need to evoke a stronger vision. 
                        He said only certain visions cause
                        his seizures.  What triggers them? 

          Off Rebecca's concerned look...

          Exchange a look. Jaeger nods to the Nurse, who pushes the
          plunger sending another load of radioisotope into Johnny's
          brain, then very carefully moves the cane top closer...

  4646VISION - THE FUTURE

          Christopher Wey is tied to a chair in front of Johnny,
          holding the cane top in a hand tied to the arm of the chair. 
          Looking around, Johnny realizes they are in a small dark
          room, Wey being held captive by somebody...

                        What about the camera?

          Before Wey can answer, a hardened TWENTY YEAR OLD MAN
          carrying an assault rifle enters the room.

          The young man looks around the room.  Johnny is right in
          front of him, but the man can't see him.  Johnny studies
          his face.

          hand with the butt of his gun, ENDING THE VISION.

          Rebecca joins the technician as they scramble to pull a

          return to normal.

                        ... there it is.


          WHAT THEY SEE ON THE MONITOR

          Another 3-D model of Johnny's brain, but this time, there
          at the center, clearly defined in a concentrated red glow,
          is an uncharted structure deep inside Johnny's brain, his
          Dead Zone.

          Off Johnny's reaction...



          Behind closed doors.  After hours.  Cigars.  Booze.  This
          is where business gets done.  Stillson is here, holding
          court with his new legislative pals, including JAKE TRUAX
          and the others from Johnny's voting machine vision in
          "Finding Rachel, Part One."

          Truax hands Stillson a fresh drink and pulls him aside,
            purposefully snubbing JAMES STILLSON, who swallows his
            reaction.  It's a bitter pill.

                                        TRUAX
                        Get yourself another drink Jimmy,
                        I just need Greg for a minute...
                        thanks.

                        I've got some thoughts on those

                          through.

          Truax just shines him on, focused only on Greg.

                                (just to Greg)
                        Listen, Greg, I think I speak for
                          everyone here when I say we're
                        all impressed with the work you've
                        done for us on the "Justice For

          Truax checks to make sure nobody can hear them, his tone
          darkening.

                        But something has come to our
                          attention that is cause for
                          concern.  A friend over in the
                        justice department told me the
                          Penobscot County Sheriff is having
                        the FBI crime lab re-examine
                          evidence in the Rachel Caldwell
                        murder.  We wouldn't want an over-
                        zealous Sheriff to re-open her
                        murder investigation.  Who knows
                        what peripheral issues might come
                        to light.

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't worry.  I've got it under
                          control.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          After hours.  In a wide view of the office, we see Purdy
          at his desk, methodically feeding papers into his shredder. 
          From the looks of it, he's been at it all night, a huge
          pile of shreddings cascading across the floor.  As the
          view moves closer, we see that Purdy is having some kind
          of breakdown; hair disheveled, eyes dull, his affect flat
          and emotionless as he continues to shred.  As the view
          moves closer still, we see just how gone Purdy is when we
          reveal what he is shredding -- his Bible.



          sits bolt upright in bed, her CRY for Rachel carrying across
          the cut as she awakens from her nightmare, finding herself
          in Johnny's bed.  Hearing her, he wakes up.

                        No... I... I was having a dream,
                        that's all...

                        Would it help to talk about it?

          Rebecca melts slightly at his touch, but the dream still
          has its hooks in her.

                                        REBECCA
                        Rachel and I were together.  We
                        were on these swings, in a park
                        near where I grew up.  We were
                        both laughing hysterically.  It
                        felt so good to be with her again. 
                        I keep dreaming about her... happy
                        dreams, then I wake up into a
                          nightmare where she's gone.

          Johnny wraps her in his embrace, but she doesn't let it
          soften her resolve.

                        If Greg Stillson killed my sister,
                        we've got to do something about
                        it.  Whatever it takes... I can't
                        live with him walking around free
                        while she's...

                        Listen to me... I know how much
                        he hurt you, what he took away
                        from you... He won't get away
                        with it. I promise.

          He pulls her tight, letting her borrow his shred of courage,
          but at the same time, knowing his promise is no guarantee
          of the future to come.

          And in her eyes, we see that she knows, life is not fair,
          or neat, or easy, and it may take more than Johnny's promise
          to bring Rachel's killer to justice.  Off her soulful look
          of doubt...

          items of Rachel's, her purse, car keys, a jacket.

          sealed bag.  He holds the camera out for Johnny, who passes
          his hand over the controls, before suddenly latching on to
          the handgrip like it was magnetic, triggering:

          A rapid fire montage of images from the night Rachel was

          Johnny witnesses a reprise of the vision he had the first
          time he bumped into Rachel.  Four men, right in front of
          Johnny, including Stillson, looking down off camera, talking
          about a woman.

                                        STILLSON
                        No one else knows about her, huh?

                        Nobody outside present company.

          The view ramps into Johnny as he turns, swinging around
          180 degrees to reveal what the men are looking at: A DIGITAL
          VOTING MACHINE.

                                        STILLSON

          Stillson reaches forward, the VIEW MOVES TO REVEAL what
          the men have been salivating over: not a woman, but a small
          computer kiosk -- one the new digital VOTING MACHINES. 
          Seen on the screen: a menu of the candidates from the
            Congressional election.  Stillson's hand circles the screen
            sensuously.]

                        Let me ask a stupid question. 
                        Does it even matter which one of

          The men laugh.

                                        TRUAX
                        Of course it matters.  Every vote
                          counts...

                                        STILLSON
                        Yeah, just some count a little
                        more than others.

                                        TRUAX
                        In a close election like yours,
                        it all gets down to margin of
                        error, which our friend here
                          manipulated in your favor. 
                          Undetected, of course.  The digital
                        equivalent of a hanging Chad.

          Johnny watches as Stillson caresses the screen.  The vision
          SPEEDS FORWARD IN TIME -- pausing for Johnny to see:

                                        STILLSON
                        And there's no paper trail?

                                        MAN THREE
                        Only the one we generate.

          Stillson touches the screen next to his name, registering
          a vote for himself.  He stares at the screen, transfixed.

                                        MAN TWO
                        Better than sex isn't it?

          Stillson throws a look to Man Two.

                                        STILLSON
                        You, my friend, need to get out
                        more. 

          The men all laugh.  The vision SPEEDS FORWARD AGAIN.  James
          Stillson steps up, putting a hand on his son's shoulder.

                                        JAMES STILLSON
                        Nothing can stop us now, Son.

          The sound of a DOOR OPENING off screen draws everyone's
          attention.










                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT - ACT THREE - 4/28/04 - BLUE-2   34.

          They all look worried, except for Stillson, who recognizes
          the person at the door.  Johnny turns and sees Rachel poke
          her head in the door.

                                        RACHEL
                        I'm sorry, I was just looking for
                        the exit.  

                                        STILLSON
                                (smiling)
                        No, no, it's okay, c'mon over,
                        we're just finishing up here...

          Johnny notices how underlings deftly shut everything up to
          conceal it from Rachel, who is carrying her video camera
          down at her side like it's not on.

          TIME SPEEDS FORWARD and Stillson is introducing Rachel to
          the group of men.

                                        STILLSON
                        Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
                        Rachel Caldwell, my next
                          communications director...

          THE VISION FREEZES, giving Johnny a chance to study
          everyone's reaction to Rachel.  It's like one of those
          Dutch Masters Tableaus, every face riveted on RACHEL, but
          all of them telling a different story.  Rachel smiles at
          Truax as Stillson introduces her.  Johnny walks among the
          frozen men, reading their expressions.  Several of the men
          are staring at her breasts, but JAMES STILLSON is glancing
          sideways at her, eyes narrowed, clearly suspicious. 
          Johnny's study ends on Stillson, frozen mid smile, his
          eyes cast down, not at Rachel's body -- but at the camera
          in her hand.  Johnny follows Stillson's gaze and sees what
          Stillson sees, the red recording light, frozen mid blink...

          THE VISION UNFREEZES, and in real time, the scene plays
          completely different, everyone covering their true reaction
          to this sheep in their midst.  It's smiles all around as
          THE VISION ENDS.

                          before... the first time I bumped
                        into her.  They're with a group
                        of men.  They're looking at one
                        of those new computerized voting
                          machines when she walks in on
                        them with her video camera running. 
                        It might be what go her killed.

                        Maybe there's some other angle to
                        look at this from, another way in

          Purdy's office is full of television equipment as he
          prepares for a live broadcast from his desk.  Purdy sits
          brooding as the last minute preparations swirl around him,
          the office full of TECHNICIANS and a few SUPPORTERS.  A
          STAGE MANAGER approaches, counting down...

                                        STAGE MANAGER
                        ...and we're back in five-four-
                          three...

          And he mimes the "two-one" before the cameras come on.  A
          music cue heralds the beginning of the broadcast as a pre-
          recorded announcer intones...

                                        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        And now, live from his office
                        with a special message of hope
                        and salvation, the founder of
                        Faith Heritage Ministries, Reverend
                        Gene Purdy...

                                        PURDY
                        Thank you.  All of you, both those
                        here at Faith Heritage, and all
                        of you watching at home.  We are
                        blessed by your continued
                        support...

          But then Purdy stops, as if he's gone up on his lines. 
          There's a long pregnant pause as he considers what he is
          about to do.

                                        PURDY
                        For more than twenty years I have
                          witnessed the good news to you
                        and you have placed your faith in
                        me.  Today I come before you to
                        say, I am not worthy of that faith. 
                        I have sinned.  A grievous sin
                        that cannot go unpunished...

          The Faith Heritage workers look at each other, wondering
          what's going on.

                        I have given false witness against
                          a colleague of mine, a man who
                          recently took his own life, Mike

          As the news moves on, Johnny shuts off the TV.

                        Not for me.  But I have to admit
                        I'm a little surprised after
                          Reverend Purdy's announcement
                        last night... Seems to me you're

                          I didn't kill Rachel and you know

                        We'll let the Justice Department
                        sort that out.  Bannerman's

                                        STILLSON
                        Heck he probably already knows
                        what I'm going to say, don't you?

          Johnny doesn't give him a response.  Just a cryptic smile
          that bothers Stillson.

                                        REBECCA
                        You said you wanted to talk to me
                        about this crime bill?

                                        STILLSON
                        Ms. Caldwell, Rebecca... I asked
                        you here because we are on the
                        verge of passing "Rachel's Law"
                        and I want you to be a part of
                        the bill signing ceremony.  The
                          president is going to be there,
                        and your presence would mean a
                        great deal to me, and all the
                        other victims of crime out there
                        who feel alone with their grief.

                                        REBECCA
                        I'm sorry, Congressman.  But I
                        don't think I'm going to be able
                        to join you for your bill signing.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did you know, after what happened
                        to your sister, I added an
                          amendment to make it a federal
                        crime, subject to the death
                          penalty, to kill a state or federal
                          campaign worker.

          Stillson stares straight at Johnny as he says that, then
          turns his attention back to Rebecca.

                                        STILLSON
                        I hope you'll reconsider. I don't
                        know what your friend here has
                        been telling you about me, but
                        it's not true.

          Rebecca just stares at him, seething at his boldness, more
          sure than ever that he killed her sister.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have her answer.

          Stillson squares off with Johnny.

                                        STILLSON
                        I knew you were capable of some
                        despicable things, but preying on
                        a grieving young woman after
                        killing her sister, that's pretty
                        damn low.  What are you really
                        here for anyway?  Trying to get
                        one of your "visions?"

          Johnny doesn't say anything, but responds by silently
            extending his hand, presenting it to Stillson.  Stillson
          just stares at the outstretched hand.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm not afraid of you.

          Stillson clasps Johnny's hand, their eyes locked...


  7878VISION - ARMAGEDDON

          Like a recurring nightmare, death and destruction seem to
          emanate from Stillson, as fire and darkness descend on
          Washington D.C.


  7979JOHNNY EMERGES FROM THE VISION

          As Stillson pulls his arm away from Johnny's grip.  Hit
          hard by the vision, Johnny falters, and Rebecca reaches
          out to steady him.

          For an instant, Johnny is touching Stillson and Rebecca at
          the same time.  We HEAR a Dead Zone Whoosh and Johnny is
            stricken, not by a visual vision, but by a vision of pain,
          his own pain, coming in a future tied to the two people he
          is touching.  He lets go of Stillson and fights to maintain
          his composure, turning to go, but getting only a few steps
          before drops to one knee, the pain like an axe to the head. 
          He looks to Rebecca, then passes out, collapsing to the
          floor.

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny!

                        Call 911... please.

          Stillson looks at Johnny on the floor, shaking his head as
          he casually dials 911.  Off Rebecca's desperate look...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


          Johnny sits on the edge of an examining table, looking
          haggard as he buttons up his shirt, having just been
          examined by Dr. Jaeger.  Rebecca watches from nearby.

                                        JAEGER
                        Johnny, these seizures are becoming
                        more devastating each time.  We
                        need another round of scans to
                          precisely map your brain. In the
                        event you need emergency surgery,
                        there won't be time.  Have you
                        designated someone to give consent
                        in the event you can't?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.  Sarah Bannerman.

                                        JAEGER
                        Good.  We'll be ready to start in
                        a few minutes.

          Jaeger exits, leaving Johnny and Rebecca alone for the
          first time since he collapsed in Stillson's office.  Rebecca
          watches Jaeger leave, then turns to Johnny.

                                        REBECCA
                          Johnny... what was it?  What did
                        you see when you touched him?

          Johnny can't look her in the eye, what does he say?

                                        REBECCA
                        Did you see him kill her?

          Johnny looks at her for a long beat, thinking, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know how to tell you...
                        or if I even should...

                        Washington D.C. -- destroyed by
                        fire.  Widespread death and
                          destruction.  Maybe the end of
                          civilization.  And Greg Stillson
                        is somehow responsible.

          Rebecca is stunned, unable to comprehend what she just
          heard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now you see why I don't tell a
                        lot of people about this.  You
                        and Bruce are the only ones who
                        know.

            Rebecca's mind is spinning.

                        But if you're still seeing this
                        vision in Stillson's future, it
                        must mean he doesn't go to prison
                        for killing my sister... He must
                        get away with it.

                        stop him.

          Just then, a NURSE interrupts.

                                        NURSE
                        We're ready for you Mr. Smith.

          Johnny looks into Rebecca's eyes and sees the fear and
          confusion.



          BRUCE sits waiting as Rebecca comes out and joins him,
          sitting down next to him, a stunned look on her face.

                        thing.

          The view pushes in on Rebecca as she thinks what the "right
          thing" might be.  Bruce's words are still ringing in
            Rebecca's ears when the nurse comes out again.

          Rebecca finds Johnny being strapped to the sled again, his
          head being bolted into a halo.

                        going to be even more painful
                        than last time... I was hoping

          The nurse smiles at Rebecca and slides a chair up to her,
          then excuses herself.

          She nods in agreement then sits next to him, careful not
          to touch him.

                        Instead of any pain, I want you
                        to feel the sand in your toes...

                        to the crashing waves... can you
                        do that for me?

          Rebecca thinks for a beat, looking around to see if they
          are alone.

                        That's good, because I have
                          something else I want you to do
                        for me, and when it's done, I
                        want you to forget I asked... Can

          Rebecca continues, speaking very casually to Johnny.

                        Send him in.

          Roscoe rolls his eyes, then steps aside, ushering Reverend
          Purdy into Walt's office.  Purdy hasn't shaved and wears a
          suit, but no tie or belt.

          Rebecca enters with Johnny, but pauses in the entryway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for driving me home.  Can

                          I really wish I could, but if I

                        connecting flight back to D.C. I
                        need to straighten some things

          Johnny is sitting in an odd bakery, watching as Rebecca
          enters and walks over to the glass case of odd black and
          white pastries, where a "BAKER" stands behind the counter. 
          The Baker is kind of grizzled as bakers go, and he's smoking
            a cigarette.

                                        REBECCA
                        Yes, I'd like to buy a birthday
                        cake...

                                        BAKER
                        Sure.  Do you have something in
                        mind?

                        I need something small.  What
                        about that one?

                                        BAKER
                          Excellent choice.  German
                        chocolate.  Comes in silver or
                        black icing.  Have you ever eaten
                        cake before?

                        Do you need a box of candles to
                        go with that?

          Off Johnny's amused expression as the VISION ENDS.



          As they break the kiss.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever you're thinking, you're
                        not going to get away with it...

          Rebecca is taken aback, but then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't worry, I'll act surprised. 
                        And just for the record, I like
                          chocolate cake with white icing.

          Rebecca exhales, realizing her suggestion to Johnny worked.

                                        REBECCA

                        I'll keep that in mind.  I have
                        to go.

          Then the door opens and the light comes on, revealing the
          interior of a near empty refrigerator.  Beer.  Pickle chips. 
          Salsa.

          The view WIDENS TO REVEAL:



          Johnny stares into the refrigerator, as if something might
            magically appear.  Then it hits him.  Another headache. 
          Bad.  He folds from a wave of pain emanating from above
          his left eye.  He sucks it up, straightening back up as he
          fights off the pain, managing to shut the refrigerator
          door.

          Feeling like he might black out, he crosses to his cane,
          and grabs hold of the nob, triggering:

          A familiar voice from behind sends a chill through Johnny

          Just then, the Twenty Year Old Man enters, alerted to
          Johnny's presence by Wey's voice.  He knows Johnny is there
          but cannot see him.

                        Yeah, he's here.

          Twenty shouts back over his shoulder to somebody outside
          the room.

                        It's time.

          Twenty steps out of the room and returns with a fifty-
            something man; white hair, sunglasses, and a fire scarred
          face.  The man is being led by the Twenty year old, his
          hand on the younger man's shoulder as he is brought in --
          apparently blind.  Johnny is stunned when he realizes who
          he is meeting...


          JOHNNY'S FUTURE SELF

          Circa 2016.  He takes off his sunglasses, revealing his
          pink, radiation burned eyes.  He blindly reaches out for
          Wey, and finding his arm, follows it down to the cane top
          in his hand.  Future Johnny grabs the cane top, triggering
          a vision with a WHOOSH.  Suddenly able to "see" he turns
          to find Our Johnny standing nearby.

                        Too much.  But you've got to do
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll do it.  Just tell me.

          Future Johnny leans close, speaking in a hushed tone to
          his present day self.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        When the time comes, do not save
                          Rebecca.

          Johnny looks at himself in shocked disbelief.  Before Johnny

          the large window, ENDING THE VISION.

          lying unconscious on his kitchen floor, alone.

          After a beat, the sound of a bell tinkling intrudes.  The
          sound carries across the cut to reveal:



          The bell above the entry door ringing as Rebecca enters
          the "bakery" now revealed to be a small gunshop.  In an
          echo of Johnny's vision, the "Baker" stands behind a counter
          full of guns.  He looks up and nods hello to a frightened,
          but resolved, Rebecca.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
