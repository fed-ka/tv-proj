City lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New
York City. The SOUNDS of a cocktail party.
The car comes to a stop at the side of the road.
7.
April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over
an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the
distance. This is still farmland.
Frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.
FRANK
What the hell are you doing?
Come
back to the car.
APRIL
No. Just let me stand here a
second.
Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches.
He
puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The
car's headlights light up April's back, then pass.
FRANK
April?
She doesn't move.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Look, can't we sit in the car and
talk about it, instead of running
all over Route Twelve?
APRIL
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?
FRANK
Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice
about this thing.
APRIL
How kind of you. How terribly,
terribly kind of you.
FRANK
Wait a minute. I don't deserve
this.
9.
APRIL
You're always so wonderfully
definite, aren't you, on the
subject of what you do and don't
deserve?
She turns and walks past him back towards the car.
FRANK
Wait a minute!
He stumbles after her.
Other cars whizz by, but he's past
caring.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Wait a minute, God damn it!
She leans against the car and folds her arms.
FRANK (CONT'D)
You listen to me. This is one time
you're not going to get away with
twisting everything I say.
APRIL
Christ, I wish you'd stayed home
tonight!
FRANK
You know what you are when you're
like this? You're sick. I really
mean that. You're sick!
APRIL
And you know what you are?
(eyes raking him)
You're disgusting.
FRANK
Oh, yeah?
APRIL
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap, you think you
can bully me into feeling whatever
you want!
10.
FRANK
You in a trap! You in a trap!
Jesus, don't make me laugh!
APRIL
Yes, me.
(clutching at her chest)
Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic
little boy  Look at you! Look at
you, and tell me how by any stretch
of the imagination you can call
yourself a man!
He raises his fist, she flinches away, and BONG! BONG! BONG!
BONG! He punches the hood of the car. Then, silence. The
look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever
received: a look of pitying boredom.
FRANK
Don't look at me like that, April.
APRIL
Could we please go home now?
She calmly walks around and gets in the car.
After a moment,
Frank follows...
A small, attractive suburban house in the morning sunshine.
Frank walks out to the car, stops and looks back at the
house.
Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of
commuters. The morning commuter train eases into the
station.
Knox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure.
Thick
HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks.
Frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright
cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their
pencils at a list of product benefits - "SPEED, ACCURACY,
CONTROL."
Pride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500
Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: "Performs A Man's
Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!"
April drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. She
stops and looks down the empty road. Not a single human
being in sight.
Close on April's face.
Frank approaches the door with his key. He takes a moment to
gather himself, but before he can, the door opens.
April is dressed in a black cocktail dress. She looks
wonderful. She smiles. She steps forward and takes his face
in her hands. She kisses him.
25.
APRIL
Frank...
FRANK
Why are you all dressed up?
She hands him a glass of whiskey and closes his fingers
around it.
APRIL
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm
sorry for the way I've been since
that stupid play. I'm sorry for
everything and... And I love
you... Now wait here till I call
you. Okay?
She goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence.
He takes a large
drink.
From inside the house, the sound of the children's voices.
Whispering, giggling. Then April's voice:
APRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Alright Frank! You can come in
now!
Frank rides between train cars. The wind whips his hair. He
takes a deep pull from a pinched cigarette - then flicks it
straight as a bullet into the passing countryside.
He feels alive.
The commuter train slows into the station. A door swings
open. And Frank leaps from the still moving train onto the
platform. He slows to a walk.
The kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler,
shrieking with pleasure.
April sits on the steps in front of the house reading some
material from the American Express office.
34.
She looks up as Frank's car pulls into the drive. He steps
out of the car and comes towards her. She looks up and
smiles. He drops his brief case on the ground and walks
towards her. She meets him in the middle of the lawn, and
they embrace.
Shep walks across the grass to the edge of his property. He
drinks and looks down over Revolutionary Road. He can see
the Wheeler house. He takes a drink of beer, his eyes
focused on the house.
MILLY (O.S.)
Shep?
Shep wheels around. April and Frank are standing there with
Milly. April wears a new indigo silk dress. Her hair moves
in the warm breeze. She's never looked better.
Through the picture window, we see the Givings' car is parked
in the driveway.
Mrs. Givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covered
baking pan. Mr. Givings opens the backseat.
45.
Out steps JOHN, 30's, an institutional haircut and ill-
fitting suit. He looks around the sunny neighborhood.
Frank, April and John walk through the woods.
The ground is freshly rained on and damp.
The sun is bright.
John buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down
over his hands.
APRIL
I hear you're a mathematician.
JOHN
You hear wrong.
It's all gone now.
APRIL
All gone?
JOHN
You know what electrical shock
treatments are?
52.
APRIL
Yes.
Yes I do.
JOHN
I've had thirty-seven.
He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April.
JOHN (CONT'D)
See?
There are scars on his forehead.
April can see them.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional
Problems.' Just jolted out the
mathematics.
APRIL
How awful.
JOHN
(mimicking)
`How awful...' Why, because
mathematics is so `interesting?'
APRIL
No. Because the shocks must be
awful and... well, because it's
awful not to be able to do what it
is you want to do. I think
mathematics are dull.
John stares at April.
He smiles.
JOHN
I like your girl, Frank.
FRANK
Me too.
JOHN
So, what do a couple of people like
you have to run away from?
FRANK
We're not running.
53.
John comes to a stop.
JOHN
And what's in Paris?
APRIL
A different way of life.
FRANK
So maybe we are running... We're
running from the hopeless emptiness
of the whole life here.
JOHN
The hopeless emptiness? Now,
you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness, but it
takes real guts to see the
hopelessness... Wow.
John continues walking.
Frank and April watch him go.
The small, attractive house bathed in sunlight.
A baking hot day. The sky is electric blue. Radios PLAY,
children CRY, dogs BARK. Sunbathers cover almost every inch
of sand.
We find Shep, Milly, Frank and April with beach chairs,
coolers and umbrellas.
A child wrapped in a towel sleeps on Milly's lap.
April wears a pair of dark glasses, behind which she is
thinking, thinking.
SHEP
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna
survive without you?
FRANK
Actually... Something kinda funny
happened the other day. I did some
dumb little piece of work to get
myself off the hook with Bandy, and
suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.
SHEP
(laughs)
That's always the way, isn't it?
FRANK
It's incredible. I knocked this
thing off in a couple of minutes
and now they want me to join their
team of `specialist' salesmen.
SHEP
Morons.
FRANK
It'd be funny, if they weren't
talking about so much damn money.
April turns and looks at Frank. Long and hard.
If he can
feel her look, he doesn't show it.
63.
SHEP
(stealing a glance at
April)
So, you tempted?
FRANK
(shrugs)
Well, it's kind of ironic, don't
you think?
April suddenly stands up.
Frank and Shep watch her walk down
to the water's edge.
SHEP
She okay?
Frank stares after her.
April stands in the water staring out over the sea. The
waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her or
not, she's staring in the direction of Europe.
Frank comes up beside her.
APRIL
I thought you turned the job down?
FRANK
(shrugs)
Not yet... It's just an option,
that's all. With the money they're
talking, things could be different
for us here. We could get a better
place. Travel.
April shakes her head and drags on her cigarette.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Look, the point is - we could be
happy here. At least for a while.
She stares out at the sea.
64.
FRANK (CONT'D)
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones who know how
to lead interesting lives, April.
She turns to him.
APRIL
So you've made up your mind?
FRANK
No.
Like I said, it's an option.
APRIL
...And supposing you're right. You
make all this money and we have
this interesting life here. Won't
you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find
ridiculous? Just like your father.
FRANK
(sharp)
Maybe we let that be my business.
APRIL
(incredulous)
Your business?
FRANK
(exhales)
It's too hot for this.
I'm going
to get wet.
She just looks at him. He walks into the ocean.
She stands
on the shore, watching him swim away from her.
Frank leads the way through the cars.
Shep supports Milly who is now falling down drunk.
April walks alone a few paces behind...
They reach Shep's car, which is trapped behind several other
cars.
SHEP
Of all the inconsiderate...
A beat.
Frank looks to April.
75.
APRIL
Look - why don't you take Milly
home, then go home yourself and
that would take care of both
sitters. Then Shep can take me
home later.
SHEP
All right with me.
FRANK
(to April)
You'll be alright?
APRIL
Sure.
Frank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with car
keys in hand.
Frank bursts out the front and comes to a stop.
She's across the street - climbing unsteadily into the
woods...
Frank breaks into a sprint.
April walks through the woods.
Frank runs up behind her, scrambling through the muddy
bracken.
April wheels around.
APRIL
Don't come any closer.
FRANK
April, listen, I --
APRIL
Don't come any closer. Can't I
even get away from you in the
fucking woods?
He stops moving.
FRANK
April, listen, I didn't mean that.
Honestly; I didn't mean what I
said.
91.
APRIL
Are you still talking? Isn't there
any way to stop your talking? I
NEED to think. Can't you see that?
She backs up against a tree trunk, looking down at him.
FRANK
Please come back.
What're you
doing out here?
APRIL
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank? Because I will, if you say
another word! I mean it!
Frank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would
hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then
turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he
goes.
April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away
down the drive.
April sees Frank looking back at her.
She waves.
Frank
waves from the car and drives off...
96.
Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill.
She turns and looks back at the house.
A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The
crisp green lawns. The blue televisions flickering behind
the glass.
101.
We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the
rush of a man's breath...
Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears
streaming silently down his face...
Shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. He
looks out over the suburban houses. At what was once the
Wheeler house.
Shep's face, looking out. His eyes are filled with tears.
Milly comes up behind him.
MILLY
You okay?
SHEP
Mm-hmm.
She takes his arm and holds him close.
SHEP (CONT'D)
I don't want to talk about The
Wheelers any more.
MILLY
Okay. We don't have to.
We don't
have to.
Shep and Milly look out over Revolutionary Road.
The same silence over a beautiful day in the city.
And
from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy
branches of trees.
Two children play in a playground in a small park.
It's Jennifer and Michael.
They seem happy, engrossed. Other
kids play around them.
103.
Watching them from a bench is Frank.
He is a little older, a
little thinner.
Close on Frank's face.
The SOUND of his children playing.
