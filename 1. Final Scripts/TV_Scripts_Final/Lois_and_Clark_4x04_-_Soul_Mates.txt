To pop everything into place...    

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the end
of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) or the * (this on Cast and Chronology pages)
designate.

Notes:

    LOIS, by her luggage near the open front door, gazes in

                                    LOIS
                   Hello, Husband.  I still can't
                   believe it -- we're really actually
                   married!  It feels like a dream.
                        (floating anxiety)
                   It's not, right?  I mean, I know
                   that's silly, but on the other
                   hand, given our history together...

                        (kisses her)
                   That feel like a dream?

                   Come true.

                   Ready... Wait, I'm missing a bag.
                   I must've left it at home.
                        (makes flying motion)
                   Do you mind?

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Something tells me we won't be
                   needing a lot of clothes on our
                   honeymoon, Lois.

                   been through too much just to get
                   to this point, this moment.

    She meets his lips and their tender exchange turns 
    passionate.  Just as they're getting hot and heavy, of 
    course, a KNOCK at the door.

                                    LOIS
                   Aw, God, not _now_!

    The KNOCKING becomes more insistent.

                   afraid we don't have much time.
                   But the short of it is, I'm here to

                   Cast upon your love centuries ago
                   by a wicked, vindictive soul bound
                   and determined to destroy your
                   love.  Forever.
                        (off their looks)
                   Right.  I didn't think you'd
                   believe me.  Which is why I wanted
                   to confirm my suspicions first.

    Clark hands the newspaper back to Wells:

                                    CLARK
                   How'd you find out about this...
                   curse?

                                    WELLS
                   Initially, with this.

    Wells reveals a Walkman-sized, titanium encased Device,
    which has, at its center, a shifting pool of liquid crystal.
    A row of ICONS underneath are the only controls.

                                    CLARK
                   What is it?

                   it's much more than that.  I came                 (X)
                   across it upon my future travels,
                   to a time quite unlike anything I'd
                   ever dreamed of.  There, I met a                  (X)
                   fellow inventor who discovered a                  (X)
                   way to identify the energies
                   emitted by... souls.

                        (filled with excitement)
                   You see, every soul has an energy
                   field unique unto itself -- a
                   cosmic fingerprint, if you will.
                   No two exactly alike.  This Device
                   was created as a means to track
                   that energy.  Or, to be more
                   precise, _back_track it.

                                    LOIS
                   Wait a minute, are we talking past

                   Look, let's just say for the sake
                   of argument, that that... _thing_
                   does what you say it does.  What's

                   and discovered something quite
                   remarkable along the way.  It seems

                   with _hers_, like soul mates.

                   news is that unless you return to

                   why stuff _does_ keep happening to

                   Wait a minute -- time out -- I've got 
                   a few questions here, do you mind?  
                   First, how is it we're here, 
                   dressed like -- Robin Hood and Maid 
                   Marian, but we still _think_ like 
                   Lois and Clark?
                        (off Wells)
                   And how come you haven't changed
                   one bit?

                                    WELLS
                   Actually, the truth is... I have no 
                   idea.  But perhaps the answer lies 
                   in the fact that this is about 
                   _your_ lives, _your_ circle of 
                   friends, _your_ destiny, not mine.
                   I'm merely... a guide.  Like a 
                   narrator in a play.

                                    CLARK/THE FOX
                   Yeah, but why am I here?  I mean,
                   I'm not even from this planet.

                                    WELLS
                   Perhaps Clark Kent isn't, but your 
                   soul -- comes from a place beyond 
                   planets, beyond Time.  Where we all 
                   come from.  You see, time travel 
                   has given me a glimpse at the Great 
                   Design.  Enough of a glimpse to see 
                   that the power of this universe is 
                   energy, and the power of your love 
                   is what brings your souls together,
                   time and again.  That's the one 
                   absolute -- wherever she is, you 
                   are.

                   If I want your opinion, I'll ask
                   for it.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Really, Sorcerer, you must stop
                   talking to rodents.  It completely
                   undermines your credibility.

                                    SORCERER
                   Baron, I fear a strange magic, a
                   force unlike any other has entered
                   our sphere.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Never mind that, I've got more
                   pressing concerns.  The Fox has
                   stolen Lady Loisette from me, and I
                   simply can't have that.  I hate it
                   when the hero gets the heroine,
                   it's so cliche.

                                    SORCERER
                   Why do you want to force her to
                   marry you anyway?  Simply to rule
                   over her fiefdom?                                 (X)

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Why, sure, power's _fun_.  But the 
                   added bonus is it'd destroy The Fox 
                   because she's his girl.  That's why 
                   I want you to make her love me.

                                    SORCERER
                   Would that I could, Sire.
                   Unfortunately, spells can enchant
                   and they can damn, but they can                   (X)
                   never force the ways of a heart.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   You're sure about that?  You've 
                   checked with all the other 
                   sorcerers?

                                    SORCERER
                   Positive.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Very well, I'll try a more 
                   conventional approach first.  But, 
                   if that fails, I want you to 
                   prepare your most diabolical 
                   curse -- and doom their love for 
                   all time.

    Tempos tosses a root into the cauldron causing it to FLARE 
    and HISS.  The rat SCREECHES wildly.

                                    SORCERER
                   Gladly.

    Then, SQUIRE JEREMY, _Jimmy Olson's incarnation_, enters and 
    bows his head:

                                    SQUIRE JEREMY
                   My liege.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                        (condescending)
                   Who are you?

                                    SQUIRE JEREMY
                   I am Jeremy, loyal squire to Sir 
                   Charles.  I'm afraid Sir Charles is 
                   away on patrol.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Ironic, isn't it?  Every time Sir
                   Charles is away, The Fox shows up.
                   I wonder, is it possible... ?

 15 EXT. CAVE - DAY                                                15   

    PICK UP Lois in conversation as she folds the Robin Hood 
    outfit and stacks it on a rock.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   I'm not saying I'm buying into any 
                   of this stuff yet, but it is kind 
                   of bizarre that Tempus, of all 
                   people, is behind the curse.  I 
                   mean, _Lex Luthor_, I could 
                   understand, but --

    She turns and ogles at Clark, who comes around from behind a 
    boulder wearing only tight black pants and lace up leather 
    boots.  He self-consciously reacts to her reaction:

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   What... ? It's the pants, isn't it?  
                   They're too tight.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                        (transfixed)
                   Tight?  No, they're, uh... perfect.
                   I just never get over how well --
                   _defined_ you are.

    She hands him a black leather jerkin with an attached 
    flowing cape.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Thanks...

                   Here, let me help.

    She adjusts the cape then helps him lace up the vest.  They 
    feed off each other's body heat, struggling to fend off 
    their natural urges.  He strokes her cheek.  She strokes his 
    exposed biceps.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE (CONT'D)

                   honeymoon A.S.A.P.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   That's what I was thinking.

    Melting into each other, they move to kiss, when Wells 
    appears around the corner and CLEARS his THROAT.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Yes... ?

                                    WELLS
                        (looking back)
                   Sorry, but your... parents just 
                   told me something very interesting.  
                   Apparently, Sir Charles and Lady 
                   Loisette are secretly in love.  
                   That's why he... I mean, The Fox... 
                   I mean, _you_ ambushed Tempos, to 
                   get her away from him.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Sounds like something I'd do in any 
                   life.

                                    WELLS
                   The problem is that could very well 
                   be the event that triggered the 
                   curse.  If so, we may already be 
                   too late.

    Marta and Jon approach and present Clark with a shiny, King      (X)
    Arthur-like sword.

                                    MARTA

    She hands it to him, then curtsies.

    A SOLDIER nails a parchment WANTED POSTER to a post.  It
    bears a crudely sketched LIKENESS of THE FOX (masked), and
    reads:  PROCLAMATION, FOR THE CAPTURE OF THE FOX, 1000 GOLD
    PIECES.  REVEAL Clark/Sir Charles, as he rides up,
    dismounts, and reacts to the poster, before entering:


 18 INT. SORCERER'S TENT - DAY                                     18   

    Squire Jeremy holds a tray of cheese for the Sorcerer, who
    takes a piece and dangles it just out of the rat's reach.

                                    SORCERER

                   I'll tell him you're here.

    Jeremy exits.  Clark drifts over to the Sorcerer, who's
    still teasing the rat with the cheese.  The rat SQUEAKS.

                                    SORCERER
                   Oh, so now you're being nice to me,

                   What have we here?  My prized 
                   knight has deigned to make an 
                   appearance, has he?

    Tempos collects a handful of grapes, as he holds out his 
    ring for Clark to kiss.  Clark hesitates, forces himself to 
    kiss it.

                   Your eyes betray you, my friend.  
                   You don't much like stooping to me,

                        (measures that)
                   That's what I like about you, 
                   Charles.  You're fearless.  Which 
                   is precisely why I want you to duel 
                   The Fox.  In my name, of course.

                   Me?  That's impossible...

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   I mean... you know, because The Fox 
                   is on the loose...

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Not for long, I assure you.  He'll 
                   be captured, and when he is, you 
                   will defeat him for all to see.
                   Then, after The Fox is vanquished 
                   once and for all, I will marry Lady 
                   Loisette.

    Clark/Sir Charles, black cape flowing, rides up to Lois and
    Wells.  Marta and Jon are roasting a wild boar on a spit
    nearby.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   It's about time, Clark, I was
                   getting worried about you.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                        (dismounts)
                   I'm supposed to be out searching
                   for The Fox.  Baron Tempos wants me
                   to duel him for your love.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   You fighting you for me?  That
                   should be interesting.

                                    WELLS
                   What about the curse, has it been
                   cast yet?

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   I don't think so, but you don't
                   want to mess with that sorcerer,
                   believe me.  The guy's married to                 (X)
                   a rat.

                                    WELLS
                   Pardon?

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   My point is, I think the original
                   Sir Charles came back for Lady
                   Loisette like I'm doing, but ran
                   off with her, never to return --

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   -- which kept Tempos from being                   (X)
                   able to marry her.  That's gotta be
                   what triggered the curse.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   The question is, how do we keep it                (X)
                   from being triggered?                             (X)

                   could I have a napkin, please?

    Marta and Jon exchange a curious look, then cross back to        (X)
    the cave.  Lois lets out an overwhelmed sigh.

                   chased by a medieval psychotic
                   who's trying to put a curse on me
                   when I'm really supposed to be on
                   my honeymoon making love to my
                   husband?!  Do I _look_ okay to

                   No, I'm serious, Clark.  Maybe 
                   we're missing the obvious here.  
                   Maybe it's time we stopped 
                   pretending, started looking at the 
                   writing on the wall.  It just seems

                   see how badly we want to be

                   Isn't that preferable to the 
                   alternative -- him having to endure 
                   the first in a never-ending string 
                   of tragedies?

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Well, what about Lady Loisette?  We 
                   can't just let her get stuck with 
                   Tempos.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   If I know her, and I think I do,
                   she can handle him.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   Yeah, but --

    Lois strokes his cheek, interrupting him.

                                    LOIS/LADY LOISETTE
                   Clark, I want to get home now...                  (X)
                        (suggestively runs her 
                         hand down his chest)
                   ... I want to turn on some soft 
                   music, open that bottle of 
                   champagne and finish what we 
                   started in the twentieth century. 
                   Okay?  Foreplay's nice, but this is 
                   ridiculous.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                        (beat)
                   I'll need my green tights.

                   Sir Charles?!  You're The Fox? I

    Baron Tempos slowly rises, stunned at this revelation.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Of course... It all makes perfect 
                   sense.  Never in the same place at 
                   the same time.  Always ducking out 
                   and returning with some lame 
                   excuse.  I can't believe I was 
                   actually fooled by a little mask 
                   over the eyes.

    With that, Lois wrenches free and dashes to Clark's side.
    The Soldier starts after her --

                   No, leave her be.  Sir Charles is

                   affect... Clark.

                   Is there a more noble way to die
                   than to die for love, Sir Charles?

    Decision time.  Lois and Clark hold an intimate look.

                                    CLARK/SIR CHARLES
                   I don't want to die... But if 
                   that's what it takes for us to be 
                   together... that's easy.

    He smothers her protest with a kiss, then turns to meet the

    him to the ground.

    But instead of going for the kill, Clark turns to look at

                   m'boy.  Have faith in your love...

    The tug that is their bond pulls at Clark as he walks off,
    sharing one last emotional look with Lois as Wells punches
    buttons on The Device, engaging it.  The liquid crystal
    center GLOWS WHITE; then, in a FLASH, it ARCS OUT to Clark

    elevator doors open.  An anxious beat, then Lois, in her         (X)
    present day wardrobe, steps out slightly unsteady on her         (X)
    feet.  Clark holds her, relieved beyond words.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, are you all right?!

                                    WELLS
                   I don't know... Perhaps something's
                   wrong with The Device.  It's from
                   the future, you know, it's
                   difficult to get parts.

                                    CLARK
                   Look, you said if we reversed the
                   curse, we'd be able to consummate
                   our marriage.  Well, we reversed
                   it, didn't we?

                                    WELLS
                   By changing history, yes.

                                    LOIS
                   But, we didn't have a choice.  That
                   was the only way to stop the curse.

                                    WELLS
                   History's held in delicate balance,
                   with infinite consequences to even
                   the most remote or seemingly
                   insignificant change.  It's quite
                   possible that in allowing Baron
                   Tempos to defeat The Fox, we
                   unwittingly allowed Evil to defeat
                   Good in a place and time it had not
                   done so before.  That, over Time,
                   may very well have shifted the
                   balance of power in favor of Evil.

                   I accept.  On one condition, 
                   non-negotiable.  The Lone Rider is 
                   to ride out of town, never to

                   Whoa, talk about your deja vu.

    Suddenly, Clark's boots lose their grip.  Lois GASPS as 
    Clark falls through the trap door but, just as the rope 
    around his neck snaps taut -- Tempus Tex quickdraws his six 
    shooter and FIRES RIGHT AT:


 32 CLARK/THE LONE RIDER                                           32   

    and the bullet just misses his head, SLICING THE ROPE above.
    Clark drops to the ground in a heap, STRUGGLING for air.

                                    TEMPUS TEX

                   Shoot, missed high.
                        (grabs Lois/Lulu close)
                   You made a wise decision, Lulu.
                   You and your dowry are gonna make 
                   me a very rich man.

    Clark, still struggling for breath, watches with hateful 
    eyes.  Sheriff Jeremiah sidles over to within earshot of 
    him.

    turns to Lois and romantically helps her off the saddle.
    She ever-so-slowly slides down his chest to the ground,

                   back.  Now, let's get outta here

                   Yes, well, if only it was that

                   was defeat Tempus.  He did that.

                   Well, temporarily perhaps.  I just 
                   had a conversation with a 
                   passing -- what do you yanks call 
                   them... a _buckaroo_, who informed 
                   me that Tempus Tex is holding 
                   hostages, near and dear to Lulu.
                   Insurance, apparently, to make sure 
                   the wedding goes through.  In 
                   short, you haven't defeated Tempus, 
                   until you save them first.

                        (studies him closely)
                   -- Have we met before?  You look

    Lois and Wells exchange an anxious look.

                   I have that kind of face.

                   any more rescuing.
                        (helps her on horse;

    Tempus Tex gives him a second look, then mounts up behind
    Lois.  As he rides off, she sneaks a nervous peek back at
    Clark, who turns and WHISTLES for his horse.

                                    TEMPUS TEX
                   Whatever that means.                              (X)

    He suddenly grabs Lois around the neck, draws his gun on         (X)
    her.

                                    TEMPUS TEX (CONT'D)
                   I don't know if you've noticed, but
                   I hate to lose.  Especially to you.

    Clark moves to Tempus, but Tempus points the gun at him.

                                    TEMPUS TEX (CONT'D)
                   Willing to die for your love, are
                   you?

                                    CLARK/THE LONE RIDER
                   Wouldn't be the first time.

    Lois elbows Tempus in the gut -- the gun GOES OFF, the
    bullet just missing Clark, who then KICKS the gun out of his
    hand.  Tempus Tex takes off in a full sprint.  Clark chases
    him down, tackles him hard into the ground, then yanks him
    to his feet.

    As he does, Tempus pulls a Derringer out of his boot, but        (X)
    Clark spots it and KNOCKS it out of his hand, then hauls         (X)
    off and gives him a cathartic PUNCH in the nose, knocking        (X)

    shirt, but still holding the champagne flutes.                   (X)

                                    CLARK
                   Didn't spill a drop.

    He crosses to her side of the bed, offers her a glass. She
    puts it down without taking a sip, then puts his down too.
    Lois wraps her arms around his neck, pulling him close.

                                    LOIS
                   I don't want anything clouding this
                   moment.

                                    CLARK
                   A moment we're destined for.

                                    LOIS
                   That's what makes it so special.  I
                   love you, Clark Kent.

                                    CLARK
                   I love you, Lois --
                        (catches himself)
                   Lane.

    They fall into a kiss, this time with growing hunger.
    They're in no hurry as this moment is played out for all its
    worth.  Then, Clark gently leads her under the sheets.  Just
    as they start to get hot and heavy -- the phone RINGS.
    Clark looks over at it.

                                    LOIS
                   Don't even _think_ about it!

    As the phone RINGS again, she pulls him back into the kiss.
    He reaches over, fumbles for the phone line, and YANKS it
    out of the socket, pulling out a chunk of wall with it.  As
    their passion takes them, they lose themselves in the
    lovemaking and don't even notice that they're FLOATING under
    the top sheet, two feet above the mattress.  CAMERA PANS
    AWAY to honor their privacy and PUSHES OUT THE WINDOW TO:
