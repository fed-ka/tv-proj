Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of
bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading
downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.
Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the
side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB ("This fall, Mondays
are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away.

Further along, Gary spots two THUGGY TEENAGERS sitting on a 106
low wall. He calls out to them:
GARY
Hey!
Do you sell crack?
The boys look wary.
GARY (CONT'D)
It's cool.
I'm only a cop on TV.
QUICK CUTS:
Money changes hands.
Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do
with its lumpy beige contents.

HOLLYWOOD.
Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A
matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the
passenger window.
Gary holds up the little bag.
GARY
Is this crack?
She takes a closer look.
GARY (CONT'D)
Do you know how to do it?

Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to
bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.
Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the
ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still
laughing.

Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He
notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but
she's down for the count.
Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing,
he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.
GARY
Yes, hello. I'm having a medical
situation. Yes. Okay. I don't
have a belly button.
(explaining carefully)
I do not have a belly button where
I should, on my belly. And I'm
concerned, because I don't know if
that's...
He sits down on the edge of the bed.
GARY (CONT'D)
Can a person live without a belly
button? Because if you think about
it, you're born with one. So if
you don't have one, you're unborn
and it's really hazy whether you're
alive or not. I guess I'm
wondering: am I alive?
(a sudden thought)
Or what if I'm God?
A beat.
GARY (CONT'D)
No, no.
I'm totally sober.
A beat.
GARY (CONT'D)
No, I don't think I need an
ambulance. I don't seem to be
dying any faster than usual. But I
should probably go to the hospital,
don't you think? Yeah, I should.
He hangs up.
CUT TO:

He's driving again, but most of his attention is focused on
trying to locate his missing navel.
He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two
A113

VERSIONS OF HIMSELF
sitting in the back seat.
All three Garys give each other
thumbs-up.
Driver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees
shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're

MARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself.
MARGARET
La la la la la. Like you've never
done worse.
From a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But
it was an environmentally friendly
car. Why doesn't that get
reported?
A beat.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
Please! He was heartbroken,
betrayed. You say you understand
but you don't. You can't. You're
like a big giant Vulcan.
6.
Noticing something to her right...
MARGARET (CONT'D)
He's coming. I'll call you later.
She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone.
We
reveal
GARY
being escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE
OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
Hi.
Margaret. I work for Lola.
GARY
Gary.
MARGARET
I know.
(to the Parole Officer)
We need to go out the back.
CUT TO:
115
115
Margaret leads the way.
She's been here before.
GARY
Are there reporters out front?
MARGARET
A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More
like Robert Downey, Jr. when he
broke into that family's house and
slept in the kid's bed like
Goldilocks. "This bed is just
right." I handled episodes two
through four for Robert. This sort
of thing is my specialty.
GARY
What is?
MARGARET
Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry.
Mama's gonna take good care of you.
A phone RINGS.
CUT TO:
7.
116
116
A designer kitchen in Hancock Park -- spacious and kosher-
ready. The phone on the counter is RINGING.
PAROLE OFFICER
Answer it.
Gary picks it up.
GARY
Hello?
Yes. Yes.
He looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at
length. Then, very deliberately...
GARY (CONT'D)
The weather in Toledo is rainy.
He says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger
phrase.
PAROLE OFFICER
Use your normal voice.
GARY
(to the phone)
Nine dogs ran through the field.
The koala sits in the tree.
The Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a
series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet.
MARGARET
It's computer voice recognition.
The system can call you any time
day or night. If you don't answer
within five rings, the police come
and haul your ass off.
GARY
What if I'm not here?
Catching the officer's concerned look...
MARGARET
That's why it's called house
arrest. You stay inside your
house.
(to the officer)
He can take direction, I promise.

Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light.
Gary wanders, checking it all out.
MARGARET
Okay, just so it's said, this house
is flammable.
GARY
I didn't mean to burn down my
house.
MARGARET
Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way
into a ten-year shame spiral, but I
did, and it's healthier to
acknowledge it.
(moving on)
This flammable house belongs to one
of Lola's other fabulous clients,
who is currently shooting a pilot
in Toronto.
GARY
Actor?
MARGARET
Writer. So for the next six weeks,
su casa es su casa. I say, feel
free to wear his clothes. He'll
probably get a sick thrill of out
it. The gays.
Noticing two crates...
GARY
He has dogs?
MARGARET
They're away at summer camp.
Now,
try the bed.
He lies back on it, feeling it out.
GARY
It's fine.
MARGARET
Comfortable?
GARY
Sure.
She massages his besocked feet.
9.
MARGARET
Look, Gary, I know this has been
crazy and stressful. I want you to
feel safe. And comfortable.
GARY
I do.
MARGARET
I'm a fan of yours, you know.
Your
number-one fan.
Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she
looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
But if you fuck this up, I will
smash your ankles with a sledge
hammer.
A long beat.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
That wouldn't be comfortable for
either of us.
CUT TO:
118

Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime on
the island.
MARGARET
I'll be coming by twice a day to
check up on you. I'm the only
person who should be coming by. No
buddies, no pals, no heroin
dealers...
GARY
I don't do heroin.
MARGARET
Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not
buying you porn. There's spray-per-
view on cable.
GARY
Good. I really wasn't concerned
about my career, my family or my
future. I just wanted to jack off.
Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone.
10.
MARGARET
Let me see your phone.
He hands over his cell phone.
She drops it in the contraband
box.
GARY
C'mon!
All my numbers are in that.
MARGARET
Dial ten digits at random. Whoever
answers will be better than the
people on this phone.
She picks up the liquor box, ready to go.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
You have my cell number. You have
delivery menus. You're fine.
Right?
GARY
I guess.
As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the
stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure.
TIME CUT TO:

Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it.
He plays a few NOTES on the piano.
He looks up at the painting over the staircase:
a cliff near
the ocean.
He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering
if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There
isn't.
He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the
dining room, which show the same thing in three different
ways.
120
120
Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery
menus.
122
122
He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who
seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door.
As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back
and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk.
The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to
being stared at.
123
123
Gary unwraps the Thai food.
Makes himself a plate.
He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating
dinner.
GARY (O.S. TV DIALOGUE)
Once we get these samples back to
the Crime Lab, we'll know who the
real killer is.
124
124
Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There
are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his
lifetime.
He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide.
He lies back on the couch, reading it.
He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more
interesting. A beat.

GARY JACKING OFF
to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining
face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as
they go down on each other.
Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on.
He can't
find anything.
12.
126
126
His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from
the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER
RUNNING as he washes his hands. Then it shuts off.
We hear a THUNK.
Something hard was dropped on the wood
floor.
Gary hears it too.
He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few
silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he
reaches the two-story section of the foyer.
That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the
wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal.
We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway.
We can
hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint
PANTING. But there's no dog.
BACK ON Gary, increasingly unsettled. He's directly below
the walkway, and can't see up into it.
GARY
Is somebody there?
Hello?
He CLAPS his hands twice.
Listens.
Nothing.
He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly
THE PHONE RINGS.
He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times
before he ducks into the TV room to answer it.
GARY (CONT'D)
Hello?!
(relieved)
Yes. Yes.
He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions
on the phone.
GARY (CONT'D)
Nine leopards run through the
jungle.
(listening)
I bought two cakes at the store.
His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up.
He looks back
into the foyer.

GARY (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
The house is haunted. There's a
zeitgeist, or something.

Gary brushes his teeth and tongue.

Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes.

He sits, trying to read Candide again.
He fidgets.
He looks at the clock again:
2:49.

Gary carefully sets rat traps, staggering them every few
feet.
He pokes one with a pencil.
The metal arm SNAPS back,
breaking the pencil in two.
136
136
Gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached
to it. He turns it on.
He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks. A red disk
is labelled "Knowing." He puts it in. Hits play.
The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy
CLASSICAL PIECE.
Gary lies on the floor, listening to it.
He stares up at the
elaborate chandelier.

Sarah tops off Gary's wine glass. They're both on the couch.
The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them.
GARY
... so it's kind of hard to prove
that I only meant to burn my ex-
girlfriend's stuff, and not the
entire house.
SARAH
Yeah.
Fire's tricky that way.
GARY
How about you? Any history of
arson?
SARAH
Strangely enough...
GARY
I knew it!
I could see that little
spark.
SARAH
It wasn't arson.
Probably.
A long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him
the story.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Okay. When I was a little girl,
our house caught on fire.
19.
GARY
Oh shit.
MUSIC begins, providing backing to her monologue.
SARAH
I'll never forget the look on my
father's face as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced through the
burning building, out onto the
pavement.
ON GARY, feeling bad he brought this up, but fascinated at
the same time.
SARAH (CONT'D)
I stood there shivering in my
pajamas and watched the whole world
go up in flames. And when it was
all over, I said to myself, "Is
that all there is to a fire?" Is
that all there is?
As she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at
all. It's Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is."
SARAH (CONT'D)
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's
keep dancing.
She leans closer.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Let's break out the booze and have a ball.
If that's all there is.
Standing up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the
couch. She leads him to an open area -- more space for
dancing.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's

Sarah leans up to the mirror, trying to get her contacts in.
It's not going well. Her eyes are tearing up.
SARAH
Then I fell in love with the most
wonderful boy in the world. We
would take long walks by the river
or just sit for hours gazing into
each other's eyes. We were so very
much in love. Then one day he went
away and I thought I'd die. But I
didn't. And when I didn't, I said
to myself, "Is that all there is to
love?"

Deep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by
vintage lighting fixtures. She's (futilely) trying to match
a specific light switch plate.
TO CAMERA:
SARAH
I know what you're thinking.
If that's the way she feels about
it why doesn't she just end it all?
I'm in no hurry for that final
disappointment. I know just as
well as I'm standing here talking
to you, when that final moment
comes and I'm breathing my last
breath, I'll be saying to myself...

LIVING ROOM - DAY
Sarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the
couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up
and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though
her voice continues.

SARAH'S VOICE
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's
keep dancing.
Let's break out the booze and have a ball,
If that's all there...
Just as they're about to kiss,
A BABY HOWLS.
It's the monitor, HISSING and POPPING as Jaden wakes up from
her nap, cranky and hungry. Sarah pushes back. Gary tries
to close the gap, but she's already standing up.
SARAH
I need to...
GARY
Just...
SARAH
My shoes.
Are here.
Okay.
As she reaches for one, she knocks over a wine glass.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Crap!
GARY
Don't worry about it.
Just...
SARAH
I'm going.
Bye.
Carrying both her shoes, she's across the room and out the
front door before he can say anything more.

Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any
trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the
cabinet.
Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it

Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water
bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he
notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads:
Look for the Nines.

Nothing.
Sticks it back
down on the counter.

Gary sits on the couch with his water bottle, listening to

his shoes and socks. When she's finished...
SARAH (ON MONITOR)
Goodnight, sweetheart.
GARY
Goodnight.
For a long beat, it's quiet.
Then we hear RUSTLING.
A crib toy plays a short MELODY.
Then a slightly-digital
voice speaks:
VOICE
The cat says meow!
The pig says oink!
Gary smiles to himself.
VOICE (CONT'D)
The cow says moo!
The cow says moo!
The cow says moo!
Evidently, Jaden loves the cow.

The dog says, nine. Nine. Nine.

Gary looks back.
Did he just hear that?
The phone RINGS.

Gary answers it on the third ring.
GARY
Hello.
It's the parole system.
GARY (CONT'D)
Yes. Yes. Two trains run through
the forest.
Music STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression.
He nearly drops the phone.
Forcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for
speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right.
MALE COMPUTER VOICE
Nine.
Nine. Nine. Nine.
Gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and
jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into
SOMEONE ELSE.
He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE
MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is
gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air.
Gary bolts for the door.
Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a
RAT TRAP,
which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off.
He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main
floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.
Limping, he hops out the door.
We stay behind, looking out
through the open door.

POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT
Handcuffed, Gary is placed in back.
He's reserving the right

MARGARET (PRE-LAP)
Once again, the idea of house
arrest is you stay inside your
house.
160

The same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet
to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also
features bandaged toes.
MARGARET
Think of it like an electronic
leash. Basically, if you ever go
more than 100 feet from the base
station...
She points to an electronic device by the wall.
26.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
...the cops come, they throw your
ass in jail. If you ever try to
take it off, the cops come and
throw your ass in jail. And if
they ever detect drugs or alcohol
in your system...
GARY
...the cops come and throw my ass
in jail.
MARGARET
No. I kick your ass. Then the
cops come and throw your ass in
jail.
The parole officer smiles.
GARY
Do I still have to answer the
phone?
MARGARET
No, I'll be doing that from now on.
I'm moving into the guest room.
GARY
I don't need a babysitter.
MARGARET
Despite all evidence to the
contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool

There's an edge to her voice.
GARY
You've been watching.

SARAH
Well. I don't want to meddle in
your affairs.
GARY
My affairs?
SARAH
Everyone needs affection.
I get

She's headed back for the door.
GARY
I don't.
Are you seriously
jealous?
SARAH
The opposite. I just want to
protect her.
GARY
From what?
SARAH
From you. Look at you. You date
models. Actresses. Tennis
players.
GARY
Yeah.

On a scale of one to ten, you

LIVING ROOM - DAY [A FEW MINUTES LATER]
CLOSE ON a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the
room, about ten feet up. It might be a smoke detector.
Gary stares up at it, intently.
He steps forward.
A little red light flicks on inside the unit. After a few
seconds it turns off. It's some sort of motion detector.
Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough
that the light never engages.

Margaret enters, carrying two mugs.
She watches him warily.
MARGARET
You okay?
GARY
No.
MARGARET
Oh.
GARY
Tell me about the Nines.
MARGARET
The Nines?
GARY
The Nines.
MARGARET
Sort of hard to start there...
GARY
Try. And don't tell me I'm
imagining it. They're showing up
everywhere, and I want to know why.
Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation:
MARGARET
Best guess? They're your
subconscious trying to remind you
who you are.
GARY
I'm a Nine?
MARGARET
Yes. It doesn't make a lot of
sense of out context.
(offering)
Coffee?
He takes the mug, then reconsiders.
Maybe it's laced with
something.
GARY
Why don't you drink coffee?
You're
always drinking tea.
Frustrated, she takes his coffee back and drinks it. She'd
really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point, but
it's just too hot.
37.
MARGARET
Happy?
She gestures for him to sit down.
Reluctantly, he does.
She
sits across from him.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
You're not going to understand this
yet, but we've known each other for
like 25 years. One day when I was
12, you called me out of the blue.
And we've been talking ever since.
GARY
Talking.
MARGARET
On the phone. Usually.
GARY
I never met you before I came here.
MARGARET
You, Gary, never met me. But
you're not always...

No.
I'm a lot confused.

FOYER - DAY
Gavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's

GAVIN (V.O.)
At this stage, you have the script
you wrote, and the film you shot,
but you don't know how it's all
going to come together. You just
know how you want it to feel.
He writes "Knowing" on the diskette, and pops it into the
Disclavier unit.

GAVIN
Wow. I thought it was pretty
obvious. And dramatic.

The monitor shows a three-second clip. It's Melissa and a
eight year-old actress ("Noelle") in a car.

Melissa's character looks alarmed by something the girl has
just done or said.
MELISSA
What's the line?
GAVIN

How could you...
MELISSA

GAVIN
Yeah.
MELISSA

GAVIN
I know. It's just for the test

TESTING SERVICE / FOCUS GROUP ROOM - DAY
Through a one-way mirror, Gavin and Susan watch as the
Moderator asks a group of twelve MALE VIEWERS about the pilot
they just watched.
Their comments are mostly positive. Gavin and Susan share relieved looks. She has a
notepad, as always.
One AGITATED MAN keeps staring at the mirror, right at Gavin.
(We recognize him as the Parole Officer from Part One.)
GAVIN
That guy's looking at me.
SUSAN
He can't see you.
As a test, Gavin waves his arm. The Agitated Man's
expression changes slightly, but it's not clear whether it's
in reaction or not.
The Moderator directs her next question to the Agitated Man.
MODERATOR
How about you? Did you feel it
was...
AGITATED MAN
It's not real.
MODERATOR
And what do you mean by that?
48.
AGITATED MAN
The show's not real. Why can't you
see that? Jesus! Are you fucking
blind?
(looking at the mirror)
You think you're above it all,
don't you? You are trapped here
with the rest of them, brother.
He stands up, pushing past the other people to come right up
to the one-way glass. He stares directly at Gavin, even
though he shouldn't be able to see him.
He SHOUTS:
AGITATED MAN (CONT'D)
Get out.
Get out! Oblivio

Gavin backs away from the glass, freaked out.

the cards yet?
GAVIN
From the screening?
Melissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka.
MELISSA
Pardon me.
Daddy needs his drink.
She makes a quick Cape Cod.
From the other room, Sam YELLS:
SAM (O.S.)
Woman, where's my cocktail!
MELISSA
(yelling back)
I'm a-comin!
(to Gavin)
I still love you most.
She gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink.
SUSAN
(continuing her thought)
People write stuff on the cards
they won't say in a focus group.
They get more specific.
He SHAKES the mixer.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Roger has this advice I always
remember.

SUSAN (CONT'D)
Forget about anyone who scores you
in the Twos and Threes. They'll
never like your show.
Gavin pours.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
Instead, look for the Nines.
GAVIN
The Nines.
SUSAN
They're the one who think your show
is almost the best thing they've
ever seen. They get your vision.
They just want it to be even
better.
Melissa YELLS from the living room:
MELISSA
Round two is starting without you!
SUSAN
So you'll look at the cards?
GAVIN
Absolutely.
Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the

She doesn't have a ton to do in the

SUSAN
True. That's one of the challenges
with a premise pilot.
GAVIN
But the network still likes the
show?
SUSAN
Of course. Roger is your biggest
cheerleader.
GAVIN
How about above Roger?
SUSAN
Roger calls the shots.
GAVIN
After he consults with the Higher
Powers.
SUSAN
True.
GAVIN
Do they like the show?
SUSAN
They haven't seen it. They're
watching all the pilots on Friday.
A beat.
GAVIN
Why are you focusing on Melissa?
52.
SUSAN
Because she's the biggest concern.
GAVIN
She's also the biggest star in the
show.
SUSAN
No, you're the biggest star. Roger
made a huge deal with you, and he
went along with casting Melissa
when that wasn't his instinct.
GAVIN
Well, hooray for Roger. I don't
understand what you want me to do.
SUSAN
Meet with someone.
GAVIN
Who?
SUSAN
Dahlia Salem.
Gavin drops his fork so that it will CLATTER on his plate.
SUSAN (CONT'D)
The network has a holding deal with
her.
GAVIN
Yes. And you put her in Gatin's
pilot.
SUSAN
It's dead. It's dying. But the
network loves Dahlia. So if she
could jump over to your show...
GAVIN
Replace Melissa and reshoot the
pilot.
SUSAN
Roger would pay for it.
Gavin is nauseous.
He has to take a drink to be able to
speak.
GAVIN
So is this even about Melissa?

It's about getting your show on the

the end.

Gavin meets with Dahlia Salem. She's pretty, funny, and very cool.

Dahlia is gone.
INTERVIEW with Gavin.
GAVIN
I see why the network loves her.
It's just, I wrote the part for
Melissa. She's one of my best

You want me to call her agents?

I "heard" you fired Melissa
McCarthy without having a backup.
Why would they pick up your show

She sits forward in her chair.
By instinct, he sits back.
MARGARET
Everything is what it is. But
you're not who you think you are.
GARY
Okay, then. Who am I?
With practiced calm...
MARGARET
You're a multi-dimensional being of
vast, almost infinite power. You
created this world on a whim, and
decided to stick around to see how
it turned out. You, this body
you're in, is just one of your
incarnations. Avatars. Call you
what you will.
Not sure he follows...
GARY
Are you saying I'm God?
MARGARET
Technically, no. If God is a ten --
a theoretical ultimate, that-which-
no-greater-can-be-imagined --
you're more of a nine.
GARY
So what are you?
MARGARET
Humans are sevens. Monkeys are
sixes.
GARY
What are the eights?
MARGARET
Koalas. They're telepathic.
Plus,
they control the weather.
She didn't mean to get on that tangent...

MARGARET (CONT'D)
What's important is that you,
you're the big cheese. El Supremo.
You could destroy the world with a
single thought.
(suddenly)
Don't, incidentally. Just file
that away. But the truth is, you
hold all the cards: every church,
every candle, every sacrifice --
that's for you. When people pray,
they're not praying because they
want this thing or that thing.
They just don't want to be
forgotten.

So you understand, I would have
told you earlier, but I didn't...

That's how I like ya.
Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the
video camera. But she's still holding it.
She hits STOP.
Tries to collect herself.
Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.
She signs,
"Mommy?"
Mary backs away.

[The next sequence bridges multiple earlier scenes from Parts
One and Two. Gary/Gavin/Gabriel has one conversation with
Sarah/Susan/Sierra, but it's broken up among previous scenes
and locations, sometimes for just a line.]
S.
It's not that hard to make a
universe. At first, you just
checked in every once in a while.
See how the Neanderthals were
doing. Move some continents
around. But then you got more into
it. Starting playing a couple of
characters of your own. Kings.
Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,
you were playing 24/7.
G.
How long have I..?
S.
You've been gone for four thousand
years. Not that time means the
same for us, but...
G.
You came looking for me.
S.
That's what a girl does.
G.
Why now?

S.
We couldn't just storm in on a
fiery chariot. It's your universe.
We had to play by your rules. We
had to make you see how limited and
corrupt your little world was.
Don't get me wrong, this world is
nice. It's cozy. But do you
remember where you came from?
A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build
in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.
G.
It was warm. And white.

PRIUS - DAY
Gabriel climbs into the driver's seat. Both Mary and Noelle
watch with interest as he pushes the "START" button. The car
BEEPS and engages without any problem.
Everyone fastens their seatbelts.

KITCHEN - MORNING
Hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are
none.
As we PULL OUT, we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret,
but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of
them. We'll call her M.
She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing.
Empty.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Honey, do we have nutmeg?
M looks over at husband Ben, who is busy making pancakes,
reading from a recipe.
M
We should.
Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the
spice drawer. M watches her with cautious fascination.
BEN
Cinnamon, too.
95.
M catches her reflection in the toaster.
Notices she looks
different than she expected.
NOELLE
(to Ben)
If I had a horse...
Noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to Ben one at
a time.
NOELLE (CONT'D)
I would name her Cinnamon.
BEN
Really.
NOELLE
And if I had another horse...
BEN
Nutmeg?
NOELLE
No, Flash.
M
Sweetie?
She beckons Noelle over. Tucks back the little girl's hair.
Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear:
M
(CONT'D)
This is going to sound really
strange, but...what's my name?
Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look.
NOELLE
Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy.
Noelle smiles.
M smiles too, a little embarrassed.
M
Right.
Exactly.
Noelle looks her right in the eye.
NOELLE
He's not coming back. But it's
gonna be okay. He put the pieces
together, it's like...
M
The best of all possible worlds.
Noelle taps her nose.
96.
BEN
Honey? Is it supposed to stick
like this?
Sharing a look...
M
We should help him.
Noelle agrees.
They head over to assist.
We MOVE ACROSS the family as they work on the pancakes,
Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be.
We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey
pancakes, and a good life.
FADE OUT.
THE END

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL
The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between S
and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to
shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that
involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.
So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be
intercutting the best of all these moments to create one
sequence.
