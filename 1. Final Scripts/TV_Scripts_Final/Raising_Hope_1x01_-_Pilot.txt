      FADE IN:

1EXT. ABANDONED LOT -- MORNING1

      An old beat up van is parked in an abandoned lot.  A motley
      group of ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS walk by on their way to
      school.  One of them throws a rock at the van.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

2INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS2

      The back of the van appears empty as we hear the rock hit
      the side and JIMMY bolts up into frame.  Jimmy is 25 and
      hungover.  He yawns and goes to scratch his head revealing
      that an empty forty ounce bottle of beer is duct taped to
      his hand.  He looks at it curiously and then sees that his
      other hand is taped to a bottle as well. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

3EXT. ABANDONED LOT -- CONTINUOUS3

      We hear kicking against the inside of the van for a beat and
      then the door opens.  On the sidewalk in front of the
      abandoned lot we see a cute woman in her early twenties,
      SABRINA, waiting for the bus in her IHOP waitress uniform. 
      She hears the noise and looks over.  Jimmy gets out the van,
      turns and tries to close the door with his feet.  Eventually
      he succeeds.  As Jimmy crosses to the sidewalk he notices
      Sabrina and makes his way over to her.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Hi.

                                      SABRINIA
                          (beat)
                    Hello.  Why do you have bottles taped
                    to your hands?

                                      JIMMY
                    I'm not sure.  I'm actually heading
                    to work and I'm hoping a guy there
                    can answer that question.

      The bus pulls up. 

                                      SABRINA
                    Good luck.

      She starts to get on the bus.                                                                                          2



                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, uh... what's your name?

                                      SABRINA
                    You just crawled out of a van and
                    you don't know why you have bottles
                    taped to your hands.  I'm not going
                    to tell you my name.

      Sabrina gets on the bus.

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't argue with that.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

4EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- LATER4

      Jimmy approaches MIKE who putting supplies in the back of a
      truck that reads, "Pool Cleaning By Chance".  Mike, an unkempt
      fairly oblivious guy in his early twenties, spots him.

                                    MIKE
                    Jimmy, where you been?  I bought you
                      a breakfast taquito but I ate it,
                    like, two houses ago.  There's still
                    half a Yoo Hoo and some circus peanuts
                    in the truck if you're hungry.

                                      JIMMY
                    Why do I have bottles taped to my
                    hands?

                                    MIKE
                    You don't remember?  It was hilarious. 
                    I also put make-up on you.  I had
                    you telling everyone at the bar you
                    were Edward Forty Hands. 

      Mike takes out an iPhone and shows it to Jimmy.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Check it out.

      Mike plays a video of Jimmy drunk, wearing white make-up,
      mascara and black lipstick and drinking from the bottles
      taped to his hands.

                                      JIMMY
                    How did I get the make-up off my
                    face?

                                    MIKE
                    Wait for it.                                                                                          3



      On the video we see Jimmy passed out as a big dog licks his
      face and mouth.

                                      JIMMY
                    Gross.  
                          (then)
                    Where did you get an apple phone?

                                    MIKE
                    Found it.  People keep calling and
                    asking for Derek.

      BURT CHANCE, a man in his early forties, comes out of the
      backyard carrying a pool skimmer. 

                                    BURT
                    Go home, Jimmy.

                                      JIMMY
                    Why?

                                    BURT
                    You're fired.  Third time this week
                    you're late and it's only Wednesday. 
                    Your drinking is becoming a problem.

                                      JIMMY
                    What are you talking about?  You
                    were drinking with me.  You made me
                    have a chugging contest with you.
                          (re: Mike)
                    He was drinking too.  He taped bottles
                    to my hands.

                                    BURT
                    But we made it to work on time, Jimmy. 
                    We can handle ourselves.

                                      JIMMY
                    So you're firing me because I'm not
                    as good of a functioning alcoholic
                    as you?

                                    BURT
                    Hey, watch the name calling.  You're
                    not an alcoholic if you can get to
                    work on time.  

      Burt gets in the truck.  Mike's iPhone rings.

                                    MIKE
                          (into phone)
                    Hello.  
                          (beat)
                    No he is not, can I take a message?                                                                                          4



      Mike gets in the truck and they drive off.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

5EXT. CRAPPY HOUSE -- LATER5

      A little pink car that has "Merry Maids" on the side is
      sitting in front of a crappy little house.  There are two
      Latina women in maids' uniforms in the front seat and one in
      the back.  Jimmy walks up the sidewalk behind them, bottles
      still on his hands.  The maid behind the wheel lays on the
      horn like it wasn't the first time.  Jimmy's forty-one-year-
      old mother, VIRGINIA, exits the house through the screen
      door.  She's wearing a maid's uniform and smoking.    

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (to herself)
                    Keep your skirt on.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, Mom.

      Jimmy walks past Virginia and towards the house.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    What are you doing home?

                                      JIMMY
                    I got fired.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (disgusted)
                      Unbelievable.  
                          (then)
                    Don't touch the TV.  I got the VCR
                    Plus set to record "Family Feud."  

      Virginia gets in the back seat of the car.  She rolls down
      the window so she can smoke.

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    What the devil are you ladies in
                    such a hurry for?  You know we're
                    going to scrub toilets, right?  

      She takes a drag and blows it out the window.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

6INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER6

      Jimmy crosses through.  We see a woman in her eighties, MAW
      MAW, sitting in a metal folding chair smoking a cigarette. 
      She's wearing orange pants and a bra.                                                                                          5



                                      JIMMY
                    You forgot your shirt again, Great
                    Maw Maw.

                                    MAW MAW
                          (waves him off)
                      Ahhhhhhhh.

      Jimmy exits down the hall.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

7INT. JIMMY'S BEDROOM -- LATER7

      The second verse of "Fortunate Son" by CCR plays as Jimmy
      enters and plops down on the bed.  We TIME DISSOLVE to see
      him doing the following things throughout the day: he uses
      his teeth to get the bottles off his hands, he plays his
      acoustic guitar, he throws a tennis ball against the wall,
      he plays his acoustic guitar, he heats up a plate of
        marshmallows in a microwave; he puts one in his mouth but
      it's too hot, he plays his acoustic guitar, he plays an old
      Nintendo.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:

8INT. HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT8

      Virginia, in a very casual outfit, bangs on Jimmy's door a
      few times.  Jimmy answers wearing tighty-whities and large
      headphones that are connected to a stereo.  He holds his
      acoustic guitar.  We can hear the faint sound of a Michael
      McDonald song.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Your father's home.  Come eat.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

9INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER9

      Jimmy, now dressed, sits down at the table.

                                      JIMMY
                    Dad.

      We see that his Dad is Burt, his boss that we met earlier.

                                    BURT
                    Jimmy.

      Also at the table is Mike, Jimmy's cousin.  Virginia puts
      down a frozen dinner in front of each of them.  Burt and
      Mike also have beers in front of them.  Burt picks up the
      salt and salts his food for a long time.                                                                                          6



                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                          (re: Mike)
                    Your cousin and I had to work our
                    tails off without your help today.

                                      JIMMY
                    I didn't tell you to fire me.

                                    BURT
                          (mocking)
                    I didn't tell you to fire me.

      Maw Maw, with a shirt on, walks through the kitchen smoking
        a cigarette.  She crosses to the fridge.

                                      VIRGINA
                    You gonna eat with us, Maw Maw?

                                    MAW MAW
                          (waves her off)
                      Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

      Maw Maw grabs a jar of pickles out of the fridge and exits.  

                                    BURT
                    Why do you make your grandmother a
                    dinner every night?  All that crazy
                    bat ever eats is pickles.

                                      VIRGINIA
                      Shhhhhhhh.  You better watch your
                    tongue if you want her to leave us
                    this house after God takes her. 

      Virginia takes Maw Maw's dinner and her own to the sink,
      dumping out all but the two bites she took.

                                    BURT
                    I wish He would hurry up and do it. 
                    How long can a eighty-five-year-old
                    woman live on pickles and nicotine?

      Virginia opens the freezer.  The inside of the freezer is
      mostly built up frost on the sides.

                                      VIRGINIA
                      Doggone-it.  We're out of bubble gum
                    ice cream.  Burt you gotta go to the
                    store.

                                    BURT
                    I'm not driving anywhere.  I'm knee
                    deep into a twelve pack.                                                                                          7



                                      VIRGINIA
                    Well, I'm not going.  I'm already in
                    my house clothes for the night.  But
                    somebody needs to get me my ice cream
                    or I'm gonna be in a mood.

      Virginia exits.  

                                      VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Maw Maw, put that down.  That's not
                    food.

      Burt looks at Mike.

                                    BURT
                    Is your driver's license still
                      suspended?

                                    MIKE
                    Yep.  They won't even tell me for
                    how long until they pull that jeep I
                    hit out of the lake.  I told them no
                    one was in it but--      

      The iPhone sitting on the table rings.  Mike pushes the
      speaker phone button.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Hello?  

                                      DEREK (O.S.)
                    Hello?  Who is this?  You've got my
                    phone.

                                    MIKE
                    Oh, hi Derek.  
                          (pulls out a piece of
                            paper)
                    Listen, your dentist called to remind
                    you you have an appointment on Monday
                    and Jill needs you to call her A-S-
                    A... 
                          (looking at the paper)
                    I think that's a B or a T.

                                      DEREK (O.S.)
                    Thanks.  Can I get my phone back?

                                    MIKE
                      Mmmmmmmmm, yeah, I don't see that
                      happening.

      Mike hangs up the phone.  Burt turns to Jimmy.                                                                                          8



                                    BURT
                    Will you go get your mother's ice
                    cream?  I don't feel like dealing
                    with her tonight.

                                      JIMMY
                    Can I have my job back?

                                    BURT
                          (beat)
                    Fine.

      Jimmy gets up and exits.  After a beat the iPhone rings.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm gonna let voicemail get that.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

10INT. VAN -- LATER10

      Tight on a quart of bubble gum ice cream on the dash.  We
      widen to see Jimmy driving.  He pops in a cassette tape.

                                      JIMMY
                          (singing)
                    Meet me in the middle of the night,
                    let me hear you say, everything's
                    all right.  Let me smell the moon in
                    your perfume.

      He stops at a stop sign and a woman in her thirties, LUCY,
      frantically runs in front of the van and hops in.

                                    LUCY
                    Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!

      Jimmy takes off, looks to see what they are running from and
      spots a GUY running after them.  

                                      JIMMY
                          (panicked)
                    Who is that guy?

      Lucy scurries to the back of the van and looks out the window.

                                    LUCY
                    Nice try, jerk!

                                      JIMMY
                    Is he gone?  What's happening?  What's
                    going on?  What, what's going on...
                    right here.  Hello?

      Lucy comes back to the front of the van.                                                                                          9



                                    LUCY
                    Oh, my god.  This is so crazy.  You
                    like, saved my life!

                                      JIMMY
                    Really?  I... what?

                                    LUCY
                    You totally just saved my life!

                                      JIMMY
                    Wow. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Jimmy pulls into his yard and parks.

12INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS12

      High on adrenaline, Lucy stares at Jimmy.

                                    LUCY
                    You're like a hero.  And you're cute.

                                      JIMMY 
                    Really?

                                    LUCY
                    Yeah.  You saved my life and you're
                    cute.

      She pulls Jimmy into the back of the van.  He smiles.

                                      JIMMY
                    Well, this is fantastic.

      She pulls him out of frame.  After a beat, a pair of jeans
      knocks the ice cream off the dash.  We're tight on the ice
      cream as it melts while the sun comes up.  The camera pulls
      back and Jimmy sits up into frame.  His hair is a mess.  He
      looks to see that he's alone.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

14INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER14

      Still waking up, Jimmy comes in the front door to find Lucy
      sitting at the table with Mike and Burt watching the news. 
      Virginia is cooking breakfast.  Mike is staring at Lucy.

                                    LUCY
                    There's the hero.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Pull up a chair, sleepy head.  Your
                    new friend's been explaining the
                    news to us.

                                    BURT
                    She can pronounce that nutty Iran 
                    guy's name.  Say it again.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You got a smart one here, Jimmy.

                                      JIMMY
                          (still confused)
                    Yeah.

                                    MIKE
                    She's pretty too.

                                    LUCY
                          (embarrassed)
                    Stop it.

      Mike takes a picture with Lucy with his iPhone.   Jimmy looks
      over to see that it's one of many that Mike is scrolling
      through.  Jimmy smacks him.

                                      JIMMY
                    Stop it.

                                    LUCY
                    Virginia, do you mind if I use your

                    sink during the second flush or you're
                    gonna have to give it a third go

                    And the good liquid hand soap is
                    under the sink cause the cat used to
                    knock it over all the time.  The cat
                    died but I still keep it under there
                    to remind me of her.  
                          (fondly)
                    Calico.  Would cuddle right up next
                    to you.

                                    LUCY
                    Got it.
                          (to Jimmy)
                    Be right back.

      Lucy gives Jimmy a very long kiss as everyone stares.  Jimmy's
      eyes are open and he's very aware of everyone in the room. 
      Finally she exits to the bathroom, smacking him on the butt
      as she goes.

                                    BURT

      Burt nods, impressed.  Virginia dumps some bacon out of a
      frying pan onto Burt's plate.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    I like her, Jimmy.  
                          (don't mess it up)
                    I like her a lot.

                                      JIMMY
                    Did she mention what her name was or
                    who that guy was that was chasing
                    her last night?

      Burt puts some bacon in his mouth but it's too hot.

                                    BURT
                    Ow.  She said you guys met at the
                    store.  Said she dropped her groceries
                    and you helped her pick 'em up.

      Burt goes to eat the bacon again.

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Ow.

                                      JIMMY
                    She said what?                                                                                        12



      Mike points to the TV that's behind Jimmy.

                                    MIKE
                    Her name's Lucy.

      Jimmy turns to look at the TV.  Lucy's picture is on the
      screen with her name under it, Lucy Carlyle.

                                      NEWSCASTER
                    This morning police are searching
                    for this woman, Lucy Carlyle aka
                    Joan Doyle aka Selma Wrightsdale. 
                    Carlyle, is wanted for murder in
                    multiple cases.

      We see a POLICEMAN being interviewed.

                                      POLICEMAN
                    She kills her boyfriends.  Two so
                    far.  We've been trying to catch her
                    but she keeps changing her name. 
                    She's tricky.  

      On the TV we see an interview of the man who was chasing
      Lucy when Jimmy picked her up.

                                    MAN
                    She snuck up behind me and tried to
                    choke me with a pair of shoelaces. 
                    She was screaming something about
                    how I forgot her birthday.  Luckily
                    the shoelaces broke.  I chased her
                    for a few blocks but then she jumped
                    into van with some guy.
                          (into camera)
                    Good luck, dude.  Her birthday is
                    May 12th.  I'd buy a card now.

      The newscaster address the camera.  In the house we hear a
      flush.  Everyone stares at each other for a beat. 

                                      NEWSCASTER
                    Anyone with information about the
                      whereabouts of Lucy Carlyle should
                    contact police immediately.  

      We hear a second flush.

                    And remember, she may look sweet but
                    she is extremely dangerous.

      Lucy enters and sits back down at the table next to Jimmy. 
      She starts to eat her breakfast.                                                                                        13

                    crook with a long list of wrongs he
                    was making amends for has finally
                    finished.  And you'll never guess
                    how it ended.

      Virginia picks up the little TV and smashes it over Lucy's
      head.  She goes down.

                    Just kidding.  We share a vent with
                    the bakery.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh, yeah, that's right.  They make
                    those cookies here.  They're good.

                                    DANA
                    Yep.  They let us take home the broken
                    ones.  Big trash bags full of 'em.

      They stop at a door and Dana opens the slot.  After seeing
      an empty cell for a beat, Lucy pops her head in the hole.

                                    LUCY
                    Hey sweetie.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey.                                                                                        14



                                    LUCY
                    You miss me?

                                      JIMMY
                    Uh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Is that what
                    you needed to talk about?

      A buzzer sounds.

                                    LUCY
                    Recess!

                                      JIMMY
                    What?

      Dana starts to unlock the door.  Jimmy backs away.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?

                                    DANA
                    She gets an hour a day to exercise
                    in the cage.

      The door opens and Lucy faces away so Dana can cuff her.

                                    LUCY
                    An hour?  You better check with the
                    warden.  I get an hour and a half.

      Lucy turns revealing that she's six months pregnant.

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                    An hour for me, and a half hour for
                    me and Jimmy's baby.

      Lucy crosses off.  Jimmy is confused.

                                    DANA
                    From the look on you face I'm gonna
                    be guessing you're Jimmy.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

16EXT. PRISON EXERCISE CAGE -- LATER16

      Lucy is inside the cage doing deep knee bends.  Jimmy watches.

                                    LUCY
                    I don't expect anything from you.  I
                    just wanted you to know you were
                    gonna be a dad.  I thought that was
                    the right thing to do.  I may have
                    killed a couple old boyfriends but
                    I'm not a monster.                                                                                        15



      Lucy starts to do lunges and Jimmy walks with her long the
      outside of the cage.  He moves up and down as she does. 

                                      JIMMY
                    Well, I appreciate you not expecting
                    anything from me.  Not that I don't
                    want to have a baby one day.  I do. 
                    But not until I get a record deal. 
                    I play the guitar.  I've written a
                    bunch of songs but I can't seem to
                    master playing and singing at the
                    same time.  It's actually harder
                    than it looks.  It's like rubbing
                    your stomach and patting your head. 
                    Anyway, point is, I'm not ready for
                    a baby right now.

                                    LUCY
                    Tell me about it.  If I was on the
                    outside I'd be screwed.  Luckily
                    women have babies in here all the
                    time.  They got a nursery, cribs,
                      clothes... Prison babies got it made.  

      Lucy gets up and steps closer to Jimmy.

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                    And you know what the best part of
                    it is?  I'm supposed to get the
                    electric chair in eleven months. 
                    But that was before they knew I was
                    pregnant.
                          (smiles)
                    No way they're killing a mother of a
                      eight-month-old baby.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

17INT. PRISON -- DAY17

      Jimmy has an EIGHT-MONTH-OLD BABY in a Baby Bjorn.  The camera
      circles him revealing that he is in a room across from Lucy
      who is in an electric chair.  As the camera pans around him,
      we lose sight of Lucy and land back on Jimmy.  We hear a
      buzzing and Jimmy covers the baby's eyes as he averts his
      own.

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

18INT. PRISON -- CONTINUOUS18

      We hear the electric chair buzzing.  Still covering the baby's
      eyes, Jimmy looks down at the floor.  The buzzing stops. 
      Jimmy looks up and his eyes go wide.  She's alive.  A little
      smoke comes from the top of her head.

                                    LUCY
                      Whoooooooooooo!  How bout that
                    people!?  How about that?!  
                          (singing Pearl Jam)
                    Whoa, I, I, I, I'm still alive, yeah,
                    I, I, I, I'm still alive.

      Jimmy is perplexed.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

19INT. PRISON OFFICE -- LATER19

      Jimmy sits across from the warden who is on the phone.  A
      female office holds the baby.  Through glass we can see Lucy
      sitting in another room.  Her hair is a little burnt.

                                      WARDEN
                          (calm)
                    And who is supposed to double check
                    that?  
                          (beat)
                    Figures.  
                          (laughs)
                    No, no, you can't fire family. 
                    Alright.  Don't worry about it. 
                    We'll get the next one.

      Warden hangs up the phone.

                                      WARDEN (CONT'D)
                    The wires were loose.  She didn't
                    get enough wattage to do the job. 

                                      JIMMY
                    So what happens now?  You gonna twist
                    the wires together and take another
                    shot at it?  I got pliers in my van.  

      Lucy bangs on the glass.  The warden hits a button on a
      speaker on the desk.                                                                                          17



                                    LUCY
                    I see you talking in there.  Just in
                    case you're thinking about flicking
                    the switch again you might want to
                    check the case of Willie Francis,
                      Louisiana, 1946.  After his botched
                    execution his attorney Bertand DeBlanc
                    argued that a second attempt would
                    be cruel and unusual punishment. 
                    Went all the way to the Supreme Court. 
                    They ruled against him five to four,
                    but that was before we had female
                    justices.  No way Ginsburg and
                    Sotomayor let me fry twice.

      The warden turns off the speaker.

                                      WARDEN
                    She spends a lot of time in the prison
                    library.  And she may be right.  The
                    lawyers are gonna have a field day
                    on this one.  In the meantime she's
                    not going anywhere.  You just worry
                    about taking care of your baby.

      The female officer brings the baby to Jimmy.

                                      JIMMY
                    I still have to take it?

                                      WARDEN
                    Well, you don't have to.  But she
                    did sign over custody to you.  

      Jimmy looks at the baby.  Lucy sees what's going on and bangs
      on the glass.  The warden pushes the button on the speaker.

                                    LUCY
                    Don't you take that baby.  That's my
                    baby.  God saved me for a reason and
                    I'm pretty sure it was to raise that
                    baby.  She belongs with her mother,
                    in prison. 

      The warden turns off the speaker and Lucy continues to bang
      on the window.

                                      WARDEN
                    It's your call.                                                                                         18



      Jimmy looks at the baby for a beat, as Lucy continues to
      bang on the glass in the background.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

20INT. LIVING ROOM -- MORNING20

      We see the baby lying on the couch and then we see Jimmy,
      Mike, Virginia and Burt staring down at her.

                                    MIKE
                    What's it's name?

                                      JIMMY
                    She named it Princess Beyonce but I
                    think I might change that.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (shaking her head)
                    Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. 
                    A baby.  Good Lord.  
                          (deep sigh)
                    You know where to get rid of it don't
                    you?

                                      JIMMY
                    What do you mean get rid of it?

      Virginia crosses to another part of the room and sits down
      in a chair.  Jimmy follows her.  Burt sits down in a chair.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You can leave it at the Fire Station. 
                    They won't even ask any questions. 
                    I heard there's a cashier down at
                    the dog track that drops off babies
                    at that place like dry cleaning.

                                    BURT
                    Is it Joan?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    April.  

                                    MIKE
                    This baby is pretty light.

      Jimmy looks over to see that Mike has lifted the baby up by
      one foot.  Jimmy crosses to him and puts the baby back on
      the couch.

                                      JIMMY
                    Put her down.  Put her down.  Don't
                    touch her.  You are not allowed to
                    touch her.                                                                                        19



      Maw Maw walks through eating a pickle.  She's only wearing
      pants and a bra again.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Shirt, Maw Maw.

                                    MAW MAW
                          (waves her off)
                      Ahhhhhhhhhh.

      Maw Maw spots the baby and looks at it.

                                    MAW MAW (CONT'D)
                    Who's is this?

                                      JIMMY
                    Mine.

      Maw Maw laughs and leans down to the baby.

                                    MAW MAW
                          (whispers)
                    Good luck, Baby.  You're gonna need
                    it.

      Maw Maw exits.

                                      JIMMY
                    Mom, I'm not getting rid of my
                    daughter.  If I didn't want her I
                    could have left her at the prison.

                                    BURT
                    You could've left it there and you
                    brought it home?  What's wrong with
                    you?

                                      JIMMY
                    It's a prison.  And her mother is a
                    murderer.  Call me crazy, but I
                    thought she might be a little better
                    off with me.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You can't keep it, Jimmy.  A baby
                    will dramastically change your life. 
                    How are you going to feed it, do you
                    have any baby food?  Do you have
                    clothes for it?  I bet you don't
                    even know where to go to get
                      reasonably priced portraits.

                                      JIMMY
                    I'll figure all that out.  I just
                    got her like an hour ago.                                                                                        20

                    How did you even get it home?  You
                    don't have a special seat.

                                      JIMMY
                    I put her in the bean bag in the
                    back of the van and drove real slow.

                                      JIMMY
                    But I'm gonna get one of those special
                    seats for her.  I'm gonna get her
                    lots of baby things. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                    With what money?

                                      JIMMY
                    I'll trade my stuff for it.  Pawn
                    shop's full of baby crap.  I just
                    need someone to watch her for like
                    an hour and I'll be right back.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You're not leaving that baby here.

                                      JIMMY
                    I have to.  I don't want to drive
                    with her again until I get the special
                    seat.  Even driving slow, the bean
                    bag slid around a lot on turns.

                    We're not helping you with this,
                    Jimmy.  That's the only way you'll
                    realize it's a stupid idea and go
                    drop it at the fire station.

21EXT. STREET -- DAY21

      Jimmy walks down the street with a shopping cart and holding
      a brown paper bag.  In the cart and on the bottom rack is
      his acoustic guitar, his microwave, his Nintendo, his stereo
      and some other items.  Also in the shopping cart, lying on
      some blankets is Princess Beyonce.  He spots the cute
      waitress, Sabrina, at the bus stop and stops.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Hi.

                          (thrown)
                    Hello.

      Sabrina looks into the shopping cart and sees Princess
      Beyonce.  She's concerned.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Why is there a baby in your shopping
                    cart?

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't hold her and push it at the
                    same time.

                                      SABRINA
                    Are you homeless?  

                                      JIMMY
                    No.

                                      SABRINA
                    Whose baby is that?

                                      JIMMY
                    It's mine.  I just don't have a
                    regular baby pusher thing yet because
                    I just got her a few hours ago.

                                      SABRINA
                          (not convinced)
                    Okay.

      Princess Beyonce starts to cry.  Jimmy reaches in the paper
      bag and takes out a yellow rubber glove filled with milk. 
      He puts it in Princess Beyonce's mouth and she sucks on it.                                                                                        22



                                      JIMMY
                    I don't have a bottle yet.  It's a
                    clean glove.  Right out of the
                    package.

      Sabrina just stares.

                    Excuse me?

                                      SABRINA
                    No.

      The bus pulls up.  

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Just promise me that's your baby.

                                      JIMMY
                      I promise.

      As Sabrina backs onto the bus she takes a picture of Jimmy
      with her phone in case he's a kidnapper.

      Virginia is vacuuming and two other maids are also cleaning. 
      A third maid, ISABELLE, is on the couch with her feet up and
      reading The New Yorker.  Virginia's cell phone rings.

      Virginia hangs up the phone.

                    Isabelle, you can have my relaxing
                    time when we're at the Dixon's house. 

      As Virginia exits, Isabelle glares at her as she deliberately
      slams the magazine on the coffee table.

      He's reading a copy of "What to Expect In The First Year."
      Princess Beyonce is in the stroller playing with a toy, which
      she drops.  Jimmy gives it back to her and she smiles.  He
      smiles back.  Virginia pulls up in a 1964 Dodge Dart.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      The car is still parked and Virginia is behind the wheel. 
      Princess Beyonce is in the car seat in the back behind the
      passenger seat.  The trunk is open.  Virginia looks at
      Princess Beyonce and shakes her head.  The trunk closes
      revealing Jimmy.  He hops in the front seat.

                    totally stole my shopping cart.
                          (then)
                    Guess what?  She smiled at me.  She
                    dropped her toy and she couldn't
                    reach it so I picked it up for her
                    and she totally smiled at me.  It
                    was like she knew I was there to
                    take care of her.  Pretty cool, huh?

                      Congratulations.  Your arms are longer
                    than hers.

                    Between holding down a job and doing
                    my church work, I barely find time
                    to spoil myself with a few cocktails
                    and some socializing.

                                      JIMMY
                    It's one time.  I won't bother you
                    again.  Now that I got the car seat
                    it's safe to have her in my van.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Your van doesn't have a back seat. 
                    Where are you gonna strap it in?

                    What do you mean "strap it in"?

      Virginia makes a left hand turn which causes the unstrapped
      car seat to tumble across the back seat and onto the floor.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    I can't believe you didn't strap it
                    in.

                                      JIMMY
                    I just thought you had to strap the
                    baby into the seat.  Not the seat to
                    the car.  I don't know how this stuff
                    works.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You know how gravity works, don't
                    you?

      Virginia starts to drive the car.

                                      JIMMY
                    Shut up.  She's fine.  She didn't
                    even cry.  And don't try and act all
                    smart.  The only reason you knew to
                    strap it in is because you already
                    had a baby.                                                                                        25

                    That's not true.  We didn't have
                    those kinds of safety things when
                    you were a baby.

                                      JIMMY
                    What are you talking about?  They
                    had car seats twenty-five years ago.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    I didn't say they didn't have them. 
                    I said we didn't have them.

      Virginia reaches to adjust the side view mirror.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Tight on the side view mirror as a hand moves it towards the
      driver.  We see a reflection of a A TEENAGE VIRGINIA who is
      driving the same car.  A TEENAGE BURT rides in the passenger
      seat drinking a beer.  THREE-YEAR-OLD JIMMY is jumping around
      in the back seat.  Virginia is preoccupied with looking at
      herself in the mirror.

      Virginia swerves and three-year-old Jimmy falls onto the
      floor of the back seat.

                    Jimmy, be careful you don't fall in
                    the hole.

      We see three-year-old Jimmy lying on the floor with his head
      next to a hole in the floor boards.  Then from underneath
      the car we see him sticking his head trough the hole.  He
      lowers it lower and lower until it's an inch from the road.

      Virginia stops the car.

                                      JIMMY
                    Why are we stopping?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Jimmy, you can't keep that baby. 
                    You gotta safe drop it.

      Jimmy looks to see that they are parked in front of the Fire
      Station.  There is a safe drop baby sign on the front.

                                      JIMMY
                    I'm not safe dropping my baby.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You don't know what you're doing.

                                      JIMMY
                          (re: book)
                    I'm learning.  And the more I read
                    the more I realize all the stuff you
                    did wrong.  You know you're not
                    supposed to smoke around babies?  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    That's only when you're pregnant,
                    stupid.  And I don't believe that
                    anyway.  I smoked with you and you're
                    fine.

                                      JIMMY
                    Fine?  I had asthma for the first
                    seventeen years of my life, I've got
                    seven permanent teeth that still
                    haven't come in and I'm allergic to
                    fruit.  How can you say I'm fine?

      Virginia stares at him for a beat, then throws the car into
      gear and starts driving.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You know, you complain a lot.  That's
                    an annoying habit.  No one likes to
                    listen to people complain all the
                    time.  And you're not allergic to
                    fruit, it just makes your throat
                    itch and your skin a little bumpy.                                                                                        27



                                      JIMMY
                    Just drop us off at work.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

28EXT. BACKYARD -- LATER28

      Burt is cleaning a pool.  Mike is mixing and pouring chemicals
      in the pool.  Jimmy enters pushing Princess Beyonce in a
      stroller and carrying the car seat.

                                    BURT 
                    You're late.

                                      JIMMY
                    I hit a few snags.

      Jimmy puts the car seat down and pulls the shade over the
      stroller to protect Princess Beyonce from the sun.

                                    BURT
                    Well, grab a skimmer and start getting
                    these leaves out of here.

      He does. 

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, Jimmy.  You ever worry that
                    thing is gonna grow up to be like
                    her mother?  All crazy.  Murdering
                    people and junk.

                                      JIMMY
                    No, I don't worry about that.

      As they talk Jimmy fishes leaves out of the pool with the
      skimmer; a net on a long metal pole.  Unbeknownst to Jimmy,
      the other end of the pole pokes into the inside of the
      stroller.  From inside the stroller we can see that it just
      misses Princess Beyonce's head before he pulls it back out.

                                    MIKE
                    I'd worry about that.  I'd worry
                    about that a lot.  Like, every time
                    I looked at her.  Which, actually,
                    is what I do.  

      Jimmy pulls more leaves out of the pool. The back of the
      pole enters the stroller and just misses Princess Beyonce's
      head on the other side.

                                      JIMMY
                    That's because you think too much,
                    Mike.  It makes you crazy.                                                                                        28



                                    MIKE
                    Thinking too much doesn't make you
                    crazy.  Crazy is a hermetitary thing.  

      Jimmy pulls more leaves from the pool and the back of the
      pole enters the stroller.  This time Princess Beyonce grabs
      it.  Jimmy walks down the side of the pool not knowing that
      he's pulling the stroller towards the pool as he goes.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Maybe she'll be smart.  Her mom might
                    be crazy but she's also smart.  Maybe
                    she'll get none of the crazy and all
                    of the smart.  Her little brain could
                    be working on the cure cancer for
                    all we know.

      As he walks down the side of the pool the stroller goes into
      the pool.  Jimmy turns, see this and dives into the pool.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

29INT. BURT'S TRUCK -- LATER29

      Princess Beyone is fine.  She is soaking wet and sitting in
      her car seat in the back seat next to Mike.  Burt drives. 
      Jimmy, also soaking wet, is sitting shotgun.  They all sit
      in silence for a beat.

                                    BURT
                    You're gonna go to jail if you kill
                    that baby.  You know that, right?

                                      JIMMY
                    I know.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm dying back here.  Can we turn on
                    the air conditioning?

                                      JIMMY
                    There's a wet baby in the back seat. 
                    We're not turning on the air
                      conditioning.

      Mike looks at the baby for a beat.                                                                                        29



                                    MIKE
                    You're turning out to be kind of a
                    high maintenance little bitch aren't
                    you, Princess Beyonce?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

30INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER30

      Burt, Virginia and Maw Maw are playing cards.  Mike is
      listening to his iPhone on the couch.  Princess Beyonce is
      lying on the floor.  Jimmy enters drying his hands.

                                    MAW MAW
                    Your baby stinks.

                                      JIMMY
                    What?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Your baby stinks.  

      Jimmy gets closer and smells her.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh, wow.  Alright, I'll change her. 
                    I knew I'd have to do this sooner or
                    later.  No big deal.  

      Jimmy holds her up and tries to keep her away from his face. 
      He passes Mike.

                                    MIKE
                    Dude, that's awful.  What did you
                    feed it?

                                      JIMMY
                    Mom and I stopped off at High's and
                    we all shared a Mountain Dew and a
                    bowl of chili.
                          (to Virginia)
                    You said it would be fine.

      Jimmy exits.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (calling after him)
                    It is fine.  What did you expect,
                    her poop not to stink?

                                    BURT
                    I thought you were only supposed to
                    give babies sodas that don't have
                    the caffeine in 'em.                                                                                        30



                                      VIRGINIA
                    Oh please.  That's just what the
                    people at 7UP want you to believe. 

      Virginia lays down a card.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

31INT. JIMMY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER31

      Jimmy enters carrying Princess Beyonce.  He puts her down on
      the bed which he has converted into a crib by putting milk
      crates against the sides that aren't pushed up against the
      wall.  He inspects the diaper that she's wearing.

                                      JIMMY
                    Okay, looks like we just use this
                    sticky tape on the sides.  Shouldn't
                    be too hard.

      Jimmy pulls the tape off the dirty diaper and pulls it down. 
      Upon seeing and smelling the contents in the diaper he
      immediately throws up on Princess Beyonce's chest. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

32INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY32

      Everyone is where we left them.  Jimmy hurries in.  We hear
      Princess Beyonce crying from the bedroom.

                                      JIMMY
                          (frantic)
                    I need paper towels, I need paper
                    towels, I need paper towels.

      He heads into the kitchen.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    What happened?

                                      JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I threw up on the baby.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You what?

      Jimmy hurries back down the hall with a long trail of paper
      towels.                                                                                        31



                                      JIMMY
                    I threw up on the baby.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

33INT. JIMMY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS33

      Jimmy comes in and tries to wipe the baby off without looking
      at or smelling the puke and crap.  He gags as he does. 
      Virginia enters.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You have got to be kidding me.  How
                    in the world...

      Virginia sees the mess and throws up on her as well.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Jimmy, people have to get up and go
                    to work tomorrow.  You gotta get
                    that baby to shut up now.

                    Don't know what to tell you.  Why
                    don't you move your tent out of the
                    laundry room and put it in the front

                                      JIMMY
                          (snapping)
                    Mike, you're not helping.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

38INT.  JIMMY'S BEDROOM -- LATER38

      The clock says 5:48.  Jimmy is walking back and forth with a
      crying Princess Beyonce.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Listen, I'm gonna put you back on
                    the bed but only because if I don't 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        33



                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm afraid I'm gonna drop you.  My
                    arms are so tired.  I don't lift
                    weights.  This is hard for me.

      He puts Princess Beyonce back in the crib and she continues
      to cry.  He straightens out his arms very slowly and in pain.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                      Ahhhhhhhhhh.  

      Virginia and Burt enter.  Burt is half asleep and carrying
      an acoustic guitar.  Burt sits on a chair and Virginia crosses
      to the bed.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?

      Virginia waves Jimmy off and leans over the bed.  Burt starts
      to play the guitar.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (sings)
                    People smile and tell me I'm the
                    lucky one, 
                          (to Jimmy)
                    This used to work with you.
                          (singing)
                    ...and we've just begun, Think I'm
                    gonna have a son. 
                          (to Jimmy)
                    Dim the lights.

      Jimmy does.

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                          (singing)
                    He will be like he and me, as free
                    as a dove, conceived in love, Sun is
                    gonna shine above.

      Princess Beyonce stops crying.  Impressed, Jimmy tries to
      look but Virginia pushes him back.  She motions for him to
      leave the room.  He watches her as he goes.

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    And even though we ain't got money,
                    I'm so in love with you honey, And
                      everything will bring a chain of
                    love.                                                                                        34



      Virginia puts her hand on the baby.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

39INT. SAME BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- 198439

      We are tight on the baby as a hand touches it.  It's BABY
      JIMMY.  We widen to see that TEENAGE VIRGINIA is singing to
      Baby Jimmy.  TEENAGE BURT plays the guitar nearby.  The room
      is dressed differently.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    And in the morning when I rise, you
                    bring a tear of joy to my eyes, and
                    tell me everything is gonna be
                    alright.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

40INT. BEDROOM -- BACK TO SCENE40

      Jimmy watches Virginia rub Princess Beyonce's back as Burt
      continues to play softly on the guitar.  She turns and sees
      that Jimmy is still there.  She motions with her hand for
      him to leave.  He does.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

41EXT. HOUSE -- LATER41

      Jimmy sits on the porch.  Virginia comes out and sits down
      as well.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    She's asleep.

                                      JIMMY
                    Thanks.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You ready to admit you're not cut
                    out for this?  

                                      JIMMY
                    It was the first day.  I'm not
                    dropping her off at the fire station
                    after one day.  What makes you so
                    sure someone else can do better than
                    me anyway?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Jimmy, you almost killed it twice
                    and we both threw up on it.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        35



                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    I'm not sure that baby wouldn't be
                    better off being raised by a rabid
                    pack of pedophile meth-heads.

      Burt comes out of the house with two mugs of coffee.  He
      gives one to Virginia.

                                      JIMMY
                    If giving away your baby is such a
                    good idea, why didn't you guys do it
                    when you had me?  You didn't know
                    what you were doing.  Why did you
                    keep me?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Because we were stupid.  And selfish. 
                    We should have given you away.  You
                    probably would have had a better
                    life.  

                                    BURT
                    Probably would have graduated high
                    school.  Gone to college.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Maybe you'd even be able to eat fruit.

      They sit for a beat.

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, well, I like my life.  And
                    fruit's overrated anyway.  It's mostly
                    sugar.  That's what the baby book
                    says.  Vegetables.  That's what you're
                    supposed to eat. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Ugh.  I don't eat nothing that comes
                    out of the ground.  That's just dirty.

      They sit for a bet.

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't do this without you guys.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    It's not that we don't want to help
                    you, Jimmy.  We can't.  We don't
                    know what we're doing either.

                                      JIMMY
                    It sure looked like you knew what
                    you were doing in there.                                                                                        36



                                      VIRGINIA
                    We sang a song.  Anyone can sing a
                    song.  Charles Manson can sing a
                    song. 

                                    BURT
                    He's actually pretty darn good. 
                    Mike has his album. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                    He is good.  But that doesn't mean
                    you want him helping you raise your
                    child.  
                          (then)
                    Jimmy, what is it with this baby? 
                    Are you afraid people are gonna look
                    at you differently if you give it
                    away?  No one's gonna look at you
                    any differently.  No one expects you
                    to take care of it.

                                      JIMMY
                    That's the problem, Mom.  I want
                    people to look at me differently. 
                    I'm sick of people looking at me
                    like I don't have a purpose.  I want
                    people to look at me like that baby
                    does.  Like I'm someone special. 
                    This is chance for me to do something
                    good.
                          (beat)
                    It's a chance for all of us to do
                    something good.

      Virginia and Burt share a look.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Well, always did think I could have
                    done better with a girl.

                                    BURT
                    And they do say you learn by your
                    mistakes.  We've already made every
                    mistake there is.

      Virginia and Burt chuckle.  Jimmy waits for an answer.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    What are we gonna name it?  I'm not
                    taking my granddaughter to church
                    with a name like Princess Beyonce.

                                      JIMMY
                    I don't know.  What do you think?                                                                                        37



                                      VIRGINIA
                          (thinks, then)
                    I always liked Hope.

                                      JIMMY
                    Then, Hope it is.

      They sit for beat.  The camera starts to very slowly pull
      out and continues to do so during the following.  The Loggins
      Messina version of Danny's song starts to play. 

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    I saw that girl at the bus stop again.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    The waitress?

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah.

                                    BURT
                    How did she look?

                                      JIMMY
                    Great.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You need to grow a pair and take a
                    serious run at that.  We could use
                    another woman around here to help us
                    keep this baby alive.

                                      JIMMY
                    She thinks I'm a homeless kidnapper.

                                    BURT
                    Well, think how happy she'll be when
                    she finds out you're normal.

      As the sun comes up over the house the music continues to
      play and Maw Maw hurries out of the house in her bra and
      pants.  She runs down the street.

                                      JIMMY
                    I got her.

      Jimmy starts after her, passing Mike sleeping in his tent in
      the front yard as he goes.  A newspaper is thrown onto
      sidewalk from a passing car.  On the front page is a picture
      of Lucy with the headline, "Execution Botched.  Lawyers vow
      to get client released."

                                                                                FADE OUT.
