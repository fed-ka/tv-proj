  INT. RACETRACK / BETTING WINDOWS - DAY11

  CLOSE ON THOROUGHBREDS racing down the homestretch.

  As the crowd cheers the finish in the BG, we find DANNY 
  ROBERTS (20, nerdy/hip) at his regular WINDOW, making notes 
  in a MOLESKINE NOTEBOOK.  He pushes A HUNDRED DOLLARS through 
  to a grandfatherly BETTING TELLER.

                              DANNY
                Hundred on Buckey s Folly.  To win.

                                TELLER
                  Hundred... Some streak you re on, 
                huh, Danny.

                              DANNY
                        (distracted, writing)
                Sorry?

                                TELLER
                You re really picking winners... 
                Seems like you can t lose this 
                week.

  THE TICKET pops up from the metal slot in the counter.

                              DANNY
                Yeah... tweaked my system a little.  

  Teller looks, as Roberts takes the ticket, leaves.  

  Teller puts up a NEXT WINDOW sign and exits...

  Danny stops at the CONCESSION STAND, buys a BEER.  NUMB3RS  #306/43  "Longshot"  GOLDENROD Rev  9-12-06     2.



  INT. RACETRACK / VIP LOUNGE - NOT LONG AFTERA2A2

  IVAN TABAKIAN (40, E. European, shaved head) sits with his 
  CREW at a table.  He s a major player in an L.A. crime 
  syndicate with a lethal reputation.  His men laugh at his 
  joke; and they d laugh whether or not it s funny.

  The Teller arrives, speaks to a BODYGUARD...

  The Bodyguard pushes MONEY into the Teller s hand.  The 
  Teller leaves...

  The Bodyguard crosses to Tabakian at his table, whispers into 
  his ear...

  Tabakian breaks off his story and nods to TWO OF HIS CREW 
  ( GARRY ,  ANDRE , E.European).  They get up, leave...

  Off Tamazarian, picking up his story...

  EXT. RACETRACK - NOT LONG AFTER22

  ON HORSES AND JOCKEYS loading into the STARTING GATES.

  DANNY ROBERTS finds a spot near the rail along the home-
  stretch, holding a rolled up copy of the DAILY RACING FORUM. 

  The BELL SOUNDS.  The horses leap from the gates and race 
  down the track.  

  WE PICK UP GARRY moving through the crowds in front of the 
    bleachers, ignoring the race.

                                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                      (over the PA)
                ...on the rail, Saddlepoint leads 
                into the turn.  Factory Bound is 
                second.  At the back, Buckey s 
                Folly, the longshot, swings wide to 
                the outside...

  ON ROBERTS, watching the horses come around the final turn.

                                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                  Saddlepoint leads down the 
                  homestretch.  Factory Bound is 
                giving ground.  But on the inside, 
                here comes the longshot...   

  ANDRE steps in behind Roberts, nods to someone off-screen.

  THE CROWD CHEERS in the BG.  ANDRE steps in, pins Roberts  
  arms to his back, holds him as...  

  GARRY STABS ROBERTS TWICE with quick, brutal efficiency.

                                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                At the wire, it s Buckey s Folly by 
                a nose!

  Roberts drops his beer.  GARRY slides him to the ground.  The 
  men fade into the oblivious crowd.

33INT. LARRY S OFFICE - DAY 

  LARRY is pounding a melancholy beat on a big TAIKO DRUM.

  CHARLIE enters.  Watches for a beat.

                              CHARLIE
                What are you doing?

                              LARRY
                Did you know that primitive 
                  societies believed they could use 
                  percussion as a means of 
                  communicating with the dead.

                              CHARLIE
                Drumming for someone in particular?

                              LARRY
                  Actually, I m hoping for some 
                  inspiration.

                              CHARLIE
                Banging bongos worked for Richard 
                Feynman.

                              LARRY
                Maybe I should switch instruments.

                              CHARLIE
                Are you still stuck on the Quantum 
                  Synchronization?  I could try to 
                help.

                              LARRY
                Thank you, Charles.  I will need 
                your help eventually, but I m still 
                mired in the early stages of 
                conceptual framework.  

                              CHARLIE
                Mired.  Since when do you get 
                mired?  

                              LARRY
                I know.  I know.  And I m worried 
                this is a problem I cannot merely 
                drum away.

                              CHARLIE
                What about a good soak in the tub?

                              LARRY
                I m afraid even water has its 
                  limitations.  In certain matters of 
                the heart... 

                              CHARLIE
                Megan...

                              LARRY
                She s exciting and she is 
                  beautiful.  But this thing between 
                us is affecting my work.

                              CHARLIE
                What is going on between you two?

  Larry paces.  Thinking a beat.

                              LARRY
                I m not exactly sure.

                              CHARLIE
                You never work well with emotional 
                  uncertainty...

                              LARRY
                You think that could extend to my 
                  emotional life as well...

                              CHARLIE
                  Honestly, I m not as familiar with 
                that side of you, Larry.

  The infield is taped off.  The ME is bagging ROBERTS  BODY.  
  SHERIFF S DEPUTIES stand the perimeter.  FBI Crime Techs work 
  the scene. 

  We find COLBY briefing DON.  

                              COLBY
                No real witnesses.

                When it happened, the longshot was 
                winning in a photo finish.  
                  Everybody was focused on the race.  
                This was on the body...

                We found that notebook with the 
                body... From the looks of it, seems 
                like this kid, Danny Roberts, may 
                be helping Tabakian.

                              DON
                Notebook with some equations,

55INT. CHARLIE S OFFICE - DAY 

  Larry and Charlie are standing around Larry s big Taiko drum.

                Explain to me why your drum has to

                Hey Larry, come have a look at 
                this.  It s a category-based 
                approach to... I m not sure what 
                  exactly...

  Larry scoots away from Megan.  Takes the notebook.

                              CHARLIE
                But it s a forecasting system, 
                right?  Very sophisticated.

  Larry flips through the pages.

                              LARRY
                This is more than just sophisticated, 
                Charles.  This reminds me of a topos

                              CHARLIE

                If so, this approach is counter-

                    Counter-intuitive?

  Larry wanders over to his drum, starts tapping on it 
    pensively, WILLIAM TELL S OVERTURE (THE LONE RANGER S THEME).

                              CHARLIE
                Well yeah... If you re forecasting 
                a horse race, you would normally

  Charlie taps an echo to Larry s rhythm on the desktop.

                  According to some of your tellers, 
                he was a regular.

                You re suggesting his death had 
                  something to do with my racetrack?

1212INT. CHARLIE S OFFICE - DAY 

  Charlie talks to Don and Warner.  He has the NOTEBOOK open on 
  his desk.

                              CHARLIE
                I think I know why Danny Roberts put 
                so much time into picking second 
                place finishers.  He designed a 
                system that identifies arbitrage 
                  opportunities.

                              WARNER
                What does that mean?

                              DON
                Give him a minute.

                              CHARLIE
                It means he was looking for 
                  bargains.  

                              WARNER
                  Bargains?

                Charlie.  A little focus.

                              CHARLIE
                Okay, okay.  In parimutuel betting, 
                the odds fluctuate according to how 
                much is wagered on each horse.  It s 
                like an auction...

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION

  A CALLER AT A CATTLE AUCTION reels through the increasing

                to buy something...

  RANCHERS signal their bids.  The CALLER keeps upping the 
  price.

                The more expensive it becomes.

  Going once... twice... SOLD!

  EXIT VISION

                              CHARLIE
                In horse-racing, more expensive 
                  translates into lower odds.  In 
                other words, the lower the odds, the 
                smaller the return on the bet.

                                WARNER
                So the favorite is just the horse 
                with the most amount of money bet?

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly.  And because everyone is 
                focused on picking the winner, 
                there s an active exchange of 
                  information about the favorite.  
                Tips.  News.  Even rumors.  The 
                odds end up in line with the return 
                on the risk.  It s an efficient 
                market.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS  #306/43  "Longshot"  GOLDENROD Rev  9-12-06     19.

                              DON
                But for a horse no one s paying 
                  attention to...

                              CHARLIE
                The market can be highly 
                  inefficient.  That inefficiency 
                creates situations where the 
                  potential for reward outweighs the 
                risk.  Roberts was betting on those 
                  opportunities.

                              WARNER
                But that still doesn t explain how 
                Roberts won thirty straight bets?

                              CHARLIE 
                No, it doesn t. 
                      (a beat, thinking)
                Something had to change.  Either in 
                his system, or at the track.  

                              DON
                Whatever it was, it got him killed, 
                Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                Well, to figure that out, I m gonna 
                need data from races; test Roberts  
                system against recent results.

                              WARNER
                How recent?

                              CHARLIE

                people at the track.  He was too

  EXT. FBI / BRIDGE - MORNING1616

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUFFER:  Colby and Warner walking.

                              COLBY
                So you know Don pretty well?  

                              WARNER
                You know what Quantico s like.  You 
                get pretty close.  Even to the 
                  instructors.

                              COLBY
                Hadda be a pretty tough instructor, 
                I bet.

                              WARNER
                He was just back from the field...

                              COLBY
                Fugitive hunting?

                              WARNER
                Yeah.  And still getting used to 
                being back in civilization.
                      (a beat)
                Any reason you re asking? 

                              COLBY
                I screwed something up a while ago.

                              WARNER
                Well, I can tell you this much.  
                Fact you re still here, means 
                something.  But I wouldn t count on 
                being forgiven twice. 

  A beat, Colby considers his fate...

                              WARNER
                So Danny Roberts picks six winners 
                for a half a million dollars, but 
                doesn t cash the ticket?

                              COLBY
                Doesn t make sense.  His girlfriend 
                said he was borrowing rent money.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS  #306/43  "Longshot"  GOLDENROD Rev  9-12-06     23A.

                                WARNER
                Sounds like he was hiding the 
                winnings from someone...

  Colby stops, has an idea brewing.

                              COLBY
                Bet too, maybe...

                What do you mean?

                              COLBY
                He s at the track everyday, right?
                So why place a bet online through 
                an OTB when he could do it in 
                person?

                                WARNER
                Because he couldn t do it in 
                  person... 

                              COLBY
                Tellers all knew him...

                                WARNER
                So maybe he wasn t working for 
                  Tabakian? 

                              COLBY
                Which might explain why he s dead.

                We have been dealt a paradox of

1919EXT. RACETRACK - MORNING 

  CLOSE ON A STOP-WATCH.  A SINGLE HORSE breezes across the 
  finish line.  Trainers and handicappers note the time.  We 
  find Alan and Charlie.  Charlie has a LAPTOP balanced on the 
  rail.

                              CHARLIE
                Danny Roberts had a system designed 
                to pick the second-place horse...  

                              ALAN
                Because there s a bias in the 
                betting on second place.  You know 
                what you re doing, you can exploit 
                that.

                              CHARLIE

                So, handicapping... we re trying to 
                predict how a horse will run at the 
                distance of the current race.

                              ALAN
                Exactly.  We have to consider past 
                  performances, type of horse, track 
                  conditions, the experience of the 
                  jockey...

                              CHARLIE
                  Actually, we should consider a lot 
                more than that.  I d factor for 
                average race speed, interval pace, 
                wind speed, time of day, assigned 
                weights, gate slot, sun position--

                In my experience handicappers know 
                pretty much everything... That is,

                May I come in?

                              LARRY
                Yes, of course.  This is... 
                  unexpected.

                              MEGAN
                I should have called, but I wasn t 
                really sure I was coming, until I 
                got here.

  A beat.  A little awkward.

                              MEGAN
                Don said Charlie and Alan were at 
                the track.  You didn t go?

                              LARRY
                I find gambling on animals a messy 
                  business.  I much prefer cards.  
                There one finds an appreciable 
                  structure playing out in a graded 
                tensor product space.

                              MEGAN
                Sounds like structure s pretty 
                  important to you?

                              LARRY
                I sense that is a more than casual 
                inquiry.

                              MEGAN
                I m thinking what s going on 
                between us is pretty unstructured.

                It s an asymmetry between matter 
                and anti-matter emerging shortly 
                after the Big Bang--
                      (off Megan s look)
                Yes.  Things between us are fairly 
                  unstructured.

                I m wondering if that s why you 
                haven t called in a couple weeks.

  Another beat while Larry formulates a reply.

                              LARRY
                This... this Us.  It s a little 
                more distracting than I 
                  anticipated.

  Megan closes the distance between them.

                I would have thought a guy who 
                lives in his car wouldn t need that 
                much structure.

                              LARRY
                It would seem to be a workable 
                theory.  But in practice, I... I--

  She puts a finger on his lips.  He stops talking.

                              MEGAN

                              LARRY 
                I m not suggesting you are.

                              MEGAN
                But if it helps, I wouldn t be 
                opposed to a little structure.

                              LARRY
                You wouldn t?

                              MEGAN
                No, and if you can find a way past 
                the distractions, there s a

  EXT. RACETRACK - DAY2121

  Charlie talks with Don and Alan.

                              CHARLIE
                Originally Roberts system was 
                working just fine picking second 
                place finishers.  Then something 
                  happened...

                              DON
                What?

                              ALAN
                Cheating.  My idea actually.

                              CHARLIE
                So the horses who should have been 
                winning suddenly stopped winning. 
                Which threw off his ability to pick 
                the runners-up.  So he made an 
                  adjustment...

                              DON
                What kind of adjustment?

                              CHARLIE
                Well, he probably noticed that race 
                outcomes were consistently falling 
                outside the range of realistic 
                  probabilities.  It s like the 
                weather...

  END VISION

                              CHARLIE
                Roberts retooled his system to 
                account for the fact the races were 
                fixed.  And presto: produced thirty 
                straight winners.

                Charlie if this is true, then 
                Roberts  system could prove 
                Warner s theory of a gambling scam. 

                              ALAN
                Maybe exposing the cheating is what 
                got him killed.

                              CHARLIE
                Dad may be right.  See, I loaded 
                all the race data on my laptop, so 
                I was able to run every winning 
                Pick-Six bet from the past six 
                months through Roberts  algorithm.

                              DON
                And found what?

                              ALAN
                  A snowstorm in July.

                You ever get tired of this 
                  intellectual purity thing, I have 
                some brochures for a condo 
                  development.  They re great 
                  properties.  While back, I was 
                thinking about one for myself.

                              LARRY
                It s funny you should mention that.

                              ALAN
                How so?

                              LARRY
                I have been rethinking some of my 
                  assumptions with regards to pure, 
                  intellectual endeavor.

                You figured out grown women won t 
                make-out in the backseats of cars.

  Larry smiles.  A little at the joke.  A little at the truth 
  of it.

                              LARRY
                I think I may have lost touch with 
                certain important aspects of life

2626INT. EPPES  HOUSE / GARAGE - DAY 

  As usual, Charlie is scribbling on his boards.  Larry enters.

                              CHARLIE
                Don asked me to see if I could 
                connect the Pick-Six winners to 
                  Tabakian, but there isn t enough 
                data.

  Larry is distracted, doesn t answer.

                              CHARLIE
                Any data-mining algorithm would 
                require way more information than 
                we currently have...

  Larry is paying no attention, and Charlie finally notices.

                              CHARLIE
                Larry!

                              LARRY
                What?

                              CHARLIE
                Did you hear anything I just said?

                              LARRY
                You don t have enough data to 
                connect the people to your mob 
                boss.  

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly.

                              LARRY
                Then focus on the data you do have.  
                Maybe there s a way to connect them 
                through their bets.

  Larry goes back to his pacing.  Charlie stands stunned for a 
  beat.

                              CHARLIE
                Larry... That s brilliant.

  Larry waves it off, still not engaging.

                Charles, do you think I require 
                  structure?

                              CHARLIE
                What is with you?

                              LARRY
                Humor me.  Answer the question.

                              CHARLIE
                      (thinking out loud)
                Well, on the one hand, you don t 
                have a house.  But on the other 
                hand, you eat monochromatically...

  A beat, Charlie thinks.

                              CHARLIE
                Do you remember when I was an 
                  undergraduate in your Quantum 
                Physics class.

                              LARRY
                How could I forget?  You wrote a 
                  variation on Ed Witten s Heterotic 
                Duality that I m still trying to 
                grasp.

                              CHARLIE
                That class was the first place I 
                learned about the paradoxes between 
                quantum mechanics and general 
                  relativity.

                              LARRY
                Yes, the two great revelations in 
                modern physics create conceptual 
                problems when we attempt to 
                  intertwine them around a single 
                  explanation of gravity.  A unifying 
                theory is the brass ring for a 
                  physicist.
                      (a beat)
                What exactly are you suggesting?

                              CHARLIE
                That there s no unifying theory of 
                Larry Fleinhardt either.  We all 
                have our contradictions.

                So I may need structure in my 
                personal life even if I succeed in 
                my professional life without it?

                              CHARLIE

                private gravity.

  Larry turns to leave.

                There s a regular progression in

                I don t think we re looking at 
                more bodies.

                              DON
                So what are we looking at?

                              COLBY
                Well, in the first place, it s not 
                eighteen different people...  It s 
                six guys who won a lot of bets over 
                the course of the eighteen dates 
                that Charlie gave us.  

                              DON
                Six guys... 

                              COLBY
                They gotta be connected to Tabakian.

                Start on backgrounds.  Let s find 
                out how.

  Off Don,

  INT. EPPES  HOUSE / BATHROOM - NIGHT3030

  CLOSE ON LARRY.  Fully dressed, he s sitting on the edge of 
  the tub.  Lost in his thoughts...

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                Give up on the water cure?

  Startled, Larry looks up, sees...

  Alan standing in the doorway of the EPPES  BATHROOM.

                              LARRY
                It didn t seem to be helping.  And 
                I ran out of hot water.

                Here I am, yet again monopolizing 
                your bathroom.  I apologize.  

                              ALAN
                You take as long as you need...  

                              LARRY
                Thank you.

                              ALAN
                You alright?

                              LARRY
                The efforts I ve made to simplify 
                my life are becoming complicated.

                              ALAN
                You know, not too long ago, I was 
                worried about Charlie.  I wanted 
                him to be able to have a normal 
                life.  

                              LARRY
                  A challenging goal given the 
                  circumstances of his genius.

                              ALAN
                That s what I realized.  Normal may 
                not be the right target for 
                Charlie.  Maybe for you, simple is 
                off the mark.  

                              LARRY
                I can t recall it ever being 
                simple.

                              CHARLIE (O.S.)
                Larry?

                              LARRY
                In here.

  Charlie enters, head buried in the NOTEBOOK.

                              CHARLIE
                I need you to look at something for 
                me.
                      (looks up)
                Why are we all in the bathroom?

  Alan shrugs.  Charlie charges on, hands the notebook to 
  Larry.

                              LARRY
                What am I looking at?

                              CHARLIE
                That s my question.
                      (off Larry, confused)
                Look closely.  If you didn t know 
                that was evidence in an FBI 
                  investigation, what would say it 
                was.

                              LARRY
                I m still not sure I get what 
                you re asking...

                              CHARLIE
                Ignore the context of the murder 
                and maybe imagine the page a little 
                bigger, what does it look like?

                              LARRY
                It looks like a blue book one of my 
                teaching assistants has graded.

                              CHARLIE
                That s exactly what I thought. 

                              ALAN
                A blue book.  You mean one of those 
                things you guys use for student 
                exams?

                              CHARLIE
                I think someone was helping Danny 
                Roberts.  Someone who was checking 
                and improving his work.

                              LARRY
                He had an accomplice.

                              CHARLIE
                Who was very talented at math.

                knows about the cheating at the 
                  racetrack.

                                WARNER
                Which means we still have a witness

                  Girlfriend told Megan he worked 
                alone at the track.

                                WARNER
                Maybe whoever helped him wasn t at 
                the track...

  Inside, the place has been trashed.  BOOKCASES TURNED OVER,

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUFFER: It s a crime scene now.  The FBI 
  FORENSIC GUYS are busy.  Colby talks with Warner.  Megan is

                Locals are running a neighborhood 
                canvas.  But so far, nothing.

  Colby & Megan follow a manager down a mid-scale hotel 
  hallway.  

                              MEGAN
                Someone transferred the money to an 
                  off-shore account.  Techs traced 
                the transfer to an IP address in 
                use at this hotel.

                              COLBY
                  Tabakian s crew must have found the 
                login IDs for the account when they 
                tossed the girlfriend s place. 

                              MEGAN
                So they kill our only living 
                witness and take back the money. 

                              COLBY
                Why leave a half mil  on the table 
                when you don t have to. 

  They reached the door and wait as the ASSISTANT MANAGER 
  slides his PASS KEY through the door lock.

                              MEGAN
                If this is one of Tabakian s 
                crew...

  Colby nods, and they draw their weapons.

                              SMITH
                Cheating was the only way to 
                explain the results.  So I wrote an 
                  algorithm that included a proviso

                We were afraid the Tellers would 
                notice he was winning.  But the 
                  Pick-Six... it would be enough for 
                us to start a life together...

  A beat.
