GENERAL PUTKIN
You are, gentlemen. Special

The assembled Officers nod modestly.
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
I want to talk to you about Mind
Wars, gentlemen. War...With...

His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a
BENT FORK from his briefcase.
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
How'd you like to be able to do

soldiers to do this? Would you be

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
(changing tack)
Or, or let's say you have a unit
operating outside the protection
of mainline units. What happens if
someone gets hurt? How do you deal
with that?
He surveys the blank faces.
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
Psychic healing! Protect the unit
with hands-off healing. Using the
mind to heal.
Silence. Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience.
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
Let's talk about time! What if
time is not a point but a space
and at any one instant we can be
anywhere in that space! (Laughing)
Physicists go nuts when I say
that!
Silence. He is growing desperate.
GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
Animals! Stopping the hearts of
animals! This is the idea I'm
coming to you with. You have
access to animals right?
Special Forces look like they've had enough. A tough
looking officer - MAJOR JIM HOLTZ - stirs.
MAJOR HOLTZ
No sir. We don't have access to
animals.

We TRACK forward into the shadowy interior into a large

BOB (V.O.)
The hundred goats in the disused
hospital building had been
secretly flown in from Central
America so as to avoid customs.
Special Forces weren't worried
about the General hearing the
goats because they'd been de-
bleated.
The GOATS stare at us, their mouths silently opening and
closing.
BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is the story of those goats.

Bob sits typing at his desk in the modest office. He
wears glasses, is attractive in a fresh-faced,
enthusiastic kind of way. SUPERED TITLES read: Ann Arbor,
Michigan, January 2003.
BOB (V.O.)
My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me
back in Michigan, where I was born
and raised. I studied journalism
at Western in Kalamazoo and then I
got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily
Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories
about competitive food eating
contests.
He looks at the photograph of his wife Debora on his desk
and up to where she stands, photocopying in DAVE the

Bob is clearing Ron's desk, putting his possessions into

BOB (V.O.)
My wife, Debora, told me later
that Ron's death had been like a
wake-up call for her - what people
used to call a memento mori.
Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead
man's desk. He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather
in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead. He
touches it, fascinated.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That massive coronary had reminded
her that life was too short to
waste any chance of true
happiness.
Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the
indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. His
eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in
Dave's office.
BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's,

Americans are a resolute people,

Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen.
BOB (V.O.)
Had I known where that path would
lead, had a soft wind from my
future brought me the name of Bill

The Journalists look bored.
BOB (CONT'D)

GUS LACEY
Then there's the seminars. When
I'm not teaching I spend a lotta

BOB (CONT'D)
So...when did this all start for

GUS LACEY
It started when I was a kid. I
used to lie on my bed and RV my
cousin, Irene, undressing at
night. Then, when I was in the
army I joined Bill Django's unit.
He trained me and the rest, as
they say...
BOB
Right. I don't know who that is.
Gus gives a dreamy smile.
GUS LACEY
I can't really talk about Bill.
BOB
So what did you do in the army?
GUS LACEY
We were Psychic Spies mainly. That
was our initial tasking but...once
they realized what they were
sitting on, the forces at work...
He stops, his face darkening.
GUS LACEY (CONT'D)
We were trained to kill animals.

BOB
Well, I've never owned a hamster
Gus, so I don't know what...
GUS LACEY
Look at the way it's glaring at
its wheel. Usually that hamster
loves its wheel.
BOB
Maybe some of the readers have
hamsters so...
GUS LACEY
Good. Then they'll know how rare
that is.

Bizarre. Right?
BOB
Well...it didn't die. I thought
you said you killed it?
GUS LACEY

defiant at the same time. Gus stares at the blank TV,

invisibility.
Bob tries to follow this.

Intelligence Agency. For some time
the General had been concerned
about information he had been
receiving about Soviet research
into psychic powers.

Two DIABOLICAL-LOOKING RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS are wiring up
some KITTENS to a MACHINE.
BOB (V.O.)
They were also conducting sadistic
experiments to see whether animals
had psychic powers.

Another DIABOLICAL SCIENTIST is wiring up the KITTENS'

BOB (V.O.)
Could they, for instance,
telepathically detect that their
babies were distressed?
47
FIRST LABORATORY

With a gloating smile one of the Scientists approaches
one of the KITTENS with a lit CIGARETTE. The kitten gives
a pitiful MEW as the Scientists LOOMS over it.
48
49
Brigadier General Hopgood is briefing two senior Pentagon
OFFICIALS.
OFFICIAL
But why did the Soviets begin this
type of research?
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD
Well sir, it looks like they
heard about our attempt to
telepathically communicate with
one of our nuclear subs - the
Nautilus - while it was under the
Polar cap.
OFFICIAL
(BEAT)
What attempt?
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD
There was no attempt, sir. It
seems the story was a French hoax.
But the Russians think the story
about the story being a French
hoax is just a story sir.
SECOND OFFICIAL
So, they've started psi research
because they thought we were doing
psi research, when in fact we
weren't doing psi research?
(CONTINUED)
36.
49
CONTINUED:
49
BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD
Yes sir. But now that they are
doing psi research, we're going to
have to do psi research, sir. We
can't afford to have the
Russians leading the field in the
paranormal.
The Officials consider this gravely.

Bill looks in a mirror as he admires his new insignia.
BOB (V.O.)
Two weeks later the Army adopted
the slogan Be All You Can Be and
appointed Bill Commander of the
first New Earth Army Battalion.

Bob wakes, stiff and cold, in the front of the car. He
sits up and looks around, trying to work out where he is.
Suddenly he realizes he is ALONE. Afraid, he scans the
landscape around him - featureless desert stretches to
the horizon.
BOB
(SOFTLY)
Lyn?
51
57
Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the
otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from
the small window above them. From next door comes the
faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it.
BOB
We're going to die! I'm going to
be killed by Al Qaeda!

From the next room we hear the Young Iraqis start to sing
along to the track, laughing. Lyn listens.
LYN CASSADY
I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
BOB
Oh what the hell do you know? You
don't know! You don't know
anything! And this is all your
fault!
LYN CASSADY
Bob, there's something I have to
tell you. When I said I was
retired from the unit, that was a
lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was
just my cover. I've been
reactivated. I couldn't tell
you because this is a Black Op,
but...I think you have a part to
play. I think that's why you're
with me.
Bob collapses face down on the mattress.
BOB
(MUFFLED)
You're an idiot. You want to know
why I'm with you? Because I got
drunk. (Starting to cry a little)
I got drunk and I just wanted to
get into Iraq so I could prove to
my wife I wasn't...just once that
I...And now I'm going to die.
She's right. I'm such a...
He dissolves into misery. Lyn watches with sympathy.
LYN CASSADY
Have you heard of Optimum
Trajectory before? (No answer)
Your life is like a river, Bob. If
you're aiming for a goal
that isn't your destiny, you will
always be swimming against the
current. Young Ghandi wants to be
a stock-car racer? Not gonna
happen. Little Anne Frank wants to
be a High School teacher. Tough
titty Anne. That's not your
destiny. But you will go on to
move the hearts and minds of
millions. Find out what your
destiny is and the river will
carry you. Now sometimes events in
life give an individual clues as
to where their Destiny lies.

LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
Like those doodles you just
"happened" to draw?
He unbuttons his shirt and reveals an EYE tattooed on his
chest - very similar to the one Bob had drawn. Bob looks
up.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
This is the Ajna chakra - the
third eye - the symbol of the
Jedi. When I saw you'd drawn
it...well, the Universe gives me a
sign like that, I don't ignore it.
You're meant to be here
with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you
sensed that.
Bob stares at the EYE.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
Now listen to me. I don't think
these guys are FRL's or Mehdi
Army... I think we're talking
standard criminals here, okay?
What they're gonna do is try and
sell us on to another group. We
can't let that happen.
BOB
How are we gonna stop them?
There's three of them! And they've
got guns!
LYN CASSADY
We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't
fight with guns. We fight with our
minds.
BOB
What do you mean?
LYN CASSADY
Let's say we have no choice but to
fight with these men. Then
we use visual aesthetics to
instill psychically in the enemy a
disincentive to attack.
BOB
(BEAT)
What do you mean?
LYN CASSADY
Okay, you lock eyes with one of
them, you go into a monotone and
you say "No, I'm not going to
attack you." You totally relax
your body and your voice. And then
you rip out one of his eyeballs.

LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
Or you use a pen, stab him in the
neck, create a fountain of blood,
I mean really a fountain, get the
blood to squirt on his buddies.
That's a psychic disincentive,
right there.
Bob thinks about this, a little nauseated.
BOB
We haven't got a pen.
LYN CASSADY
(SIGHS)
You're missing the point.
(Standing up) Here let me show you
something. Stand up.
Bob stands up reluctantly.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
Choke me.
BOB
Oh...I don't want to Lyn.
LYN CASSADY
Choke me. What am I gonna do?
(pointing at his throat) Just
here. Choke. Choke.
BOB
I don't think I...there's sharp
edges around here...
LYN CASSADY
C'mon...(making quotation marks
with his fingers) "Attack me."
Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this.
BOB
What's with the quotation fingers?
That's like implying I'm you
know...only capable of ironic
attacking or...
LYN CASSADY
Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me.
BOB
(BEAT)
Well, if I choose to choke you,
what are you going to do?
LYN CASSADY
I'm going to interrupt your
thought pattern.

Bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke Lyn.
Lyn THROWS him - sailing through the air. He crashes
down into the floor behind Lyn.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
See? I hardly moved. Physics wise
there's not much going on. It's
the psychic energy that's
important. (Beat) You okay?
BOB
(in pain)
Sharp...edges...
LYN CASSADY
(helping him up)
You felt fear didn't you? Before
hand?
Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself.
BOB
Yes.
LYN CASSADY
Would you say that level of fear
was abnormal for you?
Bob thinks about this.
BOB
I don't know. I was pretty
terrified anyway but the fear I
felt on the run-up to the choking
did seem, you know, unusual.
LYN CASSADY
(PLEASED)
You know why? It wasn't you. It
was me. I was inside your head.
Fighting with the Mind.
Suddenly the door opens and one of the Young Iraqis comes

A small group of JEDI RECRUITS, Lyn amongst them, stands
facing a stern Bill Django in the abandoned-looking
building. The walls have been decorated with COSMIC

BILL DJANGO
I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill
Django. From now on, you
will speak only when spoken to,
and the first and last words out
of your mouth will be "Sir, yes,

RECRUITS
Sir, yes, sir!
BILL DJANGO
If you complete this course you
will be a Psychic Weapon, an Angel
of Death, our enemies Worst
Nightmare! Until then you are
Nothing! Less than Nothing! Do you

RECRUITS
SIR, YES, SIR!
BILL DJANGO

Yeah, I'm only kidding with that

Hey! Lets dance!

The Jedis are DANCING to some rock, encouraged by Bill.
BILL DJANGO
Okay! Give it everything you've

The Jedis start to dance more frenetically, eyes closed,
jumping about the room, waving their arms...
Bill notices Lyn, shuffling self-consciously from foot to
foot.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
What's your name son?
LYN CASSADY
Lyn Cassady sir.
BILL DJANGO
Where you from?
LYN CASSADY
Opelousas, Louisiana, sir.
Bill stares at Lyn, taking in his orphan air, his hunted
look.
BILL DJANGO
Tough place to grow up?
Lyn shrugs, embarrassed.
Bill nods.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
You've gotta free your feet before
you can free your mind, Lyn.
LYN CASSADY
(EMBARRASSED)
Not much of a dancer sir.
Bill examines Lyn's face through narrowed eyes.
BILL DJANGO
But that isn't true is it Lyn? You

Bill leads the Jedis in another dancing session - rock
music blasting - the men dancing in a variety of nerdish
and demented ways. Their uniforms have been supplemented
with odd, personal touches: hats, badges, sunglasses, a
poncho...
We find Lyn dancing in blissful, idiotic abandonment.
BOB (V.O.)
After years of feeling like an
oddball Lyn had finally found a
home. At last he was amongst men
who prided themselves on being
different.
78
79
GUESTS sit eating dinner around the large table.
Brigadier General Hopgood is talking to his WIFE. He
turns back to find the FORK in his hand BENT DOUBLE.
He looks in amazement at the man sitting beside him -
LARRY HOOPER.
BOB (V.O.)
Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi
writer from Colorado, recruited to
the Jedis after Brigadier General
Hopgood met him at a spoon-bending
party.
Other guests laugh and applaud.
80
81
The Jedis eat at one table. Larry sits alone and shunned
at another table. Lyn walks over with a tray, hesitates
seeing Larry alone.
BOB (V.O.)
Larry made it quite clear that he
despised most of the other Jedis.
Feeling sorry for him Lyn sits beside Larry. Larry
flushes red.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But Lyn - Lyn was different.
(Beat) He really hated Lyn.

Scotty, Larry and Lyn sit focusing on a wall of SMALL
WOODEN CUPBOARDS. Each cupboard has a letter and number

The three men focus on the cupboard in question.
SCOTTY
It's...it's something cylindrical?
I think it's a pencil?
BILL DJANGO
Okay. Larry?
Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high
wavering voice with a bad cockney accent.
LARRY HOOPER
This is Larry's Spirit Guide,
Maud. I'm looking into
the cupboard now and I'm
seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?
BILL DJANGO
Lyn?
Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly,
puzzled.
LYN CASSADY
It's a man on a chair.
Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph
of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration
from the watching Jedis.

Bill is leading the Jedis in AIKIDO.
BILL DJANGO
Aikido is a vehicle for
harmonizing ourselves with the
Universe and the Way. Look upon
these sessions as an opportunity
to discover yourself and your
training partner in a loving
environment.

Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease.
Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him
out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)

watching Jedi's)
Notice how Lyn's circular motions
turned Larry's
aggression back upon him. Good

Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of
the NATO GENERAL inside.
BOB (V.O.)
After a year's training, Lyn was
given his first tasking. A senior
Nato General had been kidnapped by
Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill
was unofficially
asked if his unit would be able to
help find him before it was too
late.
LYN CASSADY
(CONCENTRATING)
We're north of Verona. It's a
little town. There's a lake
nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across
from the Cinema is a shop or,
or...it's a cafe. He's in the
apartment above. The town is
called...it's something sweet.
(Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce.
Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking
OFFICIAL watches from the next room. The Official looks
impressed.
BOB (V.O.)
It's true that the unit never
found out whether any of their
remote viewings were accurate or
not. Nevertheless from that moment
on Lyn's reputation soared.
86
86
Lyn stands in front of the other Jedis.
BILL DJANGO
Rank, medals...these things mean
little to the Jedi. But growth in
spirit, in wisdom, in psychic
power, these things earn our
respect.
He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
Native Americans believed that
when one received an Eagle
feather, it was the mark of love,
of gratitude and ultimate respect.
Only true Human Beings may carry
the Eagle feather.
He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other
Jedis applaud. Larry watches Lyn with HATE.

Lyn lies on the couch, drinking another beer, the Eagle
Feather on a chain around his neck. A period song is
playing in the room.
BOB (V.O.)
The word soon got out in the
intelligence community that there
was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who
could find whatever you needed
found. It was as if Lyn could fly
anywhere in the world without
leaving his room.
We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND.
LYN'S MIND P.O.V - We move towards the wall.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
As Bill Django said - the Force
truly was strong with this one.
As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the
wall, into freedom...

CLOSE on a man who looks like WOODY ALLEN in a jungle
hat. He has his eyes closed in IMMENSE CONCENTRATION. A
bead of sweat runs down his face. SUPERED TITLES read:
BEN ECHMEYER.
BOB (V.O.)
Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
with sixty-three confirmed kills.
He remains the only non-Korean to
achieve the rank of Master in Kwa
Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi
teachers at Fort Bragg.

horror.
BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was said he could have a tug of
war with a dozen men and not move
an inch.
We PAN DOWN the back of BEN and find he is NAKED from the
waist down. A SAND BAG is somehow hanging between his
legs.

He was also able to lift bags of
sand on hooks hung through his
scrotum.

BOB (V.O.)
The approach was hailed by some
knife aficionados as revolutionary
but criticized by others who
believed that the leaping and
spinning might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself.
TRACKING ALONG BEN'S TRAINEE JEDIS - as they watch his

Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn
sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY

car.
Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the
screen, moved.
NIXON (CONT'D)
We play this on these big screens

Boston, then we can damn well sell
it in Baghdad! (To Mahmud) Am I

Halliburton, Parsons,
Perini...just in the primes.
We're gonna have Macdonalds, we're

aiming them at the cars which swerve out of their way in
fear.
NIXON

I was pretty down for a while
about not getting any trigger time
in this war Bob, but you know what
I've learnt? Our greatest weapon
against evil is commerce. When
these people have quality consumer
items they will no longer want to
kill Americans.
He turns to gaze at the TOWN they are now driving into.
NIXON (CONT'D)

Mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. Lyn looks

Mahmud shrugs.

something comforting to say.

more in dark thoughts.
BOB
Lyn?
LYN CASSADY
What?
BOB
What are you thinking?
LYN CASSADY
Just Mahmud. People try to build
something of their lives,

Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper
and the part he had played in the
destruction of the New earth Army.
But, in fairness, the Jedis' own
eccentricities hadn't exactly won
them many allies in the Army.
A JEDI - TIM KOOTZ - lies on the couch in a TRANCE, Bill
sitting beside him with pen and paper.
BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
For example, there was Tim Kootz
who, on being asked to ascertain
the whereabouts of General Manuel
Noriega, had replied...
Tim jerks awake from his trance.
TIM KOOTZ
(FIRMLY)
Ask Angela Lansbury.
BILL DJANGO
(BEAT)
What's that Tim?
TIM KOOTZ
Ask Angela Lansbury.
Bill looks up to an CIA AGENT observing from the next
room. The Agent frowns.
108

Bill waits a little anxiously. The CIA Agent walks up to
him.
CIA AGENT
We asked Angela Lansbury.
BILL DJANGO
And?
CIA AGENT
She said she didn't know where
General Noriega was.

MAJOR GENERAL JACK GILLING is being driven through the
base. As he stares out of the window his expression
suddenly changes to one of amazement.

BOB (V.O.)
Or there was the time Major
General Gilling was visiting the
base and saw Jedi trainee Clifford
Hickox...
RUSSELL'S P.O.V - we are driving past the training
course. A bare-chested, long-haired Hickox is dancing
around a wooden pole to which he is attached by two long
wires and metal hooks which are stuck in his bleeding
nipples.
BOB (CONT'D)
...practising the ancient Sun
Dance of the Sioux Nation.
110
110
Bill is introducing a young, fresh-faced recruit -
LIEUTENANT NORM PENDLETON to the other Jedis.
BOB (V.O.)
The Jedis survived such minor
scandals, protected, it was
rumored, by a President who was a
fan of both the Star Wars films
and the paranormal himself. But
then, one summer,
a young, likeable Lieutenant
called Norman Pendleton was
recruited to the New Earth Army...
Larry Hooper examines the new recruit with interest.

Norm sits on the couch, smiling innocently as Larry
wheels an ELECTRONIC DEVICE on wheels over to the couch.

BOB (V.O.)
All he needed was a lab rat to try
them out on, check if they were
safe.
Larry, making sure Norm can't see, is pouring a massive
dose of LSD into a DRINK. He gives the glass a quick stir
and turns, smiling, to Norm with it.
113
113
Norm lies tripping on the couch, rigid, wide-eyed,
wearing headphones, connected to the electronic device,
which emit disturbing electronic frequencies.
Larry stands at the light switch, turning the red bulb
overhead on and off, eagerly watching Norm's reaction - a
modern day Frankenstein.
BOB (V.O.)
It turned out they weren't.

CLOSE ON LARRY - LATER

...cowering terrified under the couch, as the sound of
GUNSHOTS fill the room. Norm's NAKED LEGS stride past
him.

Norm's father - MAJOR GENERAL PENDLETON - stares fixedly
to where Bill and Brigadier General Hopgood sit in the
hearing - his expression filled with icy rage.
BOB (V.O.)
Norm's father, who it turned out
was pretty high up in the
Pentagon, wanted blood.

BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Although the Jedis were pretty
sure Larry was responsible,
nothing could be proved and when
he was called to the disciplinary
hearing Larry made sure to smear
Bill with everything he could...
117
LARRY TALKING BEFORE THE HEARING
117
...looking every inch the neat, professional soldier.
LARRY HOOPER
Lieutenant Colonel Django used
funds from the project's black
budget to procure prostitutes...
The OFFICIALS listening register shock and dismay. Bill
stands up, outraged.
BILL DJANGO
That's a lie!
LARRY HOOPER
...and also drugs for himself and
his men.
Bill jumps to his feet again.
BILL DJANGO
That's a...(catches himself) Well
the hooker thing is definitely a

The OFFICIALS look at him as if he were SATAN himself.

The Jedis sit having their hair shaved with electric
clippers. The Jedi's NEW COMMANDER - MAJOR HOLTZ - not a
shred of New Age sympathy in his regulation heart - walks
down the line, examining his men coldly.
BOB (V.O.)
After Bill left, Major Holtz of
Special Forces took command of the
Jedis.
Lyn stares at his reflection as his long hair falls to
the floor.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And nothing was ever the same

Bob wakes up, listening to the sound of Lyn's laboured
breathing.
Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing
an injection. We see he has used the LAST OF THE
MEDICINE. He injects himself, his breathing beginning to
ease and sits staring at the empty VIAL. Bob watches for
a moment then shuts his eyes, feigning sleep.
122
123
Lyn watches Mahmud in the mirror as they drive away. He
stands in the middle of the road, staring at his feet.
They drive on.
124
131
The Jedis, now indistinguishable from other soldiers,
stand white-washing over the COSMIC MURALS. Major Holtz
stands watching.
MAJOR HOLTZ
Yoga is not the business of the US
Army, ladies. Drumming circles are
not the business of the Army. And
love and peace is most certainly
not the business of the Army. So
you girls better start thinking
about how you CAN engage in the
business of the United States
Army, which, in case you have
forgotten, involves winning
fucking wars!
BOB (V.O.)
When the dust of the Pendleton
Affair had settled it revealed a
surprising victor.
132
132
Larry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT
held under one arm.
BOB (V.O.)
Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper
as a patriotic whistle-blower and
the one sound fruit in an
otherwise dubious barrel of
apples.
LARRY HOOPER
It's some scientific research I've
done for possible offensive psi
applications sir. (Beat) I did
show the report to Lieutenant
Colonel Django, but he didn't seem
interested.
Holtz snorts angrily.

MAJOR HOLTZ
(MUTTERING)
I bet he wasn't.
He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause.
He looks up slowly at Larry.
MAJOR HOLTZ (CONT'D)
We have men who can do this?
LARRY HOOPER
(a sly smile)
I think I know one sir.
Holtz ponders the report, tempted.
MAJOR HOLTZ
But we don't have the resources.
LARRY HOOPER
Well sir...there is goat lab?
133
133
The building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred
GOATS stare silently at us.
BOB (V.O.)
Goat Lab was originally created as
a clandestine laboratory to
provide in-the-field surgical
training for Special Forces
soldiers.
We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their
legs in PLASTER.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The goats would get shot in the
leg with a bolt gun and then a
trainee would have to dress the
wound successfully. Goat lab
actually used to be called Dog
Lab...
134
SMALL DOG STARING AT US
134
...with big, brown eyes.
BOB (V.O.)
But it turned out most soldiers
didn't feel good shooting dogs in
the leg...
A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in
hand.
84.
135
136
Lyn stands facing the goats. Holtz and Hooper watch him.
Lyn STARES. One of the goats STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. The
goat STARES BACK. Lyn STARES.
And the Goat falls over.
MAJOR HOLTZ
(SOFTLY)
Holy shit.
Beat. The goat gets back up, shakes itself and walks off.
Lyn slumps.
137
138
Six GOATS - each wearing a NUMBERED BIB - stand in a
small bare room. A SOLDIER is setting up a VIDEO CAMERA
in front of them.
139
139
Lyn sits in another bare room. Holtz and Larry Hooper
stand watching him. Lyn is also being TAPED. A SOLDIER
walks in carrying an envelope. Holtz takes the envelope
and draws from it a piece of paper. He shows it to Lyn -
the number FOUR.
MAJOR HOLTZ
Take out number four.
Lyn stares at the number.
BOB (V.O.)
Lyn said he had no intention of
killing the goat.

A soldier runs into the room. Holtz, Hooper and Lyn turn
to him, the atmosphere electric with dread and
anticipation.

The three men stare at him.

OVERHEAD SHOT - Lyn and Bob lie side by side in beds,
both hooked up to IV's. Sunlight slants through the
shutters on the window in the cool room. The voice is
coming from a SPEAKER on the wall.
ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.)
This is democracy. Let us work
together for that. And please stop
shooting at those who are only
here to help.
Lyn opens his eyes, looks around him.
ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
This is an old one from Cat
Stevens. (Correcting himself)
Yusef Islam. That's Yusef Islam.
Lyn looks at the door and for a second there's a FLASH OF
A FACE staring in through the glass. Then it's gone.

Over the speaker comes the sound of a period song.
Lyn sits up, staring at the door. Bob stirs in his bed.
BOB

Lyn walks unsteadily out of the room, towing his IV drip
behind him.
The door at the end of the corridor is just CLOSING. Lyn
sets off down the corridor. Bob appears in the doorway
behind him, towing his own IV.
BOB
(HISSING)
Lyn? Where are you going?

ANOTHER CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Lyn passes doors, glances into the rooms beyond...
LYN'S P.O.V - the room seems to house a PRINTING PRESS. A
SOLDIER stands with his back to us, watching LEAFLETS
fire out of the press.
We pass to the next room which seems to be a RECORDING
STUDIO - the walls covered in shelves of CD's. A SOLDIER
sits with headphones on playing an electronic keyboard...

Psy for psychological, although
the irony isn't wasted on me.
Radio broadcasts, leaflets, that
sort of thing.
Bob picks up a LEAFLET.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)
Oh, that's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet
they dropped on us.
BOB
(READING)
"American Soldier - your wives are

Simpson and Bert Reynolds."
LARRY HOOPER
Yeah, hadn't exactly done their
homework there.
Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly
at the racks of CD's. Larry notices.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)
How'd you find us, Lyn?
LYN CASSADY
I remote viewed you.
Larry smiles a little mockingly.
BOB
If this is Psyops what are you
doing here?
LARRY HOOPER
I said primarily Psyops. This is a
restricted area, you understand?
Everything you hear and see stays
secret or you go to prison.
Bob nods a little nervously.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)

He indicates the PSIC name badge he's wearing.
BOB
"Sick?"
LARRY HOOPER
It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic
Systems International Corp. Turns
out certain people had heard about
the New Earth Army and were
interested in some of the work we
were doing back then. They got in
touch with me, I got in touch with
Bill.
LYN CASSADY
(To Bill)
You're working for him?
Bill frowns at the CDs, not seeming to hear.
LARRY HOOPER
Bill's been looking into
subliminal messaging. (Selecting a
disc) This is one we've designed
to play to our own troops before
combat.
He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a
burst of a period song.
BOB
There's a subliminal message in
this?
LARRY HOOPER
(reading the CD)
This is..."Don't get drunk before
firing heavy machine guns." We've
got all sort of products in
development.(To Worker) Tell them
one of our new ideas.
PSIC WORKER
Air bag mine?

He turns back to Lyn.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)
The point is we've got a budget,
we've got supporters. I'm

Only this time without the hippy
crap.
Bill stands up and starts walking a little unsteadily
towards the door.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)
You okay Bill?
BILL DJANGO

Gonna get some ice-cream.
Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to
Lyn.
LARRY HOOPER
You get the odd flash of what he
used to be but... he's pretty
burnt out with the booze.
Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices
some candy on a desk.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)
Ooo, Twizzlers.
He picks it up and starts to eat it.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)

Lyn shakes his head, trying not to show the emotions he

LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)

Bob helps Lyn down the corridor. Lyn suddenly stops,
listening. There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from
somewhere nearby.
156
156
Lyn walks down the corridor, Bob following. At the end of
the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE. The loud
music is coming from there. We can hear now that it is an
annoying children's show song or heavy metal.
We TRACK towards the door...
Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and
peers in.
LYN'S P.O.V -
An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell, illuminated
in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT OVERHEAD.
SONG (O.S.)
(Lyrics from chosen song.)
The prisoner looks terrified, and despite the whimsical
music the whole scene is horribly sinister.
Lyn steps away from the spy-hole.
BOB

What? What is it?
LYN CASSADY
It's the Dark Side.

Lyn lies sleeping. Larry sits at the foot of his bed,
smoking a cigar. He watches Lyn for a moment, then COUGHS
deliberately. Nothing. He repeats the cough - louder. Lyn
wakes.
LARRY HOOPER
Oh. Didn't mean to wake you.
The two men stare at each other.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)

he'd run into you and mentioned
that there might be some jobs
going with us over here. (Beat)

They eat in silence for a moment. Lyn turns to look out

He turns and notices Lyn, raises his cup, smiles. Lyn
looks troubled. Bob suddenly leans into Lyn.
BOB

Don't eat the jello.
Lyn turns to Bob puzzled.
LYN CASSADY
(BEAT)
What?
BOB
Don't eat the jello.
Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry
outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand
at his feet - a small insect of some kind. He begins to
watch it with strange fascination. After a moment he
sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it.
One of the SOLDIERS notices and starts to laugh softly.
His neighbor looks at him as if he's crazy then begins to
laugh himself. Lyn looks around him, sensing the strange
atmosphere creeping through the room.
LYN CASSADY
What's going on?
BOB
We put LSD in the jello.
Lyn turns to stare at him.
LYN CASSADY

BOB
Bill showed me where Larry had
bottles of LSD. So we put it in
