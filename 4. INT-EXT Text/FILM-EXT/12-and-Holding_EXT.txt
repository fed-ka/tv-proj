TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes
through a suburban neighborhood.
Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck
pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears
over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The
boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.
Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,
screaming. They try to shake the urine off.
Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up
to the boys.
KENNY
You and your deformed brother are
dead!
Jeff and Kenny walk off.
KENNY
They're fucking dead!
Jeff runs off screen and throws up.
A modern, upper-class home with a large, well tended yard.
YACCO (O.S.)
The check is supposed to be here on
the first of the month... She's
your daughter, you asshole!
Leonard sits upon a large rock with the words, LINDSAY ACRES
inscribed on the center of it. He eats POPCORN. Hanging off
the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner, which
reads, 5th ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PICNIC. ALL INVITED.
Malee rides her bike up to Leonard. She HONKS her BIKE HORN
at every pedestrian in her path.
MALEE
Move it, people.
Outta my way!
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
She comes to a screeching halt an inch in front of Leonard.
LEONARD
(mouthful)
You're late.
MALEE
Yeah well, I began menstruating
this morning, and I had some
difficulty inserting the tampon.
(off his disgusted look)
What? It's a natural process. You
know, I could conceive, carry and
birth a child right now.
LEONARD
Big deal.
You won't.
MALEE
But I could. That's what matters.
LEONARD
The twins said, they'd meet us at
the spot.
Leonard gets on his bike.
MALEE
Wanna race?
LEONARD
Nah, I'm good.
Malee drops on the stoop like a ton of bricks.
After a beat,
she reluctantly begins playing her flute.
A few pedestrians stop to listen.
MALEE
Keep it moving. This ain't a show.
It's your typical fourth of July block party. Families crowd
the streets with BBQ GRILLS, cotton candy and beer. Children
ride their bicycles, which are adorned with streamers,
balloons and noise makers.
Off to the side, Malee and Jacob sit, eating SNOW CONES.
Jim Carges tends to some burgers on his grill.
GABE ARTUNION
(40), real estate agent, approaches.
GABE
30 acres.
JIM
I already told you, Gabe, I'm not
selling that land. Not 30 acres
not five.
GABE
I'm willing to pay top dollar.
JIM
I'm not gonna let you tear down
those woods, so you can stack
twenty houses right on top of each
other.
GABE
I'm gonna write down a number.
JIM
No! My kids... hell, your kids
play in those woods all the time.
You can't put a price on that.
Gabe writes down a number and hands it to Jim.
GABE
I believe I can.
Jim looks at the figure and his eyes go wide.
A line of PICNIC TABLES surround nearby GRILLS. Leonard's
family minus Leonard sit, eating as if there's no tomorrow.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
SOCCER MOM # 1 (O.S.)
Look at them. So unhealthy.
ON TWO SOCCER MOMS, watching Leonard's family eat.
SOCCER MOM # 1 (cont'd)
You know, Grace can barely walk
because of her weight.
SOCCER MOM # 2
Where do you think she finds
clothes big enough to fit?
The two woman walk off. As they disperse, we see LEONARD,
standing behind them. He has heard every word.
Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows
with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted.
Patrick rises and crosses over to the buffet table.
PATRICK
Good eating, huh son?
Patrick grabs the ladle and begins to fill up his plate.
LEONARD
Maybe you shouldn't have seconds,
Dad, you know?
PATRICK
Who are you, Richard Simmons?
C'mon, enjoy the day.
He walks off with his food. Leanard looks down at the food,
shrugs, then helps himself to a heaping porion.
RUDY straddles his bike while watching a group of 8-year-
olds, having a water balloon fight. Jealous, he
reminiscences to a time when he was one of those kids.
KENNY
(o.s. )
Me and Jeff are gonna pay that tree
house of yours a little visit
tonight.
Rudy spins around to find Kenny, standing at his side.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
KENNY (cont'd)
When we're through, it'll be a pile
of scrap.
RUDY
Why don't you take your smelly ass
back to the trailer park?
KENNY
Free country, asshole.
RUDY
You got nothing better to do than
pick on us all the time?
KENNY
I did until yesterday.
RUDY
I thought you liked "golden
showers". Oh no, that was your
mother.
Kenny pushes Rudy to the ground and then jumps on top of him.
Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered. A crowd of
kids surround them, chanting, "FIGHT, FIGHT".
Jeff hocks a phlegm wad onto Rudy's face. Rudy screams as
the stream of saliva, drips across his nose and onto his lip.
NEIGHBORHOOD FATHER (O.S.)
What's going on over there?
Kenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over.
KENNY
I'll finish this tonight!
Kenny pushes Rudy down once more and runs off.
Rudy slowly
rises, wiping the saliva from his face.
The entire neighborhood has descended upon a VACANT LOT.
They are awaiting the annual, fireworks display.
We FIND Leonard, Jacob and Malee sitting on a large rock,
which gives them a birds eye view of the crowd.
Rudy runs over to the rock and climbs up top.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
RUDY
Kenny showed up. He said, Jeff and
him are gonna tear the treehouse
down tonight. We gotta sneak out
and stop them.
JACOB
Mom and Dad would kill us.
RUDY
We can't let him tear it down.
JACOB
It's just a treehouse.
RUDY
No, it's not! You know what, you
suck. I'm going. Leonard, you in?
JACOB
You don't have to go if you don't
want to.
RUDY
Don't listen to him.
He's a pussy.
Leonard looks between Jacob and Malee.
LEONARD
I'll go.
RUDY
Finally, someone with balls.
Insulted, Jacob slides off the rock and walks away.
Malee
follows.
RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Let them go.
The fireworks display begins.
As they turn to watch it...
The treehouse is illuminated by the full moon, which rests in
the sky above. The thunderous sound of a million crickets
fills the air.
Jeff and Kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse.
Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside.
KENNY
Now yours.
And aim for the window.
Jeff lights his COCKTAIL. It misses the window and smashes
into the side of the tree house.
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Ha ha, you suck.
Jeff and Kenny hear Leonard and Rudy screaming from inside.
JEFF
You hear that?
Jeff and Kenny are frantic.
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
They're in there!
They're in
there!
Jeff turns around and runs back home through the woods.
We watch over Kenny's shoulder as Leonard falls from the
treehouse, smacks his head on the tree trunk and comes to a
crash upon some rocks. Kenny runs over and finds Leonard
unconscious.
KENNY
Wake up!
Wake up, kid!
Off the treehouse, which is now a towering inferno -
ON JIM and ASHLEY, watching Rudy's casket as it is lowered
into the ground. The once spirited, couple now looks tired
and pained. They are accompanied by a number of mourners.
PRIEST
Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene
Carges. May God hold you in the
palm of his hand.
Jacob stands beside his parents. Tears stream from his eyes,
across his birthmark and off his chin. So stricken with
grief, Jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away.
We continue on through the crowd and find Malee. Embarrassed
by the tears, she brings a black veil down over her face.
Cars fill the driveway and line the street in front of
Jacob's house.
TIGHT ON a CHAIN SAW chopping down a tree.
WIDEN to REVEAL a CONSTRUCTION CREW, tearing down the last of
the woods. Rows and rows of STUMPS make it look like a
graveyard for trees.
MALEE (O.S.)
It's gone!
It's all gone!
We FIND Malee and Jacob, straddling their bikes a few feet
away from the site. Leonard is beside them on a scooter. He
as a band-aid on his forehead.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking
out right now.
Leonard shoots Malee a look.
She silences herself.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
LEONARD
You holding up alright, Jacob?
Jacob shrugs.
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I'm sorry. I wish I could have
done something.
JACOB
Jeff and Kenny were the ones that
started the fire. It was their
fault. Or maybe mine. I should of
been there.
MALEE
You wouldn't have been able to do
anything. And it could have been
you who died.
JACOB
I wish it was. You know the last
thing Rudy said to me? He said, I
can't be a pussy all my life. He
was right, I am. And Rudy might be
dead because of it.
MALEE
Don't say that.
(beat)
Why don't you talk to your parents
about this?
JACOB
They can't help me.
MALEE
Give them time. It'll get better.
JACOB
What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't
gone back to work yet. What if he
loses his job. We could lose our
house. I could be homeless.
MALEE
Then you'll stay with me.
LEONARD
Or me.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED: (2)
JACOB
We're best friends.
We...
Suddenly, something catches Malee's attention off screen.
It's GUS, standing beside a BULLDOZER.
MALEE
Oh my God.
JACOB
What?
MALEE
That guy. I like know him. He's
one of my mother's patients.
LEONARD
So?
MALEE
I've never seen a patient of hers
actually out and about.
(beat)
Should we go over and say "hi"?
JACOB
I just want to get out of here.
Leonard and Jacob start heading off.
Malee stays for a beat, eyeing Gus as he removes his T-shirt
and exposes his rock abs. She is obviously turned on.
LEONARD
You coming, Malee?
Students make their way inside for the first day of school.
There is a sign out front, which reads: WELCOME BACK.
The coach and his students stand at the beginning of the
track, waiting for Leonard to finish his laps.
Leonard slowly walks over.
He is soaking wet and breathing
heavy.
COACH
23 minutes.
LEONARD
Not bad.
COACH
The goal was 8.
The class can't help but laugh.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Hit the showers.
The class walks off.
COACH (cont'd)
Not you Leonard.
Leonard turns back and crosses over to the coach.
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Center. That's the position you'll
be playing in two years.
LEONARD
Football?
COACH
You don't like football?
LEONARD
I love it. It's just I'll never
make the weight requirement. Pop
Warner league wouldn't let me play
for five years because of it.
COACH
There's no weight requirement in
high school ball, son.
The coach bends down and rifles through his GYM BAG.
He
removes 2 books and hands them to Leonard.
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
These are your new bibles.
LEONARD
Books?
COACH
One is on nutrition, the other
exercise. You do what they say,
and you can play for me once you
get to high school.
LEONARD
Thanks.
Leonard begins walking back to the gym.
After a few steps,
he stops and turns back.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED: (2)
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Coach, why are you doing this for
me?
COACH
Because I've never seen a child so
out of shape in my life.
Dressed in a sweat suit and sneakers, Leonard sprints down
the driveway and to the street. His sweat suit is so tight,
Leonard looks like a stuffed sausage.
With each step he takes, Leonard breathing becomes heavier
and heavier. Sweat forms on his forehead and drips down his
face.
Within seconds, Leonard's pace tapers off. He struggles to
continue but is so out of shape, stopping is inevitable.
Leonard leans over, gasping for air. He looks back and
realizes that he only ran about one hundred yards. In fact,
his house is still in view.
Leonard turns around and starts walking back home.
After a
few steps, he stops and throws up.
Gus stands inside of a shallow ditch, digging out the roots
of an old tree.
MALEE (O.S.)
Don't I know you?
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
Gus turns and sees Malee behind him, holding a PICNIC BASKET.
GUS
Dr. Chung's daughter.
MALEE
You remembered. We were never
introduced. My name is Malee.
GUS
Gus.
They shake hands.
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What are you doing here?
MALEE
I was in the mood for a picnic. I
thought this would be a nice place
to have one.
Gus looks around, confused. This location is anything but
picnic friendly. Bulldozers plough through the scene,
blasting exhaust into the air. Men scream at each other.
WORKER (O.S.)
Asshole, move your fucking truck!
MALEE
Would you like to join me?
There's
plenty of food.
GUS
I don't go to lunch for another ten
minutes.
MALEE
I'll wait. Meet me by the cement
mixer when you're ready.
Malee walks off. Gus watches as she makes her way through
the construction site.
Gus and Malee sit on a checkered blanket, eating Chinese food
with chopsticks. A large CEMENT MIXER stands behind them.
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
GUS
The last time I saw you, you had
just come from a funeral. How are
you doing?
MALEE
Okay. Death is like so weird. I
mean, it's sad, but I also feel
like I've been given this sign. A
sign which is telling me, life is
short, so you gotta do what makes
you happy. You gotta take chances.
You gotta get crazy.
GUS
What are you doing to "get crazy"?
MALEE
I play the flute.
GUS
(laughs)
Yeah, that's totally nuts.
MALEE
No, not that. See, every year my
school has this recital. I've
always been too scared to play a
solo in front of people, but this
year I've decided to do it.
GUS
Good for you. When is it?
MALEE
Why do you care?
GUS
Cause I'm gonna go.
MALEE
What? You can't go!
Nobody goes
to these things. I don't even
think my mom is going.
GUS
You gotta have somebody rooting for
ya. Besides, I like music, and I
owe you for bringing me lunch.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED: (2)
MALEE
(laughs, embarrassed)
Okay. Tuesday at 8:30 in the
junior high school auditorium.
GUS
I'll be there.
MALEE
(vulnerable)
Don't say it if you don't mean it.
GUS
I'll be there.
Front row.
Malee smiles.
She's got a major crush on Gus now.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON TV: VIDEO GAME - HALO. Two soldiers fire at each
other with supersonic weapons. One soldier is particularly
annihilated. GAME OVER appears.
With the help of the BUS DRIVER, Jacob loads his bike into
the luggage compartment underneath the bus. Then he hands
the driver a ticket and boards.
Jacob takes a seat up front. After a few moments, the driver
boards, starts the engine and drives off.
41.
Malee is riding her bike on the sidewalk when she sees Gus,
exit his car and enter her mother's office.
Parents and students file inside. A large SIGN above the
door reads, JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH FALL RECITAL.
47.
With fire and determination, Leonard jogs. Unfortunately, he
is quickly winded by the run. He bends over, gasping.
SUPERIMPOSE SHOT OVER SHOT: Leonard appears, running past
his old, weaker self. Stronger, he makes a few more yards
and then is forced to stop.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
He leans over for air, and we SUPERIMPOSE another SHOT OVER
SHOT of Leonard, weeks later, running past his weaker self.
(This series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating
the progression of time and weight loss.)
Malee hands Gus her bag of Halloween Candy.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
GUS
I can't take your Halloween candy.
MALEE
You'll be doing me a favor.
Chocolate gives you zits. Besides,
if I want to keep this firm ass as
an adult, I gotta develop good
eating habits now.
GUS
(uncomfortable)
Maybe just a snickers.
Gus opens a snickers bar and starts eating.
MALEE
So work is good?
GUS
To be honest, I can't wait till
this job is finished. This place
is creepy. You know, a boy died
here like right before we started
working.
MALEE
Rudy.
His name was Rudy.
GUS
You knew him?
MALEE
He was one of my best friends.
Remember that funeral I went to?
GUS
That was him?
MALEE
I thought you knew. Two boys threw
a flaming cocktail at him. Can you
imagine killing someone like that?
How evil can you get?
Gus eyes Malee, completely unsettled.
Ashley stands with a big smile on her face.
ASHLEY
Jeff Laskey is dead.
Jim and Jacob look up, stunned.
JIM
What?
ASHLEY
He committed suicide in his jail
cell last night. Sally Yngve
called just now to tell me.
Jim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as
Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the
kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins
eating. She is smiling.
JACOB
Why are you smiling?
A boy died.
ASHLEY
No, a monster that murdered my son
died. Justice is served; end of
story.
Ashley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves
and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss
as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior.
Malee flips through a TELEPHONE BOOK.
She comes to Gus' name
and rips out the page.
61.
Gus drives up, parks along the sidewalk, and gets out.
Malee, Leonard and Jacob sit, playing LIFE, the board game.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
LEONARD
Don't worry, white male infants are
the hardest to come by. 60 minutes
did a whole story on it.
MALEE
Since when do you watch 60 minutes?
LEONARD
Since I was in the hospital. They
said, any adoption agency worth its
salt has at least a three year
waiting list. By the time your
parents get a kid, you'll be in
college. You think they'll want to
start over again with that baby
shit?
JACOB
No, but it's like they're trying to
replace Rudy.
LEONARD
It doesn't matter cause it's not
gonna happen.
Malee has been silent this entire time.
Seeing a moment, she
speaks up.
MALEE
I'm thirsty.
(to Leanard)
Can you get us some drinks?
LEONARD
Why me?
MALEE
Because it's the gentlemanly thing
to do.
JACOB
I'll get the drinks.
MALEE
I'll go with you.
LEONARD
Why are you all of a sudden going
to get the drinks?
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED: (2)
MALEE
(bitchy)
Because you've upset me, and I
don't want to see you right now.
Leonard looks to Jacob.
LEONARD
Fine, I'll get the drinks.
Leonard exits.
Malee turns to Jacob.
MALEE
I need a favor. It's big. I need
you to hide something for me.
JACOB
Hide what?
Malee reaches into her back pack.
MALEE
Promise, you won't freak.
JACOB
I won't.
Malee removes Gus' gun.
JACOB (cont'd)
Holy shit!
MALEE
You said, you wouldn't freak!
JACOB
That's a gun.
MALEE
I know.
JACOB
Where'd you get it?
MALEE
I can't tell you. I just need you
to hide it for a while. When all
is cool, I'll come for it.
JACOB
Why can't you keep it?
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED: (3)
MALEE
My mother is a total snoop. She
goes through my stuff like all the
time.
(beat)
Please, Jacob. Somebody's life
might depend on it.
Jacob crosses to his closet, removes his metal LOCK BOX and
opens it. Jacob takes the gun and places it inside.
JACOB
Is it loaded?
MALEE
No, but I do have some bullets.
Malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets.
Jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Sure your parents won't find it?
JACOB
Nobody has the combination, but me.
Besides, I could be building a bomb
in here, and they wouldn't even
know.
Off Jacob, locking the box up.
FADE TO BLACK:
FADE IN:
ON TWO FEET, running. We REVEAL that it's LEONARD. His once
skin tight sweat suit, hangs off of him. More than just
skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape. He runs fast, carefully
avoiding puddles of melting snow. (Spring is fast on the
horizon.)
Jacob and Kenny talk via one way phone. Their demeanor has
changed since last we saw them. No longer fraught with
contempt and acrimony, they speak like two old friends.
JACOB
I sent in some comics for ya.
The
X-men one is pretty sweet.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
KENNY
That last batch was awesome.
Jacob checks his watch.
JACOB
I better get going, I don't want to
miss my bus.
KENNY
Before you go, I got some news.
Apparently, the parole board feels
I've been a model prisoner, so
they're giving me early release.
JACOB
What?
How can they do that?
KENNY
I don't know. They just did.
You're pissed, aren't you? I knew
you would be.
(off Jacob's silence)
It was an accident, Jacob.
JACOB
So you're getting out.
Gonna head
back to school, or...
KENNY
Fuck school. I'm going to live
with my Dad in New Mexico. He's
working on a ranch out there.
JACOB
You can't leave the state. That
violates your probation. You'll
have to...
KENNY
My dad won't tell anyone. No one
will even care I'm out there.
JACOB
Your mom will.
KENNY
Jacob, in the entire time I've been
locked up, you were the only one
who came to see me. Trust me, she
won't care.
67.
Leonard and Jacob play catch with a football.
LEONARD
When I was fat. Now I don't have
to wear a T-shirt when I go
swimming. Who knows, maybe I could
even get lucky.
JACOB
You're still ugly, though.
Leonard punches Jacob's arm in fun.
LEONARD
I don't understand what my mother's
problem is. It's like the thinner
I get, the more she hates me.
JACOB
She's probably jealous. Maybe you
should put her on that diet.
LEONARD
Anytime I mention it, my mother
goes crazy.
JACOB
If you really want her to drop a
few tons, put her in jail. Kenny's
lost about 30 pounds since he's
been incarcerated, and he was
already thin.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
LEONARD
Really?
JACOB
Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight
loss program. You take a fat tub,
throw them in a room and force them
to eat right and exercise. Don't
let them out till they do.
Off Leonard, thinking-
Gus watches a CEMENT TRUCK, dumping cement into a foundation.
Once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. Malee is
revealed, standing there and holding a picnic basket.
Gus sees the new and improved Malee for the first time.
His
jaw drops.
GUS
Malee?
My God, you look...
MALEE
Different?
GUS
Beautiful.
You look beautiful.
Off Malee's smile -
Gus and Malee eat their lunch.
MALEE
I felt like I needed a change, you
know?
GUS
I bet you're driving the boys at
school wild.
MALEE
Boys my age are so immature. I'm
more attracted to older gentlemen.
Malee smiles at Gus.
He knows where this is going, and he's
suddenly nervous.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
GUS
You don't want somebody that much
older than you. An age difference
can cause problems.
MALEE
What kind of problems?
GUS
A lot of times when a couple has an
age difference, they wind up
splitting up because they want
different things.
MALEE
You mean sex.
GUS
No.
Gus catches a look of relief on Malee's face.
GUS (cont'd)
I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a
boy even three years older than you
is probably more "experienced".
Boys can be impatient about that
sort of thing.
MALEE
Are you impatient?
GUS
No, but when I was a kid.
MALEE
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
GUS
I did, but it didn't work out.
MALEE
How old was she?
GUS
About my age.
MALEE
See that, age wasn't an issue, yet
you still wanted different things.
I don't think it's about age.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED: (2)
MALEE (cont'd)
I think when two people connect,
they connect for other reasons.
And since soulmates are eternal,
they have no age.
Gus is stumped.
Leonard watches Patrick and his sisters drive off in a
TAXICAB.
LEONARD
(calling after them)
Have a good flight!
The taxicab disappears down the street.
As Leonard turns back around, he sees Grace, staring at him
from the window. They lock eyes for a moment and then Grace
disappears into the dark recesses of the home.
Jacob is on the one way phone with Kenny.
JACOB
He's not some baby.
He's like 10.
KENNY
You're blaming me for this?
JACOB
No.
But can you believe it?
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
KENNY
Maybe this is the only way they can
get over Rudy's death.
JACOB
He's a person not a fucking vase.
KENNY
I know.
JACOB
I gotta get out of there. I can't
live in that house for one more
day. I want to go with you to New
Mexico.
KENNY
No way. You've never even
been
out on the road.
JACOB
So.
KENNY
It's not easy. After first night
falls, you'll be pissing yourself.
JACOB
No, I won't.
KENNY
You don't need me to run away from
home.
JACOB
That's not what this is about.
KENNY
Yes, it is.
(beat)
And you want to come with ME of all
people. Are you forgetting, I was
the one who killed Rudy!
JACOB
That was an accident.
Kenny appears stunned.
Jacob has never accepted that truth.

JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I'll be helpful. I can get
everything we'll need together. As
soon as you're released, we can go.
Kenny appears to be weighing the decision.
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Please.
KENNY
If this is what you want.
Alright.
Malee watches as Gus enters his car and drives off.
Gus drives up, gets out of his car and enters the building.
Malee, now wrapped in a large overcoat, is led by Yacco out
of the building and over to her car.
Yacco exits her office to find Gus waiting for his session.
They speak not a word. He rises and enters the office. She
follows, shutting the door behind her.
Jacob straddles his bike, watching a crew spread cement over
the foundation of a house. Jacob appears lost in thought.
He looks at a picture of Rudy and himself together.
Jacob touches his face in the photograph. He traces his
finger along the outline of his birthmark.
KENNY (O.S.)
Tonight, we ride.
Jacob and Kenny share a cigarette.
KENNY
We got sleeping bags, a tent,
canteens and a lantern.

(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
KENNY (cont'd)
I heard it's supposed to rain, so
I'll bring ponchos.
JACOB
(half hearted)
Cool.
Kenny eyes Jacob.
KENNY
You're acting weird.
You gonna
chicken out?
JACOB
No.
KENNY
You better not. I already packed
twice the amount of shit. I can't
carry it all alone.
JACOB
I'll be there.
KENNY
Good. I'm telling you, man. It's
gonna be great.
JACOB
I guess.
KENNY
Come on. You can't be a pussy all
your life.
JACOB
(beat, hauntingly)
I know.
KENNY
I'll see you tonight.
Don't be
late.
Kenny rides off. Jacob watches him go.
He has a lifeless,
almost calculating look in his eyes.
A heavy rain begins to fall as Jacob rides up. He sees
Kenny, standing inside of a partially, constructed house.
KENNY
You're late.
JACOB
I'm here.
Kenny throws Jacob a PONCHO.
KENNY
Put this on.
Jacob removes his backpack and puts on the poncho. Then he
opens his backpack and removes his HOCKEY MASK. (The same
mask he was wearing at the beginning of the movie.)
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What the fuck is that?
JACOB
If people see me riding around in
the middle of the night, we're
screwed. You didn't bring a
disguise?
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
KENNY
Who gives a shit what I'm up to.
The boys start riding off in opposite directions.
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
The main road is this way.
JACOB
Yeah, but if we cut through the
construction site, we'll hit the
railroad tracks. It's faster and
no one will bother us.
KENNY
Good point.
Kenny files in behind Jacob, and the boys make their way deep
into the construction site. Thunder and lightning crash.
Jacob and Henry make their way to the edge of the
construction site. Suddenly, Jacob stops in his tracks.
KENNY
What's wrong?
Jacob lifts the hockey mask.
JACOB
I can't do this.
KENNY
What?!
Jacob begins rummaging through his backpack.
KENNY
Son of a bitch! I knew it.
I knew
you'd chicken...
Jacob rises, holding the gun.
He points it at Kenny.
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
What the fuck?
Jacob shakes, frightened and reluctant to do what he believes
he has to do.
JACOB
I can't let you leave, Kenny.
You
have to pay for what you did.
KENNY
Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I...
I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll
do my probation.
Jacob cocks the gun.
Tears stream down his checks.
JACOB
You killed him. I gotta do this...
for my family. It's the only way.
KENNY
Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an
accident. I swear. Please, don't.
This isn't you.
JACOB
I know. But I can't be a pussy all
my life.
Jacob fires. Kenny is hit in the head.
He drops to the
ground instantly.
The force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground.
As he
falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face.
Jacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body.
Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the
hockey mask.
Jacob is inside one of the UNPAVED house foundations, digging
a hole. He cries, struggling to finish what he has done.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
Once a hole is dug, Jacob throws Kenny's body inside and
starts covering it up with dirt.
Gus loads cinder blocks into a wheel barrow.
MALEE (O.S.)
Gus?
Gus spins around, and finds Malee, standing there.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Before you freak out, I want to
tell you, I'm sorry. And to give
you this.
Malee opens her backpack and removes Gus' GUN.
Gus snatches
it from her.
GUS
Malee?
MALEE
Don't be mad. I was just worried
about you. Now I'm out of your
life forever. Goodbye. Thanks for
not pressing any charges.
Malee walks off.
Gus holds the gun in awe.
TIGHT ON JACOB, staring at the construction site.
We ZOOM
OUT and find him, straddling his bike.
Malee appears, walking over.
MALEE
Quite a storm last night.
They stand for a moment, watching the builders.
MALEE (cont'd)
Did you hear about Leonard?
Jacob nods, YES.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
MALEE (cont'd)
Only him. I was gonna go and visit
him at the hospital. You want to
come?
Jacob doesn't answer. He is preoccupied with watching a
TRUCK pour cement into the foundation where Kenny is buried.
It's a bittersweet moment. While relieved by the fact that
his crime will be hidden, the guilt overwhelms him.
MALEE (cont'd)
Earth to Jacob. You coming?
JACOB
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Jacob turns his bike around, and the two ride off together.
MALEE
You know, your birthday's coming
up. Any hints as to what you might
like?
JACOB
Whatever you get me will be fine.
MALEE
(annoyed)
Right.
Malee eyes Jacob, sensing that something is wrong.
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Are you okay?
JACOB
(lying)
Never better.
BACK ON the foundation. Gus enters frame and begins
spreading cement over Kenny's grave.
