      As Mickey looks up at the blue, blue sky.  Freedom.  It's
      been a long time coming.  No one is there to meet him.  It
      is winter, there is snow banked along the streets.


      An old wooden house.  Mickey pays off a sketchy looking guy
      in his 50's, who steps aside as he opens up the door.


      As we cruise along the Sunset Strip.  Ghostly quiet this
      early.  We pass many iconic sights, until we see the boxy,
      modern Mondrian up ahead.  We stop, and then move up across
      the facade of the building.  Past the awning of the Penthouse
      and through the balcony into the dark rooms beyond, where
      the sunlight is just penetrating.


      RAY DONOVAN, 45, is in bed, sleeping, next to his wife ABBY. 
      The dulcet sounds of Doris Day have been totally replaced by
      the heavy thumping.                                                                                          3.

      Rap music coming from somewhere in this upscale neighborhood. 

                                    ABBY
                      Goddammit.  

      Ray throws an arm across her.

                                    RAY
                    Go back to sleep.

      She sits up on an elbow, stares at him.  He is a handsome
      man.  Abby is in her early forties, has more of a Boston
      accent than Ray, who has mostly gotten rid of his.  

                                    ABBY
                    You think they'd put up with this
                    shit in Beverly Hills?
                          (beat)
                    We're freaking moving, Ray.

      Ray's cell phone rings.  He looks at it.  It says DEONTE. 
      He has to take it.

      We INTERCUT between Ray and DEONTE at The Mondrian --

                                    RAY
                    Yeah, Deonte --what's up?

                                      DEONTE
                          (whispers)
                    I'm at The Mondrian.
                          (beat)
                    I got a strange female in the bed
                    with me.

                                    RAY
                    Alright, what's the problem?  She
                    want money?

                                      DEONTE
                    I think she's dead.

                                    RAY
                    Did you kill her?

      Ray looks at Abby, she knows to get up and leave, she is
      used to this.

                                      DEONTE
                    No, dog,I didn't even fuck her!  She
                    was doing blow all night!  I think
                    she overdosed!  Oh my god!                                                                                        4.

                                    RAY
                    Take your hand and put it under her
                    nose.

                                      DEONTE
                    I can't!  I think there's blood there. 
                    She had a nosebleed.  My dick is
                    covered in blood!  This is so
                    extreme!!

                                    RAY
                    Do it now, Deonte.

                                      DEONTE
                          (starts to cry)
                      I can't!!!  Oh my god, what if she
                    passed?

                                    RAY
                    You think you're the first person
                    I've dealt with woke up in bed with
                    a dead body?  Take your fingers and
                    feel for a breath.  If she's alive
                    we need to save her life.

      Deonte does.

                                      DEONTE
                    She's dead, dog.
                          (beat)
                    I don't even know her!  I met her
                    last night in the Sky Bar!  I don't
                    even do drugs --I'm an athlete!

                                    RAY
                    Alright, listen to me.  Don't touch
                    anything, don't call anyone.  I'm
                    sending someone.

                                      DEONTE
                    I just signed an 80 million dollar
                    contract, cuz!!  TMZ was following
                    me last night!

                                    RAY
                    Calm down.  I'm on it.  Just sit
                    tight.

      Ray hangs up.  Makes a call.  Connects with someone on the
      other end.  This is AVI THE JEW, his #1.  Avi is enormous --
      just huge.  Solid muscle with a thick overlay of fat.  Maybe
      Mossad once?                                                                                          5.

      He is sitting alone at Nate and Al's, in front of a staggering
      amount of food.

                                    RAY (CONT'D)
                    Av?  We have a situation at The
                    Mondrian.  Deonte Frasier's got a
                    dead girl in his bed.  I think she
                      overdosed.  Get over there and hold
                    his hand, see what's what.

                                    AVI THE JEW (V.O.)
                    I'm on it, Raymond.

      RAY hangs up, goes into action, dials another number.  This
      is his #2, LENA, 28.  She is dark, intense.    We Intercut --

                                    LENA (V.O.)
                    Yo, boss.

                                    RAY
                    Lena, honey.  Get to the office now. 
                    I'll call you back in 10 minutes
                    when I'm on the road.  Deonte
                    Frasier's in bed at the Mondrian
                    with a dead girl, maybe a hooker.

                                    LENA (V.O.)
                    I hate when that happens.

      She hangs up, turns to the young woman next to her in bed.

                                    LENA (CONT'D)
                    I have to leave.  Get dressed.

      Back to Ray, who is madly hurrying now, grabbing clothes and
      slamming into the shower.


      The enormous building on Wilshire which houses the law firm
      that is Ray's biggest client.  As Ray zooms into the
      underground parking.


      He and Tommy are racing to The Mondrian.  Ray's back on the
      phone with Lena.

                                    RAY
                    Call TMZ and leak the news that Tommy
                    Jenkins is at The Mondrian with a
                    dead girl.  Then get over there and
                    represent him.  You're his press
                    agent, or you work for the studio.
                    You try to control the story.

                                    LENA
                    Got it, boss.

      Tommy Jenkins looks panicked as the seriousness of this starts
      to hit him.

                                      TOMMY
                    Did I kill her?

                                    RAY
                    No.  She overdosed.

                                      TOMMY
                    I'm gonna throw up.


      Out in front.  TMZ, who has offices down the street, have
      taken minutes to get there.  Other Papparrazi have gathered. 
      Lena is there, she and the manager are keeping everyone behind
      a roped off area.

                                    TMZ GUY
                    Is he in there?

                                    LENA
                    Yes, I can confirm that Tommy Jenkins
                    is in the hotel.  That's all I can
                    tell you at this point. 

      She's good.


      The crowd is really getting huge now.  This is a big, big
      story.  Lena watches as a cop car pulls up.  A uniform cop
      gets out, with another cop.  Lena reads his nametag --

                                    LENA
                    Officer Davis, my client is inside. 
                    I believe he's in some trouble. 
                    Could I come in with you?

                                      OFFICER DAVIS
                    Yeah, come on.


      Deonte is holding the hand of his gorgeous blinged out, bi-
      racial wife.  They are having breakfast in the outdoor living
      room.

      RAY -- walks past them, on his way out.  He and Deonte nod
      to each other.


      Ray has parked on the street by the side of the hotel.  He
      gets into his car and takes off.  Immediately calls Lee.  We
      intercut --

                                    LEE
                    This gonna fly?

                                    RAY
                    Yeah, worked out fine.  They'll let
                    him go in a few hours, we put him
                    straight into Promises.

                                    LEE
                    Suck one cock, you're a cocksucker
                    for life.  Get caught with a dead
                    girl, admit to a drug problem and go
                    to rehab --no problem.  Crazy town,
                    right?  I'll deal with the studio.
                          (beat)
                    Stu Feldman just called, you're late. 
                    You gotta get over to Paramount.

                                    RAY
                    I was gonna go see Ezra.                                                                                        15.

                                    LEE
                    Ezra's fine.  He's grieving.  You'll
                    see him tomorrow at the service. 
                    Get over to Paramount.  

                                    RAY
                    Lee?  Do me a favor.  Don't tell me
                    what to do.

      Ray hangs up on him. 

      Lee simultaneously picks up a call from Marty Gross at
        Stalkerazzi.

                                    LEE
                    Marty, my friend! I told you he's
                    not a fag!!  You see that trannie? 
                    I would have fucked that trannie!
                    You drop the fag stuff, I'll get you
                    the first interview with him from
                    rehab.  

      Ray has turned around in the hills, pulls in front of The
      Mondrian to get back onto Sunset just as Tommy Jenkins is
      brought out by Officer Davis.  Lena is with him.  The
      Papparazzi go nuts. 

      As Ray drives past them, we pan up to reveal a huge billboard
      of Tommy, cradling an Uzi.  It reads "Bo Bronson Back to
      Save the World" with the single word "May" underneath.


      Ray drives through the gates to valet parking.


      As Ray gets out of his car outside a small brick office
      building.  Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he sees a
      beautiful woman approaching, fast.

                                      DIVORCEE
                    You prick.

      She goes to hit him, Ray catches her hand, holds it tight.

                                    RAY
                    Relax.  I got you a good settlement. 
                    He would have given you nothing.

      He gives her a look --"are you gonna cut it the fuck out if
      I let go of your hand?".  He does, she moves off.


      Ray is driving towards Malibu.  The water sparkles.  He's
      listening to James Brown.  "It's a Man's World".

      Over this music we cut to--

      A SHITTY ROOM IN A BY THE HOUR HOTEL -BOSTON

      Mickey Donovan, the man we saw kill the priest, is sitting
      with a towel wrapped around his waist.  He is with A BLACK
      HOOKER, who passes him a joint.  As he takes a deep toke --

                                      HOOKER
                    Easy, baby.  Stuff's alot stronger
                    now.

      The MUSIC segues into "Pappa's got a brand new Bag". Mickey,
      stoned, gets up and does a dance that went out of fashion
      twenty years ago.  He's feeling good.  Over this --

                                                                                BACK TO:


      Ray talks to his phone set-up, instructing it to call back  --

                                    RAY
                    Terry --


      A private stretch of beach.  Multi-million dollar homes
      crammed next to each other with only inches between them. 
      But the view, the air.

      Ray is down the beach, with binoculars.

      POV: through binoculars, he sees a man, mid-30's, balding,
      who is hiding behind a pillar that supports an old wooden
      house.  He is gazing up at the house next door.  He is
        surreptitiously masturbating, to the sight off --                                                                                        22.

      ASHLEY RUCKER: a gorgeous, fresh-faced young pop star, late
      20's, who is practicing yoga on her deck.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Avi and Ray are standing on the street, the Pacific Coast
      Highway behind them, cars zipping past.  They watch as the
      stalker drives away in a small beat up car.  Avi lowers
      binoculars, finishes writing something on a small pad.

                                    AVI THE JEW
                    I got his plates, I'll call it in to
                    Lena for an address.
                          (beat)
                    I got a bad feeling, this is a bad
                    guy. 

      Ray is quiet for a long moment, makes a decision, starts to
      move towards Abby's front door.

                                    AVI THE JEW (CONT'D)
                    Ray, what are you doing?  You can't
                    fucking do that.  You gonna give up
                    Feldman?

      Ray keeps on, ignores him.

                                    AVI THE JEW (CONT'D)
                    You said you weren't gonna do this
                    shit anymore.  She's not the client! 
                    Stu Feldman's the client!  Goddammit,
                    Ray!

      He's pissed.  He gets in his van and leaves.


      Ray has rung her bell.  She comes to the door, opens it.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Jesus.  Ray Donovan.

                                    RAY
                    You always open the door like that? 
                    Without asking who it is?  

      She laughs, taken aback.                                                                                        23.

                                      ASHLEY
                    I do when it's you.  How the hell
                    are you, Ray?

                                    RAY
                    Pretty good.  You?

      She shrugs.

                                      ASHLEY
                    Better than the last time I saw you. 
                    What was I, 16? 
                          (beat)
                    Trying to get my fucking money back
                    from my parents.  Assholes.  Did I
                    ever thank you?

                                    RAY
                    You did.

                                      ASHLEY
                    I'm a musician now.

                                    RAY
                    I know.  My kids like you.

                                      ASHLEY
                          (teasing him)
                    Your kids? 

      He smiles, embarrased.

                                      ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    So, what are you doing here, Ray?

                                    RAY
                    You have a stalker.

      She starts to laugh, looks behind him for a camera crew --

                                      ASHLEY
                    I'm being punked, right?

                                    RAY
                    No.

      There is something about his demeanor, his absolute
        seriousness, that shoves the laugh down her throat.  

      She steps aside and ushers him in.                                                                                        24.


      Avi watches from his van as Ashley Rucker's stalker pulls
      into the underground parking structure for a shitty building
      in a bad neighborhood.


      Ray and Abby greet Lee Drexler outside the temple.  Abby is
      dressed beautifully but we can see now she is not a match to
      the women who are pouring in, all in black, covered in jewels. 
      Photographers and papparazzi snapping pics of all the heavy
      hitters who are arriving --

                                    RAY
                    Tommy's in rehab.  Worked like a
                    charm.

                                    LEE DREXLER
                    Very smart, Raymond.  Excellent.  
                          (kisses Abby)
                    Hi, sweetheart.  You look beautiful. 
                    How's Calabasas?
                          (beat, referring to
                            Ray)
                    What I have to pay him? He could
                    move you to Bel-Air.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        37.

                                    LEE DREXLER (CONT'D)
                          (loves to bust his
                            balls in front of
                            Abby)
                    Who lives in Calabasas anyway? 
                    Sinbad?  Howie Mandel?  Jesus, Ray.  

      Abby sinks. Ray shoots him a look, he loathes Lee Drexler. 
      He and Abby enter the temple as Lee hurries to greet someone
      else.


      Ashley gets out of Ray's car. 

                                    RAY
                    Listen to me.  You crossed a line. 
                    You don't come near me or my family
                    again.

      He stares at her for a long beat.  She smiles and waves as
      she goes to get into her car.  Ray zooms off.

      Abby calls him on his cell.  He answers over the speaker.

                                    ABBY
                    You promised me, Ray. Don't come
                    home.

      She hangs up on him.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A young woman, BRIDGET, 17 now, with a blonde shag and too
      much eye-makeup, wavers on the edge of a roof.  She is high,
      crying, deliberating on whether or not to jump.  Just as she
      jumps --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      Ray drives past the guardhouse, starts taking the green
      verdant streets up past huge estates, the Bel-air hotel. 


      The huge gates open up and Ray drives up into a courtyard,
      filled with cars.


      Ray and Abby and the kids drive along the Pacific Coast
      Highway with the top down.  It's a spectacular day.  The
      azure sea dotted with sailboats, surfers.  Bridget is still
      pissed at him.


      As he drives home to his family, lost in thought.


      A limo pulls up, Daryll driving and Mickey next to him in
      the front seat.

      Mickey exits, walks to the front door.

      Abby opens it, waits.  Mickey walks towards her, opens his
      arms to her and she falls into them.  He begins to talk to
      her in a low, soothing tone.  Like a cobra hypnotizing a
      mongoose.

                                      MICKEY
                    Pictures don't do you justice, Abby. 
                    You're beautiful.  When I wrote to
                    you?  All those letters?  From the
                    bottom of my heart, Abby.  I'm an
                    old man.  I need to make it right. 
                    He hates me, Abby.  Why, I don't
                    know.                                                                                        63.

      She opens the door to let him in.  Bridget is waiting behind
      her.  She runs to her grandfather and he kneels down to
      embrace her.  The wolf is in the gate. 

      As Daryll watches from the car, we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:
