Dexter extends an arm around the boy.

                                    DEXTER
                    You ready? 

Cody bravely lets go as Dexter flushes, then eagerly looks 
up.      

                                    CODY
                    Can I have cereal now? 

Off a nod from Dexter, Cody races out the door.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    We all grieve in our own way. 

He peers into the toilet. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Yet another I ve sent to a watery 
                    grave. 
                            (a beat, frowns)
                    Well, not quite.

Dexter reaches over.  Flushing the toilet again. 


Dexter enters to find RITA and ASTOR flipping through a 
recipe book at the breakfast table.  Cody is already in his 
chair, loading up a bowl with cereal.  

                                    RITA
                    What about this one?                                                                                          2.



Astor shakes her head.  Rita tries another page.

                                    CODY
                    I want angel cake.

                                    ASTOR
                    It s angel food, stupid.  And you 
                    don t get a vote.  It s my birthday.

                                    RITA
                    Guys...

Rita gets up from the table.  While crossing to the stove, 
she whispers to Dexter... 

                                    RITA
                    How d it go?

                                    DEXTER
                    Bob the goldfish, may he rest in 
                    peace.

                                    RITA
                    Thanks for taking care of that.  
                    Dead stuff... 

                                    DEXTER
                            (shudders)
                    I know. 

                                    RITA
                    Well, have a seat.  Your reward for 
                    coming over early is on its way.

Dexter spies the recipe book.  Inside a photo of a decorated 
  birthday cake. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I don t get birthdays.  The party.  
                    The song.  Celebrating another year 
                    just being alive feels... forced.  

As Dexter sits at the table, Astor points to a page.  

                                    ASTOR
                    That one!  That s what I want, Mom.

  Crossing back with an omelette for Dexter, Rita puts the 
plate in front of him while glancing at Astor s selection.

                                    RITA
                    Coconut it is.                                                                                          3.



                                    CODY
                    I hate coconut.

                                    RITA
                    You ve never had coconut.

  Dexter s phone RINGS.  He checks to see who s calling.

                                    DEXTER
                    It s dispatch.  I might have to settle 
                    for toast to go.

He gets up from the table.  Flips open his phone. 

                                    DEXTER
                    Morgan.

Listening, Dexter grabs a strip of bacon.  Takes a bite.

                                    DEXTER
                    Sure.  What s the location? 

PUSH IN on Dexter s face.  A look of unsettling dread.  

                                    DEXTER
                    I ll be right there.


Dexter enters to find Debra in the cramped dining area, her 
body blocking his view.  As he comes closer, Dexter can t 
believe his eyes... 

A PAIR OF FEET  

stick out from the end of a table. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Impossible.

Then, coming alongside his sister, Dexter sees who the feet 
belong to...

VALERIE CASTILLO 

Her naked body lies atop the Air-Stream s small dinner 
table, posed eerily similar to the Ice Truck Killer s 
  victims.  The carotid arteries on her neck slashed open.  

  QUICKFLASH.  Dexter tosses a small bag with pieces of Jorge 
overboard, then all of Valerie in a bag that s much larger. 

BACK TO SCENE.  Debra looks to her brother. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Some place-setting, huh?  We re 
                    running her prints now.                                                                                          5.



  Dexter s mind races.  The implications staggering.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    It had to be the Ice Truck Killer.  
                    He s watching me.  

                                    DEBRA
                    Dex?

He snaps out of it.  

                                    DEXTER
                    Good.  ID the victim.  What else have 
                    you found?  

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                            (re: body)
                    That ain t enough? 

                                    DEXTER
                    Any eyewitnesses?

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    What do you care?  Just worry about 
                    the blood.   

Doakes  phone RINGS.  Debra watches him check to see who s 
calling but not pick up. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Gonna answer that?

He turns off the ringer.  Annoyed, Doakes takes it out on 
Dexter. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    This tin can smells like ass, Morgan.  
                    The sooner you get busy, the sooner we 
                    finger who did this.

As Doakes heads for the door, Debra gives her brother a shrug.

                                    DEBRA
                    You heard the man. 

Debra follows after Doakes.  Left on his own, Dexter moves 
closer to study Valerie Castillo s miraculous return. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.  
                    He s getting back at me for not 
                    killing that security guard.   

Dexter is mere inches from Valerie s face.                                                                                             6.



                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    For not playing his game.  


Rita waits patiently for Cody and Astor.  

                                    RITA
                    Guys, hurry up, you re gonna be late 
                    for school.  

Astor enters.  Rita helps with her bookbag.   

                                    RITA
                    I m headed to the store.  Anything you 
                    want for the party?  Balloons aren t 
                    much of a list.

                                    ASTOR
                    It s okay.  I don t need that other 
                    stuff.  It costs too much.   

Rita bends over so she s eye-level with her daughter. 

                                    RITA
                    How  bout you let me worry about that.  
                    This is your party.  And you can have 
                    whatever you want. 

Finally ready for school, Cody zooms by as the phone RINGS.  
Rita picks up.  

                                    RITA
                    Hello...

Listening, her whole body language changes.  Rita covers the 
  mouthpiece.  Offers an unconvincing smile to her children.   

                                    RITA
                    Wait in the car, okay?

She takes the phone with her into the other room. 

                                    CODY
                    What s wrong with Mom?

But Astor knows.  Concerned.

                                    ASTOR
                    She only gets that way when she s 
                    talking to Dad.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                          7.



  STEADICAM POV 

of white flesh over-saturated under high intensity lights. 
Then, coming into view, a long red incision.  We re...


REVEAL Dexter with a camcorder.  He s using it to document the 
wounds on Valerie Castillo s neck, and as an excuse to look over 
  Masuka s shoulder.

                                    DEXTER
                    Got anything?

                                    MASUKA
                    No bruising.  Nothing under her nails.  
                    She didn t put up a fight.  If she was 
                    killed here, which I doubt, whoever 
                    did it was a real pro.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Under normal circumstances I d take 
                    that as a compliment. 

Dexter lowers the camcorder.

                                    DEXTER
                    Prints?  

                                    MASUKA
                    She s clean. 

He looks around.  Recoils.

                                    MASUKA
                    This trailer, that s another matter.  
                    I don t even want to know what some of 
                    those stains are.

  Noticing something outside the trailer, Dexter peeks through 
the bent, metal blinds of a cracked window...  

                                                                          CUT TO:


  Worried, Dexter sees LaGuerta, Doakes and Debra take off.

                                    MASUKA S VOICE
                    Yo, Dex... 

  Reluctantly, he turns to see Masuka examining Valerie 
Castillo s neck.

                                    MASUKA
                    ...zoom in on this, will ya?

Dexter hesitates, not looking to help this investigation.

                                    DEXTER
                    Kinda low on batteries here. 

                                    MASUKA
                    Dude, it ll take like two seconds. 

  Dexter s stuck and he knows it.    

                                    MASUKA
                    What s up with you today?  You re 
                    throwing off my chi. 

Dexter raises the camera to his eye.

                                    DEXTER
                    You re not Chinese.

                                    MASUKA
                    Whatever.  
                            (points)
                    Right here.                                                                                          9.



  CAMCORDER POV

ZOOMING IN on a tiny, red dot located near the arterial neck 
wound. 

                                    MASUKA S VOICE
                    This look like a needle mark to you?

QUICK FLASHCUT.  Dexter jamming his syringe into Valerie 
Castillo s neck. 

BACK TO SCENE.  Dexter has to cover...

                                    DEXTER
                    More like a bug bite.  A blemish 
                    maybe.  

Masuka stands.  Makes a note of it. 

                                    MASUKA
                    Yeah, I guess.  I m gonna let the 
                    coroner bag her.     

Once Masuka moves off, Dexter rushes back to the window.  
  Helpless, he watches as LaGuerta, Doakes and Debra enter a 
windowless garage. 


FIND Doakes, Debra and Laguerta inside.  The stench in the 
  simmering midday heat is overwhelming.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    This ain t no auto garage.

Debra wanders past rotting food.  Soiled clothing.  A lone 
shoe.  Swatting away flies, she finds a hole in the ground.  
Peers inside... 

                                    DEBRA
                    Oh God.  I didn t need to see that.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                            (unfazed)
                    What s the matter, Morgan, never seen 
                    a shit pit before?

                                    DEBRA
                    Uh, yeah, just not indoors. 

They continue to fan out.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Army taught me a lot of things.                                                                                           10.



                                    LAGUERTA
                    This gonna be one of your Desert Storm 
                    stories? 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    But diggin  holes for people to take a 
                    dump, that was the most important.   

                                    DEBRA
                    Not really following that.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Don t matter how many bars you got on 
                    your collar... 

                                    LAGUERTA
                      ...everybody s shit stinks.  

She turns to Debra.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    We were partners for a long time. 

Doakes kicks at a thin, stained mattress.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    And from the looks of things, Valerie 
                      Castillo s better half was knee deep. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    You like the husband for this?

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    It s always the husband.

Debra crouches down.  Examines a tiny set of numbers etched 
into the metal wall.  

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    What ve you got?

                                    DEBRA
                              (squinting)
                    Looks like a phone number...  and a 
                    name... Mariel. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Call it in to Batista.  He can run it 
                    down for us. 

THROUGH THE LARGE GARAGE DOOR

Doakes sees a UNIFORM (FORBES, 20s) silently waving him over.                                                                                           11.



                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Heads up.


Still watching from the window, Dexter has seen it all.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I can t breathe.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


TEENAGE DEBRA (13, glasses) watches as HARRY takes a shotgun 
from his gun cabinet and hands it to TEENAGE DEXTER (15). 

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    Why can t I go with you?

                                    HARRY
                    Deb, we ve been through this.

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    I can stay in the car.  I have my 
                    books.  Or I could just walk with you 
                    guys.  I promise I ll be quiet.  You 
                    won t even know I m there.

                                    HARRY
                    The pheasants will.  

Harry sets aside a shotgun for himself then locks the 
  cabinet s glass door.

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    But Dexter was my age when --

                                    HARRY
                    That s enough.  The Logans are 
                    waiting.  Did you pack your swimsuit?

                                    TEENAGE DEBRA
                    Yes.

                                    HARRY
                    Good.  I want to see that back flip of 
                    yours when we get back. 

  Dejected, she turns and goes.                                                                                           14.



                                    HARRY
                    We ll be out in the car in a sec.

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    Deb does kinda have a point.

                                    HARRY
                    What we do on these weekends... your 
                    sister can never know about.

Dexter slides his shotgun into a leather carrying case.

                                    TEENAGE DEXTER
                    I hate always lying to her like this.  

                                    HARRY
                    Keeping the truth from the people 
                    closest to you is how you ll survive.  
                    And how you ll protect them if 
                    something ever goes wrong.  

OFF Dexter...

                                                                END FLASHBACK:


Doakes and Debra arrive to find BATISTA waiting for them.

                                    BATISTA
                    I was able to track down that name, 
                    Mariel, with the number you called in.  
                    She s a Cuban refugee staying with 
                    cousins.  I had a car bring her in.

They cross the bullpen.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Why carve the number in the wall?  

                                    BATISTA
                    Next of kin in case something happened 
                    to her.  She says Jorge Castillo was 
                    holding her and six others captive at 
                    his salvage yard. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Explains that garage.

                                    BATISTA
                    If the family doesn t pay a  release  
                    fee, then the coyote dumps their ass 
                      overboard.  Cocksuckers make me sick.                                                                                          15.



Back at Batista s desk, MARIEL, 30s, stands as they 
  approach.  She s skittish.  Uneasy.

                                    BATISTA
                    Estos son mis amigos que te dije.  
                    Este es Sargento Doakes y el Oficial 
                    Morgan.  <<These are the friends I was 
                    telling you about.  This is Sergeant 
                    Doakes and Officer Morgan.>>

Batista TRANSLATES back and forth. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Mariel, can you tell us when was the 
                    last time you saw Jorge Castillo?

                                    BATISTA
                    Mariel, diganos cuando fue la ultima 
                    vez que usted vio a Jorge Castillo?

Mariel speaks directly to Batista...

                  MARIELBATISTA
Cuando el nos encerro When he locked her up with 
despues que de nosotros nos the other refugees after 
bajamos del barco.pulling them off the boat.

Choked with emotion, Mariel continues...

                  MARIELBATISTA
  Nosotros no teniamos comida They went without food.  
ni agua.  Un hombre trato de Water.  One man tried to 
  escapar, pero Jorge lo escape and was beaten by 
agarro y lo golpeo.Jorge. 

                                    DEBRA
                    How d she get free?

                                    BATISTA
                    Como escapo?

                  MARIELBATISTA
Alguien desatranco la puerta Someone just unlocked the 
del garaje y nosotros door to the garage. 
escapamos. 

  Mariel s anguish slowly turns... to anger.

                  MARIELBATISTA
Cuando los agarraren, She wants us to make them 
aganlos sufrir especialmente pay for what they did, 
a ese concha.especially that concha who 
                                            treated them like dogs.                                                                                              16.



                                    DEBRA
                    Concha?

Mariel emphatically points to Debra s crotch. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Ah.  Gotcha. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Fuck me.  The wife was in on it. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Ask if she knows the little boy Social 
                    Services picked up.  

                                    BATISTA
                    Quien era el chico pequeno con usted?

Mariel is confused by the question...

                  MARIELBATISTA
Que chico?  Yo nunca vi a un She never saw any boy. 
chico.


Reading an autopsy report, Dexter s eyes nervously dart back 
and forth.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    No hair.  No fibers.  C-O-D 
                      exsanguination.  So far, so...

  Annoyed, he stops.

                                    DEXTER
                    You re hovering.

REVEAL Masuka pacing behind him.  Excited.  

                                    MASUKA
                    Keep reading. 

                                    DEXTER
                    What am I even looking for?

                                    MASUKA
                    Wait for it.    

                                    DEXTER
                    This is the prelim, I don t have time 
                    for... 

Masuka turns the page for him.  Points.                                                                                           17.



                                    MASUKA
                      M-fucking-99.

                                    DEXTER
                    ...games.

  Stunned, Dexter has to feign ignorance. 

                                    DEXTER
                       Etorphine Hydrochloride? 

                                    MASUKA
                    An animal tranquilizer more powerful 
                    than morphine.  Causes total 
                      paralysis.  That mark on her neck kept 
                    bugging me so I ordered up a tox 
                    screen.  

Dexter looks down at the autopsy report again.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    That s it.  No more donuts for Masuka.

                                    MASUKA
                    Stuff s strictly controlled.  Only way 
                    to get it is with a DEA license.  I 
                    put in a request for their list.  I ll 
                    have it for Doakes in the morning. 

Dexter hands back the report.  Forces a smile.

                                    DEXTER
                    Good work.  

As Masuka exits, the cold reality sets in for Dexter... 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I m on that list.  And eventually, the 
                    alias I used will lead them back to 
                    me.  Tick-tock.   

  Dexter s phone RINGS.  He looks to see who it is and puts on 
a happy face as he answers.

                                    DEXTER
                    Hey you...

                                                                        INTERCUT:


With the phone to her ear, Rita paces in the kitchen.                                                                                           18.



                                    RITA
                    I m glad you picked up.  I really need 
                    to talk with someone. 

Through the glass window, Dexter sees Doakes, Debra and 
Batista huddling in the bullpen.

                                    DEXTER
                      Everything okay?

                                    RITA
                    Paul called after you left. 

  Distracted, Dexter takes his phone with him.  Crossing to 
his door to keep an eye on his colleagues. 

                                    DEXTER 
                    Paul?  Who s Paul?

                                    RITA
                    My soon to be ex?  He s already out of 
                    jail.  Overcrowding.  Can you believe 
                    it?  Every time things start to go 
                    just a little bit right, something 
                    like this happens.  
                            (sighs)
                    He wants to come to Astor s party.

                                    DEXTER
                    What did you tell him?

                                    RITA
                    I d have to think about it.  But even 
                    if I say no, he won t listen.  He 
                    never does.
                            (beat)
                    Can you come over tonight? 

  LaGuerta urgently joins the others in the bullpen.  Dexter s 
trying to focus on Rita, but he s dying to hear what they re 
talking about. 

                                    DEXTER
                    I don t know... I m kinda under the 
                    gun here.  Big case.

                                    RITA
                      I shouldn t be dumping all this stuff 
                    on you.  I m sorry.

                                    DEXTER
                    No, no, don t be.  Tell you what, I ll 
                    drop by if I can.  Promise.                                                                                            19.



                                    RITA
                     kay.  I ll keep a plate warm just in 
                    case. 

                                    DEXTER
                    Thanks.  Bye. 

Dexter quickly grabs some files and heads out into the 
bullpen...


...but he s too late.  Everyone is breaking off. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    ...I m headed over there now to 
                    see if we can bring the little boy 
                    in for a sketch. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                            (to Batista)
                    Check the marinas.  Find Jorge 
                      Castillo s boat.  
                            (to Debra)
                    We ll search the house.  Let s 
                    roll.

As LaGuerta, Doakes and Debra move away, Dexter is left in 
the dust.  Only Batista remains behind.       

                                    DEXTER
                    Sketch? 

Batista grabs his hat then heads for the front door.  Dexter

                    The kid told Social Services some guy 
                    saved him from the  bad lady.    

The news hits Dexter like a ton of bricks.

                                    DEXTER
                    Valerie Castillo.

                                    BATISTA
                    Sounds like she got exactly what she 
                    had coming to her.  Personally, I d 
                    shake this guy s hand.  

Dexter watches him go. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Oh, you say that now.                                                                                          20.




TECHS filter in and out of the room.  From a hamper, clothes 
are being separated into brown evidence bags.  PAN OVER. 
FIND Doakes combing through Jorge Castillo s desk while 
Debra searches a file cabinet nearby.   

                                    DEBRA
                    Found his passport.   

She opens it, glancing at the photo. 

                                    DEBRA
                    God, I feel like I need a shower just 
                    looking at this douchebag. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Keep searchin .  Phone records.  Bank 
                    accounts.  Credit cards.  Maybe the 
                    wife got greedy and that s why he 
                    killed her. 

                                    DEBRA
                              (unconvinced)
                    Maybe. 

They continue to search.  A long beat.

                                    DEBRA
                    This morning, at the salvage yard, 
                    what was that thing at the car? 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    What thing?

                                    DEBRA
                    Right before you opened the trunk.  
                    You like tried to cock block me or 
                      something.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Just looking out for my team. 

                                    DEBRA
                    I didn t see you looking out for 
                    LaGuerta. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    I would if she asked.

                                    DEBRA
                    I didn t ask.                                                                                           21.



                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Fine.  Next time, get your ass shot.

  Frustrated, Doakes slams a drawer shut.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Our guy may have skipped town. 

                                    DEBRA
                    If he even did it.  
                            (off Doakes  reaction)
                    What if we have a copycat killer on 
                    our hands? 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Bit of a stretch, don t you think? 

                                    DEBRA
                    Just hear me out.  What if the person 
                    who killed Valerie Castillo was trying 
                    to bleed her out like the Ice Truck 
                    Killer, but didn t know how?  

Amused by Debra s enthusiasm, Doakes sits in the office chair.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    She wasn t a hooker.

                                    DEBRA
                    But she was killed someplace else, 
                    dumped, and laid out in a ritualistic 
                    manner.  Just like all the others.  

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                     Cept she wasn t in pieces. 

                                    DEBRA
                    What about the cuts on her neck?  
                    Those weren t done by some amateur.  
                    And we have yet to find a murder 
                    weapon.  

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    It s always the husband.

                                    DEBRA
                    All I m saying is that with all the 
                    media coverage about the ice truck 
                    murders, it s possible.  

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    So what do you suggest?                                                                                           22.



                                    DEBRA
                    Let me work up a profile.  Just in 
                    case Jorge s a deadend. 

Doakes considers it.  Sighs.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    What the hell. 

Doakes  phone RINGS.  He checks the caller, then turns off 
the ringer again.

                                    DEBRA
                    That s the second time today you ve 
                    made that face.  Who re you avoiding?

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    We ve got one more stop to make.


Doakes pulls up and stops in front of a nice house in what 
was probably once a nice part of Miami.

                                    DEBRA
                    What s this?

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    You wanted to know who s been calling.  
                    My mom lives here.

                                    DEBRA
                    Forget your laundry?

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    She s been on me to stop by for 
                    dinner, so... I m stopping by.  Here s 
                    the plan: we go in.  Eat.  Get out 
                    before the cheesecake.

                                    DEBRA
                              (realizing)
                    Oh my God... I m what, your exit 
                    strategy?

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Look, you can stay out here, which 
                    gives me an even better excuse to 
                    leave early, or you can come inside 
                    and get some free food.  Your call. 

He opens his car door.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Oh, and my sisters are probably here 
                    too.

Doakes exits, leaving Debra to stew.  A long beat.  Screw 
this.  She gets out, following her partner up the sidewalk.                                                                                          24.




As Astor and Cody work on  Happy Birthday  banners on the 
floor of the living room.  FIND Dexter holding a plate, 
  watching them playfully snatch markers from one another. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I wonder in time if they ll even 
                    remember me.  Other than the man who 
                    broke their mother s heart.  
                            (beat)
                    I ll be breaking their hearts too. 

  Entering from the kitchen, Rita continues to clear the 
table, picking up on a conversation Dexter isn t a part of.   

                                    RITA
                    ...he is their father, they need to 
                    know he s been released, right?  

A beat.  Dexter realizes that wasn t rhetorical, but all he 
can offer is...  

                                    DEXTER
                    Yeah.  Sure.  

                                    RITA
                    Even if I tell Paul not to come, he ll 
                    show up here eventually.  I know him.  

Dexter grabs some silverware and follows Rita... 

IN THE KITCHEN

Rita sets plates down on the counter. 

                                    RITA
                      Everything s been going so good at 
                    work.  With you. 
                            (beat)
                    I don t know what to do.   

                                    DEXTER
                    He s really got a hold on you, doesn t 
                    he? 

Where does she even begin?

                                    RITA
                    Paul always had a temper, but when he 
                    was using... he said if I ever left 
                    he d find us and hurt the kids.  
                    Somehow I convinced myself that by 
                    staying I was protecting them.                                                                                                  25.



She starts rinsing off dishes.  Self-conscious.  Ashamed.  

                                    RITA
                    Cody s too young to remember the 
                    worst of it.  But Astor... she s 
                    the one who called the police the 
                    last time.  She was protecting me.  

Dexter takes a plate from her.  Lifts her chin with his 
hand. 

                                    DEXTER
                    You re not that woman anymore.  You re 
                    stronger now, and when their dad shows 
                    up, we ll deal with it together. 

                                    CODY S VOICE
                    Dad s coming home?!

REVEAL Cody and Astor in the doorway.  Unable to contain 
  himself, Cody starts pulling on Rita.

                                    CODY
                    When will he be here? 

Astor remains frozen.  Then, without a word, she heads back 
into the living room.  Rita follows after her with Cody in 
tow, wanting to know more...   

                                    CODY
                    Can he sleep in my room?

Alone, Dexter leans back, both hands against the counter.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      I shouldn t even be here.  Rita will 
                    be devastated if I m arrested.  Her 
                    husband was a crackhead and her 
                      boyfriend s a serial killer.  It s 
                    kind of hard not to take that 
                      personally. 


FIND Debra, Doakes, his mother GINNY (60s), and sisters JESS 
and RONI (30s) seated around the dinner table.  Debra is 
  entertaining them with tales from Vice. 

                                    DEBRA
                    ...so this john comes out of nowhere, 
                    he s got me by the throat, and I can t 
                    reach around for my gun.  Then, I see 
                    his nipple ring.                                                                                           26.



The women react.  They see where this is going.

                                    DEBRA
                    I yanked that fucker out like it was a

                    Girl, the first words out of my baby 
                    brother s mouth were,  Got milk, 
                      motherfucker? 

The sisters break into giggles.  Doakes is the odd man, and 
lone man, out.  And Debra is loving it.  She fits right in.

                                    GINNY
                    That s enough, you two.

                                    RONI
                    That security guard on the news

                    Someone did a hatchet job on me like

                                    DEBRA
                    Tony s doin  okay.  The hospital is 
                    fitting him with prosthetics.  And 
                    he s just got this spirit about him.  
                    I mean, the guy s missing body parts 
                    because of this ice truck asshole, and 
                    he s still hitting on me. 

                                    GINNY
                    That s because men only think with one 
                    body part.  And that one wasn t cut 
                    off.

Doakes puts his napkin on his plate.  Then, to Debra...

                    C mon, we got a case to solve.

                    You sure?  I ve got cheesecake in the 
                    fridge. 

                                    RONI
                            (to Debra)
                    And none of that store bought shit.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Yeah, we re sure. 

But Debra is having a good time. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Y know, I d love some cheesecake. 
                            (then, to Doakes)
                    You can wait in the car.  Your 
                    call.  

OFF Doakes, realizing this was a bad idea...


Inside the Air Stream, Dexter begins to shiver.  Cautiously 
moving forward, he finds Harry standing over Valerie 
  Castillo (her throat still cut) lying on the dinner table.

                                    HARRY
                    Sorry  bout the A/C.  She likes it 
                    cold.

                                    DEXTER
                    Dad, what re you doing here?

Harry shakes his head.

                                    HARRY
                    You let me down, Dexter.  

Harry takes Valerie s hand and she comes to life.  Helping 
her up, Harry escorts her past Dexter and toward the door.  

                                    DEXTER
                    But it s not my fault... someone else 
                    is out there...  he s like me...  but 
                    he s not like me.

Harry exits with Valerie.  As the door shuts behind them,  
Dexter tries the handle, it won t budge.  He s locked inside.  

                                    DEXTER
                    He did this!  Dad... DAD!

TIGHT ON Dexter s ear.  Ruby red lips moving INTO FRAME. 

                                    DEBRA S VOICE
                    He s dead.  Dumbass.

ROTATE CAMERA.  Dexter is now flat on his back on the Air 
  Stream s table.  Like one of his victims, he s strapped 
down.  Debra, in her Vice sex suit, is by his side.  

                                    DEBRA
                    Why didn t you tell me what you are, 
                    Dex? 

She slowly slices his cheek with a scalpel. 

                                    DEBRA
                    I m your sister.  Okay, not by blood, 
                    but they know what I mean.

Desperate, Dexter looks to his RIGHT -- there s Rita, looking 
  beautiful and glamorous in black.  She pulls Cody and Astor close, 
  shielding their faces.                                                                                            29.



Dexter looks LEFT -- Doakes and Batista are in full-dress 
  uniforms while LaGuerta holds hands with Oscar who bites 
into a big tuft of pink cotton candy.    

As Dexter peers down at his FEET, he notices -- A MAN bathed 
in shadow.  Slowly, the man opens his hand.  Dangling from 
it... 

THE DOLL HEAD

                                    DEBRA
                    Any last words?

Dexter tries frantically to tell Debra there s the Ice Truck 
Killer she s been looking for, but no words come out.  With 
  a shrug, Debra raises a butcher s cleaver. 

                                    DEBRA
                      Figures...

OFF Debra, a killer swing...

                                                                  SLAM CUT TO:


Dexter gasps awake.  Throwing back the sheets, he s covered 
in sweat.  He lies there.  Motionless.     

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I don t have bad dreams.  When I 
                    sleep, all of me sleeps.  Nothing ever 
                    goes bump in Dexter s night.  

Getting up, Dexter crosses to the window.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I ve never felt a moment of remorse.  
                    Doubt.  Regret.  

He sees his haggard, distorted features in the window.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    What s happening to me? 

As Dexter pulls back, his reflection simply... disappears. 


PULL BACK.  FIND Dexter, unkempt, sitting at a computer.  He 
takes a big gulp of coffee as he continues his search.                                                                                          31.



                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    If my back wasn t against the wall, 
                    and I wasn t working on no sleep, I d 
                    almost feel guilty for hacking into 
                    Masuka s email.  Once I got past all 
                    the porn, it was easy to -- 

ON SCREEN

the name DR. JEFF LINDSAY with a Ft. Lauderdale address and 
DEA license number underneath is highlighted.  A beat.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    And there I am.  Dr. Jeff Lindsay.  So 
                      wholesome.  So inconspicuous.     

He hits delete.  The name and its information disappears.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Harry would frown upon destroying 
                    evidence, but he never wanted me to 
                    get caught either.  If I can give 
                    myself more time, maybe I can figure 
                    out a way to -- 

                                    DEBRA S VOICE
                    What re you doing in here?

REVEAL Debra in the doorway.  Dexter clicks on the  Keep As 
New  tab, closes the window, then quickly logs off. 

                                    DEXTER
                    My computer froze.  Needed to check 
                    some email. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Can you take a look at this for me?

  Crossing, she hands him a folder.  Dexter notices the title... 

                                    DEXTER
                    Copycat killer?

                                    DEBRA
                    I worked on this profile all night.  
                    I d like to give it to LaGuerta.  But 
                    I want to make sure it s good enough 
                    first. 

Dexter hesitates.  

                                    DEXTER
                    I m... honored.                                                                                           32.



Then, begrudgingly, he opens the folder.  Reading outloud...

                                    DEXTER
                     The similar manner in which the 
                    victim s body was displayed suggests 
                    this killer feels a connection to the 
                    Ice Truck Killer, excited by what he s 
                    doing.   

He looks up but Debra urges him to keep going.

                                    DEXTER
                     The cut on the victim s cheek, while 
                    not fatal, appears to be a signature 
                    of sorts.  Because of the lack of 
                    forensic evidence collected from the 
                    crime scene, the suspect may be 
                    familiar with law enforcement 
                      procedure.       

Dexter stares at the document.  He has to nip this in the bud.

                                    DEBRA
                    Why d you stop?  You were just getting 
                    to the good stuff. 

                                    DEXTER
                    Let me guess, single white male.    
                    Mid-30s.  Disconnected from his 
                    emotions.  Lives alone.  It s a  
                    little textbook, don t you think?  

Dexter hands back the file and Debra is thrown.  He s always 
been there for her. 

                                    DEBRA
                    But it totally fits this case.

                                    DEXTER
                    Or, you re trying to make it fit.  My 
                    advice?  Keep this to yourself. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Really?

                                    DEXTER
                    Deb, you re new in Homicide.  If 
                    this blows up in your face, you ve 
                    given LaGuerta the excuse she s 
                    been looking for to send you back 
                    to Vice. 

His sister mulls it over.  Then, defiantly...                                                                                          33.



                                    DEBRA
                    No... I m on to something.  I can feel 
                    it, like one of your hunches.  

She turns to go.  A little hurt.

                                    DEBRA
                    But way to have my back. 

OFF Dexter, feeling truly horrible...

                                                                      FLASHBACK:


Reading a comic book on his bed, Dexter looks up to see 
Harry standing in the doorway.  Pained.  Urgent. 

                                    HARRY
                    Where s your sister?

                                                                          CUT TO:

A soup can and soda bottle resting on a tree stump.  
  Suddenly, the can rockets into the air with the simultaneous 
sound of a GUNSHOT.  We re...


TIGHT ON Dexter.  Nervously looking around. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES (O.C.)
                      ...starting this morning, we ve got 
                    cadets from the Academy going over 
                    every inch of the salvage yard.   

PULL BACK.  See that Dexter stands next to Masuka among a 
small group of UNIFORM COPS and DETECTIVES, including Debra 
and Batista.  Everyone s being brought up to speed on the 
  Castillo case by Doakes.

                                    BATISTA
                            (to Debra)
                    Those days, I don t miss.                                                                                          35.



                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    The kid we found yesterday saw someone 
                    abduct Valerie Castillo from that 
                    yard.  Because he didn t recognize a 
                    photo of Jorge Castillo, Lt. LaGuerta 
                    is bringing him in to attempt a 
                    sketch.   

Desperate, Dexter strains his neck, looking around.  Hoping 
the kid doesn t walk in this very second. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    In the meantime, we follow up on the 
                    DEA list of M-99 buyers.  Vets.  
                    Doctors.  Animal Control.  Even 
                    circuses. 

  A Uniform hands out copies of the list.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Be thorough.  Check everyone.

He turns to Masuka.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    Where are we on the home and the boat?

                                    MASUKA
                    Still processing.    

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    If it turns out the husband s a dead 
                    end, we re looking at a new suspect.  
                    Officer Morgan, any thoughts?  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Don t do it, Deb.  The last thing I 
                    need right now is to be profiled for 
                    all of Miami-Metro. 

She shoots Dexter a defiant look. 

                                    DEBRA
                    We could be looking at someone who is 
                    inspired by the Ice Truck Killer.  A 
                    copycat.  If so, the suspect is most 
                    likely... 

                                    DEXTER
                            (to Masuka)
                    I ll be in my lab.

But as Dexter pulls away, walking into the station...                                                                                          36.



THE CUBAN BOY

  clutching LaGuerta s hand.  Dexter s caught.  There s 
nowhere to turn.  All he can do is lower his gaze.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Morning, Dex.

                                    DEXTER
                      Lieutenant.

Dexter and the boy pass in SLO-MO.  Dexter can t help 
  himself.  He sneaks a peek and is deeply relieved to see 
that the boy is looking at the ground.  OFF Dexter, 
  hightailing it to his lab...

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

A BLANK SKETCH PAD.  We re...


  Batista, LaGuerta and a MALE SKETCH ARTIST (30s) sit with 
Oscar.  The boy is distant, fidgeting with a crucifix that 
hangs from his neck.  

                                    BATISTA
                    Oscar, el hombre que viste era como yo 
                    o mas chico?  <<Oscar, the man you 
                    saw, was he big like me, or smaller?>>

Oscar remains silent.  His gaze directed at his feet.     

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Hijo, esta bien cuentanos lo que viste 
                    esa noche.  <<Honey, it s okay.  You 
                    can tell us whatever you want from 
                    that night.>>

And still not a peep.  Batista and LaGuerta share a look.  
This is going nowhere.  Then...  

                                    LAGUERTA
                    I ll be right back.

But as she tries to go, Oscar clings to her, scared of the 
men.  LaGuerta motions to Batista, whispering in his ear.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


Oscar s face is covered in white powder as he digs into a 
bag of pastries.                                                                                            37.



                                    BATISTA
                    I forgot how much I loved pastelitos 
                    growing up. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    He just needed a little reminder of 
                    home.   

                                    BATISTA
                    I was barely his age when I came over 
                    with my family.  Threw up the whole 
                    damn way.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    How s your Dad doing?

                                    BATISTA
                    Not so good.  I was thinking about 
                    trying to take him to Havana... but 
                    he s so stubborn.  Says he won t go 
                    back until Castro s taking it up the 
                    ass from Hitler in hell.  

  LaGuerta looks at Batista.  Then, Oscar.

                                    BATISTA
                    What?  He doesn t speak English.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    I don t care.       

She brushes the hair from Oscar s eyes.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    This kid s been around enough ugliness 
                    for a lifetime.    

Oscar looks up at her, finished.    

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Go get the artist.  I think someone s 
                    ready. 


Rita stands on a chair, hanging the birthday banners the kids 
were working on.  Then Cody bursts in, home from school.  He 
heads straight for his Playstation, but Astor lingers behind.  

                                    RITA
                    Did you thank Mrs. Carroll for picking 
                    you up from school for me?                                                                                            38.



                                    ASTOR
                    Yes.

                                    RITA
                            (re: banner)
                    So, what do you think?

Astor plops down on the sofa, sulking. 

                                    RITA
                      Everything okay?

Astor doesn t say a word.  Rita comes down off the chair, 
  kneeling in front of her daughter.

                                    RITA
                    Wanna talk about it?

                                    ASTOR
                    Holly and Blake and Ashley said they 
                    can t come to my party. 

                                    RITA
                    Honey, that s not true.  I spoke with 
                    their mothers last week. 

                                    ASTOR
                    It s all Cody s fault.  He couldn t 
                    keep his mouth shut about Dad coming 
                    home.  He told everyone.  

                                    CODY
                    Did not. 

                                    ASTOR
                    You told EVERYONE!

Astor runs from the room.  Slamming her bedroom door shut 
behind her.  OFF Rita, troubled...


Dexter lingers just outside the doorway.  He s surprised to 
find the room empty and the lights turned off.  Are they 
done already?  Then, he sees it...  

THE SKETCH PAD

face down on the table.  Summoning his courage...    

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I have to know.      

But the moment Dexter sets foot in the room...                                                                                          39.



                                      LAGUERTA S VOICE
                            (an urgent whisper)
                    Dexter?

  Startled, he turns to see LaGuerta on a couch with Oscar 
draped across her lap, sound asleep.  She can t move.     

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Thank God.  My arm s asleep. 

                                    DEXTER
                    How long have the two of you been like 
                    this?

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Half an hour.  I was afraid to move or 
                    I d wake him.  

                                    DEXTER
                    At that age, when they re out,  
                    they re out.  You could brush his 
                    teeth and he wouldn t wake up. 

Dexter picks up LaGuerta s jacket off the back of a chair. 

                                    DEXTER
                    Here, lift his head.  I ll slide this 
                      underneath. 

As LaGuerta gently lifts, Dexter slides the rolled up jacket 
underneath Oscar s head, allowing her to free her arm. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Thanks. 

Oscar stirs a little and Dexter freezes.  If this kid does 
wake up and sees him, it could all be over.   

                                    LAGUERTA
                    What re you doing up here?

                                    DEXTER
                            (covering)
                    Waiting for some lab results.  Had 
                    some time to kill. 

  LaGuerta sees him eyeing the sketch pad.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Go ahead.  We didn t get far.  He s so 
                    tired.  We ll start up again tomorrow.

She looks down at Oscar.  Her hand lightly rubbing his back.                                                                                          40.



                                    LAGUERTA
                    It s just a matter of time before we 
                    know who this little guy saw.    

With great trepidation, Dexter reaches for the pad.  Turning  
it over to find...

A PAIR OF EYES

staring back at him.  They re his eyes.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Windows to the soul...

PUSH in on Dexter, his world collapsing...

                                                                          CUT TO:


QUICK CUTS of Dexter efficiently moving through his place.  
A TRUNK hides a false bottom that contains syringes, small 
bottles of medicine and latex gloves.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...that boy saw my eyes...

Behind COUNTLESS BOOKS on a shelf, Dexter collects 
handcuffs, boxcutters, a scalpel.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...and he knows I have no soul.

Sliding the MATTRESS off his bed, we see that the BOX SPRING 
has been hollowed out.  Inside, layers of plastic sheeting, 
rope, and two, small surgical saws.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    When he gets around to the rest of my 
                    face...

Buried underneath his colorful print shirts in a DRESSER 
DRAWER is a sea of black killing clothes.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...I ve got nowhere left to hide.

  Finally, Dexter removes the front of the AIR CONDITIONING 
UNIT, retrieving his precious box of blood slides.  Into a 
large duffel bag it goes, landing on top of the other items.  
Dexter takes one last look around his place.  Satisfied he 
got everything, he zips up the duffel and heads for the door.                                                                                           41.




Debra exits a stall to find LaGuerta with her face pressed 
up to the mirror.  Frustrated, she curses while prodding 
underneath her bottom eyelid... 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Lente de mierda.

There are only two sinks and Debra needs to use one of them.  
Shit.  Sucking it up, she crosses.  Washing her hands next 
to the LaGuerta.  A beat.  Debra can t help herself...

                                    DEBRA
                    If you...

  Grabbing some paper towels, she dries her hands.

                                    DEBRA
                    ...here.

Debra takes a step toward LaGuerta who stiffens slightly. 

                                    DEBRA
                    You want some help or not?

She tries to relax, allowing Debra to come close. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Damn thing rolled up on me. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Luckily, you re in good hands.  I 
                    ditched my glasses for contacts back 
                    in high school.  

The two women are now mere inches away from one another. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Boys?

                                    DEBRA
                    Yep.  But what I really needed was 
                    tits.  All my bras had Winnie the Pooh 
                    on them until I was 16.  As you can 
                    see, not a lot has changed since then.   
                            (then)
                    Try not to blink.  

She holds LaGuerta s head steady.  A beat. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Your brother s adopted, right?                                                                                           42.



                                    DEBRA
                    Yeah, Dad found him at a crime scene.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    How d the department feel about Harry 
                    getting so personally involved in a 
                    case?  

                                    DEBRA
                    Didn t seem to be a problem.  My folks 
                    never talked about it much.   

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Still, raising a boy, must ve been a 
                    lot of work.  

                                    DEBRA
                    Dex?  God, no.  I got into more 
                    trouble than he ever did.  He was the 
                    perfect one...
                            (then)
                      ...there s the little bastard.

She begins gently pushing underneath LaGuerta s eyelid.

                                    DEBRA
                    Can I ask you something?
                            (off LaGuerta s nod)
                    Why do you have it in for me?

Without hesitation, or malice, the Lieutenant tells her. 

                                    LAGUERTA
                    You re loud.  Impulsive.  And you 
                      constantly question authority. 

Debra delicately fishes out the lens.  Hands it to LaGuerta.

                                    DEBRA
                    Fair enough.

  LaGuerta turns to squirt some solution into her palm.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    So I hear you have an interesting 
                    theory about who --

But looking in the mirror, she sees Debra is already gone.


Alone on the couch, Rita watches the late news.  Looking up, 
she sees Astor enter the room, half asleep.

                                    RITA
                    Honey, what is it?

  Ashamed, Astor can t form the words.  Instead, she takes 
Rita by the hand.                                                                                          45.




Astor leads her mother into her bedroom.  Cody is sound 
asleep, but there in the middle of Astor s sheets is an oval 
wet spot.

                                    ASTOR
                    I m sorry... I...

And the tears come.

                                    ASTOR
                    ...I didn t mean to.

Rita pulls her close.

                                    RITA
                    Oh, sweetie... it s alright.
                            (a hug)
                    These things happen.  Now, c mon, 
                    let s get you changed. 

As Rita opens a dresser drawer to pull out new night 
  clothes, Astor stops her. 

                                    ASTOR
                    Mommy... would it be okay if I didn t 
                    have my party?

OFF Rita, considering this heartbreaking request...


At his desk, wearing latex gloves, Dexter removes Valerie 
Castillo s slide from the tray.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I was wrong the whole time... 

With a steel-point, he gently breaks the dried blood drop in 
half, eliminating the smiley face in the process. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...my playmate saw an opportunity to 
                    paint me into a corner to see if I d 
                    find my way out...  

Using a piece of clear adhesive tape, Dexter applies it to 
one half of the slide.  Running his gloved finger over the 
tape, he presses down, smoothing it out.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...if I d fight to survive.                                                                                           46.



TIGHT ON the tape as Dexter delicately lifts off one half of 
blood drop from the slide as if it were a fingerprint.  He 
rolls his chair to the other side of the desk.  

A LARGE BONING KNIFE 

rests atop clear plastic.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Transferring a dried drop of blood is 
                      relatively easy, if you have a well-
                    preserved sample.

Ever so carefully, he transfers half of the drop of blood 
from the tape onto the knife s razor sharp blade.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


Dexter withdraws a man s black sock from an evidence bag.  
Placing it on his desk, he reaches into a pocket, withdrawing 
Valerie Castillo s slide in a small baggie.  Carefully, he 
begins scraping off the remaining dried flecks onto the sock.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Now for the hard part.

  Glancing out his window into the bullpen, Dexter sees...

                                                                          CUT TO:


Doakes at his desk as Debra crosses with a stack of mug 
shots. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Just got off the phone with the FBI.  
                    Wanted to see what their computers 
                    would spit out.  I cross-referenced my 
                    profile with the Ice Truck Killer 
                    list...

  Proudly, she tosses the photos on Doakes  desk.

                                    DEBRA
                    ...eleven new hits.     

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    How  bout we hold off until there s a 
                    sketch.  Take it from there.                                                                                           47.



                                    DEBRA
                    I know, I know.  I just wanna get a 
                    head start on this. 
                            (beat)
                    We could look these over at lunch.  My 
                    treat. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    You never give up, do --

Doakes  phone RINGS.  He checks to see who s calling, then 
turns off the ringer.  Debra knows exactly who that was. 

                                    DEBRA
                    Thank Ginny again for the other night.  
                    I can t even remember the last time I 
                    met a guy s family and they liked me. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    You held your own.  Most don t get a 
                    dirty word in edge-wise with my 
                    sisters around the dinner table. 

                                    DEBRA
                    In our house for dinner, every 
                    Thursday night was pancake night.  
                    Morgan tradition.

She sees Dexter on fast approach. 

                                    DEBRA
                    I miss that kind of stuff, y know?

                                    DEXTER
                    I found something.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

TIGHT ON a black sock.  PULL BACK.  We re...


Doakes and Debra stand beside Dexter looking at the sock 
laid out on an evidence tray. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    The wife s blood, you re sure?

                                    DEXTER
                    Without a doubt.  This was found in 
                    the Castillo s bedroom hamper.  We 
                    check all clothing items brought in.  
                    Because of sheer volume, sometimes 
                    that takes awhile.                                                                                               48.



                                    DEBRA
                    Still doesn t prove anything.  

                                    DEXTER
                    Not by itself, but I re-examined the 
                    footage I took that morning... 

He picks up a remote control.  Pushes Play.   

ON A NEARBY TV MONITOR

footage rolls of Valerie Castillo s neck wounds. 

                                    DEXTER
                    Notice the cuts along the carotid 
                    arteries.  Long.  Deep.  Valerie 
                    Castillo bled to death in minutes. 

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    No shit. 

                                    DEXTER
                    The person who did this wasn t trying 
                    to emulate the Ice Truck Killer -- he 
                    was in a hurry.  Probably afraid of 
                    getting caught.   

                                    DEBRA
                            (scoffs)
                    Most killers are.

                                    DEXTER
                    Except if this was a copycat, he 
                    wouldn t be in a rush.  He would savor 
                    his first kill.  Control the precise 
                    moment when Valerie Castillo died 
                    instead of simply letting her bleed 
                    out. 

Dexter hits Pause.

                                    DEXTER
                    This is all too... passive.       
                            (beat)
                    Have you completely ruled out the 
                    husband?

                                    DEBRA
                    Why re you doing this?  The kid didn t 
                    recognize Jorge Castillo in any of the 
                    photos.                                                                                           49.



                                    DEXTER
                    He was a dehydrated and traumatized 
                      seven-year-old left to fend for 
                    himself for days in a salvage yard. 

He crosses to turn off the monitor.

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I hate this.  But my only way out is 
                    to turn against the one person who s 
                    always believed in me...    

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    You really think it s the husband?

                                    DEXTER
                    He was a deep sea fisherman, most know 
                    how to use a knife.  And he s still 
                    missing.  Have you finished your 
                    search of the salvage yard? 

Doakes hesitates for a beat.  Neither Dexter nor Debra sure 
what side of the fence he ll land.  Then, Doakes pulls out 
his cellphone.  On the move.

                                    SGT. DOAKES
                    I m gonna have  em send out the cadets 
                    again.

Once he s gone, brother and sister are left alone.

                                    DEXTER
                    I m sorry.  

He can see the hurt in Debra s eyes.

                                    DEXTER
                    I know how hard you worked on that 
                    profile.

                                    DEBRA
                    No, I really don t think you do. 

As she goes...

                                                                      FLASHBACK:


TIGHT ON an undecorated cake fresh from the oven.  PAN AROUND.  
There s Rita with a bowl of frosting in one hand and a 
  spreading knife in the other.  But she s not looking at the 
cake -- she s staring at the phone on the counter nearby.  

A beat.  With a deep breath, she puts everything down and 
picks up the phone.  Methodically, she punches in the 
numbers as if she might change her mind at any moment.  She 
waits.  And waits.  But just as she s about to hang up... 

                                    RITA
                    Hey, Paul it s me...  um, look, we 
                    need to talk... I know you want to see 
                    Astor... but the kids are doing so 
                    well now. 

Pacing nervously, she chooses her words carefully.

                                    RITA
                    It might be better if you don t show 
                    up for the party... I just don t 
                    want... 

Rita hesitates.  Staring at the unfinished cake and 
  something inside of her... snaps. 

                                    RITA
                    I m sorry, but I have full custody  
                    now and you can t just drop in on us 
                    like this anymore.  I checked and the 
                      restraining order is still in effect, 
                    so if you step one foot on this 
                    property, the first call I make is to 
                    the police.  The second is to your 
                    parole officer.  If you want to see 
                    the kids, we can discuss it another 
                    time.

She exhales.  A long beat.

                                    RITA
                    Call me when you get this, okay?

Rita hangs up, heart pounding.  The weight of what she s 
done washes over her.  That felt... good.  Even if it was 
only a message on an answering machine.


Dexter is putting the box of blood slides back behind the air 
  conditioning unit.  His phone RINGS.  Crossing to pick up, 
Dexter checks to see who it is.

                                    DEXTER
                    Morgan...
                              (listening, a smile)
                    I ll be right there.


The Sketch Artist faces CAMERA, adding the final touches on 
his pad.  180 AROUND.  Oscar is on the floor with LaGuerta, 
the contents of her purse spread before them.  Clowning 
around, the boy holds up a pair of her handcuffs to his eyes 
as if they were glasses.  

                                    MAN S VOICE
                    Oscarito?

The boy and LaGuerta look up to see the Social Worker and 
Batista standing in the doorway with ROBERTO (30s).  Oscar 
gets up off the floor, racing into his uncle s waiting arms.   

                                    OSCAR
                    Tio Roberto!

As Batista helps LaGuerta up, the Social Worker crosses to 
her. 

                                    TELMA
                    The uncle called our office this 
                    morning.  Lives in Tampa.   

  LaGuerta masks the disappointment well.  

                                    LAGUERTA
                    That s wonderful... he should be with 
                    family. 

                                    ROBERTO 
                    Can I take him home?

  LaGuerta looks to the Sketch Artist. 

                                    SKETCH ARTIST
                    We re good.                                                                                            53.



Batista crosses to take a look at the just completed sketch. 

                                    ROBERTO
                            (to LaGuerta)
                    Thank you for finding him.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    He s a very special boy. 

Roberto carries Oscar away.  A beat.  The boy whispers into his 
uncle s ear.  The man stops.  Looking back, Oscar gives 
  LaGuerta a tiny wave and a smile.  As they go...  

                                    BATISTA
                    L.T., you need to see this. 

  LaGuerta swallows hard.  Collecting herself, she turns, 
  crossing to Batista.

                                    BATISTA
                    You okay?

She wipes the corner of her eye.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Contacts. 

Batista hands her the finished sketch.  A stunned beat.

                                    LAGUERTA
                    Dios Mio. 

OFF her shock...


Dexter installs new locks on his front door.                                                                                          57.



                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    All along I thought this was a game my 
                    alter ego and I were playing.  But 
                      relationships change.  Evolve.  And 
                    this one is turning deadly. 
                            (beat)
                      I wouldn t have it any other way. 

Dexter grabs the door handle.  Checks the locks.  Makes sure 
they re secure.  

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Like Harry said in my dream...

He looks to the horizon. 

                                    DEXTER (V.O.)
                    ...a storm s on its way.             

OFF Dexter, shutting the door behind him... 

                                                                      FADE OUT.
