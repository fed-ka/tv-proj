A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His
walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the
danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
At times he places his palms together and extends his
arms cutting a path through people. We will be very
pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.
CLOSER ON MELVIN
His eyes focused on the terrain.
A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the
approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN
and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and
the most likeable of the gritty little trio.
EVAN
Why is every customer surprised I
read books?
DOUG
(amazed)
You read books?
EVAN
Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look!
He even bought me dinner.
They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in
front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through
the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.
CARL
(slightly exasperated)
Look, I just can't. I promised
Simon I'd find him a model.
FRIEND (V.O.)
(on speaker phone,
flirting)
Carl, take me off the speaker.
Did I tell you that these are
house seats? C'mon, you could use
a break. Hello...
Carl, are you
there...
hello?
Seeing the hustlers:
CARL
.		...
I just found a model.
DOUG
(to Carl)
Hey, how it's goin'...
EVAN
Hey, hi...
remember?
CARL
I only need one.
EVAN
You picked me up, maybe a few
weeks, I don't know, some time
ago. You were very flattering
about our...
encounter.
CARL
Maybe just you and me...
but this
is for a painting. I need a
pretty face.
Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal
his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.
AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.
As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a
beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is
avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.
MELVIN
It's a beautiful day for our walk.
Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.
ON VERDELL
again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the
sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic
gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.
MELVIN
Don't be like me, don't you be
like me. You stay just the way
you are because you are a perfect
man. I'm gonna take you home and
get you something to eat...
what
you love.
ANOTHER ANGLE
FEMALE PASSERSBY
(charmed)
Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like
that.
MELVIN
(all smiles to Verdell)
Let's go home and do some writing.
Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then
turning into a building with a copper sign reading
"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."
MELVIN
Worst sidewalk in New York and
look where they put in.
An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.
MELVIN'S POV
A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever
the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of
community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving
their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local
store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.
As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.
As Carol carries her young son through a class of
uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She
spots Melvin about to enter a cab.
CAROL
Melvin, wait!
The school kids pick up the chant in unison.
SCHOOL KIDS
Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!
Melvin, wait!
He turns to face them.
MELVIN
Shut up, kids!
They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.
CAROL
Melvin...
give us a lift. We've
got to go see our friends at the
hospital.
Melvin is thrown...
he pauses a beat...
then holds the
rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The
maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.
MELVIN
I'll ride up front. Cover your
mouth when you cough, kid.
As Carol enters the hospital.
CAROL
(calling back)
I owe you three dollars.
Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son...
MELVIN
Yeah, yeah...
any chance you'll
get back to work today?
CAROL
(furiously)
No!!! Stay away from me!
A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is
suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.
CAROL'S POV
A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.
BACK TO SCENE
As Carol breaks into a run.
Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.
Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on
her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the
subject.
NIGHT (RAIN)
Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the
rains come...
We are in a familiar neighborhood.
ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE
As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on
it.
Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A
simple and unprecedented experience in their recent
lives.
BEVERLY
Nice to get out, isn't it?
Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each
other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.
Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches.
She kisses them.
CAROL
(to Spencer)
You stand there and I'll wave to
you from the back window.
As she boards the bus.
BEVERLY
Call me as soon as you're settled.
CAROL
(to Spencer)
I love you.
The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them
open.
CAROL
(to bus driver)
Sensitive, huh?!
The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at
his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing
himself.
Carol disembarks.
As she walks and turns a corner.
CLOSE ON CAROL
The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death
chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do
not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws"
will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect
couldn't be grimmer.
CAROL'S POV
Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.
CLOSER ON MELVIN
He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the
tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the
building.
FRANK
I'm sorry that I'm not taking
you.
SIMON
(upset)
So am I, Frank.
Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.
MELVIN
Soak it up -- it's your last
chance at a hug for a few days.
As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor
changes... that quickly there is a shyness.
CAROL
Hi.
MELVIN
Thanks for being on time... Carol,
the waitress, this is Simon, the
fag.
CAROL
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that
to you?
SIMON
I, uh... I was... attacked.
Walked in on people robbing me. I
was hospitalized. I almost died.
MELVIN
Let's do the small talk in the
car. Load up.
Carol puts her bag in the car.
MELVIN
I was going to do that for you.
CAROL
(taken aback)
It's okay. No problem. Where
should we sit?
MELVIN
(totally non-plussed)
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no
place cards or anything.
CAROL
(to Simon)
Let me go in back. You look like
you need all the room you can
manage.
SIMON
That's very thoughtful.
MELVIN
Never a break. Never.
Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's
not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small
back seat. She struggles to get her feet in.
MELVIN
You're really jammed back there.
He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his
seat and, with some effort,
wrenches it forward giving
Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel.
She is startled by the gesture.
CAROL
Thanks, Melvin.
MELVIN
Welcome.
And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.
Turning onto Fifth.
MELVIN
I got the whole ride programmed.
CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all
carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the
one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly
and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick
burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.
MELVIN
Just wanted to see what you'd do.
No, we have greatness here.
He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS
UP."
The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY
SELECTED MUSIC.
CAROL (O.S.)
Hey, I like this music.
And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.
The three of them... Carol chattering away.
CAROL
I don't know the last time I've
been out of the city... Hey, my
arms are tanning. I used to tan
great. We gotta stop soon so'se
I can check on Spencer.
SIMON
(during the above)
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I
can't turn my head all the way
yet... tell her we can't hear her.
MELVIN
Doesn't matter. She's enjoying
herself. Consider it part of the
music.
A short time later. Carol is now driving.
CAROL
I'm sure, Simon, they did
something real off for you to feel
this way... But when it comes to
your partners -- or your kid --
things will always be off for you
unless you set it straight. Maybe
this thing happened to you just to
give you that chance.
MELVIN
Nonsense!
CAROL
Anybody here who's interested in
what Melvin has to say raise their
hands.
Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus
declared their majority.
SIMON
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?
CAROL
Yes. I really would.
SIMON
Well...
CAROL
No, let me pull over so I can pay
full attention.
Car pulling over toward parking spot.
She takes the car curbside and parks.
CAROL
Now go ahead.
Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks
innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something
-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.
SIMON
Well, I always painted. Always.
And my mother always encouraged
it. She was sort of fabulous
about it actually... and she used
to... I was too young to think
there was anything at all wrong
with it... and she was very
natural. She used to pose nude
for me... and I thought or assumed
my father was aware of it.
MELVIN
This stuff is pointless.
CAROL
Hey -- you let him...
MELVIN
You like sad stories -- you want
mine.
CARL
. Go ahead, Simon. Really.
Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.
SIMON
Okay. Well, one day my father
came in on one of those painting
sessions when I was nine -- and he
just started screaming at her --
at us -- at evil. And...
MELVIN
(very quickly)
... my father didn't leave his
room for 11 years -- he hit my
hand with a yardstick if I made a
mistake on the piano.
CAROL
Go ahead, Simon. Your father
walked in on you and was yelling
and... really, come on.
SIMON
I was trying to defend my mother
and make peace, in the lamest way.
I said, "she's not naked -- it's
art." And then he started hitting
me. And he beat me unconscious.
After that he talked to me less
and less -- he knew before I left
for college, my dad came into my
room. He held out his hand. It
was filled with money. A big wad
of sweaty money.
(gathers himself)
And he said to me, "I don't want
you to ever come back." I grabbed
him and I hugged him... He turns
and walked out.
Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as
strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so
much more complicated than her meat and potatoes
troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her
fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice,
understated, gesture of friendship.
CAROL
Well, you know -- I still stay
what I said. You've got to get
past it all when it comes to your
parents. We all have these horror
stories to get over.
Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.
MELVIN
That's not true. Some of us have
great stories... pretty stories
that take place at lakes with
boats and friends and noodle
salad. Just not anybody in this
car. But lots of people -- that's
their story -- good times and
noodle salad... and that's what
makes it hard. Not that you had
it bad but being that pissed that
so many had it good.
CAROL
No.
SIMON
Not it at all, really.
MELVIN
(a veteran's irony)
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to
the hotel. And if you're lucky
tomorrow Dad will give you another
wad of sweaty money.
As they drive up.
VALET
Good evening, sir.
MELVIN
They sell hard shell crabs here?
VALET
Yes.
As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.
As the car goes right across the street to a shopping
mall.
As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.
VALET #2
Good evening.
MELVIN
You have hard shells?
VALET #2
I'm not sure.
MELVIN
Everyone else says you do.
VALET #2
Then I guess we do.
The car parked near a phone booth --
MELVIN
(to Frank over
the phone)
Aww Jesus! No choice.
Carol walks up to Simon in the car.
CAROL
I got a gift for you.
She hands him a base ball cap.
MELVIN
(on phone)
Nothing like no choice to make you
feel at home.
CAROL
(to Simon)
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
MELVIN
Do it then. Get the dog picked
up. I can't believe you let it
stay there.
Melvin hangs up the phone.
MELVIN
Good-bye.
(to Simon)
Well, your luck is holding. They
sublet your place. You're
homeless. Frank's got a line on
another place you can use for now.
SIMON
Another place where?
MELVIN
Does it matter?
Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a
special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it
PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:
CAROL
I don't want to hear that music
right now.
MELVIN
What do you mean? You said you
liked it.
CAROL
I don't.
MELVIN
This one has a special meaning.
CAROL
It's your car but I don't want to
hear it. If that means anything.
Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
proclamation of love.
As the car arrives... They get out...
MELVIN
Here are the keys to my apartment.
I'm going to park you in my place
while I take Carol home.
CAROL
(hefting bag)
I'll take a bus.
MELVIN
I'll take you... why not?
CAROL
I don't care what you did for me.
I don't think I want to know you
anymore -- all you do is make me
feel badly about myself.
(turning to Simon)
You have my number.
SIMON
(hugging her)
I love you...
(sotto)
Let him take you home.
CAROL
Don't want to. I love you.
She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at
Melvin with some sympathy.
MELVIN
Don't say anything.
NIGHT
As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at
his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the
apartment house.
They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual
attention to where he steps.
CAROL'S POV
Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement --
it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids
stepping on the lines.
BACK TO SCENE
Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing
down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious
-- his habits making him appear unworthy.
CAROL
(gently; almost
lovingly)
I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever
this is -- is not going to work.
ON MELVIN
He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper
something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his
history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.
MELVIN
I'm feeling... I've been feeling
better.
CAROL
Melvin, even though it may seem
that way now -- you don't know me
all that well...
(as he scoffs)
I'm not the answer for you.
She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns
back to him.
MELVIN
Hey, I've got a great compliment
for you.
CAROL
You know what? I...
MELVIN
Just let me talk.
(gathers himself
with uncertainty,
then:)
I'm the only one on the face of
the earth who realizes that you're
the greatest woman on earth. I'm
the only one who appreciates how
amazing you are in every single
thing you do -- in every single
thought you have... in how you
are with Spencer -- Spence...
(he has reached
her)
... in how you say what you mean
and how you almost always mean
something that's all about being
straight and good...
ON CAROL
She stands on the precipice of being transported away
from the logic which has been her lifeline.
MELVIN
I think most people miss that
about you and I watch wondering
how they can watch you bring them
food and clear their dishes and
never get that they have just met
the greatest woman alive... And
the fact that I get it makes me
feel great... about me!
(a real question
filled with
concern for her)
You got a real good reason to walk
out on that?
That last question clearly a true question, not the least
rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:
CAROL
No! It's certainly not. No -- I
don't think so. No.
MELVIN
(tentatively)
I'm gonna grab you.
(with conviction)
I didn't mean it to be a question.
I'm gonna grab you.
He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate.
A tense beat. Then:
MELVIN
I know I can do better.
They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A
first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot
land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his
knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a
notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in
unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a
path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the
bakery turn on as it opens for business.
CAROL
Warm rolls...
They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As
they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to
clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto
a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous
fact and joins Carol inside as we:
FADE OUT
