      FADE IN:

      INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - COMMUNITY MEETING - NIGHT

      HAILEY BURKE, 31, ADDRESSES A SMALL CROWD AT A TALK-TO-THE-
      COUNCILPERSON MEETING.  AT HER SIDE IS HER CHIEF OF STAFF, 
      RHONDA NICHOLS (40-PLUS, ALWAYS HOLDING PAPERS).

                                  HAILEY

                ...This is the first bill from City 

                Council that bears my name and I 

                couldn t be more proud.  This bill 

                mandates that the School District cap 

                  elementary school class size at twenty-

                two students, starting this fall!

      SHE EXPECTS BIG APPLAUSE, BUT INSTEAD GETS A SMALL SMATTER.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                (GAMELY) ...Thanks.  Both of you.  

                Alright, I m sure some of you have 

                  questions.

      SEVERAL PEOPLE LINE UP AT THE MIC.  FIRST UP IS A SCOWLING 
      MIDDLE-AGED GUY, LOADED FOR BEAR.  HE READS FROM A CLIPBOARD.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                Yeah!  I own DeMarco s, the pizza shop 

                across from City Hall, and I depend on 

                trash pick-up twice a week.  I 

                  understand, young lady, you intend to 

                cut that back to once a week.                                                                                      2.


                                  HAILEY

                That s right.  That s where the money 

                comes from to pay for smaller class 

                sizes and a better education for our 

                kids. (POINTS TO THE NEXT PERSON) You, 

                Ma am, in the very pretty pink blouse.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                YO!  Did I say I was done? (READING 

                FROM CLIPBOARD) How can we take 

                  seriously any legislation that comes 

                from a chippie like you?

                                  HAILEY

                (STIFF SMILE) Chippie?  Really?

      SHE GLANCES OVER TO RHONDA.

                                  RHONDA

                (SOTTO) Let  im go.  High road.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                  Everybody knows you only got elected 

                 cause your father was a Senator and 

                you ran on the name!

                                  LOUD WOMAN

                Give her a break!  She won!

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                Her daddy prob ly rigged it!  Besides, 

                what s she done for the last ten years 

                besides party hearty and take her 

                clothes off?  You all remember this?                                                                                      3.


      HE HOLDS UP A MAXIM MAGAZINE, CIRCA 2000, WITH A SCANTILY 
      CLAD HAILEY ON THE COVER.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY (CONT D)

                The Girls of DC?  Here s your Council 

                Woman!

                                  HAILEY

                Ah yes, my old friend the Maxim cover  

                -- no one s shown me that in days.  

                Y know, Sir, I ve got some pictures of 

                you in a swimsuit.  But I m going to 

                show restraint.

        APPRECIATIVE LAUGHTER FROM THE CROWD AND A SUBTLE  ATTA GIRL  
      NOD FROM RHONDA.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                (POINTS AGAIN) Pink Blouse.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                Okay, you been keepin  your clothes on 

                lately but what about a certain little 

                family financial scandal?  I mean, how 

                do we trust another Burke with our  

                money?  That was one helluva Fonzy 

                Scheme!

                                  HAILEY

                  I believe it s Ponzi, Sir.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                You d know.  True or false: your 

                sister went to jail and your brother-

                in-law s a fugitive somewhere.  

                                  (MORE)                                                                                      4.

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY (CONT'D)

                How do we know you don t have a piece 

                of that whole thing?

                                  HAILEY

                What my brother-in-law and my sister 

                did with their company was awful.  But 

                that s not me.  Let me ask the room: 

                does anybody else here have a relative 

                they re not exactly proud of?

      EVERYBODY S HANDS GO UP.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Whew.  It s not just me.  

      PEOPLE IN THE CROWD LAUGH.  RHONDA NODS.

                                  LOUD WOMAN

                (AT THE MIDDLE-AGED GUY) And she took 

                in their kids!  Two of  em!  What do 

                you think of that?

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                I think I want trash delivery twice a 

                week!

                                  HAILEY

                I can t give you that.  But what I can 

                promise is a standing order for twenty 

                regular pies every Thursday for City 

                Council sessions.  As long as I have 

                this seat.

      MIDDLE-AGED GUY OPENS THE MAXIM TO A PHOTO OF HAILEY 
      FEATURING HER BACKSIDE.                                                                                      5.


                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                This seat?!

      THE REST OF THE CROWD BOOS HIM SOUNDLY.

                                  HAILEY

                (TO THE CROWD) Hey, hey!  Everybody 

                gets to speak their mind here. (TO THE 

                  MIDDLE-AGED GUY) Including... 

                                    MIDDLE-AGED GUY

                Phil.  Phil DeMarco.

      SHE HAS MOVED THROUGH THE CROWD TO PHIL.

                                  HAILEY

                May I? (PULLS OUT A PEN AND SIGNS THE 

                  MAGAZINE)  To Phil, who keeps me on my 

                toes.  From one Toledo original to 

                  another.  (WINKS) Worth a lot more 

                now, Phil.

      AT CLOSE RANGE, HER SMILE AND PRESENCE IS TOO MUCH FOR PHIL.  
      HE BLUSHES AND SHUFFLES LIKE THE  COWARDLY LION.   SHE S MADE 
      A CONVERT.  AS SHE STRIDES BACK TO THE PODIUM.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Pink Blouse!  Do you have any 

                  embarrassing pictures of me?  

      PINK BLOUSE LADY SHAKES HER HEAD  NO. 

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Then you have the floor!

      RHONDA GIVES HAILEY A THUMBS-UP.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                      6.


                                    COLD OPEN - PART 2

      INT. HAILEY S TOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM (LATER THAT NIGHT)

      RHONDA IS WATCHING THE RECAP OF THE COMMUNITY MEETING ON THE 
      TV NEWS AS HAILEY PULLS ON AN ELEGANT BLACK DRESS.

                                  RHONDA

                (RE: TV) Look at you.  Hostile guy 

                attacks, you turn it around!  You re 

                better than your father.  On message, 

                quick on your feet, and most 

                  important, you re likable.  You took 

                all the steam outta the trash revolt.

      BANG!  SOMETHING HITS THE HOUSE.  HAILEY GOES TO THE WINDOW.

                                  IRATE MAN S VOICE (O.S.)

                Special delivery, Council Babe!

      WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A CAR DRIVING AWAY.

                                  HAILEY

                Some guy just threw a trash bag at my 

                front door.  Might still be a little 

                steam in the issue. 

                                  RHONDA

                There s always one crank.

      BANG.  ANOTHER TRASH BAG HITS.  BANG BANG BANG.  MORE BAGS.

                                  HAILEY

                And his cranky friends.

                                  RHONDA

                So this date tonight -- is it that 

                cute reporter you kept smiling at all 

                goofy?                                                                                      7.


                                  HAILEY

                I will not comment on my personal life 

                except to say: Didn t he have amazing 

                eyes! (HOLDS UP TWO SETS OF HEELS) So 

                whaddya think?  These say  Smart, 

                  independent, knows her own mind.   

                These say,  Former bad girl.  Still 

                got it. 

                                  RHONDA

                (POINTS TO THE SECOND PAIR) Those.  

                Just keep it out of the papers.

      LENNOX SCANLON (15), HAILEY S NIECE, APPEARS AT THE DOOR.

                                  LENNOX

                (WITH AN EDGE) Excuse me, dear Aunt 

                Hailey.  Why are people throwing 

                garbage bags at the house?

                                  RHONDA

                Because your aunt believes in the 

                  importance of education.

                                  LENNOX

                  (DEADPAN) That was my guess.

      SHE WATCHES HAILEY PUT ON THE  BAD GIRL  PUMPS.

                                  LENNOX (CONT D)

                Nice shoes.

                                  HAILEY

                Thanks, they re a little hard to walk 

                in.                                                                                      8.


                                  LENNOX

                It s okay, they ll probably spend most 

                of their time up in the air.

      LENNOX HEADS OUT THE DOOR.

                                  HAILEY

                (SOTTO TO RHONDA) Sweet, isn t she? 

                (CALLS) Lennox, did you like the new 

                curtains I put in your room?

      LENNOX RE-APPEARS FOR:

                                  LENNOX

                Not my room.  It s the guest room.  It 

                still has your elliptical trainer in 

                it.

      AND LENNOX IS GONE.  HAILEY TURNS TO RHONDA.

                                  HAILEY

                It must be great to be fifteen and 

                know absolutely everything.

                                  RHONDA

                And you were just a delight at her 

                age.

                                  HAILEY

                I don t really remember.  I did a lot 

                drinking then.

      BANG!  ANOTHER TRASH BAG HITS THE HOUSE.  HAILEY REACTS.  

                                      END OF COLD OPEN                                                                                      9.


                                  ACT ONE - SCENE ONE

      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      THE STOVE S TIMER BUZZES ANGRILY.  HAILEY AND RHONDA ENTER TO 
      FIND RYDER SCANLON (12) AT THE KITCHEN TABLE, PAPERS AND ART 
      SUPPLIES SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM.

                                  HAILEY

                (LOUDLY, TO RYDER) Doesn t that noise 

                bother you?!

                                  RYDER

                (YELLS) What noise?!!

      SHE TURNS THE BUZZER OFF.

                                  HAILEY

                Ryder, buddy, it s your house now, 

                too.  Take some ownership.  Turn a 

                buzzer off, open an oven, look inside.  

                See that the mac  n cheese needs some 

                more time.  Reset the timer. (HE S NOT 

                  LISTENING) Talk to myself.  Feel the 

                  frustration of having two kids and   

                  absolutely no help.

                                  RYDER

                (LOOKS UP) Huh?

                                  HAILEY

                Nothing.  It s fine.  Remember Rhonda 

                who runs my office?  She s staying

                date.  Rhonda, say hi.                                                                                    10.


                                  RHONDA

                  (BUSINESS-LIKE) Hey there, young man.

      HAILEY S STARE SAYS,  WOULDJA MAKE AN EFFORT?!   SO RHONDA 
      STEPS CLOSER.

                                  RHONDA (CONT D)

                Well, what are you up to there?  Ahh!  

                (STEPS BACK, AGHAST) Breasts.  He s 

                drawing breasts.  Naked ones.

                                  HAILEY

                That s what he does.  Tell Rhonda why 

                you draw so many breasts, Ryder.

                                  RYDER

                I like  em.  They re great.

                                  RHONDA

                (SOTTO TO HAILEY) They re not yours, 

                are they?

                                  HAILEY

                  (SCANNING THE DRAWINGS) Nope.  I think 

                that s his math teacher.

                                  RYDER

                (SMILES) Miss Reitman. 

                                  HAILEY

                Ryder, can you move your breasts so we 

                have some room for dinner?

      RYDER PICKS UP HIS DRAWINGS AND STARTS TO EXIT AS A CELL 
      PHONE OR TWO RINGS.

                                    RHONDA/HAILEY

                That s yours.                                                                                    11.


      THEY RE BOTH RIGHT.  HAILEY AND RHONDA ANSWER THEIR PHONES.

                        HAILEYRHONDA

      Hailey Burke... Oh, yes, Rhonda Nichols... Yeah? 

      hello. (SENSES TROUBLE, SOTTO  TROUBLE, SOTTO TO *(SENSES

      TO RHONDA) School Principal. HAILEY) Channel Five.

      THEY LISTEN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PHONE CALLS, GRUNTING 
      SERIOUSLY, PACING AND ALMOST BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER.

                        HAILEYRHONDA

      She did what?... No, she What d she do?!... Liz, I 

      didn t tell me -- which is find that hard to believe.  

      pretty typical... Well, I ll It s not at all typical... 

      certainly talk to her...  I ll certainly talk to Hailey 

      Yes, we could meet you but I doubt there s anything 

      tomorrow... Of course.  I m, to it... Sure, you too, 

      y know, their guardian.thanks.

      THEY BOTH HANG UP, SIGH, TURN TO EACH OTHER.

                                  HAILEY

                Guess what.  My sweet niece stood up 

                at assembly and sang a song about Ms. 

                Lunt, her principal.  In which, for 

                the purpose of satire, she allegedly 

                rhymed Ms. Lunt s name in several 

                creative ways. (AWARE OF RYDER) In her 

                big finish, dear Lennox chose a... 

                colorful little rhyme that has led to 

                her immediate suspension and a meeting 

                that is bound to be unpleasant.                                                                                    12.


                                  RHONDA

                I just finished telling Liz Ackerman 

                at Channel Five that never happened.

                                  HAILEY

                How d Ackerman get the story?!

                                  RHONDA

                Her producer s kid goes to the school.  

                Shot it on her phone, sent it in.

                                  HAILEY

                But that s not fair!  It s not news!

                                  RHONDA

                (PATS HER CHEEK) Aw, you are so cute.

                                  HAILEY

                (LOOKS TO THE STAIRS, SIGHS) Guess I 

                gotta go up there and talk to the kid.  

                That s whatcha do when you re a parent 

                slash guardian. (STARTS UP THE STAIRS) 

                Children are a blessing.  But you know 

                what s a bigger blessing?  A nanny.  

                Did you hear from your lawyer friend 

                who doesn t need hers any more?

                                  RHONDA

                The lady got another job.

                                  HAILEY

                There can t be that many kids in the 

                world.  Somebody s hoarding nannies.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    13.

      MAKING HER OWN.  SHE S STILL LIVING OUT OF TWO SUITCASES, 
      WHICH SIT OPEN ON THE FLOOR.  LENNOX SITS ON THE BED, TYPING 
      ON HER OPEN LAPTOP.  HAILEY POKES HER HEAD IN THE ROOM.

                                  HAILEY

                  (BRIGHTLY) Knock knock.

                                  LENNOX

                (STILL TYPING) Who s there?

                                  HAILEY

                (AFTER A BREATH) Listen, Lennox, I 

                just got off the phone with -- (STOPS 

                HERSELF) Uch, I hate the parenting 

                stuff, it s not me.  I m still your 

                fun Aunt Hailey.  Really.

                                  LENNOX

                Then let s go grab a beer.  Take a 

                look -- just got a new fake ID.

      HAILEY TAKES IT, STUDIES IT WITH A PROFESSIONAL EYE.

                                  HAILEY

                Very clean.  You could get a State 

                  Department job with this.

                                  LENNOX

                Not likely, with my mommy in the 

                slammer and my daddy playing hide  n 

                seek with the Feds.

                                  HAILEY

                I know you re going through a lot.                                                                                    14.


      HAILEY REACHES FOR HER HAND; LENNOX PULLS IT BACK.

                Your principal called.  To tell me 

                about assembly today.

                                  LENNOX

                (LOOKS UP) Two words: First Amendment.  

                It ain t number one for nothing.  Lunt 

                censors half the articles in the 

                  newspaper.  You can t say anything 

                critical about the school or she goes 

                all Dick Cheney up side your head.  

                Somebody had to take a stand.

                                  HAILEY

                Yeah, but did you have to call her...  

                  y know...

                                  LENNOX

                (GRINS) You shoulda seen her face.  

                                  HAILEY

                Well, we ll both see it tomorrow 

                because we re meeting her at three.  

                You ve been suspended. 

                                  LENNOX

                You can handle that meeting all by 

                  yourself.

                                  HAILEY

                No, I mean, it s not my district.

                                    GRIFFIN

                I ll call you later.  I promise.

      THEY KISS.  IT LINGERS.  WE SEE WHAT MIGHT VE BEEN.

                                    GRIFFIN (CONT D)

                I have to get to the fire.

      HE S GONE.  SHE SLOWLY CLOSES THE DOOR AND SIGHS.

                                  HAILEY

                You re leaving one here, big boy.

      SHE PULLS OFF HER HEELS.  AS SHE STARTS FOR THE KITCHEN:

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Rhonda!  Good news, you get to go home 

                early!

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    20.


                                  ACT ONE - SCENE FOUR

      INT. HAILEY S BEDROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

      HAILEY S SITTING IN BED, WITH A FEW PAPERS AROUND, HER 
      BLACKBERRY PERCHED ON HER KNEES.  SHE THUMBS THROUGH ONE     
      E-MAIL AFTER ANOTHER.  THE TV, ON SOFTLY IN THE BACKGROUND, 
      IS HER ONLY COMPANION. 

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    21.


                                  ACT TWO - SCENE ONE

      INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

      HAILEY RUSHES ABOUT, TRYING TO GET RYDER READY FOR SCHOOL.

                                  HAILEY

                You brush your teeth, buddy?  

                                  RYDER

                Uh huh.

                                  HAILEY

                Today?

      OFF HER LOOK, RYDER TROTS BACK UPSTAIRS.  HAILEY TURNS TO 
      LENNOX, ON THE COUCH WITH HER LAPTOP AND HER PHONE.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                I got meetings outside the house all 

                day but I ll be back in the afternoon.  

                What are you going to be doing with 

                  yourself?

                                  LENNOX

                If you re out all morning, sounds like 

                a good day to build that Meth Lab.

                                  HAILEY

                I m not crazy about you staying home 

                by yourself.

                                  LENNOX

                Hailey, I m fifteen.

                                  HAILEY

                That does not help.  I was fifteen.  

                When I was thirteen.                                                                                    22.


                                  LENNOX

                Ooo.  This is one of the few times I 

                want you to keep talking.

                                  HAILEY

                Go update your status.  Or download 

                  something grossly inappropriate.

      LENNOX GRABS HER CEREAL AND HEADS UPSTAIRS, PASSING RYDER AS 
      HE RETURNS.

                                  RYDER

                Morning, Psycho.

                                  LENNOX

                How s it goin , Perv.

                                  HAILEY

                Where s your backpack?

                                  RYDER

                (LAUGHS) Oh yeah.  Thanks.

      HE RETRIEVES IT AND SHE GUIDES HIM TO THE DOOR AS HER CELL 
      PHONE RINGS.

                                  HAILEY

                When the bus shows up today, get on 

                it.  Love you.

      SHE GIVES HIM A KISS, SENDS HIM OUT, AND ANSWERS HER PHONE.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Rhonda, I m still on family time.  Ten 

                minutes.  Oh, listen, I filled out the 

                nanny agency paperwork.  You gotta 

                find me time ASAP to go talk to them. 

      THE DOORBELL RINGS.  SHE OPENS THE DOOR TO REVEAL JACK LONGO, 
      STILL IN THE SAME SUIT, CITY BUDGET IN HIS HAND.                                                                                    23.


                                  JACK

                So Burke, exactly who does your 

                budgets?   Cause whoever he is, you 

                should think about the death penalty 

                for this guy.

                                  HAILEY

                You seriously came back here to talk 

                about the budget?

                                  JACK

                No, I came back here looking for Lewis 

                Scanlon.  But I was up late last night 

                reading the budget  cause I got no 

                job! (RE: BUDGET) Look at this, 

                  SpongeBob here put expenses in 

                accounts payable, but didn t accrue 

                revenue.  Accrued revenue should be 

                included as additional income in any 

                budget.  Speaking of criminal 

                  negligence, where s your scum-sucking 

                  brother-in-law?  You can tell me.  All 

                I want to do is kill him.

                                  HAILEY

                Look, I m real sorry you lost your 

                job.                                                                                    24.


                                  JACK

                Old news!  Yesterday I lost my condo.  

                Which would be okay, if I had my life 

                savings.  But that was all in company 

                stock.  Current value: dick!  Plus, 

                because of the Scanlon stink I got all 

                over me, I am unemployable anywhere in 

                the financial industry!  For the next 

                five thousand years.

                                  HAILEY

                I know.  Lewis made a real mess of 

                things.

                                  JACK

                Let me finish!  I sold all my suits -- 

                except for this swell Hugo Boss -- 

                they re about to repossess my car, and 

                here s the morning s big headline: now 

                that I got no more gold to dig, my 

                wife says she s leaving me. (SITS)  

                God, I m gonna miss that car.

                                  HAILEY

                I don t know where Lewis is.  Frankly, 

                I got a few issues with him myself.  

                Two, to be specific: one s twelve, 

                one s fifteen.                                                                                    25.


                                  JACK

                Yeah, my heart bleeds for the person 

                with the nice house and the job and 

                the Hockney on the wall. (ADMIRES THE 

                  PAINTING) You know what?  I think I ll 

                take this.  

                                  HAILEY

                Wait a minute...

                                  JACK

                Consider it a down payment from your 

                family to the much abused Jack Longo.

      HE LIFTS THE PAINTING OFF THE WALL.

                                  HAILEY

                Jack Longo... (LIGHT BULB) You ran the 

                  commodities division!  Lewis used to 

                talk about you all the time -- you 

                made millions for the company.

                                  JACK

                Did he also tell you that he dumped it 

                all into his Ponzi scheme? (RE: THE 

                HOCKNEY) You got, like, a nice Crate 

                and Barrel bag I could put this in?

                                  HAILEY

                How do I say this nicely?  I got my 

                own problems.

                                  JACK

                You re not going to help me?                                                                                    26.


                                  HAILEY

                Do you live in my district?

                                  JACK

                I m parked in your district.  And now 

                that I m living in my car -- yeah.

                                  HAILEY

                Listen, I got meetings, a trash 

                revolt, kids to deal with, and I m in 

                  desperate need of a nanny. 

      JACK HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE PAPERWORK IN FRONT OF HIM.

                                  JACK

                You re not going to find one this way.  

                The salary sucks.

                                  HAILEY

                It s live-in.  Includes a room and 

                meals.  Plus, I can negotiate higher 

                if I find a woman with experience.

                                  JACK

                It s gotta be a woman?  Only Vagino-

                  Americans need apply?

                                  HAILEY

                Personal question.  Did your hair just 

                get sick of you and leave?

                                  JACK

                (TAPS THE PAPER) Seriously, what s 

                your top number here?                                                                                     27.


                                  HAILEY

                I dunno.  Like another hundred a week.

                                  JACK

                Hundred and fifty, you got a deal.  

                But I can t start  til Monday.

                                  HAILEY

                You can t be serious.

                                  JACK

                Okay, I can start today.  I just have 

                to move a few things around.  Mostly, 

                my car.  Tuesday is street cleaning, 

                right?

                                  HAILEY

                You do know that childcare involves 

                  children?  You ever work with kids?

                                  JACK

                Are you kidding?  Right out of college 

                I ran a youth center downtown.  I was 

                in charge of fifty kids.  I made  em 

                meals, helped  em with homework.  

                Hell, it s second nature to me.  I m 

                the oldest of six kids. (OFF HER 

                  SKEPTICAL LOOK) Come on! You re not 

                going to trust me with a couple of 

                kids after your sister and her dirtbag 

                husband trusted me with half a billion 

                dollars?                                                                                    28.


                                  HAILEY

                Yes, you re perfect.  Just one small 

                detail: I don t really like you.  And 

                when people live in my house, I prefer 

                they be somewhat less... jerky.

                                  JACK

                Hey, I m not too keen on you but I m 

                willing to set that aside.  In the 

                interest of the children.

      THE FRONT DOOR OPENS.  IT S RYDER.

                                  HAILEY

                Ryder?  What are you doing back here?

                                  RYDER

                The bus never came --  cause the 

                streets are all dug up and the sewer 

                guys are tearing pipes out.

                                  HAILEY

                Oh shoot, yeah.  The new upgrade 

                starts today.  I even voted for it.  

                Crap!  Crap! (CHECKS HER WATCH)  Now 

                you re gonna be late.

                                  JACK

                No he s not.  I ll take him. (TO 

                RYDER) Call me Jack. (POINTS OUTSIDE)  

                See that Porsche?  It s mine.  For ten 

                more days.                                                                                    29.


                                  RYDER

                Sweet.

      RYDER HEADS OUT.  JACK FOLLOWS, THEN TURNS TO HAILEY.

                                  JACK

                Relax.  I got airbags and GPS.  What 

                Filipino nanny s gonna bring you that?

      HE EXITS, PASSING RHONDA, JUST COMING IN THE FRONT DOOR.

                                  RHONDA

                  (WATCHING HIM GO) Cute guy.  You re on 

                a hot streak, aren t ya?  

                                  HAILEY

                He s a homeless commodities trader.

                (INTO HER PHONE-CAM) Day One of my 

                house arrest.  I am currently re-

                reading  A Day in the Life of Ivan 

                  Denisovich , famous Gulag saga for 

                those who were too stoned in Freshman 

                English to remember.  Ivan and I share 

                a new bond today: we re both political 

                  prisoners, scapegoats of a corrupt 

                  oligarchy.  And both Pisces by the

      HAILEY ENTERS AS LENNOX HITS  SEND  ON HER PHONE.

                                  HAILEY

                Hey there, how s the Meth Lab coming?

                                  LENNOX

                Fine.  Still some kinks in our 

                  distribution network.                                                                                    32.


                                  HAILEY

                Listen, I was thinking about you 

                hanging out here with not much to do.  

                We could use a smart intern in my 

                office.  Phones, filing, deliveries.

                                  LENNOX

                Golly, one would have to be smart to 

                do all that.  But I m gonna have to 

                say  God, no.   Besides, what would 

                Nanny Man do if I wasn t here to tell 

                him where the towels are?

      JACK ENTERS FROM UPSTAIRS, TOWEL WRAPPED AROUND HIS WAIST, 
      HIS STAINED SUIT PANTS IN HIS HANDS.

                                  JACK

                I bet you know this.  How do you get 

                kid barf out of expensive pants?

                                  HAILEY

                Why would I know that?

                                  JACK

                 Cause you re a woman.  Right?

                                  HAILEY

                And your wife dumped you.  What was 

                she thinking?

                                  JACK

                Look, he s fine now, but Ryder got 

                carsick.  He s upstairs watching one 

                of those  Saw  movies.  They freak me 

                out, but he seems to be loving it.                                                                                    33.


                                  HAILEY

                  (OVERLOAD) Saw?  What?  He s home?  

                Why is he home?!

                                  JACK

                He puked.  So I brought him back fast 

                as I could -- which in retrospect was 

                a huge mistake.

                                  HAILEY

                What kind of nanny are you?  He was 

                just carsick.  You stop the car and 

                wipe it up.  You don t miss a day of 

                school for carsick.

                                  JACK

                Well, he was vomiting.  Seems to me 

                you take a kid home.

                                  HAILEY

                It s not that kind of vomit.

                                  JACK

                How many kinds are there??

                                  HAILEY

                He vomits all the time.

                                  JACK

                Maybe you should look into that.

                                  HAILEY

                Are you a doctor now, too?

                                  LENNOX

                (AMUSED) Where d you find this guy?                                                                                    34.


                                  JACK

                I worked for your dad.  Til he boned 

                me. 

                                  LENNOX

                Let me guess.  He left you hanging and 

                took off?  Welcome to the family!

                                  JACK

                (BACK TO HAILEY) Look, I m taking care 

                of the kids, isn t that the job?

                                  HAILEY

                Yeah, but I was kinda hoping for 

                someone who d do it correctly.

                                  LENNOX

                You guys are hilarious.  Child 

                services would shut this place down if 

                they could stop laughing.

                                  HAILEY

                Be quiet, Missy! (CATCHES HERSELF) My 

                god, did I just say  Missy ?

                                  JACK

                Yeah, you did.

      RHONDA APPEARS AT THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.

                                  RHONDA

                Go ahead.  Everything s under control.

                                  LENNOX

                Quoth the man with no pants.

                                  HAILEY

                (TO LENNOX) Look.  I ll be back at

                meeting at school.  So be dressed, be 

                ready.  Do not make me wait.

                                  LENNOX

                                  JACK

      INT.  ANNIE S NANNIES  - AN AGENCY - AN HOUR LATER

      AN OLD-SCHOOL OFFICE WITH NO COMPUTERS, JUST FILE CABINETS, 
      TYPEWRITERS AND STACKS OF PAPER.  HAILEY S BEEN TALKING TO 
      THE GENIAL AND FAIRLY ANCIENT ANNIE, THE PROPRIETOR, WHO SITS 
      BEHIND HER DESK.

                                  ANNIE

                All my ladies are working, dear.  I 

                might have one coming off a job in 

                three to four weeks.

                                  HAILEY

                I could be dead by then!

                                  ANNIE

                Oh, I m sure it s not that bad.  

                  (OFFERING) Some tea?

                                  HAILEY

                I don t want tea.  I want a nanny.  

                  Actually, I want my old life back but 

                I m not gettin  that. (CHANGES TACK)  

                Annie, dear... you were once a nanny, 

                right? 

                                  ANNIE

                I was once a very fine nanny.                                                                                    37.


                                  HAILEY

                I could tell that immediately.  You 

                just radiate confidence, competence, 

                caring and concern.  It s a shame all 

                that life experience is being wasted 

                behind a desk.

                                  ANNIE

                I ve had that thought sometimes.  I 

                just wonder if I have the energy.

                                  HAILEY

                Who needs energy?  You have the 

                skills.  I don t want some fifty-year 

                old punk looking after my kids.  I 

                want experience.  I want soul.  I want 

                you, Annie.  Come out from behind that 

                desk.  Right now.

      ANNIE BEAMS.  SHE RISES, OH-SO SLOWLY, AND BEGINS THE LONG 
      LONG WALK TO OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK. 

                                  ANNIE

                Lennox!  It s time to go!  Ryder?!  

                Anybody?  Hello?

      SHE CROSSES INTO THE LIVING ROOM, JUST AS JACK OPENS THE 
      FRONT DOOR AND ENTERS.

                Why?!

                                  JACK

                 Cause you said so.

                No, I didn t!  Where s Lennox? 

                (CHARGES UPSTAIRS) Lennox!!  Are you 

                up here?!  Would you answer me! (TURNS 

                TO JACK) You were supposed to make 

                sure she was here and ready to go.

                                  JACK

                When did you say that?

      HAILEY CHARGES BACK DOWN THE STAIRS.

                                  HAILEY

                Oh, it s so obvious -- she s ditching 

                the meeting.                                                                                    39.

                Yeah, that s what I d do.

                                  HAILEY

                  (THINKING FURIOUSLY) Okay, she s got 

                like three places she always goes 

                after school.  I ll start there.

                                  JACK

                You want me to help?

                I can work with this kid.

                                  ACT THREE - SCENE FOUR

      EXT. TOWNHOUSE ROOF - A SHORT TIME LATER

      LENNOX IS SEATED IN A DECK CHAIR, LISTENING TO HER IPOD AND 
      TEXTING, AS JACK CAREFULLY CLIMBS OUT A WINDOW.

                                  JACK

                Wow.  Nice.  Is this where you come 

                for your adolescent brooding? 

                                  LENNOX

                Yep.  It s the lone Outpost of 

                Justice. (POINTS) See that house?  

                Four floors and one rich old lady.  

                Lives all by herself.  There s room 

                enough in there for three immigrant 

                families -- but they gotta live in 

                some shack.  That seem right to you?

                                  JACK

                Hey, if she owns the house, she owns 

                the house.  That s how it works.  

                (TAKES A SEAT) On the other hand, she 

                might ve had a perfectly fine husband 

                she kicked out -- for nothing he did.  

                Except for maybe losing his job.  The 

                job he worked his ass off to buy her 

                that house. (RECOVERING) Just a guess.

                                  LENNOX

                Your old lady did a number on you, 

                huh?                                                                                    41.


                                  JACK

                Life sucks much of the time.  

                  (POINTEDLY) As you well know.

                                  LENNOX

                (CLOSING DOWN) You don t know anything 

                about me, okay?

                                  JACK

                Fair enough.

      THEY BOTH STARE THOUGHTFULLY AT THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

                                  LENNOX

                And why should I have to go apologize 

                to that bitch of a principal?

                                  JACK

                Because.  At some point, every single 

                person who wants to get stuff done has 

                to eat a big steaming bowl of crap.  

                So get out your over-sized spoon, 

                kiddo,  cause today it s your turn. 

                (OFF HER STUNNED STARE) Oh, were you 

                looking for the little kid answer?  I 

                don t do those.

                                  LENNOX

                  (INDIGNANT) The school fired the music 

                teacher and completely got rid of the 

                band and Amy Leesin wrote an article 

                asking why -- and Lunt cuts it!  No 

                reason.  

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    42.

                                  LENNOX (CONT'D)

                And everybody s afraid to talk about 

                it.  So I did.  And she dusts me.   

                Somebody has to change the system.

                                  JACK

                And that can be done by sitting up 

                here on the roof checking e-mail? 

                (EYES HER) You really want to change 

                things? (OFF HER NOD) Go to the 

                meeting.  Say you re sorry -- you 

                don t have to mean it -- and then 

                subtly, over time, work to undermine 

                her authority.  You gain their trust, 

                then twist the knife.

                                  LENNOX

                Like my dear ole dad did to you?

                                  JACK

                Yeah.  But I m talking more about what 

                your Aunt s doing.  She was an 

                  outsider, a screw-up.  Made some, as 

                they say  bad choices .  Many of which 

                are accessible if you google  Naked 

                  Councilperson.   But she got smarter.  

                Learned how to work the system.  And 

                maybe accomplish something.  I ll say 

                this about your aunt -- if she had 

                just a thimble full of charm, she 

                would be unstoppable.                                                                                    43.


                                  LENNOX

                You got that right.

                                  JACK

                I mean, she s not bad-looking.

                                  LENNOX

                You gonna try to hit that?

                                  JACK

                What are you, a dock worker?

                                  LENNOX

                Sorry.  Withdrawn.

                                  JACK

                So what do you say?  I ll give you a 

                ride down to the school.

      LENNOX CONSIDERS, THEN FINALLY SHAKES HER HEAD.

                                  LENNOX

                Can t do it.  Can t eat that much 

                crap.

                                  JACK

                  (CONSIDERS, THEN) Okay, you forced my 

                hand.  I got one more argument.  And I 

                want you to hear me out before you say 

                  anything.

      SHE LOOKS AT HIM: TAKE YOUR SHOT.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    44.

      INT. PRINCIPAL S OFFICE - 3:15PM

      HAILEY PACES IN THE OUTER OFFICE, OCCASIONALLY GLANCING INTO 
      THE HALLWAY.  NO LENNOX.  THE DOUR AMELIA LUNT EMERGES FROM 
      HER OFFICE.

                                  MS. LUNT

                Still no sign of your niece?

                                  HAILEY

                Listen, Miss Lunt, why don t the two 

                of us talk?  You and me.  I could 

                bring you up to speed on what Lennox 

                has been going through.  I mean, it s 

                only been two months since her mom 

                reported to prison and --

                                  MS. LUNT

                Miss Burke, this is pointless without 

                Lennox.  She was aware of this 

                meeting, wasn t she?

                                  HAILEY

                Yeah, I told her.  Several times.  

                                  MS. LUNT

                We ll just have to reschedule.  You 

                think you ll be able to find her by, 

                say, Thursday afternoon?

                                  HAILEY

                  Thursday s a council session all day.  

                Can t we just talk now?                                                                                    45.


                                  MS. LUNT

                Miss Burke, parenting doesn t fit into 

                nice little schedule boxes.  Perhaps 

                you don t have adequate time to devote 

                to the child.  It may be helpful to 

                look not just at what Lennox is doing, 

                but at the job you re doing.

                                  LENNOX (O.S.)

                She s doing okay.

      THEY TURN TO SEE LENNOX IN THE DOORWAY.

                                  LENNOX (CONT D)

                Sorry, I m late.  And I m sorry about 

                the other day and the song thing and 

                the other stuff I said.  I was mad and 

                  I probably need to shut up sometimes.  

                But for chrissakes, don t blame my 

                aunt.  She took me and my brother in 

                and nobody made her, she just did it.  

                She s not a big expert at all this but 

                at least she s trying.  Unlike my 

                fugitive fath -- (STOPS HERSELF) At 

                least she s trying.  You know, 

                  whatever... (GESTURES TO LUNT S 

                OFFICE) Let s just do this.

      LUNT NODS AND STEPS INTO HER OFFICE.  HAILEY GIVES LENNOX A 
      SLIGHT SMILE.  LENNOX SHRUGS AND WALKS STRAIGHT AHEAD INTO 
      THE OFFICE.  HAILEY FOLLOWS.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    46.


                                  ACT THREE - SCENE SIX

      INT. KITCHEN - LATER (DINNER TIME)

      JACK BRINGS A DISH OVER AND PAUSES TO ADMIRE RYDER S MANY 
      DRAWINGS, SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE. 

                                  JACK

                Hey, my wife looked just like that 

                when we got married. (RE: ANOTHER 

                DRAWING) Then after Dr. Margolis and 

                  twenty-thousand dollars, she looked 

                like these over here.  I gotta say, 

                you are remarkably gifted at this.

                                  RYDER

                I dunno.  I think I made the areolas 

                too big on these ones.

                                  JACK

                No, you re cool.  They get that big.  

                In some cases, bigger.

                                  RYDER

                (IN AWE) I bet you got stories.

                                  JACK

                Which you re not going to hear.  

                However, I will say this.  You have a 

                very promising career in graphic 

                novels.  Or medical illustration.  

                Either way, you will not lack for 

                  employment, my friend.

      JACK TOUSLES RYDER S HAIR AS RYDER GRINS.  WE HEAR A CAR DOOR 
      SLAM AND A WOMAN S VOICE JUST OUTSIDE.                                                                                    47.


                                  JACK (CONT D)

                Look good.  Your mom s home.

      RYDER LOOKS UP, STARTLED.  JACK REALIZES.

                                  JACK (CONT D)

                Sorry.  Your aunt.  Your aunt s home.

      RYDER EXHALES, THE COLOR RETURNS TO HIS FACE.  HE SMILES 
      GAMELY AS JACK SQUEEZES HIS SHOULDER, COMFORTINGLY.  AFTER A 
      MOMENT, HAILEY AND LENNOX ENTER THROUGH THE BACK DOOR.

                                  JACK (CONT D)

                Okay.  Nobody s smiling, but I see no 

                bruises or contusions, so I m 

                  guessing...?

                                  LENNOX

                I ate my whole bowl of crap.  Even 

                went back for seconds.  I m going to 

                brush my teeth now.

      JACK NODS AND GIVES HER A LIGHT SHOULDER PUNCH AS SHE EXITS.   
      HAILEY HAS OBSERVED THIS EXCHANGE.

                                  HAILEY

                  Apparently I need to thank you.  How d 

                you talk her into going down there?

                                  JACK

                Who can say... people like me.

                                  HAILEY

                No, really.

                                  JACK

                I paid her.  Fifty bucks.                                                                                    48.


                                  HAILEY

                Are you serious?  A bribe?!  That s - 

                that s terrible!  It s not only wrong 

                but it s horrible parenting!!

                                  JACK

                I m not a parent.  My job was to get 

                her down there.  And I ll absorb the 

                fifty bucks  cause that s the kind of 

                guy I am.

                                  HAILEY

                Is this how your ran your youth center 

                right out of college with your two 

                hundred kids?

                                  JACK

                There was no youth center.  I made 

                that up.  But you needed to hear it or 

                  I wouldn t have gotten the job. (TURNS 

                TO RYDER) By the way, young man, you 

                should hardly ever lie.

                                  HAILEY

                Can we speak in the other room?

                                  JACK

                (SHRUGS) Your house.

      HE FOLLOWS HER INTO THE LIVING ROOM.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    49.


                                ACT THREE - SCENE SEVEN

      INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      HAILEY LOOKS AT JACK.

                                  HAILEY

                (FUMING) You lie, you bribe.  Is there 

                anything you won t do?

                                  JACK

                Windows. (THINKS HE S FUNNY, THEN) No, 

                look, I should tell you the truth.  I 

                also don t have six siblings.

                                  HAILEY

                So you just wing everything?

                                  JACK

                It s gotten me where I am today. (OFF 

                HER STARE) I am aware of the irony.  

                Look, Burke, I m trying to help you 

                out.  You re juggling a lot and it s 

                hard to do that all by yourself.  

                Okay, I may have played it fast and 

                loose but Lennox apologized to that 

                Lunt woman, right?

                                  HAILEY

                  (CONCEDING) Yes, she did.  And she 

                also, as it happens, said a few nice 

                things about me.  In front of me.  

                First time since she s been here.  

                Frankly, it... took my breath away.  

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    50.

                                  HAILEY (CONT'D)

                I mean, finally, it makes me feel I m 

                making a difference in her life.  

                (GASPS, THEN) Omigod, you didn t pay 

                her to do that too, did you?

                                  JACK

                She must ve come up with that herself. 

                I don t have that kind of cash.  

                                  HAILEY

                Jack.  It pains me to say this, but 

                had the thought occurred to me, I d 

                have paid her five times that much to 

                show up for the meeting.

                                  JACK

                I like to keep expenses down.

      SHE SMILES AT HIM.  FIRST TIME.  THE DOORBELL RINGS.  HAILEY 
      OPENS IT.  IT S ANCIENT ANNIE.

                                  ANNIE

                I made it, dear.  Where are the wee 

                ones?

                                  HAILEY

                Oh.  Annie!  Hello.  Uh, this is Jack.

                                  ANNIE

                Hello, young man!  Shall I run you a 

                bath?

                                  HAILEY

                Y know, Annie, I ve been thinking a 

                lot.  Anybody can be a nanny.                                                                                    51.


                                  JACK

                Hey.

                                  HAILEY

                Shh! (BACK TO ANNIE) But there are 

                very few true leaders like you.  Who 

                can the Nanny Community look to if you 

                leave that desk?  There s nobody.  So 

                go back to your office.  And lead the 

                nannies of Toledo to greatness.

      DURING THE ABOVE, HAILEY HAS WALKED ANNIE OUT THE DOOR.

                                  HAILEY (CONT D)

                Don t let anything slow you down.

      ANNIE HEADS SLOWLY AWAY.  HAILEY BACKS INTO THE HOUSE.

                                  JACK

                So where d you dig her up?  She take 

                care of little Abe Lincoln?

                                  HAILEY

                I was afraid you might flame out.  

                Which was looking pretty likely until 

                you pulled all that competence out of 

                your ass.

                                  JACK

                So I got the job?   Cause I could just 

                hop into my house and drive away.

                                  HAILEY

                Nah, the conventional nannies haven t 

                worked out.  How bad could you be?                                                                                    52.


                                  JACK

                You ll find out, won t you?

                                  HAILEY

                You re certainly on call tonight.  I 

                got a date.

                                  JACK

                Oh. (THE SLIGHTEST TINGE OF JEALOUSY)  

                Is it the guy from before with all 

                the... (RESENTFUL) Hair.

                                  HAILEY

                Yep.  I might be late.

                                  JACK

                  Whatever.  Anytime is fine. 

                                  HAILEY

                I m gonna go check in with Ryder.

                                  JACK

                You should.

                                  HAILEY

                So, um, thanks.

                                  JACK

                You got it.

      SHE CROSSES INTO THE KITCHEN.  HE REMAINS IN THE LIVING ROOM.

      INTERCUT - IN THE KITCHEN, SHE TURNS AND GLANCES BACK AT THE 
      DOOR.  IN THE LIVING ROOM, HE GAZES AT THE KITCHEN DOOR.  
      THEY TURN AWAY AT THE SAME TIME AND GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.  

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    53.


                                              TAG

      INT. LIVING ROOM - 3:00 AM

      JACK IS WATCHING THE TV AND TAPPING ON HIS LAPTOP AS HAILEY 
      OPENS THE DOOR.

                                  JACK

                Good morning.

                                  HAILEY

                (PLEASED WITH HERSELF) Yeah, it is 

                late. (PUTS HER KEYS DOWN) You didn t 

                wait up, did you?  

                                  JACK

                No, I had some calls to make to 

                Germany.  Thought there was a job 

                  prospect.

      SHE S TAKEN ABACK -- BUT HIDES IT.

                                  HAILEY

                Oh.  Is there?

                                  JACK

                Turns out, no go.  I am radioactive 

                world wide.  Thank you, Lewis Scanlon.

      SHE SMILES, HEADS FOR THE STAIRS.

                                  HAILEY

                Kids get to bed okay?

                                  JACK

                Yeah, Ryder knocked out at about ten, 

                Lennox was, I think, one-thirty.

                                  HAILEY

                  (CROSSING BACK) One-thirty?                                                                                    54.


                                  JACK

                Okay, two.  Hey, I kept her in the 

                house.  As for the schoolwork she 

                missed, I got her caught up in Bio, 

                History and Math -- but she owes me 

                four chapters of English.  I ll lean 

                on that tomorrow.

                                  HAILEY

                  (IMPRESSED, BUT NOT READY TO SAY IT)  

                Huh.  And no money changed hands?

                                  JACK

                By the end of the week, you re going 

                to wonder how you ever lived without 

                me.

                                  HAILEY

                Is this your nightclub act or is this 

                really you?

      HE SMILES.  SHE SMILES BACK AT HIM, SHAKING HER HEAD.  IS 
      THIS MUTUAL FASCINATION OR REPULSION?  BOOM!  A TRASH BAG 
      HITS THE DOOR.

                                  JACK

                That does it!

      JACK JUMPS UP AND THROWS OPEN THE DOOR.

                                                                            RESET TO:

      EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      JACK GRABS THE NEW BAG OF TRASH AS WE HEAR AN O.S. CAR 
      ACCELERATE AWAY.  AS HAILEY APPEARS BEHIND HIM, WATCHING, HE 
      TAKE A FEW STEPS AND FLINGS THE BAG LIKE AN OLYMPIC CHAMP.                                                                                    55.


                                  JACK

                Hey, butt-face, you forgot something!!

      BANG!  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE BAG HITTING A WINDSHIELD AND 
      BRAKES SQUEALING.  JACK LOOKS VERY PROUD.

                                  ANGRY VOICE (O.S.)

                Hey!

                                  HAILEY

                (STARES OFF, EYES WIDE) Oh my god, 

                he s gigantic, get inside!

      AS SHE YANKS JACK BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE, WE:

      FADE OUT.
