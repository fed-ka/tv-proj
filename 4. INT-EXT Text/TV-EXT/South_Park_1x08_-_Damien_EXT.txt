               Establishing.


               A recess monitor blows her whistle as kids run around the 
               playground.

                                     RECESS MONITOR
                         Five minutes until recess is over 
                         you little bastards!!

               Cartman is standing by the swingset with full on graphs, 
               charts and drawings. A few random kids are gathered around.

               Cartman has a pointer in his hand and is using it to 
               demonstrate as he talks.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Now, as you can see, the Red Mega-
                         Man uses the --
                              (Pointing)
                         Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will 
                         be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, 
                         YOU were supposed to get me the Mega 
                         Power Chopper illustrated --
                              (Pointing)
                         HERE. But I am changing your present 
                         to the Yellow Mega-Man, since Kenny 
                         has been turned into a --
                              (Pointing)
                         duck billed platypus. That means 
                         that the Mega-Man Beach House, 
                         illustrated here... Will be a gift 
                         given by two people at once...

               The kids all try to follow along with their eyes. A few take 
               notes.


               Meanwhile, Damien is at another part of the playground setting 
               things on fire with his hands. Pip is standing next to him.

               Damien spins around and burns down the slide. Several children 
               look sad.

                                     BEBE
                         Our slide!

               Damien spins around and sets the teeter-totter a blaze. Again 
               the children look sad.

                                     DAMIEN
                         FEEL MY WRATH!!!

                                     PIP
                         Oh dear, you shouldn't be so upset, 
                         Damien. I know its hard being the 
                         new kid, but the children may accept 
                         you some day.

                                     DAMIEN
                              (Insincere)
                         I DON'T NEED ACCEPTANCE! I'M THE SON 
                         OF SATAN!!

               Another flick of the hand, and Damien burns down the little 
               spring-animals.

               Damien turns and burns down the jungle gym.

                                     PIP
                         Believe me, I know what its like not 
                         to have friends. Perhaps you should 
                         speak to the school counselor, he 
                         helps me a lot when I'm feeling 
                         lonely.

               Damien stops and thinks.

                                     JESUS
                         DAMIEN!!!

               Damien turns around and sees Jesus standing with Stan and 
               Kyle and the Kenny duck billed platypus.

                                     DAMIEN
                         AH! Son of Stench!! Cursed ruler of 
                         the weak!!

                                     JESUS
                         So it IS Thou! Son of Lucifer!!

                                     DAMIEN
                         Your time on this Earth is short!! 
                         Soon my father comes!!!

               Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman follow the biblical exchange 
               like a tennis match with their heads.

                                     JESUS
                         Let him come then! I shall stop him!

                                     DAMIEN
                         Behold! He is already upon us!!

               Suddenly, clouds move all over the sky. The day becomes black.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh, dude!

               A huge booming voice comes from all around.

                                     EVIL VOICE
                         Et dominous em pluribus unom som...

               Damien closes his eyes and listens. Jesus looks around, 
               confused.

                                     EVIL VOICE
                         Forente omi sanctum san ri en unibus.

               Winds blow, thing fly all around. Half the townspeople come 
               running up to see what's happening.

                                     JIMBO
                         What the hell is going on?!

               Now a normal looking priest, (we call him PRIEST MAXI) walks 
               up and looks around.

                                     PRIEST MAXI
                              (Pointing to Jesus)
                         Look! It's that guy from the public 
                         access show!

               Jesus looks around the flying debris. Chef comes running up 
               as well.

                                     ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                         WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

                                     CHEF
                              (To the pretty women)
                         Come over here if you're scared, 
                         womens! I'll protect you!

               Mr. Garrison hides in Chef's bosom.

                                     CHEF
                         Not, you dammit!

                                     EVIL VOICE
                         En ri... En ri omnibus spiritus...

               Finally, Damien opens his eyes.

                                     DAMIEN
                         Jesus... My father says... He CHOOSES 
                         YOU! He CALLS YOU OUT!

               Jesus eyes grow wide. All the townspeople look at each other.

                                     DAMIEN
                         Be here at this time tomorrow! There 
                         the terms will be discussed!

                                     JESUS
                         Very well! Let the final battle 
                         between good and evil be fought... 
                         Right here in South Park!

               The townspeople all look thrilled.

                                     JIMBO
                         Come on Ned! We gotta get our asses 
                         to the bookie!!

               Everyone disperses. Stan and Kyle walks up next to Jesus.

                                     STAN
                         You're gonna fight Satan?

                                     JESUS
                         This fight has been ordained since 
                         the beginning. My children, this is 
                         the most crucial and serious time of 
                         all history...


               A large group of people have gathered around Jesus in downtown 
               South Park.

                                     PRIEST MAXI
                         When is Satan going to show up?

               Another Townsperson shrugs as he prepares his camera by 
               cleaning off the lens.

               The boys walk up.

                                     STAN
                         Did The Devil show up yet?

                                     JESUS
                         Not yet.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey Jesus, If you win the fight can 
                         you turn Kenny back to normal?

               Jesus looks at the little duck billed platypus.

                                     JESUS
                         What the hell do you mean IF I win 
                         the fight?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Aside)
                         Don't mind him, Jesus. He's Jewish.

                                     JESUS
                              (Understanding)
                         Oh.

               Still more townspeople show up.

                                     JIMBO
                         We're all with you Jesus! We put 
                         every dime we have on you beating 
                         that Dark Prince!

               The townspeople all cheer.

                                     JESUS
                         Thank you for your faith. But I think 
                         perhaps you don't understand the 
                         severity of the situation...

                                     PRIEST MAXI
                         You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus!

               The Townspeople all cheer again. Suddenly, a HUGE booming 
               sound starts.

                                     JESUS
                         Behold, the evil one approaches.

               In walks Satan. Seven feet two inches, three hundred and ten 
               pounds -- A BIG, BAD ASS MOTHER FUCKER.

               Jesus' eyes get HUGE.

               The Townspeople's jaws all drop in unison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Holy poop on a stick!

                                     SATAN
                              (Deep, bellowing voice)
                         Puny son of Jehovah. Prepare to enter 
                         thy house of pain.

                                     STAN
                         Holy crap, dude, Satan is HUGE!

                                     JIMBO
                         Now that is a man who has eaten a 
                         lot of beef.

               Jesus tries to look tough, but he's obviously scared. Stan 
               and Kyle look at each other with deep concern.


               Everybody is still gathered around for the weigh in. Satan 
               stands in front of Jesus looking tough and confident.

                                     SATAN
                         Son of God, I will smash thy face 
                         into small little bits.

               Jesus swallows hard, then tries desperately not to sound 
               scared.

                                     JESUS
                         Oh... Oh yeah?

                                     SATAN
                         I have such delightful horrors to 
                         unleash upon thee.

                                     JESUS
                         Oh yeah?

               The Townspeople look at each other, concerned. The Weigh In 
               Guy stands with a large scale. He gestures for Satan to step 
               up, and he does.

                                     WEIGH IN GUY
                         Satan weighs in at... Three Hundred 
                         and Twenty pounds four ounces!

               The townspeople all gasp. Jesus replaces Satan on the scale.

                                     WEIGH IN GUY
                         Jesus Christ weighs in at... A hundred 
                         and thirty-five pounds -- one ounce!

               Stan and Kyle look at each other.

                                     CHEF
                         Ooh, crap.

                                     JESUS
                              (Checking the scale)
                         Oh come on, I weigh more than that!

               Satan throws his arms in the air.

                                     SATAN
                         LET THE NEW PRINCE BE DECIDED ON 
                         SATURDAY!! FIRST SOUTH PARK, THEN 
                         THE WORLD!!!!!!!!

               Satan leaves. Jesus stands there, still obviously shaken.

               The Townspeople look around, with knowing nods.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well... I think I'll uh... I think I 
                         left the oven on...

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yeah... I think I left your oven on, 
                         too...

               All the Townspeople slowly back away. Jesus looks at them 
               suspiciously.

                                     PRIEST MAXI
                         See ya, Saturday, Jesus. Good Luck...


               A few children are standing in a circle with Pip in the 
               middle.

                                     CLYDE
                         I bet I can spit the most on him!

               Clyde let's a loogie go on Pip.

                                     BEBE
                         Oh yeah, I bet I can get spit in his 
                         hair!

               Bebe spits a wod in Pip's eye.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, nice try! A little higher and 
                         you've got it.

               At another part of the playground, the boys are all just 
               standing around, since all the playground equipment was burned 
               down by Damien.

                                     STAN
                         Man, recess sucks without any slides 
                         or nothin'.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, here comes unholy butthole now.

               Damien walks by.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey! Thanks a lot for burning 
                         everything down, you little bitch!

               Damien takes a deep breath.

                                     DAMIEN
                         I apologize for ruining your 
                         playground and turning your friend 
                         into a duck billed platypus. I was 
                         doing my father's bidding. I didn't 
                         have a choice.

               The boys all think.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, oh!

               Cartman walks up to Damien and farts on him.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, excuse me, new kid! I didn't 
                         mean to fart on you, I didn't have a 
                         choice!

               Damien looks pissed, but he holds back.

                                     STAN
                         Whew! You stink new kid! You smell 
                         like a fart!

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, we're gonna call you fart boy 
                         from now on!

               Damien walks off, pissed off and sad.

                                     STAN
                         Bye Bye, Fart boy!

                                     KYLE
                         See ya!

               Damien leaves and walks up to Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Good day. How are you, Damien?

                                     DAMIEN
                         Those guys farted on me and then 
                         called me --

                                     PIP
                         Fart boy? Oh good, perhaps they won't 
                         call ME that any more!


               Jesus walks out of the bar huffingly and bumps into the boys.

                                     STAN
                         Hey, Jesus.

                                     JESUS
                         What are you doing out so late, kids?

                                     KYLE
                         We have to find red and green mega-
                         mans for Cartman's birthday party.

                                     JESUS
                         Oh...
                              (thinking)
                         Kids... YOU believe I can beat Satan, 
                         right?

                                     STAN
                         Sure, dude, you're the son of God.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. You aren't having doubts are 
                         you?

                                     JESUS
                         No, no...
                              (Pause)
                         But could you help me train a little?


               Cartman's birthday party is an AMAZING event. There are 
               elephants, clowns, mimes, and even a ferris wheel.

               A large Banner reads 'Happy Birthday, Eric!'

               Cartman's mother walks through the huge crowd of kids, 
               carrying an ENORMOUS amount of food.

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Come on, kiddies! Eat more!

               Cartman is walking tall, wearing a little pointed birthday 
               hat. He greets children as they walk in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Welcome, Clyde. Please put your 
                         present on the table to your left... 
                         Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your 
                         left... Welcome Chef...

               Chef walks in.

                                     CHEF
                         Yup, here's your present, children. 
                         Well, nice party, see you later.

               Chef starts to walk out.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, you just got here, Chef!

                                     CHEF
                         I know, but the fight is starting!

                                     STAN
                         But dude, check it out, Cartman's 
                         mom made chili.

               Mrs. Cartman gives Chef a wink.

                                     CHEF
                         Mmmm, that's my favorite kind of 
                         chili.


               Damien and Pip are sitting alone on the curb.

                                     DAMIEN
                         I guess all the kids are at that fat 
                         boy's birthday party.

                                     PIP
                         Yes... It's always such a huge event. 
                         Sometimes I like to sneak up to the 
                         fence and close my eyes, and pretend 
                         I'm there.

                                     DAMIEN
                         The other kids have ALWAYS hated 
                         you?

                                     PIP
                         Oh, yes. Actually, I think they make 
                         fun of the fat boy a lot too, but 
                         now I think they like him because he 
                         picks on me.

               Damien suddenly gets an idea.


               A good sized place for a boxing match.


               The big birthday party continues. Boys and girls run around 
               and play and laugh.

               Suddenly, Damien and Pip walk in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY! What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing here?!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, YOU aren't invited, new kid!

                                     KYLE
                         And neither are YOU, PIP!

                                     PIP
                         Yes, I tried to tell Damien that we 
                         weren't invited, but --

                                     DAMIEN
                         Wait a minute, give me a chance! I 
                         want to do something special for 
                         your party...

               Just then, Damien touches Pip -- and something incredible 
               happens. Demons come up from the ground and grab onto Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Oh NOOOO!!!!!!

               The demons hoist Pip up into the air. Pip's clothes catch on 
               fire. He screams horrifically.

                                     KYLE
                         Wow!

               Pip's body flies up into the sky and PWOOF!!! An explosion 
               like beautiful fireworks illuminate the party.

               The kids all cheer and applaud.

                                     STAN
                         Wow, that was COOL!!!

                                     KYLE
                         Hey... You're not such a bad guy 
                         after all, Damien!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, come on in and join the party!

               Damien absolutely beams with happiness.


               Cartman is wearing a little birthday hat on his head and 
               standing at a table opening gifts.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, I wonder what Stan got me for my 
                         birthday... Oh look! A blue Mega-
                         Man!

               Cartman pulls out the toy and smiles.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Thank you, Stan, you may eat pie and 
                         cake and ice cream, now.

               Stan dashes off.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And what did Wendy get me?
                              (Before he even opens 
                              it)
                         Oh, it's The Yellow Mega-Man!

               Now Cartman opens the present and sure enough, The Yellow 
               Mega Man is inside.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Help yourself to pie, cake and ice 
                         cream, Wendy.

               Wendy dashes off.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh! Look what Kyle got me! it's a 
                         Red Mega --
                              (Opening the gift)
                         Ants in the Pants?!

               Cartman pulls out the game.

                                     CARTMAN
                         ANTS IN THE PANTS?! ANTS IN THE 
                         PANTS?!

                                     KYLE
                         It's a game, dude. It's really fun.

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!!

               Cartman tackles Kyle and knocks him to the ground.

                                     KYLE
                         AAGHGH!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED 
                         MEGA MAN!!! NOW I CAN'T MAKE ULTRA 
                         MEGA-MEGA MAN!! YOU DIRTY CHEAP ASS 
                         PIECE OF CRAP!!!

               Cartman slugs Kyle repeatedly.

                                     KYLE
                         THEY WERE ALL OUT OF 'EM, DUDE!!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I HATE YOU!!! I WANT YOU TO DIE!!!! 
                         DIE!!!!!!!!!

               Cartman suddenly gets up and yells to everybody.

                                     CARTMAN
                         THAT'S IT!! PARTY IS OVER!!! EVERYBODY 
                         GO HOME!!!

               The kids all look stunned. Cartman walks over to a HUGE switch 
               and pulls it down. Immediately the entire party shuts down -- 
               The ferris wheel stops, the lights go off and all the music 
               stops.

                                     CARTMAN
                         GET THE HELL OUT I SAID!! PARTY'S 
                         OVER!!! GET OUT GODAMNIT!!

               The kids all start to file out.

                                     STAN
                              (Walking out)
                         Whoa dude, you need to mellow out.

               Cartman throws the box at Kyle.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Take you stupid ants in the pants 
                         with you!!!


               All the kids are gathered outside, in shock.

                                     DAMIEN
                         Wow, that kid has some real emotional 
                         problems.

                                     STAN
                         Aw, he does this all the time.

               Chef starts running down the street.

                                     CHEF
                         Come on, children!! We can still 
                         catch the end of the fight!!!

               Pip drops out of the sky.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, what a splendid party.


               Cartman is sitting at a table by himself surrounded by half 
               eaten cakes, pies, and all kinds of other crap. Food is all 
               over the place.

               Cartman's face is covered with food, his eyes are half closed. 
               It looks like a food war has been fought, but actually Cartman 
               has just gorged himself.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
