Rebecca moves quickly down the poorly lit, ominous alley.  
All local businesses are closed.

Suddenly -- A VEHICLE appears in the alley, its headlights 
BLARE.  Rebecca squints and shields her eyes.  The driver 
STOMPS the gas.  Rebecca never has a chance -- #01006/108                2            Rev. Green  10/01/10




Thirty minutes later.  LAPD, LAFD, and EMTs fill the alley  
along with LOOKIE-LOOS and the STAFF from the restaurant. 
An ambulance speeds away from the scene, lights flashing 
and siren wailing.  WINTERS and TJ get briefed by SGT. 
COOPER (30s, female, drained). 

SGT. COOPER
EMT said she had multiple fractures, 
internal bleeding --

TJ indicates the large pool of blood where Rebecca lay --

TJ
Lot of external bleeding too.

SGT. COOPER
They re giving her 50-50 odds.*

WINTERS
We know where she came from?

SGT. COOPER
(indicates)
The restaurant.  They said she works 
there.  Name s Rebecca Townley.

Cooper indicates objects scattered on the ground --

SGT. COOPER (cont d)
We got a purse here, car keys there, 
cellphone smashed to bits --

TJ
How about a witness?

SGT. COOPER
Santa Claus.

She motions to a HOMELESS MAN (60s, African American) with 
a full white beard, round belly and Santa hat, sitting on 
the edge of the perimeter, watched over by a Uni.  

SGT. COOPER (cont d)
He says he saw it go down.

Winters gives TJ a  this is all you  look.  TJ crosses to 
the Homeless Man.

TJ
How re you doing, sir?  You saw what 
happened to that girl?

HOMELESS MAN
Santa needs cookies and milk first.

He rubs his index and thumb together.

TJ
Sorry, sir.  Can t do that.  I always 
figured Santa to be a good citizen.

HOMELESS MAN
(a beat, then --)
That car come at her like a bat outta 
hell.  It hit her.  Then it stop.  Then 
it back up over her again.

TJ
You see the driver or the license?

HOMELESS MAN
No.  But the car, it coulda been gray 
or black.  That s all.

TJ
Okay, thank you.
(aside, to Uni)
Take Santa down the street to Tommy s, 
get him a chili dog.  And don t let him 
out of your sight.

He hands the Uni a couple of bucks, then joins Winters 
who s looking through Rebecca s purse.

TJ (cont d)
The car took two runs at the girl.  
Makes it attempted murder.  

WINTERS
Homicide.

Off TJ, Winters shows him what he found in the purse -- a 
SONOGRAM PHOTO from Rebecca s purse.  The photo is taped to 
a card inscribed with Rebecca s name.

WINTERS (cont d)
Rebecca Townley was 16 weeks pregnant.

TJ reacts.  The cops consider the pooled blood.  Off 
Winters as he moves off --

ACT ONE



Expansive homes on a tree-lined street.  ROBERT FORESTER 
(37, business attire) pays a cab and grabs his luggage as 
Winters and TJ approach.  (NOTE: in the driveway is a green 
SUV).  TJ badges Forester.

TJ
Robert Forester?

ROBERT
Yes?  

WINTERS 
You been away?

ROBERT
On business.  In Twenty-Nine Palms.  
What s this about?

WINTERS
Your ex-wife, Rebecca Townley, was in

WINTERS
She s in a coma.

Winters and TJ approach the house with two Unis.  Winters 
knocks.  A woman, CAROLYN, 30s, answers.  They badge her.*

WINTERS
Afternoon, ma am.  LAPD.  We have a 
warrant to search the house. 
(hands it to her)
May I have your name please?

CAROLYN*
A search warrant?  Why?

TJ

ACT TWO



Our cops with LOUISE HAMMOND (64, spry, caftan over bathing 
suit) as she fishes leaves from the pool with a skimmer.  

LOUISE
My husband and I are supporting 
candidates for state assembly.  Adam s 
firm helped me with the fundraiser.

TJ
Till what time was he here?

LOUISE
About ten-thirty.  That s when my 
husband kicked everybody out.  He goes 
to bed early, he s training for an Iron 
Man.  He s seventy-one.

WINTERS
How well do you know Mr. Yarborough?

LOUISE
Well enough.  We ve relied on him for 
five or six years now, we raise money 
for charities, cultural events -- can 
you reach that grapefruit for me?

She hands the skimmer to TJ, motions to a grapefruit 
floating in the middle of the pool.  As TJ fishes for it.

LOUISE (cont d)
Worst idea my husband ever had, putting 
a fruit tree uphill from the pool.  
Darn things are constantly rolling in.  
Is Adam in trouble?

TJ
Probably not.  He ever mention the name 
Rebecca Townley?

LOUISE
No.  Oh I see...For what it s worth, 
I ve never seen Adam so much as look at 
another woman.

WINTERS
The night of your fundraiser, how was 
he -- worried, preoccupied? 

LOUISE
He s always preoccupied.  That s what 
makes him so good.

TJ has fished out the grapefruit, holds it in the skimmer s 
basket for Louise.

TJ
You remember if he left with anyone?

LOUISE
Congressman Nelson from Riverside.  
Chairman of Defense Appropriations?  It 
was Adam who convinced him to attend -- 
they go back to the 2000 campaign.
(re: grapefruit)
It s all yours.  My husband and I can t 
eat them.  Doctor s orders.



Off the 10.  Winters, TJ, and LOCAL PD chat with gas 
station owner HAL (50s, grease monkey) who stares at a DMV 
photo of Robert Forester, hands it back.

HAL
No, I didn t see the man, I close at 
eleven, but like I told the officer 
here, when I got to the station about 6 
am that morning, I come to find 
somebody busted the lock on the hose.  
There was a huge puddle of water out 
back.  Looked like they washed their 
car.

WINTERS
Show us where?

The cops follow Hal to the back of the run-down place --

WINTERS (cont d)
There anything else besides a puddle?

HAL
A shirt, looked like it was used to 
clean the car.

TJ
So the shirt, long gone by now.

HAL
Naw.  Still have it.  Good cotton shirt 
makes a good rag.

He picks the shirt from among others rags on a towel rod 
near the hose out back.  Hands it to the cops.

HAL (cont d)
Can t have too many rags in a gas 
station.

Off the cops --



A patrol car leads Winters and TJ s Charger into New Parker 
Center.  Forester in the back, trying to hide his face from 
the reporters flooding the entrance to the garage.  Morales 
and Price witness the circus.

MORALES
One down.  Now lets bag us a real live 
Congressman.

Morales leaves Price behind as he walks toward the 
expectant press shouting for a comment.

ACT FOUR



Morales and Price with Rebecca in a wheelchair.

REBECCA
Tom was adding me and the baby to his *
family trust.  It would ve taken effect 
after the baby was born.

MORALES
You re sure it was his family trust?

REBECCA
Yes.  I signed papers at the lawyer s 
office.  Tom said our baby would never *
have to worry about anything.

MORALES
It sounds like he made it clear you had 
a future together, as a family.

REBECCA
That s what Tom said.*

PRICE
Did his wife know?

REBECCA
Tom hadn t told her yet.  He said we *
had to wait for the right time...

Rebecca sees a nurse approach.

REBECCA (cont d)
I have to go back in...
(beat, looks up)
Sometimes, I still feel the baby inside 
me...The nurse says it s normal.

Morales and Price watch as the nurse wheels Rebecca away.

MORALES
There s no way Nelson could ve legally 
added Rebecca to the family trust 
without his wife s permission.

PRICE
So either Rebecca lied to us, or Nelson 
lied to her.

Morales mulls it over a little longer, then --

PRICE (cont d)
If Nelson s wife wasn t going to be 
around -- I mean like really not around 
-- her consent to add Rebecca to the 
trust would be immaterial.

MORALES
Not around, as in dead?

PRICE
She had cancer four years ago.
(then)
Say the cancer came back.

PRICE
If his wife found out --

MORALES
She d be very pissed.



Winters and TJ, followed by a Palm Springs PD patrol car, 
drive up a residential street.

They pull up to a house.  The windows are shuttered, no car 
in the driveway.  The place looks deserted.  The cops get 
out of the car and walk up the driveway.

AT THE NELSON HOUSE --

MORALES
They keep a car there, don t they?  A 
1986 tan Cadillac Deville?  A car *
matching the description of the one 
that ran down Rebecca Townley. *

No response from an increasingly apprehensive Patricia.  
Price gets a text.

PRICE*
The police are outside the house now.*

AT THE HOUSE IN PALM SPRINGS --

The Patrol Officers and our cops are putting a jack in 
place to force open the garage door.

AT THE NELSON HOUSE --

MORALES
You have one chance, Mrs. Nelson.  *
Agree to testify against your co-*
conspirators and I ll keep you out of *
prison.  You can die with dignity, at 
home.  But once the police pry open 
that garage and find the car, all bets 
are off.

Patricia is weakening --

AT THE HOUSE IN PALM SPRINGS --

The cops are using the jack to slowly lift the garage door.

AT THE NELSON HOUSE --

Price is checking her phone for a text --

PRICE
They re getting the door open.

MORALES
Mrs. Nelson, your time is running out. 

Patricia finally gives in.

PATRICIA
All right.  Yes.  I found out about 
Thomas and that girl.  That he would do *
this to me, to our son...I...
(focused)
I told Robert Forester that I d get him *
fired unless he helped me.  He refused 
at first but when I told him his ex-
wife was pregnant, that cinched it... I *
told him about my uncle s car, I gave 
him a key for the garage.  I went to 
the congressional office, I used a *
computer to fabricate an alibi for *
Forester...

MORALES
Did anyone else help you?

PATRICIA
No.  Just Forester.  *

A beat.  Morales nods to Price.  She goes to the front door 
to let in two female Riverside Sheriff s Deputies.  
Patricia looks at Morales --

PATRICIA (cont d)
It just... simply could not happen.  He *
couldn t just erase me...*

Morales gets it.  The Unis help her up.*

The cops finally get the garage door open.  Light pours

AT THE NELSON HOME --

Morales and Price follow Patricia and the Unis to the front 
door, when Price gets a text.  She checks it, then shows it 
to Morales.  Morales reacts.  Then, to Patricia --

MORALES
Who else knew your uncle kept a car in 
Palm Springs?

PATRICIA
Just Thomas.  Why?*

MORALES
The garage was empty.  No car.

Patricia is uncomprehending.

PATRICIA
That s not possible.  I gave Forester 
specific instructions to put the car 
back in the garage.  He would not have 
gotten rid of it.  

MORALES
I m sure he didn t.  But I m thinking 
your husband did.  He found out what 
you d done, he tried to protect you.

A crack appears in Patricia s demeanor....

PATRICIA
Oh God...Tom...*
