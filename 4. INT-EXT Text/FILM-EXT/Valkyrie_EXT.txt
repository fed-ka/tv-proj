TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT.
13 MARCH 1943.
A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand
rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform
denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.
TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF
STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.
Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only
movement in the frame.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by
Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS
escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party
dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie.
Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of
distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.
Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200
Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109
fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar
that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the
massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters
roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors
come to rest and, needing no introduction:
ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by
the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.
(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire
sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)
2.
Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,
but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Fhrer
marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or
their waiting limo.
To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto
the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the
windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.
Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.
VOICE (O.S.)
It's not so much your car he
doesn't trust... It's your driver.
Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:
TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER
OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.
The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in
a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops
into the limo they brought for Hitler.
Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A
beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.

3
Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is
bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.
4
6
The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.
Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt
is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.
4.
Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently
handles a carefully wrapped package.
CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of
the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The
explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.
TRESCKOW
With my regards to Colonel Stieff.
Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He
studies the familiar shape.
BRANDT
Cointreau? You better hope I don't
get thirsty on the flight.
Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having
just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.
Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with
Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him
along with, we hope, the Fhrer's fate.
Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:

Est. An early morning fog blankets the ground,
obscuring our view. Eerie.

TITLES: TUNISIA, NORTH AFRICA - THE RETREATING 10TH
PANZER DIVISION. 7 APRIL 1943.
Moving rapidly through an olive grove in the
otherwise wasted desert. A column of tanks, trucks
and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely
contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around
others dumping documents into burning oil drums.
In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young
officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform
complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than
the other side of your pillow. He directs men this
way and that, holding back panic.
TITLES: COLONEL CLAUS VON STAUFFENBERG - STAFF
OFFICER, 10TH PANZER DIVISION.
9.
A jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by
a YOUNG LIEUTENANT.
YOUNG LIEUTENANT
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new
headquarters has been established
at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there.
Stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless.
STAUFFENBERG
Now they tell us to disengage - a
day late. No matter how many times
we tell Command the reality, they
always manage to leave us-
But he stops himself, containing his rage.
YOUNG LIEUTENANT
Colonel, the enemy is less than
five kilometers from here. You've
done all you can.
Stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating
a ring on his finger. After a beat:
STAUFFENBERG
I wonder... Was there even a point
in our coming to Tunis?
YOUNG LIEUTENANT
To get taken prisoner, it seems.
Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:
BOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the
tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead.
Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery
blasts strike in front and behind the retreating
column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.
Panic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg
taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.
Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short
supply and many are left in the open. So they run.
Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The
survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn
to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the
other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.
Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.
10.
STAUFFENBERG
STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.
The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him.
They turn and watch the formation of planes complete
their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense,
some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
STAND FAST, I SAID.
They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines
growing louder, meaner...
13
14
STAUFFENBERG
NOW.
The mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left -
as the fighters open fire on what had been the center
of their mass. Unable to change course quickly
enough, they spray their lead into the sand.
In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his
seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and
a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet.
Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the
turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns
to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But
Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's
head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER
coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of
frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body.
BANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield
before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear
blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION.
SILENCE. FADE TO WHITE.
15
20
The city sleeps. An unsettling image knowing that, in
war, quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye.
21
23
A depressed Stauffenberg walks down the deserted
night streets. Silent but for the echo of his
footsteps. Eerie.
Across the street, an OLD WOMAN peers nervously out
her window. The instant Stauffenberg makes eye
contact she steps back, drawing the curtains. Afraid.
He approaches a cozy brick cottage - the Berlin home
he shares with his brother, Berthold. He is surprised
when he looks through the window to find FOUR
CHILDREN laughing and playing - the sound of music on
a phonograph. Bittersweet.
21.
In the next house over, he catches sight of a TEENAGE
BOY, the picture of Aryan youth, watching him
suspiciously from the upstairs window. It seems
everyone is watching everyone in Hitler's German.
24
34
A car loaded with luggage. Stauffenberg hugs his
children, one by one, before placing them inside.
Then he turns to face Nina. As always, there is much
to be said that they cannot say. She gently touches
the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the
cross she gave him. They embrace tightly and kiss.
She gets in the car, looking at him through the back
window as she is driven away.
35
35
Darkness. As our eyes adjust we realize we are in the
middle of the woods. Is this a dream? A nightmare? We
are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance.
36
36
From out of the darkness comes a candle held by a
nervous, almost mousy young woman, FRAULEIN VON OVEN.
Walking just behind her is Tresckow. He carries a
small but heavy case in one hand.
They come to a clearing in the woods and find a
strange sight. In the center is a tree stump
surrounded by papers, including the original orders
for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise
marked with the seal of the Reich. The orders have
been meticulously annotated.
VOICE (O.S.)
Were you followed?
33.
Fraulein Oven gasps. Tresckow turns, pistol drawn.
The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from
Stauffenberg's eyepatch. Stauffenberg smiles,
emerging from the shadows.
TRESCKOW
Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me
half to death.
STAUFFENBERG
We'll be closer than that before
we're finished.
37
37
Wearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case
Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter.
She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into
the machine and sets the margins carefully. Pause.
Then she starts typing with remarkable speed.
(Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene,
punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each
time a little louder.)
Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the
Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes.
TRESCKOW
Looking this over, I'm not
satisfied that the Reserve Army is
enough to shut down Berlin
completely.
STAUFFENBERG
(handing over papers)
Yes, I've been giving that some
thought. We should include any
field units that are home on leave.
Before Tresckow can respond, more papers:
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
I've also drawn up an outline for
orders to streamline combat groups
in order to quietly concentrate
forces at vital points - state and
government buildings, of course,
but also the radio and newspapers.
More papers. Tresckow can barely keep up.
34.
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
Combat groups will be reorganized
as reinforced grenadier regiments.
One or two of them can be quickly
mobilized, eliminating the usual
six hour lag. We blitz the
government quarter, arrest all
Ministers and Party leaders,
surround all SS and police
barracks. Any officers who resist
will be arrested... or shot.
CRACK. A carriage return as loud as a rifle-shot.
38
38
A truck full of soldiers roars past. Stauffenberg,
Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit
bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the
middle.
Stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the
Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter
case. They stop at the center of the bridge, looking
around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone
could be watching from the shadows. Eerie.
STAUFFENBERG
(to the Fraulein)
If anyone comes to you, play
ignorant. Just tell them-
FRAULEIN OVEN
I'll tell that I was serving the
German people. Then I'll tell them
to go to hell.
Both men smile, a bit taken aback. Von Oven shakes
each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the
darkness. When she is gone:
TRESCKOW
To Operation Valkyrie.
Stauffenberg nods. Tresckow heaves the typewriter
case over the railing and into the water below.
SPLASH.
They watch in silence as the water settles, then:
35.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
I've been transferred to the front.
STAUFFENBERG
(shocked)
Why didn't you tell me?
TRESCKOW
Would you have stayed?
Obviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg.
STAUFFENBERG
Do you think Fromm reported us?
TRESCKOW
It's more likely just... an
unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it
doesn't matter. You wrote the
orders. You know them better than
anyone.
STAUFFENBERG
You don't mean to say-
TRESCKOW
I'm appointing you military leader
of the Resistance. Beck agrees.
STAUFFENBERG
But Olbricht-
TRESCKOW
We both know Olbricht hasn't the
wit or the spine. No. It's you.
A million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's
mind. Fear. Anxiety. But he knows what he must do.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
One more thing. You were right what
you said that first night. It's not
enough to kill Hitler. We need to
isolate his chain of command. The
slightest confusion could crush us.
We need to be certain that no
conflicting orders get out after
the flash.
Stauffenberg considers this for a moment.
36.
STAUFFENBERG
That greatly limits our options of
where and when to make our move,
but it's the only way.
TRESCKOW
How will you do it?
STAUFFENBERG
Perhaps it's better I don't say.
Pause. A sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment
ago he was in charge. Now he has no clearance.
TRESCKOW
God promised Abraham that he would
not destroy Sodom if he could find
just ten righteous men.
He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's shoulder.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
I have a feeling that for Germany
it may come down to one.

TITLES: 6 JUNE 1944.
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF D-DAY. Allied forces invade
Normandy. The liberation of Europe has begun.
But this is not the D-Day you learned about in
history class. This is a German newsreel. Nazi spin.
In it, Hitler's forces have nothing to fear.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
(subtitles)
The Allied Forces have blundered
into the trap awaiting them on the
beaches of Normandy - heroically
repelled by the combined might of
the German Army. It is a glorious
day for the Reich. At long last the
craven enemy has come to Europe to
face their inevitable defeat at the
hands of-
43
44
Est. Hitler's forboding southern headquarters.
TITLES: THE BERGHOF. 7 JUNE 1944.
Stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs -
at the top he sees a group of WAITING ADJUTANTS
quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted
Nazis. In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy
officer we saw outside Fromm's office. He watches
Stauffenberg pass, aloof. We hate him.
44.
Just then Stauffenberg is greeted by TWO SS OFFICERS
who move to physically search him - one his body, the
other his valise.
VOICE (O.S.)
You don't need to search him.
ANGLE ON: Fromm's adjutant, Lt. Herber approaches,
waving off the SS.
HERBER
Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored
guest. The hero of Africa.
The SS officers stand down. Herber and Stauffenberg
share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm
walks up on them:
FROMM
For God's sake, Stauffenberg,
you're-
He pauses, clearly caught off guard when he sees
Stauffenberg with two eyes.
FROMM (CONT'D)
... they're waiting for you.
45
46
Fromm escorts a visibly shaken Stauffenberg to his
waiting vehicle. Haeften opens the car door for
Stauffenberg to get in. Fromm leans in.
FROMM
I don't know what you've got
brewing and I don't want to know...
But when the music stops, I'd be
much obliged if Keitel should find
himself without a chair.
47.
Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a
condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before
Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut
and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.
47
49
Est. The sound of children at play takes us to:
50
50
Once again, the scene idyllic. The Stauffenberg
children play football in the distance. Stauffenberg
himself is out of uniform for the first time since
the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed.
49.
Nina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half
talking to her husband. Stauffenberg cannot hear a
word she is saying - he is miles away.
He looks over at his children. One would never
suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and
that the country is facing total devastation.
NINA
...After that I thought I'd take
the children to the country for a
few days to see my- Claus?
He snaps out of his thoughts. "Hmmm?"
NINA (CONT'D)
Have you heard a word I said?
STAUFFENBERG
The country...
(thinking)
Nina. Listen. I want you to delay
your trip. Just for a while.
She wants to ask, he wants to tell her. Finally:
NINA
Does this have something to do
with... your work?
STAUFFENBERG
I would just be more comfortable
knowing where you are - until I'm
back from Berlin. Things will be
different then. I promise.
Long pause. Once again, a couple who know each other
well enough to not have to say things plainly. Nina
is worried but strong.
NINA
How long until... until we see you?
STAUFFENBERG
A few days. If all goes well. Then
we can travel as a family.
NINA
And if things... don't go well?
He hesitates.
50.
STAUFFENBERG
I love you, Nina.
NINA
And I love you... What-
CHILDREN
PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. (Etc.)
The children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the
one sport he can play. He is about to say something
to Nina, but she cuts him off.
NINA
Go be with your children.
Stauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and
kissing her forehead. We stay on her as he joins the
children. She watches them play together, seeing her
husband laughing for the first time in a long while.
Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and
anguish. Too good to last, too much to bear.
51
Shots of scattered elements of the Reserve Army
coming together, taking shape:
RESERVISTS and CADETS, from all walks of life, rush
to their homes, hastily trading their civilian
clothes for uniforms.

54
TITLES: 15 JULY 1944.
Stauffenberg and Haeften board a waiting courier
plane, preparing for departure. Both are clutching
their briefcases, faces like stone. Stauffenberg is
dressed once again in his ornate, formal attire - his
patch gone, glass eye in place.
55.
AIR SIRENS wail. A SCULPTED EAGLE AND SWASTIKA loom
over a large pillared stronghold.
From out of the surrounding barracks, RESERVE
SOLDIERS scramble to march readiness, assembling on
the center parade grounds, awaiting orders.
Vehicles move into place along the perimeter. All in
all, a well-oiled machine.
CLOSE ON THE BERLIN COMMANDANT - GENERAL PAUL VON
HASE - issuing the alert signal. AIR SIRENS wail.
RESERVE SOLDIERS scramble into readiness. Vehicles
move into place - a well-oiled machine.
We focus on two officers in particular: MAJOR OTTO
ERNST REMER, Commander of the Deutschland Guard
Battalion, and SECOND LIEUTENANT DR. HANS HAGEN.
Loyal Nazis both.
REMER
What do you suppose this is all
about?
HAGEN
Probably just a drill.
But Remer doesn't seem convinced. Remember him.
56
56
Shots of Stauffenberg and Haeften deplaning/getting
into a waiting car/slowly making their way to their
destination. Finally, they arrive at:
57
57
Est. A 625 acre compound hidden deep in the mosquito
infested forests of Wilhelmsdorf. Security is tight -
barbed wire fencing, checkpoints, flak towers,
machine gun nests, trenches, land mines.
TITLES: WOLFSCHANZE - "THE WOLF'S LAIR". HITLER'S
BAVARIAN HEADQUARTERS.
56.
58
58
The car carrying Stauffenberg and Haeften arrives at
the first security checkpoint.
TWO GUARDS check identity papers and confiscate
pistols from Haeften and The Driver. Stauffenberg
boldly extends his valise to one of the Guards, but
rather than reach for it, the young soldier snaps to
attention and raises his hand in a Nazi salute, eyes
straight ahead, stone-like. A drone.
After an awkward pause:
STAUFFENBERG
(to the Driver)
Drive on.
CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG'S BAG. A series of JUMP CUTS
follow the bag through the extensive security layers
one must endure before getting to the meeting. ID is
checked frequently. The bags, not once. The men here
are Hitler's inner circle, after all.
59
59
Finally, Stauffenberg and Haeften are escorted toward
the bunker where the meeting will be held. Pausing,
Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to find:
THE COMMUNICATIONS HUT - through the open door of the
small shack we see a mass of radios and telegraphs. A
LONE FIGURE stands outside, smoking a cigarette.
HAEFTEN
(whispering to Haeften)
Your man?
Yes. And it is none other than GENERAL ERICH
FELLGIEBEL, the man Stauffenberg confronted in the
bathroom at the Officers' Club so long ago.
He and Stauffenberg share a long, intense stare.
Finally, Fellgiebel nods, dropping his cigarette and
crushing it with his boot. He's in.
Stauffenberg and Haeften head inside the impervious
bunker through the heavy steel door.
57.
60
65
A military sedan skids to a stop outside the Guard
Battalion headquarters. Olbricht jumps from the car,
racing to get General Hase's attention.
LARGE FORMATIONS of soldiers stand at attention in
the hot sun, awaiting orders.
HASE
(whispering)
What the hell is going on? My men
have been standing here for an
hour. I don't know what to tell
them.
CLOSE ON REMER (the officer we told you to remember)
standing before the ranks. He eyes Hase and Olbricht
suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying.
After a moment, Hase addresses the men.
60.
HASE (CONT'D)
At ease, gentlemen.
Olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to
hide his nerves.
OLBRICHT
This has been a drill. You're all
to be commended for your quick
response. Dismissed.
Pause. The men linger, confused until:
OLBRICHT (CONT'D)
HEIL HITLER.
SOLDIERS
HEIL HITLER.
And the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just
light up and shoot the shit. Hagen approaches Remer.
HAGEN
What did I tell you? A drill.
But Remer is not so sure. The way he stares at
Olbricht makes us nervous.
CLOSE ON: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making
note of the esteemed KNIGHT'S CROSS pinned to Remer's
uniform. Olbricht leans toward Hase.
OLBRICHT
That man there. Who is he?
HASE
Major Remer? He commands the
Deutschland Guard Battalion. What
about him?
OLBRICHT
Get rid of him.
HASE
Remer? Don't worry about him. He's
an order taker. To the bone.
Ah yes... But whose orders?
61.

In these waking hours Berlin appears quite peaceful.
Only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that
the city is surrounded by war.
72
74
TITLES: 20 JULY 1944. 6:00 AM.
Haeften holds the door for Stauffenberg, stepping
into a military sedan.
67.
75
75
For the first time we see Berlin in broad daylight -
the city in ruins. The drive through the rubbled,
smoky streets is particularly eerie today.
78
78
TITLES: 7:00 AM.
Haeften and Stauffenberg board a three-engine courier
plane - each carrying a leather briefcase. A moment
later the plane is taking off.
79
80
Stauffenberg and Haeften are driven in a topless
sedan. Each carries his leather briefcase.
BECK (V.O.)
Once in position, he will signal us
once to alert the troops and again
after the flash...
81
81
Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly get in the sedan -
the concrete bunker just behind him - its steel door
closed. They speed out of frame a beat before a
muffled explosion rocks the bunker - the steel door
bulges but holds fast. Only a wisp of smoke escapes.
82
83
Establishing shots of the idle troops and equipment
as they are once again called into action.
BECK (V.O.)
Then he'll notify all district
commanders between Paris and Berlin
that the SS is attempting to seize
power. The Reserve Army will arrest
all SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials.
The same soldiers are now storming government
buildings and seizing personnel.
69.
84
88
The plane touches down and taxis to a stop.
Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step
into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful
Nazi. SECOND LIEUTENANT KRETZ. Remember him.
89
89
Even this early, the heat is oppressive.
We watch from a distance as the courier car is
stopped at the outer checkpoint. Once again, the
GUARD carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's
identification and takes their pistols before
allowing the car to pass. We follow.
90
90
Est. Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel's office as the
courier car arrives.
Stauffenberg and Haeften are greeted by Freyend who
shows them to:
91
97
Freyend scurries, trying to catch up with Keitel.
Stauffenberg and Haeften lag behind.
STAUFFENBERG
(to Haeften)
See that the car is ready.
Haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand - the
second, unarmed explosive inside.
HAEFTEN
But sir-
STAUFFENBERG
I have everything I need,
Lieutenant. Thank you.
Haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as Freyend
turns back, eager for Stauffenberg to pick up the
pace. He reaches for the briefcase.
75.
FREYEND
Please. Let me help you with that.
STAUFFENBERG
(pulling it away)
I can manage, thank you.
Freyend seems more than just a little peeved. But
Stauffenberg doesn't notice. He is focused straight
ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left.
The bunker suddenly seems miles away.
98
98
Security Perimeter I. Keitel and his men file through
the heavily guarded entrance. Each man holds up his
pass for the GUARDS to inspect. Stauffenberg is last.
Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead -
AWAY FROM THE BUNKER. Stauffenberg is confused.
STAUFFENBERG
Where are they going?
FREYEND
It's too hot. The briefing has been
moved to the conference hut.
ANGLE ON: The conference hut. The door and many
windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open.
Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure
vital to Stauffenberg's plan. But this obstacle only
seems to strengthen his resolve. He is a soldier
after all. And no military operation goes according
to plan. Making matters worse:
FREYEND (CONT'D)
Sir, your briefcase. I insist.
Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion,
Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. He
watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut. Pause.
Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to:
Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building.
The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room
before the bomb goes off. They share a nod. Then
Stauffenberg steps into the hut.
76.
99
104
Fellgiebel and Haeften watch anxiously as
Stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks
toward them, slow and deliberate - eerily calm.
The hut explodes outward like a house of cards.
Bodies are thrown clear. Everyone hits the deck
except Stauffenberg. He just keeps walking.
A great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. The
sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and
ash. STUNNED OFFICERS are running about. Shouting.
Screaming. Absolute chaos.
Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned.
Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building
and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel.
STAUFFENBERG
Contact General Olbricht in Berlin.
Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed
with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever
all communications.
Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call.
Stauffenberg leads Haeften to their waiting car -
still driven by young Lt. Kretz.
80.
He too is stunned by the explosion - so much so that
he does not think to get out and open the door for
his passengers. Stauffenberg climbs in next to Kretz,
pushing Haeften in the back.
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
(to Kretz)
Drive.
(Kretz lingers)
LIEUTENANT.
Kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear,
speeding off down the forested trail. Stauffenberg
and Haeften look back for a clear view of the total
destruction. Bodies are carried out of the demolished
hut - the grounds littered with the wounded.
Surly there is no way the Fhrer could have survived.
105
106
Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first
checkpoint. A barricade is in place. A GUARD
approaches. Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes.
STAUFFENBERG
We have to get to the airfield at
once. Orders form the Fhrer.
The guard signals his men to remove the barricade.
107

Stauffenberg's car presses on through the woods
toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new
road barriers are in place. This is not good.
One SERGEANT KOLBE and TWO ARMED SOLDIERS step from
the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop.
KOLBE
No one gets in or out.
STAUFFENBERG
We're on orders from the Fhrer. We
have to get to the airfield
immediately. You will step aside.
KOLBE
I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are-
Stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a
beeline for the guardroom. Kolbe races after him.
110
111
A humiliated Kolbe watches Stauffenberg's car speed
away from the open barriers. Free.
112
113
TITLES: 1:15 PM.
Stauffenberg and Haeften climb aboard a waiting
plane. A beat later it is rolling down the runway.
MERTZ (V.O.)
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost.
114
Once again RESERVISTS and CADETS rush to their homes
and scramble to put on their uniforms.
119
119
The siren, the sculpted eagle and swastika, the
pillared stronghold. Tanks and heavy equipment are
once again made ready.
General Hase issues the alert signal just as he did
before, watching the men of the Reserve Army
scramble. In the melee we find Lieutenant Hagen.
HAGEN
Here we go again.
He says this to:
88.
Major Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time
is even more suspicious now.
121
121
A light drizzle. A man jabbering in Italian O.S.
We get our first good look at the demolished briefing
hut. That anyone survived is a miracle. Officers
crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Fhrer himself
heading this procession. He wears new clothes,
nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian
O.S. A slight wince is the only indication that he
was damn near blown to bits just hours ago.
COME AROUND TO REVEAL none other than BENITO
MUSSOLINI speaking an incessant stream of Italian.
HITLER'S P.O.V. Blissful silence. Mussolini's
blathering falls literally on deaf ears.
122
122
TITLES: 3:15 PM.
Three hours have passed since the explosion.
Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane. The
airfield is surprisingly calm. No car to meet them.
STAUFFENBERG
Quiet, isn't it?
Too quiet.
HAEFTEN
I'll see where our driver is.
Haeften walks over to the office. Stauffenberg looks
around the airfield. The silence slowly becomes
unnerving. He goes after Haeften.
123
128
RESERVE SOLDIERS are marched into readiness. Vehicles
moved into place. As they await further orders...
FROMM (V.O.)
Who told you the Fhrer was dead?
129
137
The city center is abuzz with soldiers and military
vehicles as they frantically cordon off the streets.
SOLDIERS come out of various government buildings
with SEVERAL NAZI GENERALS in custody, hands bound.
They push them into waiting trucks.
Meanwhile, PASSING CIVILIANS walk quickly by, trying
to pretend they don't see anything. Years of Nazi
rule have told them to mind their own business.
99.
ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back,
watching the entire scene with cold eyes. Lt. Hagen
emerges from the chaos on the streets.
HAGEN
Major Remer. We've just had orders
from the War Ministry. The
battalion is to blockade the
government quarter and place
Minister Goebbels under arrest.
Remer does not move. He just thinks.
HAGEN (CONT'D)
What is it, Major?
REMER
Something just doesn't feel right
about this. I would hate to find
out I'm being taken advantage of.
HAGEN
(realizing)
A coup you think?
REMER
Of that I am certain. What I can't
say is which side we're on. Get in.
As Hagen does, Remer turns to his DRIVER.
REMER (CONT'D)
Take us to the Reichministry. Be
quick about it.
140
142
Est. Remer arrives, followed by a wave of trucks.
Soldiers deploy, surrounding the building.
102.
143
145
As day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the
government quarters wait for further orders.
Major Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and
focused. He walks over to a truck loaded with RANKING
PRISONERS, turning to the soldiers guarding them.
REMER
(re: prisoners)
Release these men at once.
HAGEN
But these men are part of a coup.
104.
REMER
I've just been on the phone with
Hitler himself. We are the coup,
you idiot. We've been duped.
146
152
Under Remer's direction the Deutschland Guard
Battalion quickly surrounds the War Ministry.
We see a figure moving behind the windows up above...
153
A series of images of the coup being reversed as the
Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by
the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly
rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score
over the silent images of:
Conspirators being rounded up and arrested. Among
them are faces we recognize...
Goerdeler, dragged from a hotel bed by SS OFFICERS as
his informing INNKEEPER watches from the doorway.
TITLES: DR. CARL GOERDELER - TRIED, 7 SEPTEMBER
1944. HANGED, 2 FEBRUARY 1945.
Witzleben is led in handcuffs from his home where he
has been awaiting his fate.
TITLES: ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN - TRIED, 8 AUGUST 1944.
HANGED, 8 AUGUST 1944.
113.
161
161
Military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi-
circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white
light and long black shadows.
Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched
into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as
they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry.
HITLER (V.O.)
I speak to you tonight for two
reasons. First, so that you can
hear my voice and know that I am
unhurt. And second, so that you may
know the details of a crime without
parallel in German history...
Fellgiebel is swarmed by SS in his office at the
Wolf's Lair and summarily beaten.
TITLES: GENERAL ERICH FELLGIEBEL - TRIED, 10 AUGUST
1944. HANGED, 4 SEPTEMBER 1944.
Chief of Police Helldorf is caught by surprise as his
own men burst into his office, rifles raised.
TITLES: CHIEF OF POLICE WOLF-HEINRICH VON HELLDORF -
TRIED, 15 AUGUST 1944. HANGED, 15 AUGUST 1944.
TEN SOLDIERS of the Deutschland Guard Battalion
scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his
conspirators. We can clearly read Fromm's lips,
shouting: "MAKE READY..."
Stauffenberg and Haeften share a reassuring smile.
Remer watches bitterly from the shadows, focusing his
hatred not on the conspirators... but on Fromm.
Berthold, Stauffenberg's brother, is taken from his
flat in Berlin.
114.
TITLES: BERTHOLD VON STAUFFENBERG - TRIED, 10 AUGUST
1944. HANGED, 10 AUGUST 1944.
Fromm smiles to himself, satisfied.
HITLER (V.O.)
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable, stupid officers have
conspired to eliminate me. Except
for a few bruises and burns, I was
completely untouched.
Fromm raises his arm, his lips reading: "TAKE AIM..."
TITLES: GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM - TRIED, 7 MARCH
1945. EXECUTED, 12 MARCH 1945.
Stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly, his
lips reading: "Long live sacred German-"
Fromm drops his hand. Ten rifles open fire.
CRANE UP and away as the music swells, as what is
left of Berlin comes into view, as the few lights
that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow were
passing over the land.
HITLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I see in this the hand of
Providence... directing me to
complete my work.
And the last strains
of music resolve in a single,
sustained note as we
CRANE UP FURTHER, looking at
last to the overcast
darkness of the night sky. The
last note goes on as
if it might play forever...
Until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no
longer hearing music at all, but the urgent wailing
of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers
coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin.
Hitler's gift to Germany.
