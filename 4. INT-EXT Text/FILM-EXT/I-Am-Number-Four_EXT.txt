CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS
A BUNGALOW.
It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been
crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.
The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.
A MONSTROUS HOWL
ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of
A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of
A HULKING BEAST.
It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
the Teen turns to make his escape when
A HAND
wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.
THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises
A SWORD.
Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.
FORM CUT TO:
THE SAME SYMBOL.
It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
ski race with TWO BUDDIES.
TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA.
3.
The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
on the beach.
Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels
THE SYMBOL
searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
across the water.
LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
like a brand.
Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.
BLONDE GIRL
Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
break your ankle?
But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
between his fingers and reels back.
BLONDE GIRL
Oh my God.
He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
his feet and takes off running.
The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
outrunning the hurtling vehicles.
Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.
A STILT HOUSE
sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
on the edge of a coral-white beach.
4.
The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.
DANIEL
Number 3 is dead.
Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
raw. Directly below this fresh wound are
TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.
HENRI
Did anybody else see this?
OFF Daniel's panicked nod...
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
intricate geometric design.
Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.
HENRI
Time to go.
5.
Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS
THE GECKO.
It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,
and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.
CUT TO:
The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge. The dying
sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.
DANIEL (V.O.)
This is the part I hate the most.
The running. But it's the only
thing in my life that's real. The
rest is a lie. My name. My
birthday. Even Henri. People
think he's my father. He's not.
His job is to keep me alive.
Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.
DANIEL (V.O.)
Only nine children escaped the
genocide. We were each given a
number and sent here to hide. I
don't know where the others are. I
only know when one of them is
murdered.
The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.
DANIEL (V.O.)
Because of the spell our Elders
cast, the Mogs can only kill us in
order. That's the reason I've
survived this long. But our enemy
is relentless.
A tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past,
headed to destinations unknown.
The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold. The SUV
barrels along the drive that twists through the woods.
The rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John
lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't
notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.
Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the HALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTY
banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives
away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he
hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find
BERNIE KOSAR.
The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.
JOHN
Bernie, what the hell... were you
hiding in the car?
He scoops the dog into his arms.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, I was about to take a picture
of the little guy.
John turns and finds
SARAH HARTE.
She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
something about her unforced beauty that is instantly
enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.
JOHN
He's not supposed to be here.
(TO BERNIE)
Go home. Now.
Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.
SARAH
He's really well-trained. How long
have you had him?
John turns away.
JOHN
Sorry about your shot.
SARAH
No worries.
He begins walking towards the entrance.
SARAH
You just moved into the house on
Old Mill Road. It's John, right?
15.
John swings back, concerned.
SARAH
Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
My mom said she rented it to a guy
with a son my age. Since I know
every other face on this quad, that
had to be you.
(BEAT)
I'm Sarah.
He nods.
SARAH
Where are you from?
JOHN
Someplace warmer.
SARAH
I don't think that qualifies as an
actual answer.
JOHN
I need to register.
She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.
JOHN
Whoa. What are you doing?
SARAH
Capturing your first day, even
though you're technically six weeks
late.
JOHN
Please don't point that at me.
SARAH
Afraid the camera's going to steal
your soul?
She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed,
he covers the lens with his hand.
JOHN
What's your problem? I said no.
SARAH
It's only for the yearbook.
John regains his composure.
16.
JOHN
I'm not big into having my picture
taken. Sorry.
As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star
quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.
It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The
Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the
middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in.
They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field.
Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle.
COACH
Alright, people. Let's hit the
gym.
The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a
tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers.
18.
Henri is on a ladder, adjusting a hidden surveillance camera
above the front door, when Bernie starts BARKING. It's an
anxious, urgent BARK.
21.
Henri's SUV roars into view, whipping up a tornado of leaves.
CUT TO:
John opens the door and finds Sarah amped.
SARAH
How'd you do it?
Her accusation startles him.
JOHN
Do what?
SARAH
Eviscerate the entire senior class?
She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.
SARAH
I was in the darkroom before lunch
and they were hanging on the line
smiling and looking forward to the
future. When I got back, I found
15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
John shrugs innocently.
JOHN
I don't know what you're talking
about.
SARAH
So you weren't in the darkroom
today?
JOHN
No.
SARAH
Here's a tip. If you're going to
lie, don't leave a big red backpack
at the scene of the crime.
She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to
quell the feeling welling in his chest.
27.
JOHN
I don't know what happened. Maybe
it's a sign that you should invest
in a digital camera.
SARAH
Digital sucks. Film tells the
truth. Clearly, I'm not going to
get that from you.
He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs
into her car. John glances at his palms and is surprised to
find they are dimly luminescent.
Sarah's car sweeps out of the drive and powers towards town,
unaware of the truck parked in the shadows.
MARK JAYNE
is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into
the night. OFF his simmering jealousy...
EPIC AERIAL SHOT LOOKING DOWN AT AN EAGLE as it soars above
the rich kaleidoscope of trees. It almost seems to be
following John, who is powering along a narrow track below.
CUT TO:
John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a blurring wake of
leaves. His foot splits a log as he bounds over it.
CUT TO:
John charges towards a secluded stream. It's 30 feet wide.
He doesn't slow, leaps off the bank and effortlessly
hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side.
CUT TO:
It offers a high-def view of Paradise. John reaches the top
and is exhilarated by the sense of temporary liberation. He
WATCHES AS
THE EAGLE
alights in a nearby oak tree. John bends to tighten his
laces, his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his
ankle. His happiness dims.
29.
He grits his teeth and takes off for home. As he passes the
oak, the CAMERA TRACKS TO REVEAL the gecko scampering down
the gnarled trunk.
CUT TO:
Sarah sits in the stands, doing homework, watching Mark and
the football team practice in the cold metallic floodlight.
ON THE FIELD the ball is hiked to Mark. He looks for an
opening and fires a perfect spiral to the RECEIVER in the end
zone. Mark thumps chests with Kevin and looks up at the
stands, only to discover that Sarah is gone.
CUT TO:
John's playing supercatch with Bernie. He watches as the
little guy races back from the woods, clutching a ball.
Panting with exertion, the dog lays it at John's feet. John
smiles, swings back his arm and hauls the ball again.
ANGLE ON BALL: It arcs up, sails right over the garage and
drops earthwards in the heart of the woods.
Unperturbed by the superhuman throw, Bernie hightails after
the ball. Henri steps out and watches, amused, then tosses
John a pair of black driving gloves. OFF John's eye roll...
CUT TO:
The sky is even pinker than the house.
The Teen Girl strides down the steps and crosses to a sleek
Ducatti. She slips on a helmet. PUSH IN on her Arctic-blue
eyes as they focus on the house with a strange intensity.
34.
KABBBOOOOOOM!
The house detonates. The concussive force of the blast rips
the structure right off its stilts. Tornadoes of flame BLAST
through the windows as the house catapults into the air.
Orange reflections flicker on the Girl's visor as she flips
it down, REVS the motorcycle and SCREAM-PEELS down the drive
backlit by the glittering inferno...
CUT TO:
The football stadium rises like a monolith in the background.
John strides towards the tree line, headed home.
SARAH (O.S.)
John.
He turns in surprise as Sarah approaches.
SARAH
I heard about the lockers. I'm
sorry.
JOHN
I'll live.
He starts off again.
SARAH
I broke up with Mark.
He stops, slowly turns back.
SARAH
I've been thinking about doing it
for a while... today just finally
pushed me over the edge.
37.
He studies her face.
JOHN
Why are you telling me?
She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed.
SARAH
I don't know.
JOHN
You made the right call.
The certainty of his voice soothes her. She looks up and
holds his gaze. Their attraction is undeniable.
SARAH
Halloween Block Party's tonight.
JOHN
I saw the banners.
SARAH
I'll be on Main Street hiding
behind my camera if you want to
swing by.
He says nothing.
SARAH
I wasn't expecting an actual
response. I could text you later.
Do they have cell phones on Planet
John?
She holds out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then
takes it. As he inputs his number, he hears the BLARE of a
car horn, looks up and sees Henri waiting in his SUV.
EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD
MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous
bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke.
The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather.
Young John glances up and sees
AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS
eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft
are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash
an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES.
GRANDFATHER
(in Loric with subtitles)
Keep moving.
It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John
and his grandfather race up the steps.
Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.
A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
haze and catches a impressionistic view as
TWO PIKEN
leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...
YOUNG JOHN
Nooooooooooo!
THE MEMORY ENDS and we...
MATCH CUT TO:
A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
woods and crosses to his side.
JOHN
I saw my grandfather. I saw what
you did to the Mogadorians -- you
saved my life.
HENRI
A lot of Lorics sacrificed their
lives so that you could live.
42.
John is still trying to process the memory.
JOHN
He said I must survive.
HENRI
The Elders had a plan. You weren't
on that ship by chance. The nine
of you were chosen for a reason.
Even if only two of you live,
together you'll pose a grave threat
to our enemy.
Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.
JOHN
You saw what they did to Lorien.
How can nine or six or two of us
take on that army? It's hopeless.
Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.
HENRI
I never thought we'd get off Lorien
alive -- but we did. I didn't know
how we could survive on a strange
planet -- but we have. I gave us
six months before the Mogs found us
-- it's been 10 years. Don't give
up now.
Henri grips John's shoulders.
HENRI
You have the potential to do great
things. Even if you don't see it --
I do.
JOHN
How can you put so much faith in
me?
HENRI
Because your life is my life. If
you quit, then everything I've
worked for and sacrificed is
meaningless.
(BEAT)
Remember -- nothing is inevitable.
The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS.
He scans a text.
43.
JOHN
It's Sarah. The Block Party's
tonight. I'll say I can't make it.
Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.
HENRI
No... go.
John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.
HENRI
You've had enough for one day.
CUT TO:
A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the
sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS
in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at
its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand.
A SLAP ON GLASS.
John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the
mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store.
John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the
road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton
candy. John subtly scans the crowd.
SAM
She's over there.
John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,
sees John and smiles as he approaches.
SARAH
You made it.
(re: Sam's shirt)
Like the T-shirt, Sam.
SAM
Guidance Counsellor said I need to
set goals for myself. Figured I'd
aim high.
She looks back at John.
SARAH
What do you think of Halloween in
Paradise?
John regards a particularly over-the-top float.
JOHN
They should pull out all the stops
next year.
SARAH
Well, you haven't had the full
experience until you've been on the
Haunted Hayride.
45.
She motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to
get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through
the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods.
SARAH
Give me a sec.
She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
her camera. Sam whispers to John.
SAM
I'm impressed.
Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.
SARAH
You guys ready?
SAM
Three on a wagon might get a little
crowded. I'll meet you two on the
other side.
He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.
SARAH
Sam's cool.
JOHN
Definitely unique.
SARAH
I haven't really talked to him
since 8th grade. Mark had a tight
circle. If you weren't a jock or
cheerleader, you didn't exist.
JOHN
I'm glad you broke free.
SARAH
Me too.
OFF their growing connection...
CUT TO:
The path is lined with human heads piked to wooden stakes.
SCREAMS, WAILS and GHOULISH HOWLS boom from hidden speakers.
46.
OMINOUS POV: WATCHES from the trees as a wagon with John and
Sarah RATTLES into view. It's driven by the GRIM REAPER.
FIVE GIANT RUBBER SPIDERS
drop from the trees. Sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle
over their heads on wires. She rubs her hair, flustered,
looks over at John, who is coolly amused by the cheap scares.
SARAH
Not even a flinch. None of this
scares you, does it?
JOHN
I'm trembling on the inside.
He smiles.
SARAH
You can smile. I was starting to
have my doubts.
She takes his hand. They CLATTER past a series of grisly
TABLEAUX:
A TEEN jerks and SCREAMS in mock agony as he is fried in an
antiquated electric chair.
A BLOOD-SPLATTERED DOCTOR CACKLES as he hacksaws the legs off
a CHEERLEADER chained to a gurney.
A squad of blood-hungry VAMPIRIC FOOTBALL PLAYERS attacks a
rival team of WEREWOLVES.
Ghosts float in the branches as the wagon LURCHES to a stop.
GRIM REAPER
Hell's Gate, everybody off.
The duo reluctantly clambers off the back and watches as the
hay wagon circles back the way it came.
SARAH
Once we make it through, we're home
free.
A SKELETON
pendulums in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS and clenches
John's hand harder. A pathway of lights floods on,
illuminating a skull-capped gate. The words
YOUR NUMBER'S UP!
47.
are scrawled across it in fake blood.
John and Sarah step through the gate and enter a natural
tunnel of dense, overhanging branches. A fog machine gently
COUGHS, and spiderwebs stretch across the sides.
They are about 20 feet into the tunnel when the lights go
out. Somewhere a CHAINSAW sputters to life. White strobe
lights suddenly flare on and
TWO CHAINSAW-WIELDING ZOMBIES
burst through the gates behind them. The teens take off.
It's like a flickering scene from a demented silent movie.
The Zombies have almost caught up when the strobe abruptly
ends. The SOUND of the chainsaws FADES and John and Sarah
stop, panting and LAUGHING with relief.
SARAH
That was insane.
IT'S PITCH BLACK.
A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the darkness. Something
brushes past John's leg. He spins, suddenly unsure.
JOHN
What was that?
SARAH
Just part of the ride.
He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle
of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all sides.
JOHN
Are you sure?
As he steps forward,
A THICK BRANCH
cuts through the dark and viciously SMACKS John on the back.
He drops to the ground like a sack. Figures emerge from the
shadows and he hears a DESPERATE STRUGGLE behind him.
SARAH
Let go! Stop it!
John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs.
Another strikes the side of his face. He is surrounded. His
attackers are brutal and unrelenting. Over the LOOPING
SOUNDTRACK OF B-MOVIE NOISES, Sarah's muffled SCREAMS DIM.
48.
JOHN
Sarah! Sa-
His voice is cut off as a fist SMASHES into his jaw and the
steel cap of a combat boot SLAMS his groin. John staggers up
but is viciously kicked back to the ground.
PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a
blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by
their coats and hammers their skulls together. As they drop,
John spins to meet his other two foes with
BLINDING PALMS OF LIGHT.
The assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare.
They're not Mogadorians but rather
FOOTBALL JOCKS.
One is Mark Jayne's buddy Kevin. They're wearing zombie
makeup and military fatigues and have night-vision goggles
strapped to their faces.
John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched.
NIGHT-VISION POV: Everything is an overexposed blur until --
WHAAAAM!!!
John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the
chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree. Kevin
slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
the darkness.
SARAH IS GONE.
He plucks up the Jocks' fallen goggles and heads off with
Terminator-like determination.
Sarah is carried through the woods by TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS in
camouflage fatigues and night-vision goggles. She SCREAMS.
SARAH
Let go of me!
She futilely tries to wrestle free.
Sam is waiting by the exit to the hayride when he hears --
49.
SARAH (O.S.)
(in the woods)
Help! Somebody!
Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam.
SAM
Sarah?
She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into
the woods.
A rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall
which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks
carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's
wild-cat angry when she sees him.
SARAH
Are you crazy! Where's John?
Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.
MARK
Relax. It's a practical joke.
SARAH
I swear if you hurt him --
MARK
Why do you give a shit?
SARAH
Get out of my face, Mark, you're
pathetic.
MARK
I'm the best thing that ever
happened to you and I'm giving you
one more chance.
Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.
MARK
Don't walk away from me!
Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by
concern. He steps towards her to help when --
JOHN (O.S.)
Back off!
Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above
John's right eye.
SARAH
John! Are you okay?
He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.
MARK
Where the hell are Kevin and Joe?
John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.
51.
JOHN
They got spooked.
MARK
Hey, those are police property!
John flings them over Mark's head into the water.
MARK
I'm going to kill you!
With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's
arm up behind his back.
SARAH
John! Stop!
Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.
SARAH
That's his throwing arm!
But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
him across the face. Startled, John lets go.
SARAH
Football's all he's got.
John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah
offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John.
John charges into view.
SARAH
John! Wait.
Sarah catches up.
SARAH
I'm sorry, I didn't want you to
break his arm.
JOHN
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at
myself.
She stops, faces him.
52.
SARAH
I had no idea Mark would pull
something like that. He has
seriously gone off the deep end.
JOHN
The guy's in love with you. Wants
you back.
SARAH
That's not love.
Their eyes meet in the moonlight.
SARAH
Walk me home?
CUT TO:
It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses
are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb-
festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the
prettiest house on the block.
SARAH
This is me.
John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.
SARAH
I know. Wait until the Christmas
decorations go up. My mom decks
the halls with so many lights, you
can see our house from space.
Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
above his eye, concerned.
SARAH
You should see a doctor.
JOHN
For this? Wouldn't waste their
time.
She looks at him, curious.
SARAH
You're not going to tell me how you
took out those football players,
are you?
53.
He says nothing. She smiles.
SARAH
I really don't get you.
She steps closer.
SARAH
But I feel like I can trust you.
JOHN
You can.
The air is charged.
SARAH
Good night.
Sarah swings open the white picket gate.
JOHN
Wait.
As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,
THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS
rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.
THE PUMPKINS
instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.
JOHN
I better go.
OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour...
CUT TO:
John cautiously approaches. It's a 50s ranch style. The
garage adjoins the house. The lights are out. RAIN bullets
off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open.
TIGHT ON A WELDING TORCH as it's sparked to life.
Its flame HISSES as Henri sweeps it towards John, who is
standing shirtless. Bernie watches, curious, as Henri washes
the flame harmlessly up John's naked arm and torso.
60.
Bernie darts ahead as John and Sarah walk through a crimson
cascade of falling leaves. As they kiss, the leaves around
them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards.
Bernie pogos on his back legs, trying to bite the tennis ball
that John telekinetically hovers just out of the dog's reach.
John is fully submerged in an old claw-foot tub.
GO TO JOHN'S DISTORTED VIEW LOOKING UP at Henri as he drops a
match into the tub. The liquid instantly IGNITES and we
realize John's lying in gasoline. He sits up, rests his
hands behind his head as the FLAMES harmlessly lick his face.
The Halloween decorations have been replaced by a
Thanksgiving display.
Wearing khakis and a pale blue Oxford, John tentatively walks
up the front path. The warm sound of LAUGHTER drifts from
inside. He takes a breath and rings the doorbell.
John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the
phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered.
JOHN
(INTO PHONE)
Henri?
CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials.
This time it's picked up immediately.
JOHN
(INTO PHONE)
Henri?
MAN (V.O.)
(OVER PHONE)
Are you one of them too?
John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone.
JOHN
(INTO PHONE)
Who are you? Where's Henri?
CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it,
panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea
and punches another number.
JOHN
(INTO PHONE)
I need your help.
Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup
truck. It's the one from Sam's garage.
67.
SARAH
John!
He looks back.
JOHN
It's Henri. I have to go. Sorry.
OFF her confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away...
It's a dilapidated Victorian. Mist shrouds the yard which is
littered with junked cars and trash. The pickup crawls to a
stop in the shadows across the street.
It's graveyard quiet. John nervously sneaks down the side of
the house. His breath fogs as he inch-CREAKS up the wooden
STEPS TO
THE KITCHEN PORCH.
69.
He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent
palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior.
WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The
sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a
semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.
SAM (O.S.)
See anything?
Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.
JOHN
I told you to go!
SAM
They might know where my dad is!
John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar
CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.
It's lying on the counter by the fridge.
JOHN
Henri's here.
John turns off his palm and reaches for the door handle.
Sam anxiously swats his arm away.
SAM
Wait! Other than strength, speed
and night-light, what powers have
you got?
JOHN
Telekinesis -- but that's a work in
progress.
SAM
No invisibility, X-ray vision,
flight?
JOHN
Sam, we drove here.
Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up.
SAM
Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.
But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light
suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a
wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.
70.
John and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door.
He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs.
CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into
SAM'S LAP.
He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He
frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John
clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette
between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner,
John releases his hand.
The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the
lock and concentrates.
SAM
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
There's a LOUD CLICK.
SAM
You just dead bolted it! Way to
go!
JOHN
New plan -- follow Lucky Strike.
Text me if he comes back.
Sam sneaks off after Frank.
Vermillion clouds streak the heavens. Sam's truck pulls up
next to Henri's SUV, which is inconspicuously parked in front
of a 24-hour pharmacy.
It's a rundown dump on the bleak edge of a no-name town.
REPORTERS and LOOKIE-LOOS watch from behind the crime scene
tape that crisscrosses the street. CAMERA ZEROES IN on
THE TEEN GIRL.
She's the one we saw in Nashville and who torched the stilt
house. Her eyes study the STREAM OF POLICE that hustles in
and out of the house carrying evidence Baggies and equipment.
79.
Sam climbs out of the truck and is startled by Sarah.
80.
SARAH
Where is he, Sam?
SAM
I don't know.
He tries to avoid eye contact, but she is determined.
SARAH
What happened last night? I've
tried calling him all day. But his
number's no longer in service.
SAM
Forget about him, Sarah.
Incredulous, she grabs his arm.
SARAH
I'm not going anywhere until you
tell me what's going on.
SAM
He left with Henri and he isn't
coming back. Ever.
(PULLING FREE)
I'm sorry.
OFF Sarah, shattered...
CUT TO:
The GROUP OF BIKERS by the pool has grown four fold. They're
partying hard. Henri keeps his head down as he passes.
The sky is twilight blue. A gleaming Harley ROARS around the
bend, going full throttle. John is on its back. The wind
whips his hair. Eyes set forward. Headed back to Paradise.
CUT TO:
Annie opens the front door and is surprised to find John.
ANNIE
Little late for dessert.
JOHN
I need to talk to Sarah.
ANNIE
She's not here. Some friends
dragged her to a party at Mark
Jayne's.
John absorbs this news, turns. Annie steps out after him.
ANNIE
I don't usually pry into my
daughter's love life, I certainly
didn't want my mother in mine --
but Sarah's my youngest and she's
special to me.
JOHN
She's special to me too.
CUT TO:
82.
The big, two-story property dominates the end of a cul-de-
sac. TEENS stream up the drive. Cars are parked end to end
down the street. CAMERA CRANES TO MEET John as he charges
into view on the stolen motorcycle.
John strides down the driveway, bleak-faced. He's about to
straddle the motorcycle when he hears a muffled EXPLOSION.
He looks back and sees
SMOKE
billowing from the side of the house. He bolts towards the
front door, SCREAMS at a JOCK as he passes.
JOHN
Call 911!
As he races inside...
The panicked evacuation spills out. A window EXPLODES and
orange flames lick the cold night air. John sees Emily
stumble out clutching one of Mark's dogs, Abby.
JOHN
Where's Sarah?
EMILY
Went back for Dozer.
Another EXPLOSION rocks. A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER.
John looks back at the house. The fire has taken hold with
incredible speed. The living room curtains are ABLAZE.
A DOG'S HAUNTING HOWL
85.
cuts over the sound of the HISSING FLAMES. It's coming from
the second floor. John charges past Mark, towards the house.
MARK
It's too late. You can't get
through!
John ignores him and runs into the inferno.
The second-floor window SHATTERS as John leaps out holding
Sarah and Dozer. A ROARING tongue of fire whips his back as
he drops to the ground and touches down with Sarah and Dozer.
COUGHING and shell-shocked, Sarah puts the dog down.
JOHN
You okay?
She stares at him, unsure.
SARAH
You walked through that fire
without getting burned. I saw you
stop that beam.
SIRENS wail in the distance.
JOHN
I'll explain everything... but not
here...
(offering his hand)
Sarah... please?
As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then
REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY
BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house.
REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on
his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the
house and finds Mark.
87.
RED-HAIRED TEEN
(RE: VIDEO)
Check this out, man!
PUSH IN as Mark stares at the footage, stunned.
CUT TO:
The spinning lights of a trio of fire trucks FLARE THE LENS.
CREWS hose down the last smoking embers. A DEPUTY approaches
Mark, who is standing by a police cruiser.
DEPUTY
The FBI showed up flashing their
badges. Wanna talk to you.
As he points to a black SUV that's parked down the street.
Sam steps out and reacts in surprise as Henri emerges through
the headlight glare.
HENRI
John's not at the house. Is he
here?
SAM
No, but he's all over the internet.
HENRI
I know.
He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows.
SAM
Those things from Warsaw -- they're
coming, aren't they?
HENRI
Go back inside. This isn't your
fight.
SAM
The hell it isn't. I'm coming with
you.
OFF this declaration...
CUT TO:
The Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as
a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a
tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo.
MARK
What the hell's in there?
He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the
trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech
machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers.
He backs away in fearful realization.
MARK
You guys aren't FBI.
Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck
and constrains him. The Commander pulls
TWO BANDOLIERS
over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal
and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his
trademark red coat and spins towards the school.
Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they
reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when
John and Henri burst out of the tunnel.
JOHN
Don't stop! Get to the woods!
She nods and exits with the others.
John and Henri head onto the field after them when
THE SECOND PIKEN
leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
him. At the last second,
HENRI
nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
as Henri lands in a heap.
JOHN
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost
seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
John's face hardens into a mask of rage.
101.
He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it
springboards into the air...
ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
bases and fly skyward.
ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.
The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger
from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch.
John sinks by Henri's side.
JOHN
Henri.
Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
drag him to his feet.
JOHN
Come on, taillights in five.
HENRI
I won't be coming with you this
time. Save yourself.
JOHN
We go together!
Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment
THE COMMANDER'S SWORD
flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's.
HENRI
Find the others.
His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.
102.
HENRI
Your life is my life... always.
His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face
THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
uselessly as he's lifted face to face.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
Number 4.
Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
mocking trophies.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
Your Cepan saved you on Lorien.
The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
But this moment was inevitable.
The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is
the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the
moment when a warrior is born.
ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
flutter to the ground like glittering confetti.
John stares at the alien with calm confidence.
JOHN
Nothing is inevitable.
ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES.
The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene
torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers.
TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over.
The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.
IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION!
103.
John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the
SUPERNOVA OF FIRE
that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.
Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the
night sky. Her breath catches in her throat.
SARAH
Oh my God... John.
Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
for the stadium.
It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated
field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet
of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians.
SARAH
John!
She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes
completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her
mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.
SARAH
John!
Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.
CUT TO:
The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is
dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces.
SARAH
Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't
cover extraterrestrial dagger
wounds.
Six smiles, grateful.
SIX
Thanks.
104.
As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.
MARK
The Sheriff's Department is
starting to put up roadblocks. You
guys better get moving.
Six and Sarah join them.
JOHN
You good to go?
SIX
Don't worry about me.
John nods to Sam.
JOHN
Sam, ride with Six.
SIX
We don't need baggage.
Sam steps in front of her, determined.
SAM
I have to find out if the Mogs took
my dad.
Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.
SIX
You slow us down, I'll shoot you
myself.
Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.
SARAH
I want to come too.
JOHN
You need to stay here.
SARAH
Why?
JOHN
You could have died last night.
I'm not putting you in danger
again. Mark's promised to look
after you.
105.
Tears tumble down her cheeks.
SARAH
I don't want to say goodbye.
JOHN
I'll come back for you.
SARAH
When?
JOHN
When it's safe.
She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.
JOHN
Where I'm from, we only give our
heart to one person. I've given
mine to you.
(BEAT)
I love you, Sarah.
Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as
BERNIE KOSAR
limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...
CUT TO:
Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.
JOHN (V.O.)
This is the first town I've left
without Henri. The first one I
have a reason to come back to.
John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
brand the image of their faces onto their memories.
The bikes blur past the Welcome to Paradise sign.
106.
JOHN (V.O.)
He warned me the pain would be
unbearable if I left her. He was
right.
A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.
JOHN (V.O.)
But I don't regret it. The pain
reminds me what's at stake.
A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.
JOHN (V.O.)
We must find the others and face
our enemy together. I'm not sure
how we can stop them. But nothing
is inevitable. I know that now.
Thunderheads darken the horizon.
JOHN (V.O.)
I am Number 4.
His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
unmapped and uncharted. Ready.
FADE OUT.
