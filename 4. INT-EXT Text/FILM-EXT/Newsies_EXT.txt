Oscar and Morris glare at the crowd, daring anyone to do
anything about it. Jack calmly walks Snipe back to his

him down. The air is electric. Nearby --

The brothers glower, look at each other, then back at

on the counter and grins at the rodent-faced man inside

turns and scans.
Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks.
Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel
with a fifty-cent piece.

Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his

grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop.

David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his

already being the mentor --
JACK
The name of the game is volume, Dave.
You only took twenty papes -- why?
DAVID
Bad headline...?
JACK
First t'ing you gotta learn --
headlines don't sell papes, newsies

him across the plank.
JACK
No?

I think they're chasing you!
Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David,

Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit --

JACK
How'd your pop get hurt?
DAVID
The factory. An accident.
(bitterly)
He's no good to them anymore so
they just fired him. He's got no
union to protect him.
Inside, Esther is singing a lullaby to Les; Mayer calls
out to David.
MAYER
David?
Time to come in now.
Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby,
Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his
friend's expression.
DAVID
Why don't you stay here tonight...?
JACK
I got my own place... but thanks.

Maybe the kid'll soften him up a

Shouting encouragement, the Newsies clear a path as Jack
and Les march up to the big doors. Jack pounds on them

a handsome, well-dressed man in his thirties, BRYAN DENTON.

On a rotted and collapsing pier is a battered sign:
"BROOKLYN EXCURSIONS - CLOSED." Hunched under the pier
is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes fixed on --
-- Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through
the no-man's land of mud and junk. Boys appear like
hostile Indians -- behind them, to the side of them, in
front of them -- silently escorting them under the pier.
David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the
harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly.
From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome.
He looks them up and down, then grins. He is SPOT
CONLON.
SPOT
If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack
be quick.
Jack meets his challenging grin with one of his own.
JACK
You're movin' up in the world,

Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."
David's getting more
nervous.

So I'm hearin' things from little

Uh... we started the strike but...
we can't do it alone, so... we've

David looks nervously at the circling henchmen.
DAVID
That... they're all waiting to see
what Spot Conlon does. That you're
the key...

himself up; David
sees an opening)
That Spot Conlon is the most
respected and... famous... newsie
in New York... and probably
everywhere else...
Spot signals the henchmen to stop circling; waits for
more, lapping it up.
DAVID
And... if Spot Conlon joins the
strike, they'll join and we'll be
unstoppable so you gotta join and

chicken for that beak of yours.

Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack
disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk
and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into
the room. Utter silence --
-- except for Snyder's FOOTSTEPS as he walks slowly down
the aisle between the bunks. He stops at the window, his
back to it. Crutchy sneaks open his eyes to see --
-- Jack, behind Snyder, swinging past the window, arms
stretched in a balletic arabesque --
-- Crutchy struggles not to laugh; Tenpin and some others
see what's going on. They all fight laughter as --
-- Jack swings back and forth behind Snyder, striking
difference poses as he passes the window: the breast
stroke, running on air, a bird with flapping wings...
-- From the roof, David looks down in disbelief: then
smiles -- nothing Jack does would surprise him any more.
-- Snyder glares suspiciously at the boys, sensing
something is going on. Behind him, Jack floats past
as an angel -- Snyder wheels around, looks --
-- but the window is empty. Puzzled, he walks out
of the room. The instant he's gone, the boys explode
in stifled laughter. We MOVE IN ON Crutchy as he

Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy

the powers-that-be, for they know
our city thrives on the shame of
child labor. Therefore, Jack

JACK
The minute I show my face, I'm

DENTON
You'd have help this time. I've
been investigating the Refuge -- I
know somebody who's going to be
very interested in Snyder's little
racket.
DAVID
(wryly)
What happened to the ace war
correspondent?
DENTON
This war'll do for now.
SARAH
Whatever happens, it's Jack's
decision. He's the one in danger.
They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought.
LES
Jack...?
You thinkin'...?
JACK
Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie
Square full of kids...
DAVID
(picks it up)
... Another rally, right under
Pulitzer's nose, and not just the
Newsies --
JACK
-- Every workin' kid from every
sweatshop in New York. We gotta
get the word out -- let's go get
the Newsies --

How're you gonna reach all these

print anything about the strike.
JACK
We're Newsies, ain't we?
So we
make our own paper.
DAVID
Be quiet and let me think.
JACK
Whattaya need to start a paper?
Writers, right? So we got Denton.
What else?
LES
Advertisements!
(as they look at him)
Cartoons?
DENTON
(the cold facts)
A printing press. And no paper or
printer is going to defy Pulitzer.
The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again.
JACK
Les. Go set me straight with the
Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet
us later at the World Building.
Les races off on his mission; the others look question-
ingly at Jack.
JACK
So happens I know a guy with a
printing press.

He points frantically at Weasel crossing the square
towards them. They duck quickly -- and he weaves past
whistling tunelessly, drunk. As Kloppman eases the
wagon away, everybody looks back, shouts --
EVERYBODY
Hey, Weasel... Good ni-ight!
He looks around blearily:

HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF THE NEWSIE NEWS (OPTICAL)

swirl and cascade, FILLING the SCREEN as we see
SUPERIMPOSED a series of living portraits of the
working children of the 1890s... young boys in too-
large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails...
holding picks and shovels far too large for them...
girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing...
shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning
to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that
the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the
SCREEN: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY!
We see that same headline across --

Our Newsies look anxiously around the square, empty
except for them. They take pains to conceal Jack among
them.

Jack looks glumly at the empty square; at the gates of
the World where Weasel and his goons are beginning to
line up, clubs in hand.

The huge doors of the World Building open and Seitz

The Newsies love it. Seitz stiffles a smile at Jack's
bravado -- a smile of admiration.
SEITZ
Then I guess you talk.
Jack beckons David to follow as they enter the huge
doors and --

Race, Boots, Les, etc. unpacking rotten fruit, getting
ready for action. They see several police moving into
the square -- including a paddy wagon.

Behind Weasel and the line of goons Jack and David are

Les quickly slips through the bars, running to tell Jack
-- but Weasel grabs him, shoves him back roughly --
LES
Jack -- !
Jack -- !
Weasel, surprised, sees Jack behind him.
WEASEL
I don't know how he got in here,
Mr. Seitz -- but I'll take care of
him, with pleasure. Just say the
word!
SEITZ
With pleasure. You're fired.
WEASEL
Come again...?
A tomato hits him in the face; he turns to see Les wiping
tomato juice off his hands.
LES
He said, you're fired.
Triumphant, Jack hoists Les over his shoulders:
JACK

A huge roar goes up outside the gates -- they swing open
and the Newsies swarm in, engulfing Weasel and the
Delanceys -- trying to look like part of the gang -- as
they rush to mob Jack and David. Jack spots Sarah --
she's waving and pointing in alarm at something.
LES
(remembers)
The bulls! Jack -- the bulls!
Jack sees several police shoving through the crowd toward
him. He quickly deposits Les -- turns to run and sees --
-- Snyder right in front of him, hands behind his back.
Jack spins away and right into the arms of --
MacSWAIN
Easy, lad! You don't have to run
anymore -- not from the likes of
him anyway!
Jack looks again and sees Snyder's hands are handcuffed
behind him; two cops have him in custody. Denton is
there, smiling.
DENTON
We brought the Warden over to say
goodbye. Goodbye, Warden.
Jack watches, amazed, uncomprehending,
as the cops move
Snyder to the paddy wagon. As the rear
doors are opened,
several boys pile out -- former inmates
of the Refuge,
including Tenpin. As Snyder is loaded
in, the last boy
is coming out, crutch first --
CRUTCHY
(to Snyder)
Remember what I told ya -- first
t'ing ya do in jail, you make
friends with the rats, share what
you got in common --

Hiya, Jack! My leg tells me the

Ya orta seen it, Jack -- he came

his walkin' stick like a sword and
he's leadin' this army of lawyers
and cops and Snyder's hidin' in
the patata bin --
JACK
What're you talkin' about -- who
come chargin' in?
CRUTCHY
Who?
Your pal! Him!
He points O.S. -- Jack turns to see --
ELEGANT COACH
parked across the square. A Rough Rider opens the door
and a man leans forward -- a glimpse of silk hat and
walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking
stick in salute to Jack across the square.
BACK TO SCENE
Jack is awestruck; so are the other Newsies gathering
around. Denton moves up to Jack.
DENTON
Governor Roosevelt's very grateful
that this problem was brought to
his attention. He'd like to offer
you a lift, anywhere you like.
This time, you ride inside.
Jack looks at the coach, torn. Boots holds the bundle of
belongings he gave him earlier. Suddenly Jack decides,
snaps his fingers, Boots tosses him the bundle.
JACK
Think he could drop me at the
train yards?
Denton moves off toward the coach. David, Sarah, Les
look stunned, dismayed -- Jack avoids their eyes. Behind
them, the BELL RINGS, the circulation window opens for
business -- a crowd of Newsies races to line up. The
gang looks at them hungrily, eager to return the work.
They look at Jack.

He shakes; the others crowd around. David looks on, left
out for the moment; Sarah and Les beside him.

bulls, for one t'ing -- not cops,
neither, but big ugly animals with
horns and --

Crutchy hobbles off to the dock. Jack looks off at the
waiting coach, then holds out his hand to Les, who runs
up and clings to him.

DAVID
We won today, but the fight's not
over. You're needed, Jack. We

He stands, looking at them.
JACK
Maybe that's what scares me...
Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns,
runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards
the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him,
holds him, as he and Sarah watch --
-- Jack climbing into the coach, greeted by Teddy.
The
door closes, the coach trots away. "SANTA FE" is
underscored.
As the coach moves off, the Newsies move up, waving their
caps goodbye. David and Sarah watch, feeling a great
loss; Les is crushed. The Newsies move into the court-
yard, trying to keep their spirits up as:
