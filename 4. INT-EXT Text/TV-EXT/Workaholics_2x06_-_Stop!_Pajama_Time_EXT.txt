      The sun shines as ADAM, who s wearing his  Top Gun  hat, 
      takes a pull from a gravity bong made out of an Arrowhead-
      style water jug.  ANDERS, who s grilling and wearing a  Kiss 
      the Ders  apron, throws a paper airplane into traffic below. 

                                  ANDERS
                    So this is breaking the law?  Cool.

                                  ADAM
                          (holding smoke in lungs)
                    Fuck the po-lice.

      Anders turns to the GRILL and flips a few burgers.      

                                  ANDERS
                    Makes you kinda wish Alice was sick 
                    every day.   

                                  ADAM
                    Yo yeah and that she always put 
                    Jillian in charge too as well... 
                    also.  

      This hits a nerve with Anders.  He sets his spatula down.   

                                  ANDERS
                    She s not  in charge,  she s just 
                    an emergency liaison.  I m the one 
                    that should be liaising.

      Ders angrily hucks a paper airplane off the balcony. 

                                  ADAM
                    Where s Blake with the fixins?


      Blake is unloading supplies as the guys continue to hang.

                                  BLAKE
                    Raided everyone s lunches for 
                    toppings.
                          (handful of gummies from 
                            sack)
                    Looks like Waymond is on a strict 
                    Gummy Octopus diet.  Cool guy.

      WHAP!  The BLAKE DECOY (which is a female Real Doll wearing 
      the same clothes as Blake) hits the window.  All the guys 
      react, caught.  Jillian pops out from behind it.  

                                    JILLIAN

                    First of all, Sigourney Beaver is 
                    not a dummy--

                    No, she s a sex doll.

                    A used sex doll.

                    I didn t know that when I bid on 
                      Sigourney.  The guy on eBay said it 
                    was a prop from Alien: 
                      Resurrection.  We ve been over 
                    this, Anders.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Now does everyone make love to her 
                    or...?

                                  BLAKE/ANDERS
                    Ewwww, no.  Gross!!!

      Adam just looks off, guilty.

                                  ANDERS
                    I thought we agreed you were going 
                    to throw it away.  It s breeding 
                    ground for bacteria.

                                  BLAKE
                    I washed her.  OK, Anders?

                    This is fun.  You know what else is

                    calls?  Let s go make some and find

                    I hate telling people what to do.  
                    It makes me anxious and I start 
                    sweating and getting all body

                          (showing her sweaty pits)
                    Is it bad?  No, don t tell me.

                    See that you do.

      They all start to push her back into the office.

                    She s good. / Really coming into

      Anders resumes making paper airplanes.

                    Watch this.  I call it...  The

      Adam grabs someone s burger and throws it into traffic.  
      Suddenly from OS they hear TIRES SQUEALING.

      ALICE steps out of her car, pissed, sick, and NOT in a power 
      suit.  She s wearing a sloppy Juicy style sweat suit and 
      looks like HELL.  She slams the door and turns to find all 
      her co-workers in their onesies, lined up like the dance 
      number at the end of Slumdog Millionaire.  Waymond presses 
      play on the boom box (or phone) and they begin the routine.

                    It was originally supposed to be 
                    your get well video, but then you 
                    had to-- OK here is where I was 
                    gonna snap zoom in and do the 
                     Black or White  Michael Jackson 
                    morphing thing.  Is it good?  I

                                  ANDERS
                    I uh, I was taking initiative.  The 
                    get-well video is cross-promoting 
                    the onesies and I though it would

                    It s the onesie.  It s just giving

                    So instead of putting together  
                    this gay shit you could have told

      They look up.

                    Which is about to end because you 
                    fired me, Alice.  Hear me world, 
                    these are my last words,  No matter 
                    what happens in your lives...

                    And I m out.   Write that down.  
                    And I m killing myself now.  Take 
                    it sleazy.

      Adam backs away, leaving the crowd confused.

                                  ALICE
                    What does any of that even mean?

      Then Adam jumps off the roof and Alice flinches for a second 
      before she realizes it s not Adam.  It s Sigourney Beaver!  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          Workaholics - Firing Squad - Network Draft - 12/13/10        23.

      CONTINUED: (3)

      She s dressed in the same onesie as Adam with a Xerox of 
      Adam s face taped around the head (with a word-bubble that 
      says,  Take it sleazy. ).

      However Anders  eyes are too jacked up to recognize this.

                                  ANDERS
                    ADAM NO!  Oh my god!

      Ders runs to the dummy on the ground, scared to touch his 
      dead friend.  He s fighting back tears, freaking out.

                                  ANDERS (CONT D)
                    Adam?!  Adam?!  Are you OK?  
                    Everyone shut up!  Adam I m sorry, 
                    tough love is all I know.  It s all 
                    I know!

                                  ALICE
                    It s a dummy, you blind idiot.

                                  ANDERS
                    What?  What?!

      Blake and Jillian stroll out of nowhere, hands behind their 
      backs, calmly speaking like the overly-rehearsed, omniscient 
      narrators of some pretentious shitty smart-people play.

                                    JILLIAN AND BLAKE
                          (in unison)
                    What you ve seen here was not real.  
                    This was a demonstration of what 
                    strange turns life can take, when 
                    the powers that be, make 
                      dumb/stupid decisions.  So put your 
                    fears aside, for Adam is alive.

      Adam pokes his head out at the roof s edge.

                                  ADAM
                    Heeeeey.
