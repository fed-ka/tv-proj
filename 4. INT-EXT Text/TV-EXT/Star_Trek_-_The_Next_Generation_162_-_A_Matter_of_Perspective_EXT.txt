       After completing a delivery of 
       dicosilium to the Tanuga Four 
       research station, our away team 
       is receiving an update from 
       Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts 
       to create Krieger Waves, a 
       potentially valuable new power 
       source.

     Near the space station... which suddenly EXPLODES. 
 
 
     The ship is in orbit as before. The space station is 
     gone, but perhaps there is a faint cloud of particles 
     or debris left over from the explosion seen earlier.

       Captain's log, supplemental: 
       Commander Riker has informed me 
       that Doctor Apgar was the only 
       one aboard the space station when 
       it exploded. We remain in orbit 
       investigating the accident... 
 
 
     As before.
