Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
the large open windows the helicopter as it continues
to approach.
Before the skids have even touched down he
SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from
the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side,
the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
chopper.
The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden

Otherwise the rooms are primitive and

PHILIPS

We've got a real problem here,
something right up your alley.
They cross to the center of the room to a folding table,
covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
American highland jungle.
Philips leans over the table,
circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
map.
PHILIPS
Eighteen hours ago I was
informed that one of our
choppers, transporting three
presidential cabinet members
from this charming little
country, was shot down...
(point to
the circled
area)
...The pilots radioed from the
ground that they were all
alive.
Their position was
fixed by the transponder
beacon onboard the chopper.

Schaefer studies the map.
He looks up at Philips.
SCHAEFER
That's over the border,
General.
PHILIPS
(dead serious)
That's the problem.
Apparently
they strayed off course.

We're certain they've been

Another puff on the cigar.
SCHAEFER
What else it new?
When do

Philips looks at his watch.
PHILIPS
You lift off in three hours.

There's one other thing.
SCHAEFER
What's that, General?
PHILIPS
Someone else will be going
in with you.
Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.
SCHAEFER
You know we don't work with
outsiders, General.
VOICE
(o.s.)
Who said anything about
outsiders, Dutch?
Schaefer turns, SEEING the outline of a figure standing
in the doorway of the communications room, holding a
sheaf of PAPERS.
Wearing pressed fatigues, DILLON, mid-thirties, black,
walks into the room.
Although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing
and grooming indicate he's been away from the business
of soldiering for sometime.
His quick intelligent eyes

The two men step forward and simultaneous swing from
the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands SLAP
together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms
bulging, testing each other's strength.
DILLON
(warmly)
How you been, Dutch?
They continue the contest, Schaefer has the edge, forcing
Dillon's arm slowly downward.
SCHAEFER
You've been pushing too many
Pencils, Dillon.
Had enough?
DILLON
(grinning)
No way, old buddy.
SCHAEFER
You never did know when to
quit.
They look into each other's faces, each remembering
something from the past.
A moment's hesitation and they
quit the contest.
They laugh, Dillon slapping Schaefer
on the shoulder.
DILLON
That piece of work you guys
pulled off at the Berlin
embassy last week was really
something.
Blew the entry

This must be good.
Big shot
from the CIA, leaves his desk
to come back to the bush.
What's so important?
DILLON
Those cabinet members are
very important to our scope
of operations in this part
of the world.
They're about
to get squeezed.
We can't
let that happen.
I needed
someone who could get the job
done, quick and quiet...no
screw-ups.
I needed the best.
The best.
So, I pulled a few
strings at the State
Department...and here we are.
SCHAEFER
Go on.
Dillon goes to the map.
DILLON
The set-up is simple, Dutch.
One day job.
We pick up their
trail at the chopper, run 'em
down, grab the hostages and
bounce back across the
border before anyone knows
we were there.
You've done

Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.
He still doesn't

DILLON
Not to worry, Dutch.
I

They've

Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are
SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and
camouflage face-makeup.
They wear no identity badges
or insignias.
The man are checking their WEAPONS,
making last minute adjustments to their GEAR.
The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
doors.
BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening
bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his
shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.
He looks across
at:
MAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60
MACHINE GUN.
Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who
refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing
smile, he knows what's coming.
Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free
from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT
KNIFE.
Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips
he slices through the plug as if it were butter.
He
chews throughtfully.
Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight,
angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano.
Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack
HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and
the bulleting the tape to:
HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough,
reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour

looking up, grinning at Ramirez, his boyish, eager
face belying the rugged professional beneath.
He
turns his gaze to the man next to him:
BILLY, the Kit Carson Scout, an American Indian, proud,
stoic, a man of quiet strength and simplicity,
carefully replacing the FIRING MECHANISM of his M-203,
working its action several times.
He looks up with a
smile at Hawkins.
HAWKINS
(shouting)
Hey, Billy, how many marines
does it take to eat a squirrel?
Billy looks back, shaking his head, uncomprehending.
HAWKINS
Two.
One to eat it and one

Hawkins laughs heartily at his joke.

The men, suspended in RESTRAINING HARNESSES from the

This brings a chorus of HOOTS and SHOUTS from the others.
The helicopter makes another radical turn.
Schaefer and Dillon, seated near the cockpit, communicate
through HEADSETS, also linked to the pilot.
They

Dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing Ramirez
a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando
unit from the past.
But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac, who
regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
outsider.
Mac looks up at Blain, his eyes narrowing.

Man, that's a real bad habit

Dillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain,
who continues to stare at him.
Mac looks across at
Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces.
Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his

Blain looks

Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES

into and rappelling down the rope to the ground.
He joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.
They look
up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit,
searching through pockets and compartments.
Schaefer
turns his back to the helicopter.
RAMIREZ
The pilots have each got one
round in the head.
And whoever

Schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary.
He turns back, looking at the chopper.
SCHAEFER

ripping into the CRATES behind where they were standing.
Dillon rises up, kicking over a crate, shooting the

Guerrilla who is trying to bring the gun around to fire
at him.
Schaefer crouches, covering the upper entrances to the

palapa, as Ramirez rushes past, joining Schaefer.
From
the corner of his eye, Schaefer catches a movement.
With a whipping, backhanded throw, he lets fly his
COMMANDO MACHETE...
The machete impales the attacking Guerrilla, driving him

backwards, pinning him to a post.
SCHAEFER
Stick around.
Schaefer and Ramirez run towards the lower levels, side
by side, firing as they go.
They reach a door, Schaefer taking out an ATTACKING
Guerrilla.
Ramirez grabs the side of the door, shoots
a look to Schaefer and throws it open.
With Schaefer
covering him, Ramirez takes a quick peak inside and
then rushes into the room.

At one end is a STAIRWAY, leading to an escape door.
A Guerrilla, seen from the waist up, scrambles down
the stairs.
At the base of the stairs, a Guerrilla, holding an
AK-47 on his hip, turns and starts to fire.
Schaefer and Ramirez respond with full AUTO BURSTS
which rip into the Guerrilla, spinning him around,
knocking over a crude WOODEN TABLE, scattering a
BRIEFCASE with burning PAPERS, FOOD CANS, and LIQUOR
BOTTLES.
As he spins he FIRES the weapon, an arcing line of SLUGS

ammunition crates, drawing down on Ramirez with a
machine pistol.
SCHAEFER

Down!!!
As the Guerrilla fires, Schaefer smashes the butt of
his empty weapon into the Guerrilla's shoulder, knocking
the gun aside, the SLUGS thudding into the wall
harmlessly.
He hits the Guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to
the head with the barrel of his weapon.
The Guerrilla
is hurled backward, crashing into the wooden crates and
to the floor.
Ramirez, recovering quickly, descends the stairs with
catlike agility, disappearing.
Schaefer crouches and spins, jamming a new clip into the
rifle, scanning the palapa for any other movement.
He
races to the main door of the room, shouting into the
palapa.
He SEES Blain charging down the steps.
Catching his
attention he signals him on, out the back to cover
Ramirez.
SCHAEFER

Mac hustles up to Schaefer,
a look of urgency on his face.
SCHAEFER

Schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the

The Hunter's HAND extends, his

A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one
with the trees and foliage.
The Hunter walks down a
CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT, leading to an opening to the
jungle.
As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes
from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.

REVEALED in flashes of strobing light, pauses at the
juncture of several towering rocks.
He stands, erect, tilting his head slowly, turning it
from side to side, his ears trying to orientate to the
diversity of SOUNDS reflecting off the circular walls,
enclosing the boulder field.

His vision, accustomed to another spectrum, has little
available heat to register vivid images of the inert,
lifeless forms of the stones.
He SEES instead, a world
of soft, ill-defined shapes in a pale MAGENTA field of
flickering heat.

Creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front
of the other, suddenly stops, hearing the CLICK-SCRAPE,
CLICK-SCRAPE, now on his right.
Starting to move in this new direction, he stops again,
HEARING the sound now directly across from him.
Listening, he hears the sound again from yet another
direction, the sound ECHOING in the natural ampitheater
of rock.
Schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits.
Suddenly
he crouches and freezes, HEARING the unbelievable SOUND
of a HUMAN VOICE, softly echoing through the
ampitheater.
ANNA'S VOICE
(o.s.; filtered;
in Spanish)
Look out, behind you!!!
Schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of
Anna's voice.
Wide-eyed, straining, he waits, hearing
only the muted FLOWING of water, the HISSING and POPPING
of the dying fire above, the shadows growing longer,
darker with each minute.
And then again, Anna's VOICE.
ANNA'S VOICE
(o.s.; in
Spanish)
...Look out, behind you!
SCHAEFER
(to himself)
Anna...?
Tracelike he moves towards the sound.

THE HUNTER

his head canted, throat distended, utters another
mimicry.

SCHAEFER

moving towards the space between two boulders from which
the VOICE seems to emanate.

his ears now directed towards the SOUND of Schaefer's
voice, his slowly approaching FOOTSTEPS, raises his
weapon.

SCHAEFER

pauses before the opening of the passageway.
All is
silent.
He hesitates to enter.
Listeneing.
He starts
to move and then hears a NEW VOICE:
HUNTER
(o.s.; Mac's
voice)
Dillon, over here...
Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's
voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder
and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.

His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light
deepening with the dying fire above, closing in.

It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.
The
Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing
into his body.
With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter
clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and
chest.
Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the
Hunter is gone.
215
215
Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running
through the ravine.
A pile of BOULDERS breaks the
falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST.
Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following
the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock.
Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly
soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE
beginning to dissolve, running off his body.
He
continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood
trail.

Next to the flowing stream, surrounded by an open area
of rock.
Schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and
ochre camouflage partially washed away, climbs up a log
onto the boulder.
Oblivious to the searing pain in his

shoulder, he breathes in hot, powerful exchanges, his
eyes wide and glowing with vengeance.
SCHAEFER
Bleed, you bastard.
His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across
the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder.
The blood trail stops.
He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE...
Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
Hunter whirl and spring towards him...
Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely
kicking the Hunter's arm.
The WEAPON flies from the
Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock.
Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate
kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground,
his back exposed.
In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the
bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound
dripping onto the Hunter's back.
The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back, REVEALING his
face, his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
blood.
The Hunter's body, rippled out of control,
trying desperately to orientate itself to the
environment.
SCHAEFER
(incredulous)
Who the hell are you...?
217
229
The weapon impacts the Hunter, his head EXPLODING in
a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue.
The weapon continues on, burying itself into the energy
field, bolts of plasma-energy begin arcing from the
force field.
Schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees,
staring at the Hunter's ship.
The SOUND of the
hyper-drive continues to increase, as the ship begins
to tremble.

Schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the
remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with
deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried
blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

Near the cockpit are General Philips, an ARMY MEDIC,
two MACHINE GUNNERS.
They look at Schaefer in awe.
The Medic, holding an open FIELD KIT, a syringe and
bandages, turns to Philips.
MEDIC
(shaking his head)
Looks like he's been through
hell...can't believe he's
still alive.
What the hell
went on down there?
PHILIPS
If it hadn't been for her, he'd
be dead now.
That story she
told us...I still can't believe
it.
He looks at Anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking
for an explanation.
She looks at him a moment before
turning back to Schaefer, staring at him as if he were
risen from the dead.
She looks into Schaefer's face, Schaefer returning her
look, recognition passing between them.
Anna extends
her hand.
Schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her
fingers, then clasping her hand.
Schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door,
beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens.
He turns back, looking at Anna, a faint smile crossing
his face...they made it.
