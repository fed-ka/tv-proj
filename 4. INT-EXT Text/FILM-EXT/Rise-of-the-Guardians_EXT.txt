Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
tousled hair frosted white.
JACK (V.O.)
But then...then I saw the moon. It
was so big and it was so bright,
and it seemed to chase the darkness
away. And when it did...I wasn't
scared anymore.
Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
underneath him.
JACK (V.O.)
Why I was there, and what I was
meant to do - that I've never
known. And a part of me wonders if
I ever will.
Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
as it dims a bit.
Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2.
Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
he begins to run across the frozen pond.
Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.
A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.
Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.
JACK
(to the townsfolk)
Hello. Hello. Good evening,
ma'am.
(BEAT)
Ma'am?
The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches
down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.
JACK
Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me
where I am?
The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.
JACK
Hello! Hello!
Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his
presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.
JACK (V.O.)
My name is Jack Frost -- how do I
know that? The moon told me so.
But that was all he ever told me.
And that was a long, long time ago.

FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal
a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible
hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS.
From the tallest spire of North's fortress, NORTHERN LIGHT
ENERGY radiates outward: for the first time in decades, the
GUARDIANS' CALL GOES OUT!

SEQ. 225 - GUARDIANS GATHER
Hundreds of fairies fly toward a hollowed out mountain, this

We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a
stream of sand swirling overhead. It's a dream and it's taken
the shape of a child playing soccer.
We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the
sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to
earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS...
...to reveal a small, GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand
shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads.
The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.
Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud
suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small
BIPLANE, with Sandy in the cockpit. He BARREL ROLLS the
plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape
and flies off into the distance.

NORTH (V.O.)
An enemy we have kept at bay for
centuries has finally decided to
strike back. We alone can stop
him.
Much of this we hear over the following...
A hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out.
A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed.
The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND.
BUNNYMUND
Ah, it's freezing.
He shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
I can't feel my feet! I can't feel
my feet!
In the distance is North's ornately decorated and dimly lit
palace built into the side of a mountain of ice.

SEQ. 250 - THE CEREMONY
A hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a
Post Office box on the opposite end of the street. The man
touches the staff to the ground, sending a streak of frost
across the street.
A RUSSIAN BOY approaches a water fountain, turns the handle
and moves in for a sip. But as he does, the water freezes
magically, and the boy's tongue is stuck to the frozen water.
His friends can't help but laugh.
RUSSIAN BOY
(tongue stuck to frozen
ICE)
Aahhhhh...!
A mail man walks across the street and a PATCH OF ICE
magically appears under his feet. He scrambles, and BOOM! -
lands on his butt. Just behind the man, we see the TRAIL OF
FROST climb up the side of a building. We stay on the frost
as it moves up along a rain pipe, and through the windows we
see...

A boy try to feed his gold fish, but a layer of ice suddenly
forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from
reaching its food. We move along the side of the building...
A writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers. The
window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the
pages flying out the window. We move along the building,
across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze.
We continue to move up, and finally discover the culprit.
Jack Frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in
the view; the full moon bathes the city in moonlight.
JACK
(AMUSED)
Ah, now that, that was fun.
(BEAT)
Hey wind...
Jack chuckles as he calls the wind. The trees begin to sway
and leaves fly into the air. Jack grabs hold of the spire,
smiling as the wind blows past.
JACK
Take me home!
Jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and
through the clouds. Night turns to day as Jack flies from
one horizon to the other.
JACK
Woooooohoooooooooo!
Jack falls through the clouds, smiling, toward the town of
Burgess.
JACK
SNOOOOOWWWW DAAAAYYYYYY!!!
Jack continues on down and zooms through the streets.
Pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as
gusts of wind, snow, and streaks of frost are left in Jack's
wake.
Jack flies in, and with the wind behind him skates across an
all too familiar pond. As the wind zips across the pond it
knocks a BOOK out of the hands of a little boy walking alone,
this is JAMIE.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 16.
JAMIE
Whoa, whoa.
Jamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the
cover - "THEY'RE OUT THERE! - MYSTERIES, MYTHICAL CREATURES
AND THE UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA." Jack flies into frame and
lands beside Jamie.
JACK
Huh, that looks interesting. Good
book?
Suddenly twins CLAUDE and CALEB, come barreling past them,
rough-housing and laughing as they slam each other into
drifts (all the boys are 8).
CLAUDE AND CALEB
Alright! Yeah! Waahoo! Snooow
daaaay!!!
Jack calls after the boys...
JACK
You're welcome!
JAMIE
(goes running after them)
Hey guys, wait up! Are you guys
coming to the egg hunt Sunday?
CALEB
Yeah, free candy!
CLAUDE
I hope we can find the eggs with
all this snow!
Caleb stuffs a handful of snow down his brother's Jacket
The kids arrive at the fence of Jamie's house. Jamie opens
up a secret plank, and heads into his yard. Claude and Caleb
are still messing with each other. Meanwhile, Jack walks
unseen along the top of the fence.
CALEB

Stop!
CLAUDE

No, you stop!

JAMIE
Whoa, it says here that they found

CLAUDE
Here we go again.
Jamie arrives at his front gate, sled in hand while SOPHIE
(Jamie's 2-year-old sister in fairy wings) sits down on their
Greyhound as it lies in the yard.
JAMIE
You saw the video too Claude, he's
out there!
CALEB
That's what you said about aliens.
CLAUDE
And the Easter Bunny.
JAMIE
(grabs his sled)
Wow, the Easter Bunny is real!
JACK
Oh he's real alright. Real
annoying, real grumpy, and really
full of himself.
Jack hops off the fence and walks amongst the kids, peering
over their shoulders as they play in the yard.
CLAUDE

Come on, you guys believe anything.
SOPHIE
(GIGGLES)
EASTER BUNNY! HOP-HOP-HOP!

Sophie begins to cry.
JAMIE
Mom! Sophie fell again!
JAMIE'S MOM comes outside. Caleb, alongside his brother,
stands at the front gate and calls out to Jamie.

JAMIE'S MOM
You okay, Soph?
CLAUDE
Are we sledding or what?
JAMIE'S MOM
Jamie, hat? We don't want Jack
Frost nipping at your nose.
Jamie's mom plunks the hat on his head, tweaks his nose.
JAMIE
Who's Jack Frost?
JAMIE'S MOM
No one, honey. It's just an
expression.
JACK
(smile drops - offended)
Hey.
Jack jumps down from the fence as the boys head off.
JACK
(MIFFED)
Who's Jack Frost?
Jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the
ground. With his palm open, Jack uses his magic to form the
perfect snowball.
He then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy
breath. The snowball turns a light shade of blue. There's
something going on here.
WHOOSH! - the snowball goes flying through the air and -
BOOF! - the snowball hits Jamie smack in the back of the
head. Jamie looks up, peeved, and turns.
Then we watch as his face changes...a mischievous sparkle
comes into his eyes. A big smile. Make no mistake,
something magical has just happened.
JAMIE
(LAUGHING)
Okay, who threw that?
Jack flies in and lands amongst the group of kids.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 19.
JACK
Well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo.
Jamie scans the horizon for the culprit. His eyes land on a
couple kids making snow barricades.
MONTY (oddball with big glasses) with his back turned
suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head, knocking
him face first into the ground.
MONTY
Ow!
PIPPA (brainy, pigtails, pink hat) steps forward and - BOOF!
A magical snowball from Jack hits her, knocking her back.
Pippa's face changes - a mischievous sparkle.
PIPPA
Jamie Bennett! No fair!
JAMIE
(LAUGHS)
You struck first!
CLAUDE
Oh!
Suddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one
of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh.
JACK
Free for all!
And just like that we find ourselves in a take-no-prisoners
snowball fight, the kids pummeling each other mercilessly.
JACK
Alright, who needs ammo?
Jack supplies the kids with more snowballs. The kids are
loving this.
JACK
(WALLA)
Look at that.
The mayhem continues as Jamie, using his sled as a shield, is
knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him.
A snowball flies overhead and hits CUPCAKE, a tough third
grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head.
Dread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints -
gunslinger eyes.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 20.
CUPCAKE
Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
PIPPA
Crud, I hit Cupcake.
MONTY
She hit Cupcake.
CLAUDE
You hit Cupcake?
Jamie is flat on his back, terrified. He looks up to see
Cupcake standing over him. Then, BOOF! Jack hits Cupcake
with a magical snowball. The kids gasp in horror.
CLAUDE
Oh!
CALEB
Did you throw that?
MONTY
No.
PIPPA
Wasn't me.
A moment, and then Cupcake starts laughing as Jack's magic
takes hold.
Cupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of
her snowman in her hands. Jack, all the while, runs along
side taking pleasure in the excitement.
JAMIE
(WALLA)
Hey, come on. Stop!
CLAUDE
(WALLA)
You can't catch me.
JACK
Ooh, little slippery!
Jack jumps ahead, blasting a sheet of ice behind him. The
kids fall to the ground, except for Jamie, who lands on his
sled, and slides head first down the sheet of ice into town.
JAMIE
Whooaaooah!!!

Jamie! Turn, turn! That's the
street! What are you doing? Stop!
There's traffic!
Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past
a set of parked cars.
Jack's path of ice covers the street. As Jamie turns, his
speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic.
Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of
control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four
car pile up.
JAMIE
Whoa!
JACK
Whoa, don't worry kid, I gotcha.
Jamie looks back, then quickly ahead as terror comes into his
eyes. Jack can't help but smile.
JACK
Hold on. It's gonna be alright.
JAMIE
Ahhhh. No, no, no, no...
JACK
Keep up with me kid! Take a left.
Jamie rockets through a pedestrian intersection, narrowly
missing those in the crosswalk.
DOG WALKER (O.S.)
Hey, slow down!
JAMIE
Whoa, no, no, no, no...
Jack flies over to the far side of the street, sending the
streak of ice and Jamie up onto the sidewalk.

PEDESTRIAN #2 (O.S.)
Hey! Watch it!
JACK
There you go!
JAMIE
No! No!
PEDESTRIAN #3 (O.S.)
Look at that dude!
Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the
street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by
Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's
face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible.
Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead,
carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail.
JACK
Whoa.
Jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming
truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp...
JAMIE
AAAAHHHHHHHH!
Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the
street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus
Burgess, colonial settler - 1680. Jamie's friends stand in
awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air.
Jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to
joy. Jack looks on smiling.
Jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. Jack jumps onto
the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess.
PIPPA (O.S.)
Oh my gosh!
JACK
Yeah!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 23.
Jamie's friends all come running to Jamie's aide, scared.
But Jamie gets up.
KIDS

Wow, that looks serious! Jamie!
Jamie, are you alright? Is he
okay?
JAMIE
Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It
was amazing! I slid - I did a jump
and I slid under a car-ERF!!
A sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down...
JACK
Whoops.
KIDS
(CRINGING)
Ooooh!
There's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie
is okay. Then, Jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning,
a new gap in his smile. He holds up a tooth.
JAMIE
Cool! A Tooth!
KIDS
(WALLA)
Dude, that means cash! Tooth Fairy
cash! I love the Tooth Fairy!
JACK

Oh, no...

I lost two teeth in one day once -
remember that?! What are you gonna
spend your money on? What are you
gonna buy? How much do you think
she's going to leave?
As Jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows.
Storm clouds overhead rumble and darken. Flurries of snow
begin to intensify.
KIDS
(WALLA)
Let's go...I'm cooold! My ears are
freezing. I can't feel my toes.
Ah, it's hot cocoa time.
Jack jumps down from the statue, trying to engage the kids.
But it's too late, the kids take off. Jack blocks Jamie's
way as the boy comes running at him.
JACK
What's a guy gotta do to get a
little attention around here!
WHOOOSH! Jamie runs through Jack, as if he where a ghost.
Jack is left momentarily shaken, then...

SEQ. 700 - NIGHT FALLS IN TOWN
Jack flips onto the roof, a little pensive. He makes his way
toward the roof's peak and looks up at the MOON, in full
view. It lights up the night sky.
JACK
If there's something I'm doing
wrong, can you, can you just tell
me what it is?
(NO RESPONSE)
Because I've tried everything, and
no one ever sees me.
(NO RESPONSE)
You put me here, the least you can
do is tell me, tell me why.
A beat. The Moon shines silently down. Jack turns away in
frustration.
Jack leaps off the roof, onto a telephone pole, and begins
walking across some telephone wires. A stream of Dreamsand
suddenly zips by behind him, then another, which swoops
around in front of him. Jack turns and looks up, a smile now
on his lips.
JACK
Right on time, Sandman.
The Dreamsand descends from the sky, and drifts into windows
around the town. Jack runs along the telephone wire until he
can reach out and intercept one of the passing streams. An
adjacent stream takes the shape of a dolphin which turns
toward Jack, before continuing on its way to a waiting child.
Then, we follow one of the streams into a window...
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 27.
Pitch steps out into the street from an adjacent alley,
avoiding the rays of moonlight. He looks up to the sky and
stares at the MOON.
PITCH
Don't look at me like that, old
friend. You must have known this
day would come. My Nightmares are
finally ready. Are your Guardians?
Jack walks along a telephone wire as the Dreamsand disappears
from the sky. Suddenly a shadowy figure and an unfamiliar
noise zips by behind him.
JACK
Whoa!
In the background, residents get ready for the night.
RESIDENTS (O.S.)
(WALLA)
Did you leave the windows open
again? The garage door is wide
open.
Jack leaps over a house to an adjacent tree to investigate
and again, something zooms behind him. Jack jumps down from
the tree and onto a truck in a nearby alley.
Suddenly: WHOOSH! The SHADOW flashes by, knocking over a
trash can.
Jack jumps down from the truck and backs up out of the
alleyway into a clearing...
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Hello, mate.
Jack turns around, ready to strike. He squints, as into the
light steps...

BUNNYMUND
Been a long time. Blizzard of 68, I

Jack is completely bewildered --

Yes.
Bunny whips out his boomerang and casually looks at it as he
holds it in his hands.

Jack is shoved head first into a sack. A yeti whips out a
snow globe, and smashes it on the ground.

disappears along with the rabbit hole. In its place, from

NORTH
What are they!?
Sandy and Bunny duck the onslaught.
BUNNYMUND
Whoa!
Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN
the fleeing fairies and flying off with them. It's chaos.
JACK
They're taking the tooth fairies!
Jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping
at its heels. Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before
the Nightmare can snatch it away.
Jack lands back in the sleigh. He opens his hand to reveal
Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear.
JACK
Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay?
As Baby Tooth nods, North steers the sleigh forward through
the storm toward the entrance of Tooth's Palace.

Pitch leans toward the Guardians, showing nothing but
contempt.
PITCH (CONT'D)
Well that's all about to change.
A SOUND behind Pitch: one of the COLUMNS of the Palace begins
to crack and crumble, as if decaying. Tooth is stunned...
PITCH
Oh look, it's happening already.

What is?
Tooth's eyes widen in shock.
VIGNETTES OF CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD

They, they don't believe in me
anymore.

Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's
great being a Guardian -- but
there's a catch. If enough kids
stop believing, everything your

dreams - it all goes away. And
little by little, so do they.
Jack's realizes now the magnitude of Pitch's plan.
PITCH
No Christmas, or Easter, or little
fairies that come in the night.
There will be nothing. But fear
and darkness and me! It's your
turn not to be believed in!
Bunny throws his boomerangs at Pitch, who quickly ducks out
of the way as they fly around the chamber columns. Pitch
then jumps onto the back of Onyx down into the depths of the

Bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at Pitch,

incisor two blocks east! Is that a
molar? They're EVERYWHERE!
Tooth, overwhelmed, jets off without paying attention and
SUDDENLY --
THOOMP -- she smacks into a TOOTHPASTE BILLBOARD.
TOOTH
Ow!
Jack jumps up to the billboard to check on her.
JACK
Ah, you okay?
TOOTH
Fine...sorry, it's been a really
long time since I've been out in
the field.
JACK
How long is a long time?
TOOTH
Ah, four hundred forty years...give
or take.
Tooth jerks to attention: suddenly her VIEW ZOOMS IN thru a
LITTLE GIRL'S BEDROOM WINDOW: a tiny GLOW under her pillow
marks a freshly planted TOOTH.
Tooth gasps and her eyes go wide -- she FLIES to the window,
excited. Jack reacts, looks to Baby Tooth: it's gonna be a
long night.
JACK
Hmm...
Bunny, now holding the tooth in his paw, turns to Jack and
laughs. Jack, not amused, zaps Bunny with burst of frost
from his staff.
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Aaahhh!
The Guardians fly over a Middle Eastern city in North's
sleigh as the full moon lights up the night sky.
Jack parkours between two buildings and into a window.
North and the Guardians, riding North's sleigh, exit a
wormhole. North laughs as they fly over the city.
Bunny lands on a rooftop, holding a tooth in his paw, and
proud of himself. Then, Bunny hears the sound of ice and
FROST--
BUNNYMUND
Crikey!
--and disappears from view. Bunny is now sliding down the
side of a roof on a sheet of ice. Jack grabs the tooth from
Bunny's paw as he slides past and holds it high in the air.
JACK
(LAUGHS)
Yes!
Jack holds up the tooth, but within moments a hand snatches
it. Jack looks to see Sandy waving `bye-bye' as he flies off
on his Dreamsand cloud.
JACK
No!
North dances across a rooftop and quickly drops into a
chimney to enter a house -- we DROP FAST THROUGH THE ROOF AND
CEILING...
A large burst of fire shoots out the top of a distant
chimney.
NORTH (O.S.)
Ahh!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 60.
Jack, North, Sandy, and Bunny stand proudly. Each one of
them revealing their own bag filled with teeth to Tooth.
Tooth is overwhelmed by their collective effort.
TOOTH
Wow! You guys collect teeth and
leave gifts as fast as my fairies.
Their eyes widen and Tooth is suddenly panic stricken.
TOOTH (CONT'D)
You guys have been leaving gifts,
right?
The rest of the group turns to each other, sinking their
heads and biting their lips in embarrassment.
The Guardians stand in line, waiting their turn to put dollar
bills into a coin dispenser.
A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS, VERY FAST
- Baby Tooth puts a COIN under a pillow.
- Now Jack puts a coin under a pillow.
- North's hand pulls a Tooth from under a pillow. He
replaces it pair of CANDY CANES and a few COINS.
- Bunny stomps his feet and falls through a rabbit hole to
reveal a pair of Easter Eggs atop a child's bed.
- Sandy walks through a doggy door with a coin in his hand.
In shock, he sees North laughing while arranging Christmas
decorations in the child's bedroom.
The Guardians fly across the night sky only to disappear
through a snowglobe portal. Nearby, a Nightmare observes as
the sleigh vanishes. It leaps off the roof, through a drain,
and down into the sewers.
CUT TO:
SEQ. 1650 - PITCH'S LAIR
TWO NIGHTMARES zigzag along the rooftops, searching for
victims. Jack, loving the chase, is in hot pursuit with
Sandy, who's riding along on a streak of Dreamsand--
JACK
Wahooo!
(BEAT)
Haha! Yes!
One of the Nightmares splits off, angling for a BEDROOM
WINDOW. Sandy calmly follows--
The Nightmare flies right through the WINDOW and SANDY does
the same -- the OTHER ONE angles up over the house's ROOF to
evade Jack, who PARKOURS over the roof after it--
JACK
Waaahahoooo!
Through the WINDOWS BELOW, FLASHES OF GOLDEN and SICKLY GREEN
LIGHT race through the house as Sandy battles the Nightmare--
The Nightmares and Jack ZOOM away from the house just as
Sandy and the FIRST NIGHTMARE blast out of the window, Sandy
wrestling it until -- POOF! It explodes into golden
DREAMSAND which he quickly transforms into a Sting Ray for
him to ride--
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 69.
Jack flies through town on the heels of the Nightmare. It
makes a sharp turn down an alleyway and Jack is quick to
follow.
The Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a
ROOFTOP. Jack whips a blast from his staff and HITS the
Nightmare before it disappears from view.
JACK
(JAZZED)
HAAAH! I got it!
Jack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen Nightmare
with his staff.
JACK
Sandy! Sandy, did you see that?!?
Look at this thing!
Jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to
Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air
conditioning unit on the rooftop.
PITCH
Frost?
Jack blasts a WAVE OF FROST across the rooftop, but Pitch
easily dodges it, reappearing behind Jack on the adjoining
rooftop.
PITCH
You know, for a "neutral party" you
spend an awful lot of time with
those weirdos.
(BEAT)
This isn't your fight, Jack.
Jack's eyes narrow. He holds out his staff, ready to strike.
JACK
You made it my fight when you stole
those teeth.
Pitch regards him curiously.
PITCH
Teeth? Why do you care about the
teeth?
When he notices something and turns to find Sandy calmly
standing on the rooftop next to him. Pitch quickly
sidesteps, moving away from Sandy.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 70.
PITCH
(CHUCKLING)
Now this is who I'm looking for--
Before Pitch can finish a DREAMSAND STREAM whips around him,
forcing him to duck and dodge Sandy's sudden attack.
PITCH
Whoa--??
Pitch DISPERSES a stream of NIGHTMARE SAND, turning it into a
gigantic sickle and swings it back at Sandy. Jack ducks,
avoiding injury as Sandy's pushed back against a ledge.
Sandy quickly grabs Pitch with another DREAMSAND STREAM and
yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the
tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the
rooftop.
Pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an EMPTY
STREET. As Sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the
rooftop to follow, Jack looks on, astonished.
JACK
Remind me not to get on your bad
side.
Pitch shakes off the crash, trying to back up as Sandy
touches down and moves toward him, Jack following. Pitch
cowers on the ground in fear as they approach.
PITCH
(looks up, pleading)
Okay, easy! You can't blame me for
trying, Sandy. You don't know what
it's like to be weak and hated. It
was stupid of me to mess with your
dreams. So I'll tell you what-
Sandy continues forward, grim faced...but suddenly Pitch
stops cowering and stands up. His tone changes.
PITCH (CONT'D)
You can have `em back!
Before Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up
through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in
the alley behind him.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71.
Jack and Sandy look around as hundreds of Nightmares descend
from the surrounding rooftops to encircle them. This doesn't
look good. Jack, worried, looks to Sandy and mutters...
JACK
You take the ones on the left, I'll
take the ones on the right?
Meanwhile, Pitch rises up from off the ground as Onyx takes
shape underneath him.
Pitch grabs onto Onyx's mane as it snorts and snarls. He
then leans forward.
PITCH
Boo!
Pitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge. Then suddenly,
the sound of BELLS and REINDEER echo in the distance--
NORTH'S SLEIGH bursts through the clouds. Jack and Pitch
look up into the sky as it circles overhead. The sleigh
turns toward Pitch, only to fly a few feet over his head.
Pitch turns as it passes over him, slightly confused.
NORTH'S SLEIGH
North's asleep at the wheel, along with Bunny and Tooth.
Suddenly, the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over
City Hall, jolting North to attention.
NORTH
Ah!
Bunny awakes with a fright from a bad a dream.
BUNNYMUND
Get outta my warren!
(realizes he's awake now)
Huh?
Still battling Nightmares, Sandy propels himself and Jack
into the air with a stream of Dreamsand and launches Jack
away from the Nightmares. Jack quickly orients himself and
knocks an oncoming Nightmare with his staff.
Tooth quickly jumps off the side of the sleigh toward Jack
and Sandy.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 72.
Jack, knocks away a few more Nightmares with his staff, and
looks up. Tooth suddenly flies into view through the swarm
of Nightmares, slicing them apart with her wings, causing
them to EXPLODE into BLACK SAND.
PITCH
Pitch gives a signal and leaps into the air, leading another
wave of Nightmares after the Guardians.
SLEIGH
Back in the sleigh, Bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby
roof.
Bunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every
Nightmare in its path. Bunny catches the returning
boomerang, leaps off the roof, and grabs the skids of the
sleigh as it passes by.
THE SLEIGH
North stands, drawing both his scimitars, and dices the
oncoming Nightmares to bits as they attack.
NORTH
Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on!
Jack heads back to the sleigh by dodging two Nightmares as
they attack. As he continues his descent, Jack is suddenly
blind sided by another Nightmare, which knocks the staff from
his hands.
For a moment, Jack is in a state of panic as he finds himself
in free fall.
JACK
Aaaaaaaah!
He finally manages to hook onto the staff, control his
descent, and land on the sleigh as it flies past.
BUNNYMUND
(coolly, to Jack)
You might want to duck.
Jack DUCKS as a Nightmare rears up behind him, but one of
Bunny's BOOMERANGS blasts through it and zips back to Bunny's
waiting paw.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 73.
SANDY
Sandy high up in he clouds, does his best to contain the MASS
OF NIGHTMARES that are swirling around him.
PITCH
Pitch rises from behind a group of Nightmares. He stretches
his arms as an ARROW of NIGHTMARE SAND forms behind him.
SLEIGH
Jack and the Guardians watch as more Nightmares speed away to
join their herd. Sandy looks overwhelmed by the onslaught.
JACK
We gotta help Sandy!
NORTH
Hyah!
North cracks the reigns, turns the sleigh, and heads toward
the swirling cloud of yellow and black sand.
PITCH
Pitch takes aim and releases the arrow. It flies through the
air and into SANDY'S back, exploding on impact.
SLEIGH
The Guardians look on, horrified.
JACK
Noooo!
Jack leaps ahead of the sleigh and flies toward Sandy.
NORTH
Jack!
PITCH
Sandy feels the shock and turns around. A patch of blackness
starts slowly spreading across his body. Pitch laughs as he
and Sandy lock eyes.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 74.
PITCH
Hahahahaha!...Don't fight the fear,
little man.
THE SLEIGH
The Guardians continue to speed toward Sandy, but Nightmares
begin colliding with the sleigh, slowing their progress.
NORTH
Hurry, hurry!
PITCH
Pitch relishes this moment of triumph.
PITCH
I'd say sweet dreams, but there
aren't any left.
Sandy, his eyes filled with terror, falls to his knees as the
patch of blackness continues to spread.
JACK
Jack presses on, trying to reach Sandy as fast as he can.
SANDY
Sandy stands up, accepting his fate, and closes his eyes as
he and his Dreamsand cloud are consumed by the writhing
blackness of the Nightmare sand.
THE SLEIGH
NORTH
Sandy...
JACK
Horrified, clenches his staff as he flies toward Pitch.
JACK
No...NOOOOOO!!!!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 75.
SANDY
Sandy's gone. His beautiful Golden Dreamsand, now black,
merges with the rest of Pitch's Nightmare sand.
PITCH
Is beyond delighted. His plan actually worked!
Pitch then notices Jack flying towards him, glowing energy
emanating from Jack's staff. Pitch raises his hands and
sends a massive wave of Nightmares toward Jack.
THE SLEIGH
The Guardians are stunned.
JACK
Jack quickly realizes that's he's in over his head as the
attacking Nightmares begin to overtake him. He's engulfed by
Nightmares and there is nothing but silence.
PITCH
Pitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning
suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand.
JACK
JACK
Ahhhhhh!!!!!
A gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a
massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream
of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of
ice and snow.
PITCH
AAAHH!!!!
Jack free falls back to Earth, unconscious.
NORTH
Jack!

Tooth quickly rescues him and sets him back down in the
sleigh.
TOOTH
Jack, how did you do that?
JACK
(REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS)
I, I didn't know I could.
Pitch pulls himself laboriously from the mud and weeds
amongst the trees where he's crash-landed, oddly, he seems
delighted.
He looks up to see a BRIGHT GLOW -- North's SNOWGLOBE PORTAL.
The sleigh zooms into it and it WINKS OUT.
Pitch shakes the FROST from his arms as scores of Nightmares
swarm behind Pitch, regrouping after the blast. Pitch, at
the center, seems as pleased as can be.
PITCH
Finally! Someone who knows how to
have a little FUN!

Jack closes the window and looks to Baby Tooth with a sign of
relief.
JACK
We should get back.

Baby Tooth nods, when...
VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)
(LAUGHING)
Jack...
Jack stops, confused. Where is that voice coming from? He
looks out across the town, toward the woods, and the sound of
the echoed voice.
JACK
That voice, I know that voice...
Baby Tooth looks to him, worried.
VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)
Jack...
With that, Jack leaps off the window ledge.
Jack, carried by the wind, flies across town toward the sound
of the eerie voice. Baby Tooth follows, trying to keep up.
Jack takes a moment to orient himself and lands, settling on
a rotating vent; as the momentum slowly spins him around, the
voice calls out to him again.
VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)
Jack...
Jack turns, looks to the woods, and takes off.
Jack and Baby Tooth land in the middle of a thickly wooded
area. It's spooky. Jack scans the forest when again he
hears...
VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.)
Jack...
Jack gives chase. He sprints through the thickets and enters
a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting
frame from a child's bed. Very creepy. What would that be
doing in the woods, and how long has it been here?
JACK
Don't worry, there's still time.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 87.
Baby Tooth desperately tries to get Jack's attention by
tugging at his tunic, and tweeting desperately.
Jack takes his staff, and breaks through the damaged frame,
revealing a hole leading deep underground.

Jack...
What to do? Jack jumps down the hole, reluctantly followed
by Baby Tooth.

There are no eggs. There's none
anywhere. I give up. Come on,
let's go. I don't understand.
Bunny checks the eggs in his basket, then looks back toward
the kids.
BRITISH GIRL
Maybe he just hid them really well
this year.
Bunny, egg basket in hand, approaches a group of kids who
seem to be wandering around searching halfheartedly,
disappointed and listless.
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Kids! Oi!
BRITISH BOY
I checked everywhere! There's
nothing!
BUNNYMUND

Yes there is! There is! I mean

He holds out a broken Easter egg. The kids just stare.

There's no such thing as the Easter
Bunny.
The girl turns to leave.
BUNNYMUND

Easter's over. Forget this.
It's only then that we realize he's too late. The spark of
childhood has already been extinguished in all of them.

Now come on. I don't understand.
Why wouldn't he come? Let's get

are you? This is the worst Easter
ever.
BUNNYMUND
They don't see me.

They don't see me.
JACK's watching this all unfold and it's heartbreaking,
because he knows it's his fault. Tooth flies to Bunny's
side. Jack hears a rustle in the bushes behind him.
NORTH (O.S.)
Jack, where were you?
Jack sees North, with his scimitars drawn and having just
come from battle. He's exhausted, wild-eyed, distraught.
NORTH (CONT'D)
The Nightmares attacked the
tunnels. They smashed every egg,
crushed every basket. Nothing made
it to the surface.

Tooth rejoins the group from off screen.

Easter is about hope.

And now it's gone.
Bunny turns away and moves toward the park, looking at the
sign that reads, `Easter Egg Hunt.'
This is like a punch in Jack's gut. He looks back to Tooth
and North, both of whom look away, too hurt by Jack. He
looks at them with a pained expression. This is exactly what
Pitch said would happen.
Jack reaches into his pocket, pulls out the tiny Russian
nesting doll that North had given him, drops the doll to the
ground, and takes off.
As Jack leaves, carried off by the wind, we see the tiny
Russian nesting doll laying on the ground.

Whoaaa, whoa, whoa...aaaah!
Jamie grabs the gutter but it breaks loose, sending Jamie
crashing down into a mound of snow.
As Jamie gets up off the ground, he sees that the Easter egg
was in fact a dirty old tennis ball. Jamie stands up,
bewildered, and dusts himself off as his friends LAUGH. A

Pippa walks away, trailing the others. Jamie doesn't know
what to believe. He hangs his head and looks into the Easter
basket, it's empty.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
I know he is.
Jack runs to the edge of a floating iceberg, ready to throw
his tooth box into the ocean. He resists, looking down at
the box as he clutches it in his hand. He's never been more
alone in his life.

I thought this might happen.
Pitch is revealed, standing not far behind Jack.
PITCH (CONT'D)
They never really believed in you.
I was just trying to show you that.
But I understand.

Jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but
it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand.
JACK
You don't understand anything!
Jack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff. Pitch
blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the
Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength.
PITCH
(SHOUTING)
No? I don't know what it's like to
be cast out?
Pitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense. Jack jumps
in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're
shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind
and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert.
PITCH (O.S.)(CONT'D)
To not be believed in. To long for
a family.
Jack turns around to find Pitch. There's a look of
compassion on Jack's face as he listens.
PITCH (CONT'D)
All those years in the shadows I
thought, no one else knows what
this feels like. But now I see I
was wrong.
They lock eyes. A moment of true connection between them.

Pitch, realizing how this looks, clarifies...

And Jack Frost too. They'll

Jack stares at him, considering the offer. Then finally...
JACK
No, they'll fear both of us. And
that's not what I want.
Jack turns and walks away.
JACK (CONT'D)
Now for the last time, leave me
alone.
Pitch looks confused and hurt. This is not the response he
was expecting. Then...his eyes flame with anger. He made
himself vulnerable, and Jack rejected him. No more
negotiating now.
PITCH
Very well. You want to be left
alone? Done. But first...
Suddenly Jack hears a familiar twitter. Pitch reaches into
his coat to pull out...

Jack charges forward. There's terror in Baby Tooth's eyes.

Pitch twirls the staff.

Alright, now let her go.
PITCH
No. You said you wanted to be
alone.

Baby Tooth squirms until she's finally able to peck Pitch in
the hand with her beak. Pitch shrieks and throws Baby Tooth
in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse.
JACK
No!
Jack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing. Pitch lifts
the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two.
Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's
eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain.
Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting
Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As
the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the
chasm below.
Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws
the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and
casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon.

He pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands.
JACK
You alright?
Baby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold. Jack does his
best to shield her from the cold.
JACK
Sorry, all I can do is keep you
cold.
Jack sits up and holds Baby Tooth in his hands.
JACK
Pitch was right - I make a mess of

Jack is devastated. Baby Tooth's never seen him like this;

pulling back to reveal him dressed as we first saw him in

come in to focus.

Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two
rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface
of a familiar FROZEN pond. And now we see what he sees, a
girl of about FOUR (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's
sister Sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. A
spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands.

in. We're gonna have a little fun
instead.
JACK'S SISTER
No we're not!
JACK
Would I trick you?
JACK'S SISTER
(fighting back tears)
Yes! You always play tricks!
JACK
(CHUCKLES)
Well, alright. Well, not, not this
time. I promise. I promise,
you're gonna be...you're gonna be
fine.
Jack fixes her gaze...holds it...there's nothing but the two
of them.
JACK
You have to believe in me.
Jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear.
And just like that, Jack's demeanor changes. A light is
switched on inside him and the last thing that could be
happening is what is actually happening.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 103.
JACK (CONT'D)
(casual, playfully)
You wanna play a game? We're going
to play Hopscotch! Like we play
every day!
Jack's sister looks more reassured.
JACK (CONT'D)
It's as easy as...one...whoaaaa...
And Jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her,
almost losing his balance then catching himself. She laughs.
JACK (CONT'D)
Two...
(the next jump)
Three!
He turns toward her with his arms spread out.
JACK
Alright...
He reaches down to pick up a familiar-looking stick lying on
the ice. He extends it towards her --
JACK (CONT'D)
Now it's your turn.
Jack's sister looks down. She is trying to gather her
courage. Jack, never breaking his gaze with her,
JACK (CONT'D)
(SOFTLY)
One...
She hops, wobbling, but catching her balance.
JACK
That's it, that's it...two...
She's almost there, Jack's staff just beyond her reach.
JACK
Three.
She grabs hold of Jack's staff and in one massive effort he
slings her with all his might to safety. But the movement
propels him into the cracked ice. He looks up to see his
sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold
water.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 104.
JACK
Whoa...
JACK'S SISTER
Jack!
Jack falls back into the icy water. SPLASH!
UNDERWATER
We're looking up at the hole in the ice, descending into the
dark icy depths...then THE FULL MOON appears from behind the
clouds as Jack's hands claw through the water towards it, but
it's helpless. The MOON glows bright...brighter...
Jack's BODY begins to glow, bathed in MOONLIGHT. PUSH IN on
his FACE, becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair
turns white and JACK'S BRIGHT BLUE EYES flash open --
The icy walls rush back in as we pull out from Jack, reeling
from the memory. He sees Baby Tooth.
JACK
Did you -- did you see that?
She shakes her head `no', tweets `of course not'!
JACK
It -- it was me! I had a family!
I had a sister!
His excitement suddenly turns to realization.
JACK
I saved her!
He looks up at the opening above. The MOON peeks out from
behind the clouds.
JACK
(whispers up to Manny)
That's why you chose me.
(TO HIMSELF)
I'm, I'm a Guardian.
The Moon seems to shine a little BRIGHTER. Baby Tooth tries
to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm of
Jack's hand.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 105.
JACK
We have to get out of here.
Jack looks down at the two halves of his staff, and picks
them up. He tries to fit them back together, but nothing
happens. He tries again, this time using every ounce of
strength left in him. Baby Tooth watches, her eyes widening
as, a SPARK of blue light shoots off the staff.
Jack continues to push, until a the icy blue light spreads
and melds the two ends of the staff back together. Jack
smiles.
Suddenly Jack, with Baby Tooth tucked safely in his tunic,
SHOOTS UP out of the fissure, high into the sky and through
the clouds.
JACK
Come on Baby Tooth! I owe you one.

NORTH (O.S.)
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
NORTH AND TOOTH arrive on the sleigh completely out of
control, and crash land outside Jamie's house.
The reindeer are separated from the sleigh and run into the
woods. A disheveled Tooth and North emerge from the
wreckage.
NORTH
Ah, moi deti! Come back!
As North stands, his back suddenly gives out.
TOOTH
North! Are you okay?
NORTH
Is official. My powers are kaput.
TOOTH
Look!
(GASP)
Jack!
Jack comes flying toward them.
TOOTH

Jack--!
Tooth falters and falls to the ground.
JACK
You okay?
They greet each other with a smile as North draws near.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 112.
NORTH
What are you doing here?
JACK
Same as you.
Jack looks off to the side as Jamie appears from out of his
backyard.
NORTH
The last light!
JAMIE
(to North and Tooth)
Wow! It is you! I mean it is you!
I knew it wasn't a dream.
NORTH
Jack! He sees you!
Jack puts a protective hand on Jamie's shoulder. Jamie looks
up at him and smiles. Jack and North exchange a look.
JACK
Wait, but, where's Bunny?
NORTH
Losing Easter took its toll on all
of us. Bunny most of all.
Jack's face goes pale. North lowers his head in sadness.
Then a twitchy-nosed LITTLE BUNNY appears on the sleigh.
JACK
Oh...no...
JAMIE
(CHUCKLES)
That's the Easter Bunny?
BUNNYMUND
Now somebody sees me! I mean,
where were you about an hour ago,
mate?
JAMIE
What happened to him? He used to be
huge and cool! And now he's cute.
Jamie gently tickles Bunny under his chin. Bunny begins
involuntarily thumping his paw.
BUNNYMUND
Oh, that's good.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 113.
Bunny catches himself and pushes Jamie's hands away.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
(TO JACK)
Did you tell him to say that?
(hops over to Jack)
That's it! Let's go! Me and you!
Come on!
JAMIE
No! Actually he told me you were
real. Just when I started to think
that maybe you weren't.
Bunny stops. Did he just hear that right?
BUNNYMUND
He made you believe? In me?
A moment of reconciliation between them, broken by the sounds
of THUNDER. The Guardians look to the sky to see Pitch
enveloped by dark clouds as he stares down at them from atop
a writhing mass of Nightmare sand.
JACK
(to the others)
Get Jamie out of here.
NORTH
Be careful, Jack!
Jack leaps into the air, and goes flying directly at Pitch.
Meanwhile, the Guardians take Jamie to find shelter.
ON PITCH
His eyes flash with anger at see Jack coming toward him.
PITCH
Jack Frost! Let's end this, shall
we?
Pitch sighs as he rolls his eyes and flies down to meet Jack
head on.
Jack sends a blast of ice and frost at Pitch as he barrels
toward him. Pitch easily absorbs the attack with his
Nightmare sand.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 114.
PITCH
That little trick doesn't work on
me anymore.
Jack's plan backfires as Pitch charges ahead and unleashes a
roaring fury of Nightmare sand that knocks Jack out of the
sky.
Jamie and the Guardians do their best to avoid the patrolling
Nightmares. North struggles to keep up.
BUNNYMUND
Quick, this way this way!
Bunny leads them down an alley, but it's no use.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
Dead end. Other way other way!
Jack suddenly falls from the sky, lands on a dumpster, and
falls limp to the ground. THUD! The others turn their
attention and wince.
JAMIE
Jack!
They rush to Jack and help him to his feet.
NORTH
That was good try, Jack! A for
effort!
JACK
(groaning in pain)
He's stronger. I can't beat him.
North and Tooth trade looks of concern. Then, a menacing
chuckle. The Guardians keep a watchful eye as Nightmare
shadow streaks across the alley.
PITCH (V.O.)
All this fuss over one little boy.
And still he refuses to stop
believing.
A CRACK of Thunder reveals the shadow of an approaching
Nightmare as the sounds of hooves clacking against the ground
echoes from the opposite end of the alley.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 115.
PITCH
Very well. There are other ways to
snuff out a light.
Bulbs start bursting as the arm of a shadow moves across the
remaining lights in the alley. Terror in Jamie's eyes. What
does that mean?
BUNNYMUND
If you want him, you're gonna have
to go through me!
With a finger raised, the shadow arm glides along the floor,
curling around the back of Bunny.
PITCH
(laughing, genuinely)
Look how fluffy you are! Would you
like a scratch behind the ears?
Bunny jumps back into North's arms.
BUNNYMUND
Don't you even think about it!
Pitch comes into view, riding atop Onyx. A gleeful smile
strewn across his face.
PITCH
I can't tell you how happy it makes
me to see you all like this. You
look awful.
They are weak and defenseless. But still the Guardians
gather around Jamie, to shield him from whatever may come.
JAMIE
Jack, I'm scared.
There's a sudden moment of realization. Jack has heard these
words before.
JACK'S SISTER (V.O.)
Jack, I'm scared.

We pan up from the ice to find his sister as he saw her in
his memory. She is smiling.

That's it. That's my center.
Jamie gives Jack a questioning look. What does Jack have in
mind? Pitch gets closer.
PITCH
So what do you think, Jamie? Do
you believe in the Boogiema...
BOOF! A snowball suddenly hits Pitch in the face. Two
Nightmares look at each, unsure how to react. Jamie can't
help but snicker and North lets out a chuckle.
Jack looks around the alley. He spots a wooden crate, a
trash can lid and a discarded wok amidst a pile of trash.
JACK
Now let's go get your friends.
Pitch wipes the snow from his face and looks up to see a
track of ice leading out of the alleyway. Jack, Jamie and
the Guardians are gone.
SMASH CUT TO:
An aerial view of Burgess. The streets are empty and the
city is quiet. Suddenly a streak of blue begins to
materialize, making its way through the tranquil suburb.
A man walks his dog across an empty street when suddenly a
cold wind blows behind him. Jack and Jamie come flying past,
leaving a trail of ice in their wake. And on that ice - the
Guardians careen along in make-shift sleds. They are scared
and thrilled, but they're having fun.

JACK
Yeah! Come on!
JAMIE
Whoa! Cool!
Pippa sits in bed amazed as it snows in her room. She hears
a KNOCK at her window and moves toward it to find Jamie
floating outside.
She throws open her window and looks down to the ground to
reveal that they are two stories up.
PIPPA
Jamie, how are you doing that?!
JAMIE
Jack Frost! Come on, we need your
help!
Jamie takes off flying down the street, and as a snowflake
lands on her nose she suddenly sees him.
PIPPA
Hey is, is that?
MONTY (O.S.)
Jack Frost!
Pippa looks up to see Monty across the street with his head
out the window and snow coming down in his room, a gaping
smile across his face.
Caleb and Claude sit up in bed in amazement, staring at the
snowflakes as they stream down from the ceiling.

Huh?!

Merry Christmas!
The twins open their window, amazed to see their heroes sled
past.
BUNNYMUND
Happy Easter!

Don't forget to floss!
Caleb looks to his brother, dumbfounded. Suddenly Cupcake
skids past, laughing and screaming on her own sled.

Cupcake?
And so it goes through the town.

SEQ. 2900 - SHOWDOWN
Jack, the Guardians, and the children all come to gliding
halt on their sleds. They look up to see Pitch standing atop
a building with a confident smile, while the clouds stir
behind him.
Monty, late to the party, comes running joyously past Jamie
and the Guardians who stand in silence as they stare up at
the sky.
MONTY
Whoa, yeaaaaaaaah!!!
(sees Pitch, makes U-Turn)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
PITCH
You think a few children can help
you? Against this!
The Nightmare sand storm descends from the sky. North draws
his sword, but the weight of the blade pulls him down. He
can barely stand. Jack moves to North's side as they look
back to Jamie, noticing the concern on his face.
JACK
They're just bad dreams, Jamie.
BUNNYMUND
And we'll protect you, mate.
PITCH
Aww, you'll protect them.
(SMILES)
But who will protect you?
Jamie takes a moment to reflect while his friends look up at
the sky in fear. Jack looks down, surprised, to see that
Jamie has taken a position in FRONT of him.
JAMIE
I will.
Suddenly, Jamie's friends move to join him.
CUPCAKE
I will.
CALEB AND CLAUDE
I will.

PIPPA

MONTY

The Guardians, amazed, watch as the kids squeeze past them.
PITCH
Still think there's no such thing
as the boogeyman?
Pitch's wave of Nightmare sand snakes its way through town
causing destruction wherever it goes and converges toward a
single point as it heads straight toward the kids.
JAMIE
I do believe in you. I'm just not
afraid of you.
Jamie thrusts out his hand toward the Nightmare wave. His
friends follow suite, just as the Nightmare sand smashes into
them. As it makes contact, the black sand...bursts into
streams of GOLDEN DREAMSAND.
KIDS
(WALLA)
Whoa...whoaaaa!
Everyone is amazed, hardly believing their eyes. Streams of
Dreamsand swirl around the children. And then it's
pandemonium. The Nightmares buck and jump as the sand makes
its way past them.
ON PITCH
He watches, aghast, as his precious Nightmares transform back
into golden Dreamsand and makes its way across town.
Tooth, amazed, watches as her wings suddenly flutter with a
resurgence of strength and energy. She takes off and flies
past the kids who cheer her on.
CUPCAKE

Yeah, Tooth Fairy! Whooaaa!
North's eyes widen. He straightens his back and unsheathes
his scimitars.

The petite rabbit looks at himself, waiting to be
transformed.
BUNNYMUND
Oh yeah, come on, come on!
When suddenly he's pursued by a snarling Nightmare.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
Oh, crikey!
Bunny takes off running.

North throws two snowglobes down to the ground, through which
an army of yetis and elves emerge.
CALEB AND CLAUDE
No way!
ON BUNNY
Bunny tries to scurry under a parked car in order to evade
the attacking Nightmare, but he is snatched by his tail
before he can get away.
BUNNYMUND
I'm just a bunny!
Suddenly, Bunny transforms back to his normal size and whips
out his boomerangs while being held upside down.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 122.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
G'day, mate!
Bunny kicks the Nightmare, flips into the air, and throws his
boomerangs which slice through two more Nightmares, turning
them to dust.
Bunny drums his feet on the ground and an army of sentinel
eggs suddenly rise up out of the earth. Caleb finds himself
riding on top of one as they join the yetis and elves in
battle.
CALEB
(WALLA)
Whoa!
BUNNYMUND
(WALLA)
Come on! Wooooohoooo!
Elves riding toy ducks and planes come flying in overhead
like bombardiers, turning Nightmares into puffs of black sand
as they fly through them.
The kids look to see a Nightmare charging toward them, only
to stop in it's tracks once the kids turn to face it.

Aaaaaahhhhhh!
The kids, accompanied by two elves in a bike and side car,
charge an incoming Nightmare. The elf behind the wheel
lunges toward it, biting at its haunches.

Nightmares, disabling a few of them.

Pitch begins to charge and responds with an attack of his
own. Jack jumps to an adjacent roof and lets out another
blast of ice.

Bunny taps his foot on the ground and creates a rabbit hole
for North and himself to travel through.
CUT TO:
Jack runs into Pitch as he rounds the corner of a chimney.
Pitch let's a Nightmare arrow fly, which is suddenly
deflected by Tooth as she flies through the area and takes
out a few Nightmares of her own.
JACK
Thanks, Tooth!
Suddenly, Bunny comes flying out of a nearby chimney, drawing
his boomerang as he lands.

Ho, ho, HO!

The Nightmares surrounding Pitch explode into dust as the
boomerang tears through them.

North shoots out of a bunny hole, his scimitars at the ready,
only to have landed on a roof some distance from the
Guardians.
NORTH
Hyah!

Wrong roof.
CUT TO:
Pitch tries to escape the attacking Guardians and slips into
a nearby shadow, emerging through the side of the building.
North jumps off the roof to greet him mid-air with his
scmitars.
CUT TO:
Pitch is knocked to the ground. As he gets to his feet he
forms a scythe with his Nightmare sand and begins crossing
swords with North.
In an instant Pitch finds himself surrounded by the
Guardians. Each of them take their turn to deal Pitch a few
humiliating blows.
Jamie looks over Caleb's shoulder as a wisp of Dreamsand
leaves his palms and rises into the air.

sand.

The Guardians advance toward Pitch.
JACK
It's over Pitch! There's no place
to hide.
Pitch give them a wry smile and quickly descends into the
shadows, casting multiple versions of himself along the alley
walls.
Suddenly, in their moment of distraction, Pitch rises up
behind Jack, his Nightmare sand AXE in hand.
BUNNYMUND
Jack, look out!
The other Guardians look on in horror as--
A golden whip wraps itself round Pitch's hands. We follow
the whip to reveal Sandy, coalescing from the funnel cloud of
Dreamsand. He gives Pitch a look, wags his finger, and then
uppercuts him into the air.
KIDS (O.S.)
(WALLA)
Whoa! The Sandman!
Sandy looks off to the side to where Jamie and his friends
have gathered. He forms a Dreamsand hat and tips the cap to
Jamie. Jamie, gleeful, waves back to Sandy as his friends
stand behind him in awe.
KIDS

Man, this is so cool! Yeah,
alright! Wahoo! Wow!
Sandy then looks to his whip and tugs on it, slamming Pitch
into the ground and knocking him out. The Guardians cheer as
they welcome Sandy's return.

A Nightmare comes barreling towards Cupcake. It screeches to
a halt, inches from the girl's face. She gently taps the
creature on the nose and turns into a Dreamsand Unicorn.

A gigantic Dreamsand dinosaur foot comes down revealing a
Dreamsand brontosaurus. As Dreamsand creatures fill the
streets, the Guardians and children rejoice.
MONTY

Yeah!
Jamie stands in awe of a school of beautiful Dreamsand fish
as they float by. Suddenly, he's hit in the head with a
snowball. He turns to look and sees Jack, smiling. Jamie
picks up a snowball and throws it at his friends. Almost
instantaneously, a snowball fight ensures.
CLAUDE
(WALLA)
Oh yeah? Bring it on!
Sandy salutes Jack and North, who are standing off to the
side while the snowball fight escalates.
NORTH
Your center?
JACK
It took awhile, but I figured it
out.
North tosses Jack a small item. Jack catches it and looks to
his open palm, it's a Russian nesting doll in the image of
Jack, similar to those found in North's workshop. Jack
smiles and North gives him a wink in return.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 128.
BOOF! North is suddenly hit by a snowball and turns. He
sees Claude, Caleb, and an elf; they immediately point
fingers at each other.
CALEB AND CLAUDE
Ooohhh.
A beat, until North bursts out in laughter.
NORTH
(LAUGHING)
You're all on naughty list.

Bunny, think fast!
He throws a snowball, which hits Bunny smack in the face.
Pitch groans in pain, and rises up to see the town crawling
with Dreamsand creatures, snowballs flying and yetis playing.
PITCH
(TO HIMSELF)
No.
He whips around to see the kids - having the time of their
lives - and no fear in their eyes. He rises up, his entire
body shaking with rage, and screams at them.
PITCH (CONT'D)
You dare have fun in my presence!
I am the Boogeyman! AND YOU WILL
FEAR ME!
He lunges at Jamie who come running toward him, Pitch's hands
outstretched as if he's going to grab him by the throat. But
Jamie runs right through him, laughing, joyous.
PITCH (CONT'D)
Noooo!
Pitch gasps, realizing that he no longer has any power over
the children. The devastation plays across his face.
PITCH (CONT'D)
(under his breathe)
No.
He sees the Guardians approach, standing side by side with
one another. Pitch turns and flees into the forest.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 129.
Pitch runs through the shadows in terror. He comes crashing
through the trees of the forest, and out onto the ice of the
pond. He looks over his shoulder to see if the Guardians are
on his tail, when BOOM! He runs smack into North's chest.
Pitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards. He looks up to
see North smiling down at him.
NORTH
Leaving the party so soon?
TOOTH
You didn't even say goodbye.
Tooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches. He looks
down. It's a quarter.
PITCH
A quarter?
BLAM. A fist punches him right in the jaw, and a single
tooth goes skittering across the ice. Tooth shakes out her
hand.
TOOTH
And that's for my fairies.
PITCH
(SCOWLS)
You can't get rid of me! Not
forever! There will always be
fear!
NORTH
So what? As long as one child
believes, we will be here to fight
fear!
PITCH
Really? Then what are they doing
here?
Hundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the
pond. It's terrifying, but the Guardians seem unphased.
NORTH
They can't be my Nightmares, I'm
not afraid.
JACK
Looks like it's your fear they
smell.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 130.
Suddenly, Pitch's eyes get huge with terror as the Nightmares
move in on him. He begins to back away, but the Nightmares
pick up speed as they charge toward him.
PITCH
Ahhh, no....AAAAAHHHHHH!!
He tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on
the ice. He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of
Nightmares. The streaks of black whip and latch themselves
onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest.
PITCH (CONT'D)
No, no, nooooooo!
Pitch struggles to escape, but the mass of black sand pulls
him deep into the forest, under the frame of the broken bed,
and back down into the dark depths of the underground. He
looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the
earth seals itself up.
CUT TO:
SEQ. 3200 - THE OATH
Pale and faint in the day, but oddly close and welcoming. It
can't be, but -- is that the barest hint of a FACE on the
Moon? Jack smiles as he looks up at it. He hears Tooth's
laugh and turns to find North, Tooth, Bunny and Sandy, their
faces shining with pride.
Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug. She lifts him off
the ground as they embrace. They share a moment and she soon
recoils with giddy embarrassment as Baby Tooth interjects.
Jack acknowledges Baby Tooth and gently pats her on the side
of her face as North steps forward.
NORTH
Are you ready now, Jack?
(BEAT)
To make it official.
Jack looks over, a stern elf is hitting a horn against his
palm. A Yeti hands North the book we saw when Jack and the
Guardians first met. Sandy and Bunny share a boastful look.
NORTH (CONT'D)
Then is time you take Oath.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 131.
North opens the book, flips through several pages, and takes
a moment before he speaks.
NORTH (CONT'D)
(TO JACK)
"Will you, Jack Frost...vow to
watch over the children of the
world?
Jamie and his friends along with a crowd of yetis, elves, and
eggs all make their way across the pond to the rest of the
group. As they approach we see settle on Jamie, who stands
at the center of the group.
NORTH (CONT'D)
To guard them with your life -
their hopes, their wishes, and
their dreams? For they are all
that we have, all that we are and
all that we will ever be."
Jack takes a second to look back at Jamie, then back to
North.
JACK
I will.

Then congratulations, Jack Frost -

Jamie and the kids erupt in a CHEER, as do the Yetis and

(WALLA)
That's my boy! Woo!
KIDS
(WALLA)
Alright Jack. Yeah! Awesome!
Imitating North, an elf picks up the elf standing next to him
and gives him a big kiss. After an awkward pause, the
affectionate elf is punched in the face.
Jack looks to see several fairies hovering nearby, forming
the shape of a heart. One of the swooning fairies faints and
falls to the ground.
TOOTH
Keep it together, girls.
KIDS
(WALLA)

Jack! Yay! Yeah! You earned it!

(WALLA)
You guys, look!
MONTY
(WALLA)
That's Santa's sleigh.
The group looks up to the sky as North's sleigh comes in for
a landing. The tie-dyed elf rescues a lone egg from the skis
of the sleigh as it glides across the icy pond.
KIDS
(WALLA)
Wow, it's real. That is wicked!
Whoa, that was awesome! Ohh...can
you believe this? Whoa, did you
guys see that? That's awesome!
Wow! Whoa!

BUNNYMUND
(to North, wryly)
Everyone loves the sleigh.
KIDS
(WALLA)
Wow! Look at that! So totally
insane!
North turns away from Bunny and puts his hand on Jack's
shoulder.
NORTH
Time to go.
As the kids look on in wonder, Sandy throws up his hands
creating a shower of Dreamsand, which drifts down on the
children.
KIDS
(WALLA)
Whoa! It's beautiful. Wow, that
was awesome!
Meanwhile, Bunny hands an egg to Sophie who giggles and pats
the brim of his nose.
BUNNYMUND
Happy Easter ya little anklebiter.
I'm gonna miss yah.
SOPHIE
Bye, bye, bunny.
Jamie realizes what's about to happen.
JAMIE
You're leaving? But, what if Pitch
comes back?
Jack looks back at Jamie, who seems wistful and worried.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
What if we stop believing again?
If I can't see you --
Jack kneels down to look Jamie in the eye.
JACK
Hey, hey, slow down, slow down.
You telling me you stop believing
in the moon when the sun comes up?

JAMIE
(considers, then)
No.
JACK
Okay, well do you stop believing in
the sun when clouds block it out?
JAMIE
(SMILES)
No.
JACK
We'll always be there, Jamie. And
now...we'll always be here.
(points to Jamie's heart)
Which kind of makes you a Guardian
too.
Jamie smiles. Jack stands up and heads toward the sleigh.
Jamie's friends stand off to the side rubbing their eyes as
they become drowsy.
KIDS
(WALLA)
I can't keep my eyes open. I think
I gotta go home. Let's go home.
What time is it? I'm sleepy.
JAMIE
Jack!
Jamie runs over and wraps his arms around Jack. For a
moment, Jack's astonished and then gives Jamie a warm
embrace. Jack stands up and gets in the sleigh with the rest
of the Guardians.
NORTH
Hyah!
Jack and the Guardians look toward the kids as the sleigh
takes off. Jamie RUNS behind the sleigh, following Jack. In
spite of it all, he doesn't want to let go. The sleigh takes
off into the sky. Jamie stops unable to follow.
KIDS

IN SLEIGH
JACK (V.O.)
My name is Jack Frost. And I'm a
Guardian. How do I know that?
Because the moon told me so. And
when the moon tells you something,
believe it.
Jack moves to the back of the sleigh as the Guardians pat him
