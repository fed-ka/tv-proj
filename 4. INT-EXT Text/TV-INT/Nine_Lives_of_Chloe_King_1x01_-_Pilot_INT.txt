      Chloe sprints up the winding stairs.



      Chloe, our until now pleasantly average, rule-following 
      teenager, stretches luxuriously in the rectangle of sun lying 
      across her bed. She wakes up slowly, eyes still closed, a 
      half-smile on her face. Life is good.



      MEREDITH KING, Chloe s mom, attractive, harried, professional 
      and remarkably young at heart hurries past, buttoning her 
      blouse. She only breaks stride to BANG on Chloe s door. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe! Get up! I swear to God I am 
                    not driving you to school today.



      But no response from Chloe as she pulls up first one leg and 
      then the other, clearly in no rush.

      Suddenly, Chloe s phone BUZZES and she reads the text. 
      Instantly, she flips out of bed and is on the move.



      Meredith is at the counter, reading the paper, when she 
      glances at the clock. She takes a calming breath and--

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe King! If you re not down here 
                    in five-    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               4.              


      But Chloe is already charging down the stairs putting her 
      hair back in a clip.

                                  CHLOE
                    Calm down, crazy lady. You re gonna 
                    pop something you might need.

      She grabs her mother s toast as she heads for the door.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry. No time. I have a super mean 
                    mom who won t drive me to school.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe!

                                  CHLOE
                    What?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Sit.

      Chloe plunks down at the counter and bites off a hunk of 
      toast. Meredith sips her coffee. Finally.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    So--?

                                  CHLOE
                          (resigned)
                    Fine. I got a B on my English test. 
                    It turns out that isolation is not 
                    a central theme of Grapes of Wrath. 
                    That slutty girl who everyone 
                    thought was going to get pregnant - 
                    she s pregnant. And, no, at no 
                    point did any even remotely cute 
                    boy look my way and say I want some 
                    of that. So - uh, pretty much all 
                    is right with the world.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Was that so hard?
                          (off Chloe s look)
                    Go.

      Chloe bolts, but she only get two steps before...

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Chloe.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               5.              


      Chloe lets out the biggest SIGH.  Now what?

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Your backpack.

                                  CHLOE
                          (kissing her good-bye)
                    See? This is why they put you in 
                    charge. Text me.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I love you, too.

                                  CHLOE
                    Implied!

      The front door BANGS closed. Meredith just smiles. 



      Chloe s best friend AMY, 16, is behind the wheel. Amy, hidden 
      inside a poofy, fake-fur coat, is a vintage queen leaning 
      toward Goth, but a certain amount of innate wholesomeness 
      always manages to creep through.

                                  CHLOE
                    Go! I promised my mom I wouldn t 
                    drive with you anymore.

      Amy tries to peel out but stalls the car instead.

                                  AMY
                    You can t yell at me like that and 
                    expect me to perform. You know how 
                    I am with pressure.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry.

      They drive off, still lurching a little along the way.

                                  AMY
                    And that last ticket was so not my 
                    fault.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               6.              



      Amy, never taking her eyes off the road, hands Chloe a latte.

                                  AMY
                    Don t spill.
                          (beat)
                    Okay, so here s the plan. After 
                    school I have band, but as soon as 
                    we re done murdering  Poker Face , 
                    I ll pick up Paul, he s ditching 
                    Chinese again, and we ll meet you 
                    at the park.

                                  CHLOE
                          (smiling)
                    I was afraid we weren t going to do 
                    anything.

                                  AMY
                    Please. This is how we always kick-
                    off birthday week.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yup. This is what we always do.

                                  AMY
                          (off light)
                    Aah. Yellow. Go. Stop. No...

      Finally, she slams on the breaks. They screech to a stop 
      halfway into the crosswalk. Amy shoots the annoyed 
      pedestrians a what s-your-problem look. After a beat.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    Don t you wanna go?

                                  CHLOE
                    No. I do. It s... I don t know.

                                  AMY
                    Are you okay?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah. I just woke up feeling kinda 
                    weird.  It ll be fun.

      A car behind them HONKS and they start up again.



      They make their way through the crowded, throbbing space and 
      find room at the end of the bar. Amy is super uncomfortable, 
      but Paul can barely contain his smile. He nods and WINKS at 
      two MODELS - they immediately move away.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               10.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Don t do that. Be cool.

      Just then a good-looking, young guy, XAVIER, slides up next 
      to Chloe and checks her out. She shoots her friends a look. 
      See? This is how it s done.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hi.

                                  XAVIER
                    Hey.
                          (beat)
                    Don t take this the wrong way, but 
                    you look kinda young.

                                  CHLOE
                    I m over eighteen.

                                  XAVIER
                    Good to know. But you have to be 
                    over twenty-one.

                                  CHLOE
                          (not cool)
                    Please don t tell anyone.

                                  XAVIER
                    It s okay. I m using my brother s 
                    ID.

      Chloe smiles, relieved, then...

                                  CHLOE
                    Dance with me!

      She doesn t really give him a chance to respond as she pulls 
      him onto the dance floor.

      DANCE FLOOR - LATER

      Chloe and Xavier are burning up the place - actually, Xavier 
      is just doing his best to keep up. Chloe is sexy and free and 
      loving every minute of it.  Who is this girl?



      Chloe is next to her locker, anxiously scanning the CROWDED 
      hallway when she spots a poofy fur coat make a hasty U-turn.

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy!

      Amy doesn t slow down. Chloe catches up and cuts her off. Amy 
      side-steps and keeps on walking as Chloe follows.

                                  AMY
                          (super uncomfortable)
                    Oh, hey, Chloe. 

                                  CHLOE
                    I can t believe that you just left 
                    me there. But you re forgiven - I 
                    ended up having like the greatest 
                    night of my entire life.

      Amy stops.

                                  AMY
                    Why? Because we left?

                                  CHLOE
                    No. Because of him.

      She shows Amy the picture of Xavier on her phone.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    His name s Xavier. And he kissed 
                    me. We kissed each other. Yesterday 
                    I said I wanted it to happen and it 
                    did. Actually, I made it happen 
                    which is kind of even cooler.

                                  AMY
                    Ohmigod, Chloe, I can t believe--
                          (then, looking off)
                    Look perky.  From Russia With Love  
                    at ten o clock.

      Chloe glances back and sees ALEK PETROV, 17, tall and 
      impossibly good-looking, coming down the hall with his POSSE, 
      bouncing a BASKETBALL off of the walls. BAM. BAM.

                                  CHLOE
                    That is your crazy obsession, not 
                    mine.
                                  (MORE)  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               14.              

                                  CHLOE (CONT'D)
                          (back to her story)
                    I still can t believe I actually 
                    did it. You would have been so 
                    proud of me. I just walked straight 
                    up to him--

      BAM. Alek s basketball hits the wall above Chloe s head.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    I don t even know if I m ever going 
                    to talk to him again, but--

      BAM. It hits the locker next to her. Chloe s had it. BAM--

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Jockoff.

      Chloe grabs the ball--

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Do you mind? People are trying to 
                    have a conversation. Go play  Look 
                    At Me  somewhere else.

      -- and rifles it down the hall where it bounces off a wall 
      and SWOOSHES straight into a TRASH CAN. Everyone turns to 
      look at her.

                                  AMY
                    You did not just do that.

      Chloe looks as shocked as everyone else.

                                  CHLOE
                    I think I did. Let s go.

      She grabs her friends arm and they self-consciously hurry 
      off. Alek watches Chloe disappear up the stairs. We re not 
      quite sure what his look is about.



      Chloe is sitting near the back. She s TAPPING her pencil as 
      she stares out the window, clearly her mind is elsewhere.

      Her cellphone vibrates. It simply says  157 . But before 
      Chloe can even react--

                                    TEACHER
                    Miss King? The answer, please.

                                  CHLOE
                    Ah, 157.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               15.              


      The TEACHER, slightly annoyed, turns back to the board as 
      Chloe scans the room. Alek looks back at her from the front 
      row and holds up his cellphone.



      Chloe is at her locker when Alek comes up - his bad-boy smile 
      and charming ACCENT make him a hard guy not to like.

                                  ALEK
                    You re welcome.

                                  CHLOE
                    Thanks. I owe you.

                                  ALEK
                    I look forward to collecting.

      He steps into her personal space. Chloe instinctively backs 
      up, but the locker is behind her.

                                  CHLOE
                    Um, you haven t spoken to me in two 
                    years.  Let s go back to that.

                                  ALEK
                    You smell very good.

                                  CHLOE
                    Okay, crazy non sequitur man, it s 
                    called bathing. Try it.

                                  ALEK
                          (amused)
                    Why do you give me such a hard 
                    time, Chloe King?

                                  CHLOE
                    Believe me, if I knew it was going 
                    to have this kind of affect, I 
                    never would have touched your ball.
                          (quickly)
                    Don t say it.

                                  ALEK
                    Something tells me we re going to 
                    be very good friends.

      He starts to lean in. Holy crap - is he really going to kiss 
      her? Chloe seems frozen when suddenly--

                                    JASMINE (O.S.)
                    Alek!  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               16.              


        A beautiful, but not very happy girl, JASMINE, 16, calls out 
      from the end of the hall. She and Alek exchange a look. After 
      a beat, Alek turns back to Chloe and shrugs.

                                  CHLOE
                    Well, uh, nice chattin . Lets try 
                    and never do that again.

      Chloe walks off as Alek and Jasmine exchange another look.



      Chloe is looking in a mirror while she holds up a fairly sexy 
      black top. Her slightly bitchy, co-worker LANA, 19, looks up 
      from the magazine she s reading behind the register.

                                  LANA
                      Yesterday, when somebody decided to 
                    take off early and left me to do 
                    all the restocking.

                                  CHLOE
                    Which is why it still hasn t been 
                    done.
                          (re: top)
                    I m going to put this on hold.

                                  LANA
                    For you?
                          (off Chloe s look)
                    I m just sayin  that s not exactly 
                    the kind of top that likes to sit 
                    home by itself on Saturday night.

      Chloe looks in the mirror again. Maybe it isn t her. After a 
      beat...

                                  CHLOE
                    Oh, turn it up. I love that song.

      LANA looks down at her ipod with its earbuds attached, lying 
      on the counter. There seems to be no sound coming out.

                                  LANA
                    You can hear that?  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               17.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Sure. Can t you?

      Lana looks at her suspiciously, but the JINGLE of the front 
      door changes the subject. A handsome guy in a motorcycle 
      jacket has come in and is going through the racks. Chloe and 
      Lana exchange looks - Chloe, gives her a  watch this  and 
      heads across the store.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hi.

      The guy turns around. He s BRIAN, 18, a tall, sweet, good-
      looking guy with kind eyes. Chloe wasn t totally prepared for 
      how cute he was going to be.

                                  BRIAN
                    Hi.

      Suddenly MUSIC comes on a little too loud, then Lana quickly 
      turns it down.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    I love that song.

                                  CHLOE
                    I just said that--

      But she knocks over a coat rack. CRASH. Oops. Once again so 
      much for being smooth. He quickly helps her pick it up. 
      Finally, she takes a deep breath and...

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Can I help you with something?

                                  BRIAN
                    Just an opinion.

      He puts on a funky, knit cap that has little cat ears on it.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Ironic or just lame?

                                  CHLOE
                    Little bit of both? But it works 
                    with the jacket. You a cat person?

                                  BRIAN
                    Nah - I ve just got cold ears. I ll 
                    take it.

      He follows Chloe to the counter. Chloe smiles at Brian again. 
      She likes this guy.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               18.              


                                  CHLOE
                    So, you in college?

      But when he doesn t answer right away...

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    I m just asking because we get a 
                    lot of people from the university. 
                    We ran this ad - and you never 
                    really know if it s working or not 
                    because--

                                  LANA
                          (to Chloe, sotto)
                    Stop talking.

                                  CHLOE
                    Twelve dollars.

                                  BRIAN
                    Back east. I m taking a semester 
                    off to help out with some family 
                    stuff.
                          (then, re: hat)
                    I kinda packed in a hurry. 

                                  CHLOE
                    I m Chloe.

                                  BRIAN
                    Brian.

                                  CHLOE
                    Every afternoon from three to six - 
                    in case there s anything else you 
                    forgot to pack.

                                  BRIAN
                    Then maybe I ll see you around.
                          (beat)
                    Sometime between three and six.

      One more furtive look and Brian heads out.

                                  LANA
                    I don t know what you did with 
                    Chloe, but when you see her - tell 
                    her she needs to tag the sale rack.

      Chloe looks in the mirror again. She takes the top and puts 
      it behind the counter. She kind of likes this new her.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               19.              



      Amy, chopsticks stopped in mid-air, is staring across the 
      table at Chloe who is shoveling it in.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               20.              


                                  AMY
                    Wait. What? So suddenly you have 
                    like these super powers?

                                  CHLOE
                    Jumping over a dumpster doesn t 
                    really qualify as a super power. 
                    But it s kinda weird, right? It s 
                    like this burst of energy and I 
                    knew I could do it. Oh - and I can 
                    hear things.

                                  AMY
                    Like little men in your head 
                    things?

                                  CHLOE
                    No.
                          (listening, then)
                    Ew, I think they just spit in that 
                    guys food.

      She turns around and a WAITER is setting food in front of a 
      very UNPLEASANT CUSTOMER. Several cooks are watching from the 
      kitchen, whispering. Amy pushes her food away.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    It s like my non-wish birthday wish 
                    came true. It s hard to explain. I 
                    just feel so different.

                                  AMY
                    What did you have for breakfast?

                                  CHLOE
                    Spinach. This isn t a fortified 
                    breakfast cereal thing.

                                  AMY
                    Hormonal?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, no, that s a whole different 
                    kind of crazy.

                                  AMY
                    Obviously there has to be some kind 
                    of explanation. You know, other 
                    than... you re a freak.

                                  CHLOE
                    And you re worthless. I wish Paul 
                    would ve shown. The Comic Book King 
                    would be so into this.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               21.              


                                  AMY
                    I told him not to come.

                                  CHLOE
                    Why?

      After a beat.

                                  AMY
                    Paul and I made out!

                                  CHLOE
                    What?! When?

                                  AMY
                    Last night. At first it was just 
                    kind of a oh-here-we-are-on-the- 
                          dance-floor-what-are-we-gonna-do- 
                    now kind of thing, but then... not 
                    so much.

                                  CHLOE
                    You and Paul?

                                  AMY
                    I know. But don t worry, you re so 
                    not going to be a third wheel.

                                  CHLOE
                    Wait. You just kissed and now 
                    you re a couple? I ve talked to you 
                    everyday, all day, since we were 
                    like two and never once have you 
                    said that you had a thing for Paul. 

                                  AMY
                    I kind of didn t know until it 
                    happened. Are you jealous?

                                  CHLOE
                    Of you and Paul? Uh, no.

                                  AMY
                    You don t have to be mean.

                                  CHLOE
                    I m not being mean. I m being 
                      surprised.

                                  AMY
                    I thought you d be happy for us.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               22.              


                                  CHLOE
                    I am. 
                          (beat)
                    Was he any good?

                                  AMY
                      Surprisingly yes. At first it was a 
                    little awkward but then when we 
                    kinda got into it--

                                  CHLOE
                    Okay, no. I can accept it, I just 
                    can t hear about it.
                          (looking off)
                    Holy crap. There s Alek s 
                      girlfriend.

      Jasmine is coming in the front door.

                                  AMY
                    Ew. Creepy. No. That s Jasmine. 
                    They re cousins. She s in my AP 
                    History Class.

      Amy gives her a little wave.

                    And why do you even care?

                                  CHLOE
                     Cause he kinda tried to kiss me.

                                  AMY
                    Chloe! Did you let him?

                                  CHLOE
                    So no. But I did just shamelessly 
                    throw myself at the guy with the 
                    world s most beautiful eyes.

                                  AMY
                    Did he throw back?

                                  CHLOE
                          (can t believe it)
                    Yeah, I think he kinda did.

                    Ohmigod, Chloe. Who are you?

      Chloe just laughs and shrugs.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               23.              



      Meredith is aggressively searching through the kitchen 
      drawers as Chloe comes in and heads straight for the sink, 
      and washes her hands.

                    Yeah, some crazy, old homeless guy 
                    tried to grab me.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Honey, are you hurt? Should we call

                    The exacto knife. My Wine-Of-The 
                    Month club box just came and trust 
                    me - not a moment too soon.

      Chloe looks at the large, sealed cardboard box on the counter 
      and then at her hands.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    I swear I just used it. Well, a 
                    month ago anyway.

                                  CHLOE
                    Done.

      Meredith turns. The box is open.

                                  MEREDITH
                    How did you...?

      Chloe just kind of shrugs as her mom pulls out the wine.

                                  CHLOE
                    I ll be up in my--

                                  MEREDITH
                    Sit.

      Chloe reluctantly sits.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    But in honor of your birthday, lets 
                    skip the talk and just have cake.

      Meredith sets a CAKE on the counter between them.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Happy birthday.

                                  CHLOE
                    No singing.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m not the singer. That was your 
                    dad s--
                          (catching herself)
                    No singing.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               27.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Mom, it s okay. He left over ten 
                    years ago. I m good.

      Meredith cuts the cake and hands her daughter a piece.

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, in a not-snooping-not-judging 
                    way, I noticed you came in a little 
                    late last night. Did you and your 
                    posse--

                                  CHLOE
                    Don t say  posse .

                                  MEREDITH
                    ...rat pack, do anything special?

                                  CHLOE
                    Actually, yeah, we did. We went 
                      dancing... and I met a boy.
                          (quickly)
                    Do not squeal, cry or hug me!

      Meredith sits back down.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    And I met another one this 
                    afternoon at work. He was... nice.

      Chloe goes back to her cake.

                                  MEREDITH
                    That s it? That s all you re going 
                    to give me.

                                  CHLOE
                    That s kind of everything.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m sensing more to this story. And 
                    you don t seem very excited.

                                  CHLOE
                    I am. I just... I ve got a lot of 
                    stuff going on.

                                  MEREDITH
                    What do you have going on?

      Chloe looks down at her hands again. After a beat...

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Chloe?  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               28.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Do you know anything about my birth 
                    parents?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Jesus Christ, Chloe. You re not 
                    going to cut me a break are you?

                                  CHLOE
                    Relax. This isn t a door slammy, 
                        you re-not-my-real-mother moment. 
                    I m just curious. I swear.

      After a beat, Meredith pours some more wine.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You already know everything I know, 
                    which is pretty much nothing.

                                  CHLOE
                    But no papers? No records?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Things were chaotic. The Soviet 
                    Union had just fallen. The Ukraine 
                    was a new country.  Your dad was 
                    working over there when he saw you 
                    in an orphanage and fell in love.

                                  CHLOE
                    I know all this.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I thought he was going to bring me 
                    home some of those stupid nesting 
                    dolls - I got a two month old baby 
                    instead. God, I wanted those dolls.

                                  CHLOE
                    But how did he get me out of the 
                    country? It doesn t make sense.
                          (off her mother s look)
                    What?

                                  MEREDITH
                      I think... some money might have 
                    changed hands.

                                  CHLOE
                    He stole me?

                                  MEREDITH
                    No. He didn t have a choice. That s 
                    just how it was done.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               29.              


                                  CHLOE
                    But didn t dad--

                                  MEREDITH
                          (sharp)
                    No. Your father wasn t big on 
                      explaining himself. Even then.
                          (softening)
                    I m sorry. I wish I knew the 
                    answers, too.

                                  CHLOE
                          (sincere)
                    Thanks for the cake.

      She kisses her mom and heads up the stairs. Meredith looks 
      after her concerned. Or is there something she s not telling?



      Chloe is at her mirror. She checks out her eyes.  Her ears. 
      Nothing else has changed. What the hell is going on? She 
      doesn t even know what she is anymore.



      Chloe is absentmindedly staring out the window, while Amy 
      paws through a rack. Lana is behind the counter.

                                  AMY
                    What do you think? Paul loves 
                    vintage rock T s, but his mom 
                    refuses to let--

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy. Known him my whole life. Not 
                    new information.

      Amy looks at her friend for a moment.

                                  AMY
                    Okay, what is the matter with you? 
                    Did you take a header into a trash 
                    bin or are you just coming off of

                                  CHLOE
                    No. Don t worry. I can t fly. That 
                    would... just be weird.

                                  AMY
                    Did you even call Bank Boy like we 
                    planned?

                                  CHLOE
                    You planned.

                                  AMY
                          (off Lana)
                    Don t give me that look. She s 
                    helping me. I m going to buy 
                      something.

      Lana looks doubtful and heads to the back. After a beat...

                                  CHLOE
                    I just can t figure out what is 
                    going on with me. Nothing makes any 
                    sense. Yesterday I was so--
                          (then)
                    What are you doing?!

                                  AMY
                          (dialing Chloe s phone)
                    Calling Bank Boy.

                                  CHLOE
                    Stop!

                                  AMY
                    Aah. It s ringing. Here.

      Chloe reluctantly takes it and glares at her  friend. 

                                  CHLOE
                    Message.
                          (beat)
                    Hi. This is Chloe. We, uh, met at 
                    the Bank the other night. Call me.
                          (hanging up, to Amy)
                    Never do that again.



      CLOSE ON a CELLPHONE. Its red message light is FLASHING. 
        Inexplicably it s on the floor.

      PULL BACK to reveal that Xavier is half-naked, lying next to 
      it. Eyes wide open. Lips blue. He s DEAD.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               31.              



      Chloe sprints up the winding stairs.



      Our scarred assassin is flying down the stairs. Under his 
      coat he has a knife ready to unsheathe.

      He bangs out the front doors, but stops dead in his tracks. 
      There s a pool of blood on the ground, but Chloe s not there.



      They re in a booth at the back.  Jasmine hands Chloe a cup of 
      tea. Alek is sitting so he can watch the entrance.

                    I know you must have a million

                    Kinda just one. What the hell are

                    are Mai.

                                  CHLOE
                    Mai?

      There is a small AMULET of the Egyptian cat-goddess BASTET, 
      around Jasmine s neck.

                    We were warriors. Now we are forced

                                    JASMINE
                    He s being slightly dramatic - we 
                    lead pretty normal lives.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               37.              


                                  CHLOE
                    There are more of you? Us?

                                    JASMINE
                    Maybe a couple thousand in San 
                      Francisco. But there are other Mai 
                    prides around the world.

                                  CHLOE
                    This makes no sense.

                                  ALEK
                    You know what we say is true. Mai 
                    blood must run thick for you to 
                    transform so quickly.

                                    JASMINE
                    We didn t even know for sure you 
                    were one of us until yesterday.

      After a beat...

                                  CHLOE
                    Are there going to be more...

                                  ALEK
                    No. Just a tail.

      Jasmine hits Alek.

                                    JASMINE
                    Ignore him. I know it s difficult 
                    to accept - but this is who you 
                    are.

      Chloe is trying to process. But after a beat...

                          (playful)

                    almost had a heart attack.

      Chloe has no idea what they re talking about.

                                  ALEK
                    Mai and humans do not mix well.

                                    JASMINE
                    I guess you d call it a curse. We 
                    can t be...

                                  ALEK
                    Intimate.

                                    JASMINE
                    Thank you.  Even something as small 
                    as a kiss--

                                  CHLOE
                    What happens if we kiss?

                                  ALEK
                    Depends on the kiss. Paralysis. 
                    Death. Sometimes paralysis and 
                    death. But don t worry - not for 
                    the Mai, just the human.

                                    JASMINE
                    Alek. I swear--
                          (to Chloe)
                    Don t let him frighten you. You 
                    didn t kiss that guy. He s fine. We 
                    were watching.

      Chloe takes out her phone and opens it.

                                  CHLOE
                    It s not him I m worried about.



      Whitley gets in  the backseat and the door is closed. REVEAL 
      that our scar-faced ASSASSIN is sitting next to him. His name 
      is THE ROGUE. Whitley doesn t seem surprised.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    You re late.

                                    WHITLEY
                    I ve been working.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    I found the girl. She s who we ve 
                    been waiting for.
                          (beat)
                    What would you like me to do now?

                                    WHITLEY
                    What do you think I d like you to 
                    do?  Kill her as many times as you 
                    have to.



      Meredith is watching TV when Chloe bangs through and charges 
      straight up the stairs.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe, I thought we agreed--

      SLAM! Okay, then.



      The shower is running behind her. Chloe takes off her shirt 
      and looks at her back in the mirror.  It s completely covered 
      in black and purple BRUISES.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               42.              


                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                          (at the door)
                    Chloe? What s going on? Are you 
                    alright?


      BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Chloe is in the shower, the water runs off of her head.



      Chloe, dressed but hair still wet, is sitting on her bed, 
      knees pulled in tight, lost in thought. 

      Suddenly, she hears a LOUD RUMBLING and something charging 
      towards her door. What the hell--

                                  AMY
                    Chloe!

      Amy bursts into her room. She looks like she s been crying.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    You re home. I called you like a 
                    hundred bajillion times.

                                  CHLOE
                    It s okay. I m fine.  Really.

                                  AMY
                    Why wouldn t you be fine? Paul and 
                    I just broke up.

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy, I m sorry, but I just can t 
                    right now. 

                                  AMY
                    He was supposed to meet me at the 
                    Galaxy but didn t show. I bet his 
                    mom--

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy! No. I just can t deal with you 
                    right now.

                                  AMY
                    And what the hell do you have going 
                    on that s so important?

                                  CHLOE
                    How about this?!  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               43.              


      And Chloe pulls up her t-shirt, but she can see in the mirror 
      that nothing is there. The bruises are gone.

                                  AMY
                    Yeah, I get it.  You re a skinny 
                    bitch. What does that have to do 
                    with anything?

      After a beat...

                                  CHLOE
                          (completely sincere)
                    I think I died tonight.

                                  AMY
                    Oh, Chloe. Are you okay?

      She immediately puts her arm around her friend. But just then 
      Chloe s phone BUZZES.

                                  CHLOE
                    It s Paul. Should I answer?

      Amy nods.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                          (on phone)
                    Hey, Paul.

      But Paul doesn t sound so good.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                    Chloe? I ve got somebody here who 
                    wants to talk to you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Paul?



      The Rogue takes the phone away from Paul s ear.

                                  THE ROGUE 
                    Hello, Chloe. I believe you and I 
                    have some unfinished business.  

      REVEAL that Paul is strung up behind him in the corner of an 
      abandoned loft.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               44.              


                                        ACT FIVE



      Chloe zips up her leather jacket.

                                  CHLOE
                    You should probably keep the motor 
                    running.

                                  AMY
                    Chloe--

                                  CHLOE
                    It ll be okay. I m just really 
                    sorry for getting you mixed up in 
                    all this, but I ll make it right.

      Amy leans across and locks Chloe s door.

                                  AMY
                    There is no way I m letting you out 
                    of this car without you telling me 
                    what s going on.

                                  CHLOE
                    Remember when you warned me about 
                    bad guys?  I should have listened.
                          (beat)
                    If Paul and I aren t out of there 
                    in two minutes, call the police.

                                  AMY
                    You can t go in there alone. I 
                    don t mean I want to go with you - 
                    but you can t go in there alone.

                                  CHLOE
                    Trust me.  I ll be fine.

      And for the first time, Chloe flashes her CLAWS. SHLOOSH.

                                  AMY
                    Aaa--

      Amy stifles a YELP, covering her mouth with both hands.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               45.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Wish me luck.

      All Amy can do is nod.  Chloe gets out and runs toward the 
      building. Two seconds later - Amy s car dies.



      Paul is tied up, arms over his head, in a corner of this 
      large, unfinished loft space obviously undergoing renovation. 
      The Rogue is nowhere to be seen.

                                  PAUL
                    Uh, hello? I don t suppose you d 
                    consider tying my hands behind my 
                    back instead - I don t really have 
                    the upper body strength for this.

      CLANK. The ELEVATOR DOOR opens and Chloe steps out. She can t 
      see anyone.

                                  CHLOE
                    Paul?

                                  PAUL
                          (calling out)
                    Chloe. Get out of here. It s a 
                    trap.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, kinda figured that part out 
                    on my own.

      She starts to cautiously move across the room towards Paul.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Creepy-creep. You know who you 
                    are. I m just going to take my 
                    friend and go and I swear you ll 
                    never see me again. I don t know 
                    what s up with you and the Mai, but 
                    it really has nothing to do with me 
                    so--

      But Chloe hears the faintest SOUND behind her and quickly 
      steps back.

      WHOOSH! A ten-point NINJA STAR whizzes past and is imbedded 
      in the wall behind her. That was close.

      But another one SLICES her in the leg and she goes down.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               46.              


                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Aaah.

      The Rogue steps into view and pulls out a gleaming curved 
      knife. It s both ancient and deadly.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    I know you don t think this has 
                    anything to do with you, but you re 
                    wrong. It has everything to do with 
                    you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Who the hell are you?

                                  THE ROGUE
                    Your executioner. I ll try to be 
                    quick but with eight lives still to 
                    go - this could take a while.

      He advances towards. Chloe pulls herself up. She now looks 
      more pissed than frightened.

                                  CHLOE
                    News flash. Dying sucks. And I m so 
                    not doing that again.

      Suddenly, she LEAPS up at him - claws out. He wasn t 
      expecting this. He goes down and she tumbles over him.

      They re both instantly back up. He advances on Chloe, 
      swinging his knife as she tries to retreat, ducking under the 
        scaffolding.

      He lunges and Chloe rolls out of the way just in time, 
      slashing him in the leg.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Now we re even. Oh, wait, I still 
                    need to throw you off of a 
                    building.

      But completely enraged, he launches another attack. Chloe 
      barely steps out of the way in time.

      Paul sees Chloe with her claws for the first time.

                                  PAUL
                    Chloe?
                          (beat)
                    That is so cool.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               47.              



      Amy is anxiously sitting in her car, cell phone at the ready, 
      staring at her watch.

                                  AMY
                    One minute thirty-eight seconds. 
                    One minute thirty-nine---

      THUD. SMACK. A man lands on the hood of her car. There s 
      another at her window.  Amy SCREAMS!

                                  ALEK
                    Where is she?

      It s Alek and Jasmine.

                                    JASMINE
                    Amy, please. There s no time. 
                    Where s Chloe?

                                  AMY
                    In there.  Fourth floor.

      And they re both instantly gone, running for the building.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    Alek and Jasmine? Wait. Don t leave 
                    me here!

      And she s out of the car hustling behind them.



      CRASH! Another piece of scaffolding goes down. Chloe is still 
      holding him off.

      He thrusts. Chloe defends. She slashes but he catches her 
      wrist and she gets an elbow to the chest. She lets out a GASP 
      of pain as he flips her back on to the floor.

      Before she can get up, he s on her. Kneeling over her chest. 
      Both her arms pinned. Her claws useless. Chloe struggles.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    To kill the so-called Uniter will 
                    be the greatest accomplishment of 
                    my life.

                                  CHLOE
                    You ve got the wrong girl.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               48.              


                                  THE ROGUE
                    Perhaps you re right. So lets see 
                    how many times I can kill you 
                    before you stop coming back to 
                    life.

      He raises his knife and is about to plunge it into her heart 
      when...

      Alek leaps in and tackles the Rogue. CRASH.

      Chloe is immediately on her feet. Jasmine is there.

                                    JASMINE
                    Chloe, go.  We ll get your friend.

      But Alek comes flying back and lands at Chloe s feet. It s 
      pretty clear that neither he nor his cousin are a match for 
      the Rogue.

                                  CHLOE
                    Get Paul. I ll deal with this guy.

                                    JASMINE
                    No. You ve got to get--

                                  CHLOE
                    Now.

      Jasmine and Alek scramble as the Rogue launches another 
      attack.  Chloe grabs a steel bar to try and defend herself. 
      SLAM. SCRAP. He flies back - Chloe looks like she s finally 
      about to clobber him when--

                                  AMY (O.S.)
                    CHLOE!

      She s at the elevator. That s all the Rogue needs as he grabs 
      the pole and flips Chloe away. OOF. She slams into a pile of 
      boxes.

                                  CHLOE
                    Not now, Amy.

      Amy spots Paul who s just been untied.

                                  AMY
                    Paul.

      And rushes over to him, just as a NINJA STAR imbeds itself 
      into wood just inches from Paul s head.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               49.              


      She kisses him. But when she lets go, she looks back at the 
      battle that Alek and Jasmine have re-entered. Even with three 
      against one, the Rogue still seems to be winning.

      Paul grabs a piece of metal pipe and heads into the fray. 
      Chloe gets in a kick to the chest. The Rogue falls back 
      towards Paul.

                                  PAUL
                    Don t worry, Chloe. I got him.

      Paul hits him across the shoulders with the pipe. But it just 
      seems to infuriate him even further. With one swift move he 
      grabs Paul and throws him up against the wall. 

      ANGLE ON Amy who is now really mad. She picks up one of the 
      industrial lights.

      ANGLE BACK on Chloe and The Rogue. The Rogue sends Jasmine 
      crashing into some scaffolding. For the moment, it s just him 
      and Chloe. 

      And Chloe looks like she might finally be getting the better 
      of him but as he stumbles, he grabs a board and it smacks 
      Chloe full on.

      Chloe flies back and CRASHES out one of the arched WINDOWS.



      Rogue is at the edge of the broken window.

                                  AMY
                    Stay away from my friend.

      He turns back just as Amy SLAMS him in the face with the 
      light. It sparks and explodes and he tumbles backwards out 
      the window.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               50.              



      Brian comes in the front door of this very impressive house 
      and starts up the stairs, but stops when he sees a light on 
      in the front room.

                                  BRIAN
                    Hey, Dad. I didn t think you d 
                    still be up.

      REVEAL that Dad is Whitley Rezza.

                                    WHITLEY
                    Good day?

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah, actually it was a very good 
                    day.  Night.

      MUSIC UP:



      Jasmine is bandaged up and sleeping. Alek watches from the 
      door for a moment before closing the door.



      Meredith stops at Chloe s door. She decides not to knock.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               52.              



      Meredith is on the floor in front of her closet. She reaches 
      all the way to the back and pulls out a dusty, old SHOE BOX. 
      After a beat, she opens it. Inside are documents and letters. 
      All of them are written in RUSSIAN.



      Brian dials his cell and heads up the stairs. No answer. 
      Finally, he hangs up.



      CLOSE ON Chloe s cell and it s  MISSED CALL  message. PULL 
      BACK TO REVEAL that Chloe is staring at her laptop screen.

      On it is a message.  It simply says,  TRUST NO ONE. Dad.
