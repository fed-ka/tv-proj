  A beautiful, chicly dressed young woman slides out of a cab and
hurries across the plaza. She is CATHERINE CHANDLER, mid-
twenties, a lawyer in a high powered, New York law firm. At the
moment, she s late for work, again... but she s not worried. Her
father is the law firm s founding partner, a prominent corporate
attorney in Manhattan. Cathy Chandler has never had to worry too
much about anything...


Cathy comes out of the restaurant and hurries to the corner to
hail a cab. A cab drives by.

                                        CATHY
                        (raising a hand)
                                    Taxi...! I

She s too late. A couple just ahead of her hops into the cab.
Another cab approaches...

                                        CATHY

              Taxi...!

The cab switches on its  Off Duty  sign.

                                        CATHY
                        (muttering)
                                      Great...

Now a STOCKY GUY in a bomber jacket saunters up...

                                  STOCKY GUY
                      (smiling)
              You re not having much luck. I ll
            get you one...
                      (steps off the curb,
                        raises an arm,
                        whistles loudly)
              I m an expert...

  Suddenly a van pulls around the corner, the door slides open.

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                7.

The Stocky Guy roughly shoves Cathy to the van door...

                                  STOCKY GUY
              Going home alone tonight, Carol?

                                        CATHY
                        (startled)
                                      Hey...! I

She tries to twist away but a pair of muscular arms reach out
from within, grabbing her and violently yanking her into the
vehicle. The Stocky Guy jumps in and the van takes
off...


The van is stopped at the side of the road. We see the two
  attackers dump Cathy s limp form in a clump of bushes. They run
back to the van and it speeds off...                                                                                9.
13 CLOSER ANGLE CATHY

She lies unconscious, near death, sprawled in the bushes. We
can t see her face. Cars whiz by in the distance... And then,
  seemingly out of nowhere, A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS HER BODY... Now,
the BROAD BACK of a patchwork-cloaked figure ENTERS FRAME. Cathy
is scooped up, as if she were a child, and carried off, into the
mist.


She s rushing up Third, trying to get a taxi. A cab pulls up but
she can t open the door, it s locked. She pounds on the window
but the cab driver doesn t seem to notice. He just sits there...
  Someone taps her on the shoulder, she turns... It s the Stocky
Guy in the bomber jacket...

                                    STOCKY GUY
                        (smirking)
              Not having much luck...

Cathy tries to scream but nothing comes out... She pounds

  furiously on the cab window. The cab drives off...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              28.

                                    STOCKY GUY
                    Need some help?

She starts running - into the arms of the Tatooed Punk...

                                    TATOOED PUNK
              You aren t having much luck...

She breaks away and runs -- up Third Avenue. Her attackers come
after her, closing in. Nobody on the street seems to notice or
care.

39 As the Tatooed Punk reaches out to grab her from 39
behind, Cathy ducks and dashes through the doors of a
  restaurant...


Vincent swiftly, gracefully, climbs the tower of a tall
  building... There he sits, perched, gazing out at the lights of
the city surrounding him, the city he can never be a part of --
the city of the woman he can never know. He bows his head and
looks utterly isolated, forlorn...

                                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:


As the sun rises and the city awakens.


CLOSE ON CATHY


As she s waiting to cross the street, she turns, looks around --
as if someone was standing beside her. But no-one s there...

                                                                  CUT TO:

Cathy climbs out of a limo in front of her building. Tom McGrath
starts to climb out of the limo...

                                        TOM
                        (to Cathy)
              I ll walk you up...

                                        CATHY
              No, that s alright.

                                        TOM
              No. I ll walk you up.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              44.

                                        CATHY
            You didn t hear anything I said
              tonight...

                                        TOM
            What? That your work s important to you? I can
              understand that. My work s important to me. That doesn t
              mean we can t see each other.

                                        CATHY
              Tom, things change...

                                        TOM
              I think your carrying this new
              seriousness a little too far.

                                        CATHY
                                      (smiling)
            Now you miss the old flake...

                                        TOM
              Listen, we re not going to just be friends. That won t
            work, it s not enough.

                                        CATHY
            It ll have to be.

                                        TOM
              Cathy, knock it off. You re working too hard. Let s go
            to Paris this weekend -- on the Concord.

                                        CATHY
              Night, Tom...

She kisses his cheek. He holds on to her momentarily...

                                        TOM
            I m not going to let you slip away.
              I won t let that happen...

                                        CATHY
              Good night...

She heads toward the building entrance. He climbs back into the
limo and it pulls away...

As she is about to enter her building she suddenly stops, turns,
looks around -- feeling a strange but familiar presence nearby...
She shakes it off and moves on, into the building...                                                                              45.
69 ANGLE " THE PARK, ACROSS THE STREET

MOVING IN on an area of dense foliage we DISTINGUISH VINCENT,
hidden among the leaves, watching CATHY AND TOM, his heart in
his throat...

  Vincent emerges from the elevator shed on the roof of the
  building. The lights of Manhattan twinkle below... He walks
along the parapet, at the edge of the roof. Then, reaching a
spot, he leaps over the edge, disappearing...

SHOT

As night begins to fade and the sky goes purple, we SEE the
  silhouettes of two figures huddled on the fire escape. As we
HEAR...

                                    CATHY (V.O.)
                        (reading to Vincent)
               ... And as the morning mists had risen long ago when I
              first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising
              now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light
              they showed me, I saw no shadow of another parting from
              her.

Cathy climbs out of a cab, her arms full of groceries. She
   hurries up the front steps of the townhouse which is under
  renovation. She rings the bell, gets no answer... She uses her
key to open the door.                                                                                59.
