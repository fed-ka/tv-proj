      Traffic moves briskly on this highway just outside CHICAGO.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So many people.  Heading to school.  
                    Late for work.  Just singing along.  
                    Living their lives.

      From the shoulder, a LONE DEER peers out at the cars and 
      noise.  And the woman continues to speak to us:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    None of them sees me.  They don t 
                    even know that I m here.

      Startled, the deer bolts from the shoulder and back towards 
      some NEARBY WOODS.  We follow.


      The woods are shallow, opening up towards an ACCESS ROAD on a 
      flat Midwestern plain.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    I was on my way somewhere, too.  I 
                    had finally figured everything out.  

      The deer is gone but we linger.  More ominous, more quiet; 
      the highway and all the life it entails seems a world away.  
      Moving down towards a DITCH-- and ending on a LIFELESS BODY.  

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And then this happened to me.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CRIME SCENE.

      Alex walks out with Tyler, handing him a scrap of paper.

                                  ALEX
                    She was going to have you pick up 
                    trash on the Interstate.  You know 
                    that, don t you?

                                  TYLER
                    I know.

                                  ALEX
                    Be at this address at 7PM tonight.  
                    We re a victim s rights group.  We 
                    need your help.  200 hours of it.

                                  TYLER
                    Okay.  Thanks.  But there s just 
                    one thing.

                                  ALEX
                    Sure.

                                  TYLER
                    Who the hell are you?

      Tyler has never seen Alex before in his life.  But Alex is 
      already walking away and making a call.


      A white PHONE COMPANY VAN is parked.  Up on a phone pole: 
      hard-hatted WALTER SNELL.  40s, lumpy, working hard at 
      something.  CO-WORKERS listen to a ballgame on the radio 
      below.  They pay no attention to him.

      Walter s cell phone rings-- the theme from  COPS.   He 
      reaches inside his blue coverall, the one with his name on a 
      little white patch, this is the call he s been waiting for, 
      his moment to shine, the day he ll prove--

      He drops the phone.  It hits a co-worker on the helmet.  
      THONK.


      Tyler stands outside, checking that scrap of paper:

                  144 Mulberry Drive

      He has the right place.  He exhales, not happy to be there.  
      He pulls a fifth of WHISKEY from his pocket and takes a sip.

      He approaches, knocks, and Linda answers, gives him a small 
      smile, and lets him in.  She takes a paranoid glance out into 
      the street before shutting the door behind him.


      Tyler walking away.  Alex behind.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey.  It might help if you took a 
                    copy of the pictures from the 
                    morgue.  Unless you have one of 
                    those photographic memory thingys--

      Tyler keeps walking.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    You know we identified 17 victims 
                    last year.  And we helped catch the 
                    killers a dozen times.  We re good 
                    at this.  And with you we ll be 
                    even better.

      Still nothing.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I took a chance with you, all 
                    right?  I ve been tracking every 
                      quote-unquote  artist  who gets 
                    busted for the past six months.  
                    And you re the jackpot.  You took 
                    all those forensic classes--

      Finally Tyler stops and turns around.  

                                  TYLER
                    So?  It s all been practice.  I ve 
                    never done one of these for real.  
                    I m not an expert.

                                  ALEX
                          (gestures towards house)
                    Did they look like experts?  It s 
                    not a requirement.                                                                                    12.



                                  TYLER
                    The guy in the blue onesie seemed 
                    pretty sure of himself.

                                  ALEX
                    There might be people somewhere 
                    looking for Highway Jane.  But 
                    they re not looking for black 
                    nails.  They re looking for her 
                    face.  We need you.

                                  TYLER
                    I can t do it.  I m calling 
                    probation tomorrow.  I can t sculpt 
                    a dead girl.  It s too weird.

                                  ALEX
                    You need to really think about 
                    what s going to happen five days 
                    from now.  Okay?  Some low level 
                    guy is gonna pull her out of that 
                    drawer, mangled face and all, and 
                    he s gonna bury her in an unmarked 
                    field, with an unmarked grave, and 
                    she s gonna be Jane Doe forever.  
                    We need to make sure that doesn t 
                    happen.  We need to get her story 
                    out there.

                                  TYLER
                    I know that but--

                                  ALEX
                    And it s not just for her, man.  
                    It s for her parents.  Maybe a 
                    sister or brother.  Right now 
                    they ve lost track of her.  Maybe 
                    it s been months or years since 
                    they ve heard her voice.  And they 
                    go to sleep every night wondering 
                    where she is.  And what happened.

                                  TYLER
                    But what s the point?  Telling them 
                    she s dead is gonna fix that?

                                  ALEX
                    It s knowledge.  And then we can 
                    try to get justice.

                                  TYLER
                    It s still grief.  And pain.  It s 
                    just a different kind.

      Alex takes a step towards him.  Choosing his words carefully.

                                  ALEX
                    Three years ago my daughter Lucy 
                    was kidnapped.  My only child.  11 
                    years old.  Lincoln Park Zoo, on a 
                    Tuesday afternoon.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    13.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    They never found out who did it.  
                    And they ve never found her.  Is 
                    she dead?  Maybe.  Probably.  But I 
                    don t know.  And I may never know.

      Tyler softens a bit.  Alex hands him an ENVELOPE.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    So you re right.  There s grief and 
                    pain all around.  But when you 
                    know, you can heal.  It matters.  
                    Trust me.

      Alex heads back in.  Leaving Tyler there to think about it.


      Alex follows Linda back into the living room.  Tyler, 
      Candace, and Walter are standing there, in a small circle...

      They step aside, and on the dining room table we see the back 
      of a YOUNG WOMAN S head.  As Alex comes around the front, the 
      group parts slightly so Alex can see--

      The FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION of Highway Jane: black hair, brown 
      eyes, expressionless but impeccable.  And THE VOICE OF OUR 
      VICTIM RETURNS:

                                  YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                    So there I was.  With a name that 
                    isn t  Jane.   With a family that s 
                    waiting.  And I don t want them 
                    waiting anymore.

      Alex gives Tyler a look of thanks.  But it s the face that 
      draws him.  And gives all of them pause, and focus.

                                  ALEX
                    This is her.  This is our girl.  
                    Her story starts here.

      Linda moves forward, puts her hand lightly on Alex s arm.

                                  LINDA
                    She s not your daughter, Alex.

      He turns to her.  He looks okay with it.  Or as okay with it 
      as someone could be.

                                  ALEX
                    I know.  But she s somebody s 
                    daughter.

                                  TYLER
                    So what do we do now?

                                  ALEX
                    We get to work.


                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    15.



                                            ACT TWO




      The scene of the crime: highway and woods in the near 
      distance.  There s a slight ditch alongside the access road 
      where the body was dumped.  We GLIDE ABOVE it from the tree 
      tops, as if Highway Jane were looking down on her saviors. 

                                  WALTER
                    There s nothing here, Alex.

                                  ALEX
                    She died here.  I needed to see it.   

      As he studies the dead leaves on the ground, light snow 
      drifting around them-- 

                                                                          FLASH TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      which is a way for us to grab a quick glimpse of our victim 
      when she was alive, as Alex and the others follow her path 
      and trace her footprints in the world--

      A man's hands around JANE DOE's neck.  She tries to scream.  
      She can't.  She falls to the floor.  Life leaves her body.  
      Eyes go dark.

                                                                              RESUME:


      Walter watches as Alex stares at one spot.

                                  ALEX
                    We look backwards and fill in the 
                    rest.  In four days.  No problem.

      Alex looks up and gives him a small smile, knowing the 
      enormity of the task.  He starts walking back to his car, 
      next to Walter s white van.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Candace is going to work on the 
                    nail polish.  Maybe narrow down to 
                      a specific shade, or find the 
                    people who sold it to her if she s 
                    lucky.  I m gonna track down the 
                    blouse, maybe our girl was a 
                    regular at one of the thrift shops, 
                    made some friends behind the 
                    counter.

      Walter is wearing his coverall.  He walks behind.  Alex 
      points across the plain:                                                                                    16.



                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    And you re heading there, right?

      There s an OLD GAS STATION, down the access road maybe a 
      quarter of a mile away.  And a quick 360 shows no other 
      businesses or homes.

                                  WALTER
                    Yeah.  I mean, if that s okay--

                                  ALEX
                    It s more than  okay  it s 
                      important.  It s the only place out 
                    here.  Work your magic, W.

                                  WALTER
                    Please don t call me that.

      Alex smiles and drives away, leaving him there.  Walter looks 
      at the crime scene briefly... then back to the gas station.


      A closer look.  A few customers, a small shop.  No carwashes 
      or sub shops attached.  Walter drives in and parks.  


      Walter is pumped.  He looks at the photo.                                                                                    18.



                                  WALTER
                     Maybe you did something.   That 
                    was good.

      He looks beyond the bright lights of the station, towards the 
      crime scene, holding up one of the flyers and looking at her 
      face as it flaps in the breeze and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Alex outside as CRACK a final EGG hits against the front of 
      the house.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey!

      A couple of teenagers hop into a car, Alex hurries down to 
      the sidewalk as the car SCREECHES and pulls away.

      Alex watches them go.  He looks across the street, where an 
      ELDERLY NEIGHBOR watches from behind a curtain.  As Alex 
      gives him a  what s up?  look, the curtain closes.


      Candace and Tyler hand out a few flyers to CLUBBERS waiting 
      in line-- a GIRL shakes her head, a GUY crumples it up and 
      tosses it aside.

      Shaved Head comes out on the front step-- glares at them.  
      Tyler turns back to Candace.  Not worried, just worn out.

                                  TYLER
                    Maybe we should call it a night.

      But Candace is undaunted.  

                                    CANDACE
                    Wuss.  It s not even four yet.

      As they walk the line she hands out a couple more flyers, 
      attaches another to a telephone pole.  Tyler watches.

                                  TYLER
                    So what s your deal?  You re into 
                    this for a reason, right?  I mean, 
                    Alex has the thing with his 
                      daughter... did you lose someone?  
                    Or something?

                                    CANDACE
                    Just my mind in a day job I hate.  

      Tyler laughs.  But Candace is serious.  She holds up a flyer.                                                                                    27.



                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    She has no one.  Think about it-- 
                    what s the first thing that happens 
                    when you re brought into the world?

                                  TYLER
                    You get a name.

                                    CANDACE
                    So you should have it when you 
                    leave.

      She says it with authority-- it s the simple law that 
      justifies all her work.  

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    I always think,  what if that were 
                    me?   I d want someone to care 
                    about me.  I d want the world to 
                    remember I was here.  That I did 
                    things.  That I affected people. 

      She gets emotional, a hint of vulnerability we haven t seen.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    Does that make any sense?

                                  TYLER
                    Yeah.  But it feels weird to care 
                    about someone I don t even know.

                                    CANDACE
                    She s a human being.  You know her.

      Tyler nods.  Willing to concede the point.  

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    And next thing you know you re 
                    spending all of your time at 
                    Mulberry Drive.

      A young woman walks by and jostles Candace-- it s Jessica 
      from inside. 

                                    JESSICA
                    Her name s Vivian.

      She keeps her head down.  Speaks nervously.

                                    CANDACE
                    Excuse me?

                                    JESSICA
                    Her name s Vivian.  We can t talk 
                    here.

                                  TYLER
                    You know her?                                                                                    28.



                                    JESSICA
                    Yeah.  But so does he.

      She makes eyes behind her, to her right, where Shaved Head is 
      watching, he starts towards them and they walk quickly away--

                                          ACT THREE




      A few blocks from the club, ducking off the main drag, music 
      still audible.  Tyler and Candace stand across from Jessica.

                                    JESSICA
                    We used to see her out, weekends 
                    mostly late but every once in a 
                    while for a show on weekdays.  

      Candace looks up.  Alex spots them from the head of the 
      alley, and walks over to join them.

                                    CANDACE
                    Jessica, this is Alex, I was 
                    telling you about him...

      Alex extends a hand and smiles.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey Jessica.  Thanks for talking to 
                    us.

                                    JESSICA
                    And you guys are totally not 
                    police, right?

                                  ALEX
                    Not police.  Well I used to be.  
                    Before I came to my senses.

      A little joke to put her at ease.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    So you said her name was Vivian.  
                    But you don t know her last name?  

                                    JESSICA
                    Yeah, I mean we weren t friends 
                    like that.  We were club friends.  
                    I saw her out, she saw me, it was 
                    like  hey Vivian. 

                                  ALEX
                    So you don t have a picture of her.  
                    On your phone or anything.

                                    JESSICA
                    Nah.

      Alex pulls out a small folded sheet of paper from his wallet.

                                  ALEX
                    And does this mean anything to you?                                                                                    30.



      It s a copy of the note: 747 - 50.  Jessica shakes her head.  
      She looks anxiously back towards the street.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    It s okay.  I saw him go back 
                    inside.  

      Jessica nods, relieved.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    He s just a bouncer, right?  

                                    JESSICA
                    Yeah.  But half the fights in there 
                    are ones he starts.  His name s 
                    Quint.

      Alex writes it down.

                                  ALEX
                    Were they dating?

                                    JESSICA
                    Quint dates a lot of girls.  He 
                    likes it rough.  Even if the girls 
                    don t.

      Tyler shows her a close up photo of the tattoo.

                                  TYLER
                    She had this tattoo on her ankle.  

      Jessica looks at it, smiling in some fond memory.

                                    JESSICA
                    I know.  So cool... I asked her 
                    about it.  

                                    CANDACE
                    And what d she say?

                                    JESSICA
                    She said it was a long story.  It 
                    was three years old, from just 
                    before she moved here. 

                                  ALEX
                    Moved here from where?

      Jessica shrugs.  Alex is frustrated but not angry with her.  


      Back out from the alley, they re saying goodbyes.  Alex a few 
      steps behind, on his cell phone--

                                  ALEX
                          (into phone)
                    His name s Quint.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    31.

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    He s a bouncer at The Silvertongue 
                      Nightclub.  Bad news, I think.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Alex rejoins the group, turns to Jessica--

                                  ALEX
                    One last thing.  At the end of the 
                    night, how did she get home?  She 
                    take the train?

                                    JESSICA
                    I think so.

                                  ALEX
                    That way, or that way?

      He points both ways.  She s not sure why it matters--

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Close your eyes, Jessica.  Picture 
                    yourself.  The two of you, walking 
                    out of here,  okay! Goodbye!   And 
                    then--

      She closes her eyes, thinks about it--

                                    JESSICA
                    That way.

      She points left.  Alex smiles at her in thanks.


      A small yard.  Linda pushes her baby in the stroller from one 
      end to the other.  It s tiny and the laps are small; it s 
      like being in a prison courtyard.

                                  ALEX
                    Our girl liked the clubs.  Darker 
                    stuff.  She s been in the city a 
                    little less than three years. 

                                  LINDA
                    So a runaway from somewhere?                                                                                    32.



                                  ALEX
                    Possibly.  And she was sleeping 
                    with this guy, this bouncer dude.  
                    He might have knocked her around, 
                    according to this Jessica person.

      The back door of the next house opens.  Linda looks up with 
      alarm, and before the NEIGHBOR can emerge she quickly grabs 
      her baby daughter from the stroller and hurries back inside.  
      Alex watches, dumbfounded, then follows her in.


      Located adjacent to a commercial strip that runs through West 
      Loop: more Mom and Pop than yuppie.  Tyler and Alex divide up 
      a stack of flyers as Candace checks her cell phone, feeding 
      maps and data directly into a HAUNTS file.  And as they head 
      down the street we:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    35.



       DOE MOMENT 

      As we see Highway Jane from behind, window-shopping down 
      Ashland Avenue... black cropped hair blowing in the breeze.  
      Alex and the group are in the right place.  They re on her 
      trail...

                                                                              RESUME:


      Alex steps off the main drag and puts a few flyers under the 
      front mats along a group of ROWHOUSES.  His phone rings.  
      CANDACE calling.  He answers it--                                                                                    36.

      Stately homes.  Alex pulls up and parks.  Gets out and we see 
      Olivo has arrived in a sedan.  They approach the front door.


      Alex rings the doorbell, Olivo standing beside him.  A MAN 
      (50s) in a suit answers.

      The man pulls the door open and a YOUNG WOMAN walks over.

      Status meeting.  The corkboard is almost full, but it feels 
      like a fraud.  They seem blindsided by what has happened.

                                  ALEX
                    So the real Vivian Simmons had her 
                    purse stolen at the Art Institute 
                    almost three years ago.

                                  LINDA
                    Highway Jane must have done it.  
                    She took her identity.  

      Walter attaches a photo of the  real  Vivian to the 
      corkboard, taken from the front of her Evanston house.

                                    CANDACE
                    Highway Jane became this girl.  She 
                    didn t want to be found.

                                  TYLER
                    I know the feeling.

                                  ALEX
                    So where are we?

                                  WALTER
                    Back to calling her  Highway Jane  
                    for one thing.

      Walter pulls down some credit card receipts, then crosses out 
      Vivian s name on the card, then grabs and crumples it. 

                                  ALEX
                    No.

      Alex smooths out the VIVIAN card and puts it back on the 
      board; it s a record of everything, the hits and the misses.  

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    The things she did, the places she 
                    went... we still have that.  We 
                    don t have the name but we ve still 
                    got two days and it s still her.  
                    This is still her.

      Alex gestures towards the corkboard.  They seem willing to 
      concede it.  As they study it--

                                  TYLER
                    What about the bouncer?

      On Alex:                                                                                    42.




      Olivo heading somewhere, Alex trying to keep up.

                                  ALEX
                    You what?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    We let him go.  He checked out.  No 
                    priors, nothing.

                                  ALEX
                    But he slept with her--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Not a crime.  Couldn t hold him.

                                  ALEX
                    He s dangerous!  Ten girls at that 
                    club would have said so!  

      Finally she turns to him.  Angry.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    You want to start questioning my 
                    judgment, Alex?  You want to make 
                    any more suggestions?  Because your 
                    last one sent me to Evanston, so I 
                    could flash my badge and look like 
                    an idiot.

                                  ALEX
                    Hey.  We had credit card receipts, 
                      a driver s license... that was an 
                    honest mistake and you know it.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Fine.  Make a mistake.  You can do 
                    that.  But my job has rules.  It 
                    has laws.  You should know that 
                    better than anyone.

                                  ALEX
                    You could have kept him overnight, 
                    or got a warrant for his place--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    I m late for an arraignment.  Woman 
                    in Hyde Park shot her ex-husband 
                    three times in the back last night.  
                    And we ve got witnesses, and a 
                    murder weapon-- and we ve got 
                    names!  A real case!  Imagine that!

      She enters the building and leaves him on the steps.  Alex 
      knows there s some truth in what she says, but he s not 
      giving up yet.  He takes out his phone and makes a call:                                                                                    43.



                                  ALEX
                          (into phone)
                    Walter, it s me.  Do you have a 
                    window?


      As he walks down the street, we see Walter s phone company 
      van start up down the block.  He follows.  Quint walks two 
      blocks... Walter behind.  Finally Quint turns down an alley, 
      and as Walter pulls up Quint is GONE.

      Walter curses, stops the van, hops out, steps to the head of 
      the alley... where did the guy go?  He couldn t just 
      disappear--

      SUDDENLY Quint grabs Walter and spins him around, pushing him 
      against the brick wall--

                                  QUINT
                    You a cop?

                                  WALTER
                    I work for the phone company--

                                  QUINT
                    You with those people at the club?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes--

      Quint PUNCHES him in the face, knocking him to the ground.

                                  QUINT
                    I did her once.  That s it.  She 
                    was nothing.  And if I ever see you 
                    again, I ll kill you.   

      Walter nods, getting to his knees, rubbing his cheek.  Quint 
      is gone.


      Outside, lunchtime.  STUDENTS around; a large mural that 
      reads HOME OF THE BENGALS.  Alex spots a GROUP OF 
        CHEERLEADERS laughing and going about their day and we:

                                                                            CUT TO:

       DOE MOMENT 

      as Alex imagines Highway Jane among them, her face hidden 
      from view by the others, but part of this group, this 
      world...

                                                                              RESUME:


      Candace tugs on Alex s arm.  He snaps out of it.

                                    CANDACE
                    Alex.

                                  ALEX
                    Sorry.

      The SCHOOL PRINCIPAL (40s) approaches Alex, trailed by some 
      LOCAL POLICE.  

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Thanks for the call.  The students 
                    are ready.  

      They walk into the school together.  Detective Olivo is with 
      them.  She and Alex acknowledge each other but it s icy.


      The girl running across the parking lot... Alex and Candace 
      chasing after her... finally she stops, leaning against a 
      car, collapsing in tears.  Alex and Candace reach her.

                                  GIRL
                    Tracy... that s my sister Tracy...

      Alex comforts her.  Then he sort of hands her over to Candace 
      and Olivo, keeping some students away-- and then Alex locks 
      eyes with someone:

      From a distance a FEMALE TEACHER is staring at him -- 30s 
      with CURLY BROWN HAIR.  She looks stricken.  

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Alex let s go.

      Alex turns back to Olivo and heads off with her, escorting 
      Amy from the school.


      Alex and Olivo approach the front door.  Behind we see 
      Candace walking towards the house with sister Amy.  Alex 
      knocks.  SALLY BENEDICT (40s) answers.  Working-class, tired.

                                  ALEX
                    Mrs. Benedict?

                                  SALLY
                    Yes?
                          (sees daughter)
                    Amy?  Are you all right?

      She nods but doesn t say anything.  

                                  ALEX
                    My name s Alex Donovan.  I m a 
                    former detective with the Chicago 
                    Police Department, and now I work 
                    with a group called  The Identity 
                    Network.   This is Detective Grace 
                    Olivo from the--

                                  SALLY
                    Tracy?  You found her?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Yes.

      She doesn t continue.  And Sally realizes.

                                  SALLY
                    Oh God...

      She starts to cry, Amy moving to hug her.                                                                                    50.



                                  ALEX
                    I m so sorry.

      She nods and invites them inside.


      Alex at the front step, saying his goodbyes, some of the 
      local police staying behind.  Sally hands him the school 
      portrait.   

                                  ALEX
                    Thank you.  This will help.  And if 
                    you need anything else, please just 
                    call me.

                                  SALLY
                    Thank you.  

      Alex turns to go and some of the police follow Sally inside, 
      matters to attend to, closing the door.  There s other police 
      outside, neighbors peeking out, lots of activity.

      Alex begins walking towards Candace-- when he sees Olivo over 
      by her sedan.  She s talking with the woman from the school.  
      Her name is ZOE.  Alex walks over.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    This is Zoe Franks.  She s a 
                    teacher at Collins.  She saw Tracy 
                    in the city a few weeks ago.

                                  ALEX
                    At the diner, right?  What 
                    happened?

      She s stammers, in a bit of a daze.  Alex puts his hand on 
      her shoulder and steers her away from Olivo.                                                                                    52.



                                  ZOE
                    I was there with my husband.  We 
                    took our son Nathaniel in to see 
                    the circus.

                                  ALEX
                    So you weren t in touch with Tracy, 
                    it was just a coincidence?

                                  ZOE
                    Yes.  I mean we re in this 
                      neighborhood, my kid wants pasta 
                    with no sauce and he s gotta pee--

      She shakes her head, laughing.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    You have kids?

      Alex hesitates.  A simple question but never a simple answer.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.  A daughter.

                                  ZOE
                    So you know.

      He doesn t flinch.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, Tracy looked so different.  
                    I mean in high school-- that girl 
                    was a bombshell.  And smart.  Now 
                    with the black everything... I was 
                    shocked.  

                                  ALEX
                    What upset her so much?

      Zoe thinks about it.

                                  ZOE
                    I asked about her Mom.  She said 
                    they weren t speaking.  She begged 
                    me not to tell her where she was.  

      Olivo listens from a few feet away, arms crossed.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    We talked for half an hour.  I told 
                    her-- come home.  The bus is 50 
                    dollars.  I ll meet you on Sunday 
                    night.  You can ride back with us.  
                    I even wrote down what time it 
                    left.

                                  ALEX
                    7:47 PM.                                                                                    53.



                                  ZOE
                    Yes.  She said she d think about 
                    it, but she had some loose ends to 
                    tie up first.  

                                  ALEX
                    What kind of  loose ends? 

                                  ZOE
                    I don t know.  Maybe it was none of 
                    my business, but I wasn t thinking 
                    like a teacher, you know? 

                                  ALEX
                    You were thinking like a parent.  

                                  ZOE
                    I should have done more.

                                  ALEX
                    You tried.  That s all you can do.

      She s truly broken up.  Alex puts a hand on her shoulder but 
      there s nothing more he can say.  Olivo watches, begrudgingly 
        impressed... Alex coaxing and comforting with a skill that 
      she lacks.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      THE CORKBOARD

      it s Tracy s life, in full-- the people she knew, the places 
      she went, where she was born and where she died.  Alex steps 
      forward and attaches the school photo.  


      Alex and Olivo approach.  As Olivo pulls open the front door, 
      Alex grabs it.  Olivo turns back towards him.

                                  ALEX
                    Are we okay here?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Sure.  We re on the same side, I 
                    know that.  It s not personal.

                                  ALEX
                    That s the thing, Grace.  For us it 
                    is personal.

      She gets it.  They head inside.


      As Clay runs down the residential block towards the 
      commercial strip of 

      ASHLAND AVENUE

      and disappears around the corner as Alex reaches the end of 
      the block himself, dodging a car and the HONKING DRIVER--

      Clay takes a quick look back, winded now but fueled by 
      adrenaline, sees Alex gaining on him--

      He passes the diner where Tracy worked, the pharmacy where 
      she shopped, her haunts in reverse, Alex closing, weaving 
      past a girl on her cellphone, cutting across the street in a 
      slight break in traffic, heading for the 

      DIVISION EL STATION

      and Clay is bounding down the stairs to the platform, about 
      halfway down when Alex tackles him, the two of them tumbling 
      the ten steps to the bottom, Alex landing on top and pinning 
      him there.

                                  ALEX
                    Late for class?

      Olivo close behind, she reaches them-- behind her two SQUAD 
      CARS with gumballs flashing slam to a stop on the street--

                                  DET OLIVO
                    You probably shouldn t be doing 
                    that whole  Freeze Police  thing 
                      anymore...

                                  ALEX
                    I ll make a note of it.

                                  CLAY
                          (to Alex)
                    You re not a cop?

                                  DET OLIVO
                    No.  But I am.

      Olivo puts her knee in Clay s back and cuffs him.  As Clay 
      grimaces...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    He said he didn t do it.  He said 
                    he barely knew me.  At first.                                                                                    57.




      Olivo and another DETECTIVE interrogate Clay.  He sits with 
      arms folded.  Alex watches from another room.

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    But even though the apartment was 
                    clean, denial only gets you so 
                    far...


      Candace hands out flyers as people stop for gas, come in and 
      come out.  Walter watches from across the street.  It s rote 
      and robotic until a BUSINESSMAN stops...

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    ...and someone saw him.  At the gas 
                    station.  Just moments before he 
                    murdered me.   


      The graveside ceremony for Tracy is underway.  A large crowd, 
      including Zoe and her family and many from the school.  She 
      was loved.  

                                  TRACY (V.O.)
                    My name is Tracy Benedict.

      Alex stands with a somber Candace, Walter, and Tyler.  
      Detective Olivo is there as well, along with a few COLLEAGUES 
      from the city.

                                  TRACY (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And these are the people who gave 
                    it back to me.

      LATER

      the funeral is over.  As the crowd starts to separate, Alex 
      has a moment with Olivo as they walk.

                                  ALEX
                    I heard you made him cry.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Not the first time.

                                  ALEX
                      Congratulations.  

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Thanks.

      It seems patched up between them.  Olivo looks over at 
      Candace, Tyler, Walter.

                                  DET OLIVO (CONT D)
                    Where s Linda?

                                  ALEX
                    She couldn t get away.

                                  DET OLIVO
                    Oh.  So.  Are you and her--

                                  ALEX
                    --working together?  Yeah.

      ANGLE - CANDACE AND TYLER

      as they walk away.  Tyler notices Walter, speaking with a 
      couple of STRANGERS, action sequence gesturing...

                                  TYLER
                    What s he doing?

                                    CANDACE
                      Exaggerating his role.                                                                                    60.



      Tyler laughs.  Candace studies him.

                                    CANDACE (CONT D)
                    You look handsome.

                                  TYLER
                    Thanks.  This is my courtroom suit.

      He smiles, a little bashful.  Looks out at crowd.

                                  TYLER (CONT D)
                      Courtrooms and funerals...

                                    CANDACE
                    Get used to it.

      ANGLE - GRAVESTONE

      as Sally stands by her daughter s marker.  Alex approaches.  
      She sees him.

                                  SALLY
                    I hear they caught the guy.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.  He confessed.

      She nods, accepting this.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I know you think she never forgave 
                    you.  But you should know there s a  
                    bus from the city that comes in a 
                    little before eight.  I think Tracy 
                    was planning to be on it.

      Sally s eyes widen at the unexpected news.

                                  SALLY
                    After all of this... sometimes I 
                    wonder if you know my daughter 
                    better than I do.

      Alex smiles and shakes his head.

                                  ALEX
                    She s yours.  Not mine.

      Sally nods.  And turns back to the marker.

                                  SALLY
                    When I sleep tonight, for the first 
                    time in a long time, I won t worry.  
                    I ll grieve, but I won t worry.  
                    Thank you for bringing my daughter 
                    back.

                                  ALEX
                    It wasn t just me.  A lot of people 
                    helped.                                                                                    61.



                                  SALLY
                    Are they here?  With you?  

                                  ALEX
                    They re everywhere.

      Alex smiles at her.  They part ways, it s time to go.  

      Alex rejoins the others and takes a final look back, leaving 
      Tracy behind, knowing she s home, at rest and at peace, a job 
      well done as we PULL AWAY.
