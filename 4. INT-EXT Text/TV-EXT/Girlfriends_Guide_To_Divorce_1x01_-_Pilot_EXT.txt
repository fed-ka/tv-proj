      Just before daybreak.  Birds shriek and dive in the bluish 
      gray sky.

      A modern house.  Stylish and big, but not pretentious.  It 
      borders the scrubby, undeveloped acres that cut through the 
      middle of Los Angeles like a wild, coyote-infested ribbon.

      David Hockney s Los Angeles.  Glittering pools, slanted 
      sunshine and glass houses.  And everybody throwing stones.

      An Audi R8 rolls up, conspicuously loud in the morning hush.  

      A handsome, gym-buffed guy, 40 s, JAKE, gets out -- looking 
      rumpled.  He s smart, decent -- but insecure enough to care 
      about sport cars and his six-pack abs. 

      He s still a bit drunk from last night.  Struggles to get his 
      key in the lock to the front door.  Lets himself in.   



      Vicki, Lilly and Charlie race outside to Vicki s car, a tiny 
      Fiat.  Charlie is holding a waffle.  Lilly has her i-pod on.

                                  VICKI
                    Charlie!  Backpack!  

      Vicki doubles back.  Jake s standing right next to Charlie s 
      backpack but doesn t seem to notice.  Vicki shoots him a 
      scathing look -- grabs the backpack, races to the car. 

      Jake waves goodbye to the kids from the doorway.  

                                  JAKE
                    Love you!

      The kids wave as Vicki speeds off.

      Jake deflates as the car disappears.  Looks sad and lost.  A 
      beat.  He closes and locks the door.  Leaves.



      Vicki, Charlie and Lilly run into school, late.  Lilly is 
      stressing.

                                  LILLY
                    Come on!  God!

      Charlie s a mess.  Hair tweaked, crumbs on his shirt.  He 
      loses a Croc.  Goes back for it. 

                                  VICKI
                    Charlie -- 

      Lilly rushes ahead.  Vicki runs back with Charlie in tow.  

      The school, arguably the hardest admission in town, is the 
      kind of educational playground that only the donations of 
      millionaire -- and billionaire -- parents can provide.                                                                                      7.


      This is where  diversity  is provided by the children of the 
      Lakers, Rihanna plays at the school fund-raiser and Maseratis 
      and Teslas clog the carpool lane.

      Most of the parents are dressed in the same sort of clothes 
      as their kids, with a few pricey suits sprinkled in for 
      variety.  

      Vicki stops at a sign-in desk, smiles at the security guard.  
      His look to her is surprisingly meaningful.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    You keep smiling, okay?

                                  VICKI
                          (puzzled)
                    Will do.  Have a good day.
                          (to Lilly/up ahead)
                    Hey.  What s the rule?

                                  LILLY
                          (recites)
                     It s better to be late and 
                    fabulous than on time and average. 

      Lilly smiles a little despite herself.  Vicki kisses her on 
      the head and she runs off.   Then Vicki guides Charlie 
      through the obstacle course of other moms and dads.  

      She can t help but notice that she s the object of some 
      INTERESTED LOOKS and SYMPATHETIC SMILES.  One mother stops:

                                  TOO SKINNY MOM
                    Bitch, you look amazing.  So thin!

                                  VICKI
                    I look like shit.  But thanks.

      Vicki s smile falters.  She s starting to get paranoid.  It 
      really feels like she s the object of unusual attention.

      Now an ATTRACTIVE DAD catches her eye and starts to speak -- 
      but she keeps her head down, avoids him.

      Then Vicki sees PHOEBE, early 30 s, ahead.  She s GORGEOUS, a 
      former model with new-age/boho/rocker flair, an effortlessly 
      stunning drama queen.  Hot in a low cut maxi and HUGE shades.

      She s also a professional ex-wife with a fortune -- parties 
      and travels like she s single.  Which is why she s dragging:                                                                                      8.


                                  PHOEBE
                    Coffee, love?  I m still drunk on 
                    last night s cava.  Have you been 
                    to Trois Mec yet?  It s--

                                  VICKI
                    People are giving me  that  look.  
                    The sympathy face.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Are they?  Shit...  Huh.  Where are 
                    my children?  Dylan?  Cassidy?

      The security man, stern now, moves over with an adorable boy, 
      Cassidy, 6, and a stunning little girl, Dylan, 8.  

      They are dressed impeccably.  Cassidy s a mini Justin 
      Timberlake, complete with vest and tie.  Dylan looks like a 
      mini version of Phoebe, only with a gold lame  backpack.

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Mrs. Wills.  They were outside, 
                    trying to cross the street.

                                  PHOEBE
                          (laughs/to kids)
                    You crazies!  I told you to stay 
                    with mama.  
                          (to security guard)
                    Thanks.  So much.  I m horrible.

      The security guard moves off, shaking his head.  Phoebe 
      barely notices as the kids run off with CHARLIE.  Vicki AGAIN 
      sees someone giving her a too-long glance.  

                                  VICKI
                    Do you think people know?  

                                  PHOEBE
                    What?  That you and Jake split -- ?

                                  VICKI
                    Shhh!  Jesus... I m losing Charlie.  
                    See you soon.

      Vicki stoops, picks up Charlie s Croc, which he s left behind 
      and chases after him.

      Vicki sees KATE, a pretty and seemingly perfect mom chatting 
      with another parent.  She s kind, beautiful and elegant.  
      Kate, an old friend, greets Vicki warmly.                                                                                      9.


                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    We re doing coffee at Farmer s 
                    Market if you want.

                                  KATE
                    Oh.  I said I d meet--
                          (then)
                    Forget it.  Yes.  Let s catch up.

      Vicki smiles and moves off, seeing ANOTHER DAD, second-lead 
      handsome, making a bee-line toward her from across the yard.  
      She speeds up, trying to lose him. 

                                  VICKI
                    Late!

                                  DOUCHE BAG DAD
                    But still beautiful.

      He grins, points at her.  Vicki dashes inside the 1st Grade 
      room.  Stops.  Hangs her head.  Says quietly to herself:

                                  VICKI
                    Disaster.



      Vicki s parked outside MEL AND ROSE LIQUOR, a  boutique  
      liquor store near the Center.  She s leaning on her car.

      She unwraps a new pack of cigarettes with shaking hands, 
      barely holding it together.  

      She lights a cigarette.  Takes a drag.  It hits the spot.  
      She visibly relaxes, then dials her phone.

      INTERCUT WITH



      Now Vicki walks through the colorful maze that is the 
      original Farmer s Market on Fairfax, still on her phone.  

      Quaint original food stalls now mix with more upscale 
      options.                                                                                     11.


                                  LYLA
                    I still have money on my retainer.  

                                  VICKI
                    But having him followed--

                                  LYLA
                    He leaves the boys on his night!  
                    Can t he do his perverted shit 
                    during the day?  He s got no job!

                                  VICKI
                    Lyla.  All this anger...  You need 
                    to let go.  Cry.  Be sad--

      Now we see that Vicki and Lyla are walking toward each other, 
      still talking on their phone.  As they meet, they hang up and 
      keep talking, not missing a beat.

                                  LYLA
                    You know what s sad?  What a 
                      spectacular piece of shit he is.  I 
                    give him 50 grand a month and now 
                    he s after my pension!?  If I prove 
                    him unfit then I get the kids and 
                    he can t live off the child support-

      They move into a line in front of SHORT CAKE, a retro-cool 
      bakery and coffee joint.  Baristas in vests and scarves.  
      Very fucking serious about their coffee.

                                  VICKI
                    He s entitled to half, Lyla.  If he 
                    were a woman--

                                  LYLA
                    Screw that.  If he were a woman I d 
                      understand why he s got no balls.
                          (then/re: Baristas)
                    Holy Christ.  This place.  They all 
                    look like escapees from a touring 
                      production of Oliver.



      Vicki and Lyla, coffees in hand, look for their table.  

      Lyla stops.  Sees a FLYER with Vicki s smiling mug on it.  
      Announcing a BOOK SIGNING at BARNES AND NOBLE.  Grabs it.

                                  LYLA
                    What?  Where are your pores?  And 
                    why didn t you tell me about this?!                                                                                    12.


                                  VICKI
                    Please don t.  I don t want anybody 
                    there.  It s too much as it is.  

      Vicki takes the flyer and tosses it.  They see a table of 
      chattering moms from school, including KATE, the  perfect .  
      Some are in work clothes, some have babies in strollers. 

                                  LYLA
                    Good morning, all.

      The ladies all look up, big fake smiles all around.  

                                  YOGA MOM
                      Hiiiiiiiiiii....  Lyla, right?

      They know Lyla only by reputation as a huge ball-buster.  
      Vicki, they re wildly curious about, have heard the rumors.

      Kate stands up, and SUNGLASSES MOM starts to scoot over.

                                  SUNGLASSES MOM
                    Sit down, Vicki.  We ll make room.  

      Lyla glares at Sunglasses.  Vicki only?  

                                  LYLA
                    We can t.  We re meeting Phoebe.  

      Stroller Mom says to Vicki:

                                  STROLLER MOM
                    Phoebe, huh?  You re brave.

                                  VICKI
                    Brave..?

                                  SUNGLASSES MOM
                    You know.  She s single again.  

      She pauses.  Is it an opening for Vicki to say something?

                                  VICKI
                    Oh.  That -- I guess so.

                                  SUNGLASSES MOM
                    She makes me feel like a Hobbit.

                                  YOGA MOM
                    I m always like --  Hi Phoebe!  
                    Don t bang my husband!                                                                                     13.


                                  STROLLER MOM
                    Sit with the Hobbits!  We never see 
                    you lately.  I mean, what s 
                      happening?

                                  YOGA MOM
                    Oh my God.  I ran into Jake at drop 
                    off yesterday.  
                          (fishing)
                    Are you guys cleansing?  You both 
                    look so thin...

                                  LYLA
                    So, hey.  We d better get going.  
                    But let s do this again.

      Lyla flashes her fake smile, steers Vicki toward the table 
      where Phoebe waits.  A beat as Kate makes an apologetic face 
      to the others, then awkwardly follows Vicki off.

      Vicki and Kate sit with Phoebe and Lyla.

      As they arrange themselves, we see that Phoebe s got a ton of 
      new-age jewelry on.  A Kabbalah string, an evil eye, an 
      Indian  Ganesha ...  Lyla nods at the other moms, teases:

                                  LYLA (CONT D)
                      Seriously, Phoebe, if you could 
                    just look like crap, you d have way 
                    more friends.  I m this close to 
                    hating you.

      Phoebe laughs and blows Lyla a kiss.  There s an uneasy vibe 
      between Kate and the others.  Kate s protective of Vicki, 
      suspicious of her flashy new single pals.

      Vicki nods toward the other table of MOMS.  They are talking 
      quietly, stealing looks back at Vicki and her friends.  

                                  VICKI
                    Look at them.  They know.  They 
                    were trying to break me.

                                  LYLA
                          (laughs)
                    Okay.  Calm down, CSI Hollywood--

                                  KATE
                    Jake s been out of your house for 
                    weeks.  Of course people are 
                    talking.

                                  VICKI
                    About what?  We ve been careful.                                                                                      14.


                                  LYLA
                    But nobody sees you two together 
                    anymore.  And now suddenly you re 
                    hanging with us.  

                                  PHOEBE
                    The whores with the scarlet  D  on 
                    their chests.

                                  KATE
                    Just because we re still married...  
                    You ve kind of disappeared and they 
                    miss you, that s all.  Nobody 
                    thinks that.

                                  VICKI
                    I did.  I thought that about you 
                    whores.  

      Phoebe, Lyla and Vicki laugh at this.  But Kate is kind of 
      uncomfortable.  A beat, then she offers helpfully:

                                  KATE
                    Why don t you tell your kids, Vic?  
                    Keeping up this act for everyone, 
                    it s too much--

                                  VICKI
                    Betsy Braun Brown said it s better 
                    not to, not until we know what 
                    we re doing.  Separation just makes 
                    children anxious. 

                                  KATE
                    Who s Betsy Braun Brown?

      All three look at Kate.  Assumed she d know.

                                  LYLA
                    Just the best kid shrink in town.  
                    Everybody has her on speed dial 
                    after they split.

                                  PHOEBE
                          (to Vicki)
                    What does your couples guy say 
                    about the whole thing?

                                  VICKI
                    No, couples is a lady.  My 
                      individual shrink is a guy.  They 
                    agree.                                                                                    15.


                                  LYLA
                    Three shrinks?  Jesus, you have 
                    more specialists than a Russian 
                    Gymnast.  

                                  VICKI
                    It s ridiculous. 
                          (counts off)
                    The nanny, the housekeeper, the 
                    gardener, the organic garden lady, 
                    the trainer, the three shrinks...

                                  KATE
                          (chiming in)
                    Dog walker, dog groomer, house 
                    sitter, decorator, computer guy, 
                    piano teacher, tutor, dentist-- 

                                  LYLA
                    No.  Medical s a separate category.

                                  PHEOBE
                    What about beauty?  Botox lady, 
                    eyebrow lady, tanning lady, eyelash 
                    lady, hair stylist, clothes 
                    stylist, manicurist, waxer--

                                  LYLA
                    Like you need any of that.  You re 
                    a genetic freak.  Vicki has to have 
                    those people.  Turning all hairy 
                    and wrinkled and gray and natural, 
                    right when she might be on the 
                    market?  No.
                          (to Vicki/decisive)
                    Ditch the garden lady, the 
                    decorator and the dogs.

                                  VICKI
                    Maybe I won t have to.  If Jake 
                    moves back in, we go back to normal 
                    -- and the kids won t even have to 
                    know he was gone.

      Lyla and Phoebe exchange a look.  

                                  PHOEBE
                    Oh, Lady...

                                  LYLA
                          (gently)
                    He s sleeping around like a Saudi 
                    prince.  And he s not hiding it.                                                                                    16.


      Vicki takes this in, surprisingly stung.  Kate shoots Lyla a 
      stern look, pissed.  Kate puts a comforting hand on Vicki.

                                  KATE
                      I wouldn t say Jake s  sleeping 
                    around. 

                                  VICKI
                    Why?  What have you heard?

                                  KATE
                    Nothing.  Mark talks to him.  
                          (to Phoebe and Lyla)
                    My husband.  I don t.  

                                  VICKI
                    What have you heard?
                          (catches herself)
                    Forget it.  I m glad Mark and Jake 
                    are still tight...

      Hot tears spring to Vicki s eyes.  She wipes them away.

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  God.  I don t know why...  
                    I know he s been dating.  And 
                    rubbing my nose in it.  But hearing 
                    it like that makes it real, you 
                    know?

                                  KATE
                    He s been on a few dates.  That s 
                    all Mark said.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Vicki.  Ralf said he saw him at the 
                    Chateau with some CW actress.  They 
                    were getting a room. 

                                  VICKI
                    An actress...?  Who plays a parent?  
                    Or--

                                  PHOEBE
                          (to Kate/firm)
                    If you know, she should know.  

      Kate looks guilty.  Finally says, reluctant:

                                  KATE
                    Her name s Rebecca Kelly.

      Phoebe and Lyla both frantically Google the name.  Vicki 
      steals herself, says:                                                                                    17.


                                  VICKI
                          (still wiping away tears)
                    I mean, he s allowed.  We re on a 
                    time-out.  To explore what we want.  

                                  LYLA
                          (looking at photo)
                      Apparently, Jake wants a ridiculous 
                    sports car and club snatch.

                                  PHOEBE
                          (it s bad)
                    Oooph.  Maybe you shouldn t--

      Vicki snatches the phone.  Goes pale as she reads the IMDB 
      page.  Stunned, she finally manages:

                                  VICKI
                    Born in...1993.  1993!?

      Vicki s shock quickly turns to BOILING RAGE.  She stands 
      abruptly -- reaches for her phone.  She stops:

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Perfect.  Jake texts:  Need a 
                    check.  Bills.   For his expenses.  
                      Unbelievable.

      Vicki STOMPS OFF.  Kate tries to stop her:

                                  KATE
                    Vicki.  Come on.  Slow down.  Don t 
                    respond when you re angry--

      But Vicki s gone, head bowed, fingers madly FLYING.  Kate 
      winces.  Phoebe immediately starts typing something.  The 
      others glare at her.  She stops:

                                  LYLA
                    Jesus Phoebe!  Are you tweeting?

                                  PHOEBE
                    I m--
                          (puts phone down)
                    Too soon?  Sorry.  



                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    18.




      ACT TWO



      Vicki s back with the ladies, now sitting on the edge of one 
      of those square fountains.  Her head down, between her knees.  
      Phoebe rubs her back.  Kate and Lyla look on, concerned.

                                  PHOEBE
                    I say we hit the sweat lodge, Lady.  
                    You need to purge this toxic crap--

                                  LYLA
                    She needs a drink, you hippie.
                          (to Vicki)
                    He s an idiot, jigar-tala.  A man 
                    with a hard-on is like a 3-year-old 
                    with an Uzi. 
                          (then)
                    What did you say to him?  

                                  KATE
                          (discouraged)
                    Wrote.  Texting leaves a trail, I 
                    always tell the kids--

      Lyla, disbelieving, looks at Kate like  Really?  A lecture?   
      Vicki just shakes her head, silently hands the phone to Lyla.  
      Who can t help but SMILE as she reads:

                                  LYLA
                    Which bills, specifically?  The 
                    suite at the Chateau?  The Princess 
                    Diaries, On Demand?  Fake IDs for 
                    your dates?  Therapy for Lilly, 
                    when she finds out that her dad 
                    likes younger women than Woody 
                    Allen?

                                  PHOEBE
                    Wow.  

                                  LYLA
                    Here s the up-side.  Now you know. 
                    It s over.  You can move on.

      A beat.  Vicki can t go there.  

                                  VICKI
                    It s not that simple.  It s -- he s 
                    angry...  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    19.

                                  VICKI (CONT'D)
                    We re still working on it.  I m not 
                    saying the marriage will go back to 
                    the way it was.  But maybe we can 
                    start over.  The people we are now.

                                  KATE
                    Exactly.  I mean, who wants to be 
                    40 and single.  With kids? 

                                  LYLA
                          (not buying it/to Vicki)
                    Sell it in your cute little books, 
                    Hon.  You re putting lipstick on a 
                    corpse.

                                  KATE
                    Stop.  You don t know that--

                                  VICKI
                    It s okay.  Don t fight, okay?

                                  PHOEBE
                    What I want to know is how come 
                    you re not  exploring? , Vic?  Use 
                    your sex amnesty while you ve got 
                    it, Lady.  

      Phoebe lights an American Spirit.  Hands it to Vicki, who 
      takes a drag.  Kate reacts, a tad scandalized.

                                  KATE
                    You re smoking?

      Vicki shrugs kind of helplessly.  Phoebe offers, re: cigs:

                                  PHOEBE
                    These are fine.  Native Americans 
                    didn t get cancer until they 
                    started spraying.
                          (to Vicki)
                    The first thing I did was fly to 
                    Berlin and get screwed into a coma.  
                    We should all go.  My au pair can 
                    stay with our kids.  

                                  VICKI
                          (wry)
                    Sure, let s get right on that.  

                                  PHOEBE
                    Why not?                                                                                      20.


                                  LYLA
                    Or just -- that guy.  Book that 
                      Chiropractor Gwen found.  The happy 
                    ending guy--

                                  PHOEBE
                    Yes!  Damon Orlando.  He s gorgeous 
                    and he knows how everything works. 

                                  KATE
                    You actually went to him? 

                                  PHOEBE
                          (smiles)
                    And I put it on our insurance.

                                  VICKI
                    How do you do it?  You just, go in 
                    for an appointment and say--

                                  LYLA
                     Doctor, I think I threw my 
                    clitoris out! 

                                  PHOEBE
                    At least come out with me one night 
                    when Jake has the kids.  Ralf s 
                    opening a new club.  

                                  LYLA
                    Why are you always hanging out with 
                    your ex?  It s weird.

                                  PHOEBE
                    I still like him, I just don t want 
                    to live with him.  And he gets me 
                      impossible reservations. 
                          (to Vicki)
                    Come on.  You need this.  

                                  KATE
                          (checking her calendar)
                    Fun!  As long as it s not 
                      Wednesday, Monday or Saturday.

      Phoebe and Lyla meet eyes, annoyed.  She s coming?!  Then:

                                  PHOEBE
                          (sing song)
                    Vicki s gonna get her freak on...

                                  VICKI
                    I didn t say I d  freak.   I mean, 
                    of course I m curious.

                                  VICKI (CONT'D)
                    But getting undressed with someone 
                    new?  With my awful baby boobs?

                                  PHOEBE
                    So fix them.  I have the best tit 
                    doctor in the world.  

                                  VICKI
                    Get out of here.  You did not. 

                                                                          SMASH TO:



      Kate and Vicki linger near Vicki s car.  Kate s concerned: 

                                  KATE
                    You re not really getting boobs.

                                  VICKI
                    No!  I mean, probably not.

                                  KATE
                    Probably not?  We used to mock 
                    Phoebe and Lyla!  

                                  VICKI
                    We didn t mock them--

                                  KATE
                    But they weren t our friends.  
                    Never in a million years.  With the 
                    heels and the hair and the 
                      surgeries--                                                                                    23.


                                  VICKI
                          (trying to change subject)
                    You have to admit the boobs looked--

                                  KATE
                    Amazing.  But Mark would never let 
                    me and you know Jake wouldn t--   

                                  VICKI
                    Jake?  Of the baby CW actress?  
                    Jake doesn t get a vote.

                                  KATE
                    This isn t you, Vicki.  It s them.

                                  VICKI
                    I was wrong about Phoebe and Lyla.  
                    They re fun.  And we look out for 
                    each other.  Phoebe calls me every 
                    day and Lyla, she s fierce.  She 
                    won t let me take any crap from 
                    Jake.  They get it, you know?

                                  KATE
                    I get it.  But I want what s good 
                    for you, not plastic boobs--

      Vicki s getting mad now.  She shuts Kate down.  Hard.

                                  VICKI
                    Look.  I m doing my best.  And you 
                    can t understand.  Not totally.  
                    And that s okay.  So, please, let s 
                    all be good.  Okay?

                                  KATE
                          (a beat/then)
                    Of course.  I m sorry.  This is a 
                    crazy time, you re allowed.  Just 
                    nothing over a C cup, promise? 

                                  VICKI
                      I promise.  Hug me.

      They hug, but it s not as comforting as they want it to be.



      Later.  Vicki, stylishly put together for a work lunch, sits 
      under an olive tree in the dining area of the SOHO house.  

      Hollywood A-listers enjoy panoramic views of the hills and 
      beyond, while munching on hummus and quinoa.                                                                                      24.


      This is the world of cut-throat players pretending to be 
       California casual. 

      Across from Vicki sits her legendary BOOK EDITOR, CAT.  Cat 
      is pretty damn old, 70 s?  But feisty.  

      Cat has spread out some publicity headshots and book tour ads  
      for Vicki s approval.  Vicki examines them.  She looks too 
      polished in the photos, unlike herself.  

      Vicki s drinking wine, a bit loose.

                                  VICKI
                    I look like a cyborg.

                                  CAT
                    I know.  Isn t it great?  
                          (off Vicki s look)
                    Too much.  This is just for the 
                    book tour stuff.  

                                  VICKI
                    Oh, fine.  Go with Blade Runner.  

                                  CAT
                    We re getting media requests for 
                    the whole family together.  Dr. 
                    Phil--

                                  VICKI
                    No way.  

                                  CAT
                    Dr. Oz?  Any Oprah Doctor?  

                                  VICKI
                    I don t want the kids on TV--

                                  CAT
                    Why not?  You write about them.  
                    Your readers feel like they know 
                    all of you, like they watched the 
                    kids grow up--  

                                  VICKI
                    In their imaginations.  Have you 
                    looked at my daughter lately?  All 
                    lithe and blonde and...  How long 
                    before Cruise s guy asks her to be 
                    Tom s next child bride?  

                                  CAT
                    Just Jake then.  It s not only you 
                    we re selling.  It s the family.                                                                                    25.


                                  VICKI
                          (evasive)
                    I don t know.  He s super busy.

                                  CAT
                    Doing what?

                                  VICKI
                    He s prepping this indie he s going 
                    to direct.

                                  CAT
                          (gathering her stuff)
                    So is our waiter.  Tell him he s 
                    coming.  No excuses.
                          (off her silence)
                      Everything okay?

                                  VICKI
                    Sure.  I ll talk to him.

                                  CAT
                    Good.  I have to dash.  You and 
                    Jake.  The Grove.  This Thursday.  
                    I ll have press there.  Just give a 
                    few interviews, pose for a few 
                    happy snaps.  Easy peasy.

                                  VICKI
                          (weakly)
                    Easy peasy.

      OFF Vicki, looking a little panicked as she downs her wine.



                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    26.


      ACT THREE



      A massive McMansion of a house.  Looks like a Four Seasons, 
      but with more fountains and statues.



      Lyla and Dan are far apart in her outdoor living room, next 
      to a gas fireplace -- which Lyla turns on.

                                  LYLA
                    What the hell are you feeding Eric?  
                    He s getting breasts.                                                                                    28.


                                  DAN
                    He is not.  Listen, Lyla--

                                  LYLA
                    If this is about my pension--

                                  DAN
                    It s not.  
                          (with difficulty)
                    I wanted you to know before you 
                    heard it around.  I met somebody.

      Lyla takes this in.  Still.  Not betraying anything.  

                                  LYLA
                    I hope you ll be happy in your 
                    dungeon together.  Does she know 
                    about your  adventures?  

                                  DAN
                    That s over...  I just -- this new 
                    thing is getting serious so...  

      Lyla stands.  Trying to hide the body blow.  Gets a bottle of 
      wine from inside, comes back out.  In a quiet rage.

                                  LYLA
                    That s over?!  You told me you d 
                       committed to a lifestyle --

                                  DAN
                    I thought I did.  I think -- I just 
                    craved being humiliated when you 
                    and I were together.
                          (off her silent glare)
                    I ve been doing a lot of work on 
                    myself.  I wanted to do the work 
                    with you, if you remember--

                                  LYLA
                    You were hemorrhaging my money to a 
                      dominatrix! 

      Now Dan marches inside.  Comes back with a glass.  Pours as:

                                  DAN
                    I didn t give up.  You did.

                                  LYLA
                    I did?!  You gave up when you 
                    licked the boot, babe.

      He takes this in.  Sits.  They both kind of deflate.                                                                                    29.


                                  DAN
                    You know I have a lot of shame.  
                    And I did keep this place running.

                                  LYLA
                    Please tell me you haven t brought 
                    her around the kids. 

                                  DAN
                    Not yet.  You ll know before.
                          (then)
                    You okay?

                                  LYLA
                    Please.  

      They sit in silence for a bit.  Lyla thinking.  Then:

                                  LYLA (CONT D)
                    Juanita made too much food.  You 
                    want to eat with me and the boys?

      Dan looks up, grateful.



      Dan is texting at a light.  The light changes.  He finally 
      notices.  Then goes through the intersection -- pulls onto 
      SUNSET.  As he does POLICE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND HIM.

                                  DAN
                    Shit.  



      The sky slowly LIGHTENS, trees shift in TIME LAPSE as a new 
      day comes on.  Jake s car appears.  Parked.



      Vicki leans against the car in front of MEL AND ROSE again, 
      smoking a cigarette from another full pack.  She stops, looks 
      at her shaking hand.  Mutters:  

                                  VICKI
                    Screw it.

      She makes a decision, dials her phone.  Phoebe answers.

                                  PHOEBE (O.C.)
                    Hey, Mama.

                                  VICKI
                    You win.  Get me laid.  



                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    34.


      ACT FOUR



      Morning drop off.  The usual parade of fancy cars, model 
      wives, magnates and almost as an afterthought, children.



      Vicki stands outside her car, outside MEL AND ROSE with her 
      daily pack of cigarettes.  She can t get the pack open, 
      struggles with it, frustration building.  

      Finally, she cracks, hurls the pack to the ground.  Stomps on 
      it as she starts to cry.  Bitterly and uncontrollably.  A 
      long time coming.

                                  VICKI
                    Goddamn it!

      She buries her face in her hands.  Then, still weeping, she 
      stoops to pick up the crumpled pack.  Pulls the wrapper off, 
      searching for one intact smoke.  Humiliated.
