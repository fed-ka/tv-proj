DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.
We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes
into view:
the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically
just beyond Pluto's orbit.
We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and
DEEP SPACE
We see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME,
heading for it.
A small vessel, it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is
pristine.
To accentuate the difference, the sudden roar of its engines is
accompanied by
HEAVY, THRASHING ROCK MUSIC.
CUT TO:
AURIGA DOCKING BAY
As it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship.
The bay on the
bottom of the Auriga
- the doors are actually OVER the ship, which rises into the airlock.
THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS
As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft.
AURIGA - CONTINUOUS
The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.
EXPLODES.
Something LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS
into her side, throwing her off balance.
St Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure
cowering in the corner.
Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with
terror.
PURVIS
Get away from me!
CHRISTIE
Drop the rod, man.
Do it!
PURVIS.
Get away...
But the energy is out of him.
The rod falls with a hollow clatter. He
looks weakly from face to face.
PURVIS
What's going on?
St Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls.
ST JUST
Purvis.
What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost
ship.
PURVIS
What ship?
Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew
for the nickel refinery...
I wake up, I don't understand... I saw something... horrible ...
CALL
Look, you come with us.
It's dangerous here.
Ripley SNIFFS.
Cocks her head.
RIPLEY
Leave him.
CALL
Fuck you.
We're not leaving anyone on this boat.
RIPLEY
He's carrying..
JOHNER
He's what?
RIPLEY
He's got one....	inside him. I can smell it.
PURVIS
Inside me? What?
JOHNER
Shit, I don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass.
VRIESS
It's a bad risk.
CALL
We can't just leave him.
VRIESS
I thought you came here to stop them from spreading.
CALL (to Wren, torn)
Isn't there a process, can't you stop it?
ST JUST
We've got no time for that.
WREN
I couldn't do it here. The lab's torn apart.
ST JUST (quietly)
I could do him. Painless, back of the head. Might be the best way.
CALL
There's gotta be another way. If we freeze him --
PURVIS
WHAT'S IN-FUCKING-SIDE ME?!?!?
They all look at him, a bit sheepishly.
WREN
A parasite.
A foreign element that ....
Ripley steps in front of the doctor.
RIPLEY
There's a monster in your stomach. They (indicating the smugglers)
hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him (indicatingWren) and he put
an alien in you. In a few hours it will punch
its way through your
chest and you'll die.
Any questions?
Purvis is wide-eyed, stunned.
After a moment he stammers
PURVIS
Who are you?
RIPLEY
I'm the monster's mother.
She starts heading out of the chamber.
Call turns to the others.
CALL
He comes with us.
We can freeze him on the Betty and get the doctor to
remove it later.
WREN
All right.
JOHNER
Since when are you in fucking charge?
CALL
Since you were born without balls.
VRIESS
Ease off, people.
CHRISTIE (to Purvis, herding him along)
Come with us.
You might even live.
Get twitchy on me and you will be
shot.
They move out.
AURIGA
Gildihg through space, passing Jupiter's moons with dazzling speed.
SPACE
The Auriga races toward:
EARTH.
But not as we've seen it.
The planet is still blue, but almost two thirds of it is obscured by a
giant orbitting latticework of metal, a part shell that rotates sligtly
faster than the
planet itself.
The Auriga heads for a section of exposed earth.
Not long now.
SKY CONTINUOUS
and the Betty SHOOTS DOWN out of the airlock -- Ripley and the newborn
just barely hold on, Ripley's body thrown straight up as she grips the
hatch door for dear life.
The newborn has a better grip -- it has more things to grip with but it
too struggles with the sudden drop.
ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA
Speeding toward the earth.
The Betty SHOOTS out the airlock and nearly
smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes, like trash thrown out
of a speeding car.
THE BETTY
The ship swerves as Call expertly avoids the Auriga -- and see Ripley
and the newborn on top, still fighting for purchase
The Betty gets clear, leveling out --
The Auriga still heads straight for earth, as the terrain below becomes
clear -
- deserted, snow covered mountains
ANGLE: RIPLEY
Hanging on
ANGLE: CALL
Fighting to control the Betty
ANGLE:	INSIDE THE AURIGA
Deserted halls, passageways bodies, and,aliens milling here and there
CALL\SHIP
Collision in six seconds ... five... four...
(softly)
Here we go...
ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA
SMASHES INTO THE GROUND, a deafening exposion eating the massive ship
in seconds, utter cacophony.
ANGLE: THE BETTY
Flying away, the thundering firestorm behind it.
ANGLE: CALL
An instrument panel suddenly SPARKS beside her warning lights flash,
the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence
CALL
Johner!
Fire!
VRIESS
Vector control's fucked! we gotta put down!
CALL
Find me a path!
Johner sprays foam on the fire.
There is a loud BANGING heard far
overhead.
What the fuck is that?
ANGLE: RIPLEY
is slamming her fist on the hatch doors, hanging on with her other arm.
The ship continues to tremble and buck -- she's nearly thrown off.
RIPLEY
Godamnit!
She looks around at the alien.
It's almost on her.
Working its way painfully toward her, gripping with its legs and
tendrils.
Hissing.
It slams a tentacle down at Ripley, but she rolls, just holding on
ANGLE: JOHNER
Above the cockpit, looking at a fuzzy external monitor.
JOHNER
It's Ripley!
Ripley's on the fucking hatch!
In the cockpit, Call nearly goes white.
CALL
Let her in!
JOHNER
Fuck no!
There's something else out there with her!
VRIESS
One of them.
Johner looks at the image, realizes how masive the newborn is.
Awed fear creeps into his voice:
JOHNER
No. it's something else.
Frustrated, Call jumps out of her seat.. Vriess fights to control the
ship as she
climbs up toward the hatch.
VRIESS
Goddamnit, Call!
Johner grabs her, practically throws her at the monitor.
JOHNER
Look at that fucking thing!
We can't open up!
They both tumble as the ship jerks
ANGLE: RIPLEY
Is bucked OFF THE SHIP
before she grabs the newborn's tentacle, holds on to it --
The newborn SMASHES it against he ship, trying to shake her again -
- she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away.
ANGLE: CALL
Pushes Johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence.
ANGLE: VRIESS.
Desperately pulling up as wooded, snowy mountains zoom dangerously
close below.
ANGLE: THE ALIEN
Turns as the HATCH OPENS nearby, the door sliding slowly beast is torn
between Ripley and this new distraction --
Ripley sees it too, starts climbing for it frantically, one on the
newborn.
The beast makes for the doorway -- and CALL POPS HALFWAY OUT pointing a
GRENADE LAUNCHER
at the thing.. She BLASTS it once,
the beast roaring
and starting back, hurt but not nearly enough.
Call fires again but
the ships rocking sends the shot wild.
she flies back for all of a second
The beast rears to attack but Ripley is at the hatch -- Call drags her
in and closes the hatch, the beast just SLAMMING in it as it closes.
BETTY - MOMENTS LATER
The ship sits silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow.
Ripley comes out the top.
She looks around her, sees the tracks in the
snow.
Huge, loping.
She jumps.down off the ship.
And runs.
Through the blur of trees, she moves with the grace and speed of an
animal, leaping from boulders, racing through the powdered brush this
is Ripley at peak speed, and it is something to see.
She starts going up, the way getting steeper and rockier, til she
reaches a cliff face, and looks out on:
A CITY.
Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes it's
just before
the horizon.
The newborn RISES in front of Ripley, STRIKES her before she has a
chance to aim her weapon.
Its tentacle cuts deeply into her, sends her flying.
The beast is on her in a second, its enormous jaws missing her head by
an inch as she rolls, grabs the grenade launcher, FIRE
The beast is thrown, but just grazed, back on her as she tries to get
off another shot, it SLAMS a foot down RIGHT ON HER she SCREAMS, the
launcher rolls free, the beast coming in for the kill and over the
ridge FLIES THE HARVESTER, Call at the controls. aiming right
for the
newborn.
It rears up to see it just as the girl RAMS it into the creatures head,
it knocks it on its ass, the harvester shaking but not quite spinning
out, as Call comes around for another shot.
Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming
harvester, it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last
second -- The monster spins with it, screaming, sees Ripley and slashes
at her.
KNOCKS HER OFF THE CLIFF --
She falls, grabs brush it snaps -- she starts slinding down rockface
and she takes her hand, SLAMS her fingers into the smooth rock face
like a pick axe -- it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase.
ANGLE: CALL
SLAMS into the newborn from behind, the girl nearly thrown out of the
harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it, Call throws it into reverse
but the newborn is too strong, holds on, bringing its head up to face
Call herself.
ANGLE: RIPLEY'S
Bloody and torn, it SMASHES into the rockface, as she climbs back to
the top
ANGLE: THE NEWBORN
SWINGS the harvester into a tree, Call nearly knocked loose again. The
monster is jolted as well, lets go, Call pilots the machine back
through the trees, the alien watching it, growling --
Call flies deftly through the trees, away, away, then spins out, heads
back for the beast at TOP SPEED, the wind roars as she closes
The newborn spins and she SLAMS into it, it goes flying, screaming in
pain,
the harvester bouncing off it, flipping over, CRASHING against
the trees and landing tilted upside down, Call unconscious between it
and the ground.
The newborn shudders, rises, makes for the harvester -- it clearly
pissed.
Ripley pulls herself over the ridge, sees the situation, rushes toward
them.
Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine.
Terrified,
but determined, she reaches for a lever
RIPLEY
No! Over here!
Calling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms.
CALL
Ripley!
Let it come!
Let it come!
Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever. The beast is
torn, and for a
moment doesn't move.
Ripley looks over to where Call is, and understanding blooms on her
face.
She looks around and spots:
ANGLE: THE GRENADE LAUNCHER
Halfway between her and the newborn.
For a moment neither of them moves.
Then Ripley RUNS, the newborn
comes at her with equal speed, like they're playing chicken, Ripley
DIVES at the ground, rolls, comes up holdin the grenade launcher, and
she FIPES!
The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time, and it rears
back, screaming -
- Ripley FIRES and FIRES, driving it back toward the upended harvester.
The alien rears up to its full height, and Ripley pulls.the trigger.
There is a hollow click.
Furious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast.
A SSCREAM wells up in
her throat and she
THROWS herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and
sending both
of them tumbling onto the Harvester.
Call pulls the lever.
In an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to
top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as
layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes.
And it SHRIEKS, a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically.
Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close --
but the beast grabs her, holds her.
The blades ever closer as she
struggles with it.
ANGLE: CALL
Still trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the
machine all around her!
She squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck.
A stream of blood
lands on her shoulder, eating it away.
Another on her leg, and panic
blooms, bright in her.
CALL
RIPLEY!
Galvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself out of the beast's dying
grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and
spark, blood eating through the controls.
Call writhes, blood everywhere now.
She is lost in primal terror.
Ripley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood
splattering her, wrenchs Call free.
She drags her' out.
A section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the
dying alien.
Call lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around
her.
Covered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames,
breathing hard,
holding each other as if their lives depended on it
still.
DISSOLVE TO.- ANGLE: THE NEWBORN'S SKULL
Burning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it.
Collapsing
gently on itself.
WIDE ANGLE:
SAME - LATER
The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire, watching the flames.
Vriess tosses 'Christie a bottle of whiskey.
JOHNER
The bitch takes her time in burning.
VRIESS
Well, it looks like she's finally giving it up.
JOHNER
Troopers should be finding our ship any time now. 1 don't much love the
idea of being around when they do.
Ripley gets up, looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city.
Christie offers the bottle to Call.
She takes it and drinks.
VRIESS (to Call)
I guess you won't want to be answering any official Questions either.
CALL
I guess not.
She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together.
VRIESS
Well, we're on Earth, for Chrissake. Plenty of places to get lost here.
CALL
So I've heard.
After a moment, she gets up as well, goes over to Ripley.
She hands
her the bottle.
Ripley looks at it.
CALL
It's a drink.
You drink it.
RIPLEY (smiling) I remember. She drinks.
CALL
So, what do you think?
RIPLEY
Think?
CALL
What should we do now?
RIPLEY
I don't know.
She looks out in the distance...
RIPLEY I'm a stranger here myself
The two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar
horizon, as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame.
