A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer,
makes its way along a stretch of motorway.
2
At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes
closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the
bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He
pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play
on his MP3.
3
Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff
face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera,
Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music
from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day",
a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and
comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.
The track will play over the following opening scenes, the
credits fading subtly in and out in white text.
4
Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset,
pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water,
holding his nose.
SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST
CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS.
2.
6
Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on
his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just
catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.
7
Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of
cocaine onto a clean glass table.
8
Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white
dressing gown, prepares breakfast.
9
Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits.
11
In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He
climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real
enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation.
12
Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same
strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.
13
GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.
14
Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His
mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him.
3.
15
Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water.
16
Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one
half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.
19
Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes
it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.
22
Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad
facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine
mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the
rush.
4.
24
Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears
the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts
it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.
SHIFTY
Fucking hell, man...
Shifty can't help but smile.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
You're early!
CHRIS
Shifty.
A smile creeps across Chris' face.
SHIFTY
Yes, rude boy.
CHRIS
You alright geezer.
SHIFTY
I'm sweet... come in, man, come in.
Shifty and Chris embrace.
CHRIS
Good to see you, mate.
SHIFTY
Good to see you too, geezer.
26
CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP.
Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag
perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.
5.
27
Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and
pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New
DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's,
lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side,
books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked
pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed
across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of
Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning
sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He
stands, staring.
28
Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast
ready. Shifty turns to face him.
SHIFTY
You alright son?
CHRIS
Yeah I just needed to splash my
face, freshen up a bit.
SHIFTY
Have you slept?
CHRIS
Did I fuck.
SHIFTY
Mate, neither have I... I just got
back from some girls yard.
CHRIS
You got a bird?
SHIFTY
No, no... just some fucking booty
call.
CHRIS
What, Break Glass Arse?
SHIFTY
In case of emergency's, man... you
know it.
They both laugh. Shifty lays sausages into a pan.
CHRIS
She fit?
SHIFTY
What!
6.
CHRIS
She fit?
SHIFTY
Yeah, she's alright you know....
She's got fucking massive Gary's.
Chris laughs.
CHRIS
You always loved your titties,
bruv.
SHIFTY
You know that!
Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Mate, do you mind halal?
CHRIS
No, no, that's sweet mate,
whatever.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Were you on just one bus?
CHRIS
Yeah... no sorry, two. I had to
change at Luton.
SHIFTY
LUTON!
CHRIS
Yeah, man.
SHIFTY
Fucking random.
Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving
about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer,
opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large
bag of sweet corn.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
I've got a few things to do today
geezer, you can stay here if you
want, just chill out.
He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out
tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places
them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty
closely, but doesn't say anything.
7.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Or you can come with me?
CHRIS
Whatever.
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(whispers)
Does your brother know you keep
those there?
Shifty shakes his head.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
(Whispering)
You not worried?
SHIFTY
Mate, he doesn't eat vegetables.
Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm.
WE STAY ON CHRIS' FACE, AS HE TAKES IT IN.
SHIFTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Apart from in a pot noodle.
29
We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and
walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old
boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth
Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl
eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst
talking on the phone.
JASMINE
(on phone)
... she's living like a drifter babe,
I'm telling you, she's split... sort
of... with Stefan... I know she did...
but she stays at Mike's in the
week, and then she's back at
Stefan's at the weekend... with the
kids (to baby) Katie, darling, stop
banging your bowl...
Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out
for him. His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow.
8.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
(on phone)
...Neither knows about the other, and
then she expects me (she drops to a
whisper) to fucking cover for her
(normal volume) Stefan's my mate
for Christ's sake, I'm not getting
caught up in that whole mess (to
boy) Freddie, sit down and finish
your breakfast!
This is too much for Trevor. He turns and walks away from the
table.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
(on phone)
... and she has a go at me for taking
on too much
(she laughs - then without
looking up)
Babe, I'm cooking you some eggs...
SLAM - the front door crashes shut - he's gone - his
breakfast untouched.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
Oh... what... nothing, Trevor's just
walked out without touching his
breakfast... I don't know, I thought
so anyway...
30
Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's
temperament, and watches through the front room window as he
drives away.
10.
32
Shifty's laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez,
Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris.
REZ
(PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED)
Motherfucker, the return of the
white man.
Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and
grabs a glass of orange juice from the side.
CHRIS
How you doing Rez, good to see you,
man?
REZ
I wondered why I could hear voices.
I thought he'd brought home a rent
boy again.
SHIFTY
Shut up you prick.
REZ
(To Chris)
You look like a rent boy.
CHRIS
What are you talking about?
Points at Chris.
REZ
That top cost more than my
education.
CHRIS
My pants cost more than your
education.
REZ
(sings)
Cold blooded.
Shifty lays down three plates of breakfast. Rez fakes a heart
attack.
SHIFTY
(PAKISTANI)
Soak it in fat boy.
CHRIS
I take it this doesn't happen
often.
11.
REZ
You know what, I'm emotional,
where's my camera, bring me my
camera. Quick, man, quick.
SHIFTY
Yeah, fucking laugh it up.
REZ
(PAKISTANI)
Don't worry I will.
Shifty sits down and they begin their food.
33
MORNING.
All three of them eat in silence. Chris' eyes dart
occasionally to Rez who pays no attention to anything but the
food. There is an uncomfortable air in the room.
35
Trevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key. We
see that he doesn't have a huge amount left in his wrap.
36
Shifty's putting away breakfast, Chris and Rez sit at the
table. Rez stabs away with a tooth pick measuring up Chris,
who reads a magazine.
REZ
(to Chris)
Do you think I've put on weight?
Chris looks up.
CHRIS
What?
REZ
Do you think I've put on weight?
12.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
I dunno. Not really.
He's lying.
REZ
(to Shifty)
I told you I haven't put on that
much weight.
Shifty lets out a sarcastic laugh.
REZ (CONT'D)
How long since you've been back?
Shifty sits back down and answers for Chris.
SHIFTY
Four years.
REZ
Is that the last time I saw you,
fucking hell?
CHRIS
Yeah. Was it? Yeah, four years ago
I think.
A BEAT.
REZ
Where you living?
CHRIS
Manchester.
REZ
What you doing?
CHRIS
What, work wise? I'm in
recruitment.
REZ
Good money?
Chris abandons his magazine.
CHRIS
I do alright, yeah.
REZ
How much?
13.
CHRIS
(laughs)
Enough.
REZ
You need to get this Gadha (donkey)
some work, four A-levels and no
job.
SHIFTY
I pay you fucking rent don't I?
Silence.
REZ
Girlfriend?
CHRIS
No, not yet.
REZ
Gay?
CHRIS
No... you?
REZ
I'm asking the questions padre... for
your information... no, I'm not...
but Shifty is.
SHIFTY
Jokes.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
(to Chris)
What have you got, rent or
mortgage?
CHRIS
Fucking hell, tag team... Mortgage.
REZ
That's nice.
SHIFTY
Yeah, mature, man.
A BEAT.
REZ
Why do you leave without saying
goodbye to my brother?
Chris is stumped. Shifty looks down at the floor.
14.
SHIFTY
Rez, man...
REZ
I'm only joking...
A BEAT.
REZ (CONT'D)
But really, why?
SHIFTY
Leave him alone.
REZ
I need info, man. I'm like a
sponge, do you know what I mean,
I'm like a flannel... How come
your back, what's the deal?
SHIFTY
I invited him to a party.
REZ
Who's party?
CHRIS
Rachel's.
REZ
Rachel who?
SHIFTY
Rachel Price.
REZ
Who?
SHIFTY
Mate, Rachel and Serena.
Rez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy
stare.
REZ
Oh right.
Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw
nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the
ice by talking about a more trivial topic.
SHIFTY
(to Rez)
You remember Rachel, you fucking
lunged her at Jazzbo Browns?
15.
REZ
WHAT... that's BULLSHIT.
CHRIS
Yeah, yeah, you went in for the
kill and she lent away like she was
doing the fucking limbo.
Chris is back in the conversation.
SHIFTY
Her ponytail swept the floor.
Shifty and Chris touch fists.
REZ
You boys need to get your facts
straight... she fucking lunged me.
CHRIS
You couldn't even remember who she
was five minutes ago.
Shifty and Chris crack up laughing.
SHIFTY
(to Chris)
I wouldn't mind if he did it
discreetly, but he lunged her from
about three feet.
Shifty mimics Rez's historic lunge, Rez starts to laugh at
the memory of it, covering his face with his hands.
37
Trevor tries the mobile again but gets the same message. He
throws his phone onto the passenger seat and exits the car.
38
They still sit around the table.
SHIFTY
(to Rez)
You can come along if you want.
REZ
(sarcastically)
Yeah, I feel like it now, don't
I... fucking hell...
Suddenly the door bell goes.
16.
REZ (CONT'D)
(to Shifty)
Get that, it's probably your viagra
delivery.
SHIFTY
Fuck off.
39
Shifty opens the door.
SHIFTY
(suspicious)
Trevor.
TREVOR
Alright mate.
Shifty steps out and pulls the door to behind him.
40
Rez stares at Chris who's still reading a magazine.
REZ
So come on, why are you back...
really?
Chris looks up at him. He's not ready for this question.
CHRIS
Because of the, erm, because of the
party...
REZ
There's been hundreds of parties
mate, what's so special about this
one?
CHRIS
I dunno, I just wanted to see
Shifty didn't I.
Rez just stares at him. Chris looks back at the magazine,
trying to pretend he's reading.
41
Still watching Chris, Rez speaks.
REZ
For some reason... I dunno why...
he still thinks of you as his best
mate.
He get's up to leave.
REZ (CONT'D)
Why don't you try acting like one.
WE'RE TIGHT ON CHRIS. HE'S TAKEN ABACK BY REZ'S COMMENT.
18.
43
Trevor goes to walk away.
SHIFTY
Trevor...
TREVOR
Yes mate...
SHIFTY
Don't ever fucking come to my house
again.
TREVOR
Yeah, no worries, I'm sorry, man.
Shifty walks in, shutting the door. Rez walks past him to go
upstairs.
REZ
Who was that?
SHIFTY
Nothing, geezer wanted to talk to
me about a job.
REZ
What job.
SHIFTY
Labouring.
Rez ascends the stairs.
REZ
What did you say?
SHIFTY
I'd think about it.
Shifty goes to walk off.
44
Rez, reaching the top of the stairs, calls down.
REZ
Shafiq.
SHIFTY (O.S.)
What!
REZ
Don't forget.
19.
SHIFTY (O.S.)
What?
REZ
Mum and dads.
SHIFTY (O.S.)
(PAKISTANI)
Do me a favour.
REZ
(PAKISTANI)
Just do it.
45
Shifty looks agitated.
SHIFTY
(PAKISTANI)
I'm going to this fucking party.
REZ (O.S.)
(PAKISTANI)
What time.
SHIFTY
(PAKISTANI)
Nine.
REZ (O.S.)
(PAKISTANI)
You can be there at seven.
SHIFTY
(PAKISTANI)
For fucks sake.
46
REZ
(PAKISTANI)
JUST FUCKING BE THERE.
47
Shifty stands there, seething, and walks away.
48
Trevor, sits in his van, by the telephone box waiting..
20.
49
Shifty and Chris stand in the hallway putting on their
jackets. They go to leave when Shifty stops and considers
something.
SHIFTY
Actually, let's go out the back
way, it'll be quicker.
They head for the garden.
50
Trevor sits. Waiting. He taps his finger on the steering
wheel. Agitated. Every second an eternity.
51
Trevor drives slowly past the house to see Rez putting out
the rubbish. Rez turns around and stares at Trevor. Trevor
looks away and drives off.
53
Jasmine sits on the toilet, she opens a pregnancy test and
urinates onto it.
54
*
*
DAY (PART 2)
Freddie is on his games console. He's at the controls of a
racing game. It's on really loud.
CUT TO:
Holding up the pregnancy test Jasmine see's it turn to a plus
sign. She's pregnant again.
CUT TO:
Tight on the screen as Freddie's computerised car screeches
around a corner.
CUT TO:
Jasmine stares forward, her face fretful.
CUT TO:
Freddie's car smashes loudly against a barrier.
CUT TO:
22.
Sitting, staring, suddenly Jasmine notices something on the
tiled surface. She rubs her finger over it to reveal the
residue of a white powder.
CUT TO:
The game is loud. Echoing through the house.
CUT TO:
She dabs finger with tongue, her face sours. She was almost
hoping she was wrong.
CUT TO:
Freddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent.
CUT TO:
Jasmine's eyes are alive with rage; the TV bellows out -
suddenly she stands, pulls up her kickers and steams towards
Freddie's room.
JASMINE
(screaming)
TURN THAT FUCKING TV DOWN BEFORE I
THROW IT OUT OF THE FUCKING WINDOW!
Freddie little face is totally bewildered.
55
Rez lays down a prayer mat. He kneels down and begins to
pray.
57
Viewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the
rear door. Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it
to Lenny.
GLEN
What are we waiting for?
LENNY
Give me a fucking break I'm rushing
my tits off...
Lenny attempts to start the car.
LENNY (CONT'D)
Where's the keys babe?
LORETTA
Let's just go Lenny. I'm freaking
out.
Lenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously
tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers. They drive
off, frog-hopping the VW down the road.
GLEN
Yeah, it's a good job we're not
making a fucking scene.
59
Trevor makes his way across muddy terrain to a porta-cabin
and let's himself in. We follow him into see Bob Moran,
portly, sitting at a desk, another gentleman, in a suit and
hard-hat stands before the desk. Bob spots Trevor.
BOB
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
TREVOR
Bob!
Bob comes around from his side of the desk.
BOB
No, Trevor, no.
TREVOR
Bob just hear me out.
BOB
Get out of my office.
TREVOR
Bob please I've paid out on all the
materials, I've lost money.
BOB
You should have thought about that
before you started bringing drugs
onto my site.
TREVOR
You owe me money.
BOB
I owe you fuck all.
TREVOR
YOU OWE ME MY FUCKING MONEY.
BOB
Tell it to the police, and I'll
tell `em why you got kicked off the
fucking job.
TREVOR
Bob, please.
28.
BOB
Fuck off, Trevor.
Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows.
TREVOR
Bob.
Bob ignores him.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Bob I need this money.
Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to
him. Trevor stands behind them.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Bob!
Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand.
BOB
Thank's for coming today Trevor,
we'll definitely be in touch.
Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob
turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment
then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with
emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it
together.
61
Trevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his
dashboard.
63
Rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine
and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but
it comes out completely from the machine.
REZ
FUCK!
He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez
gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks
in the gap, and sees something.
30.
He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has
something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through,
watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez
sits back against the machine just staring at it.
64
On Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting
bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds
of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing
gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the
emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her
haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum.
31.
WE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIM
WATCHING HER.
67
Shifty and Chris stand before a racing green door upon which
a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number
eight. Shifty knocks on the door. Silence. He stares at the
emblem of the cat.
SHIFTY
Fucking cat lovers.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
I can't stand people who feed their
cat's... fucking red snapper... or
goose liver, because they say the
fucking things fussy...
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
...it's a fucking cat.
SHIFTY
Wait until you see this...
CHRIS
*
Starve the fucking thing for a week
and it'll eat a condom, do you know
what I mean...
Shifty laughs. Then they stand for a second waiting. Shifty
knocks again.
SHIFTY
C'mon Val.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Sorry about this geez.
CHRIS
Mate, it's cool.
SHIFTY
I didn't wanna drag you around all
day.
32.
A BEAT.
Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a
shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps,
echoing down the clinical looking hallway.
69
*
We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and
colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller.
We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the
first time. At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands
and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is
clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping
cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.
A BEAT.
Valerie looks towards Chris.
SHIFTY
Valerie, this is Chris, he's erm,
he's an old friend of mine, we grew
up together. He's cool. We go way
back. So it's cool, you know.
CHRIS
How you doing?
He offers a hand that she takes politely.
VALERIE
Yeah. Hi.
A moment of uncomfortable silence.
SHIFTY
I called yesterday but you were
out.
VALERIE
When?
SHIFTY
I dunno, It was probably about two
in the afternoon.
VALERIE
I was in all day.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
You must have been asleep.
33.
VALERIE
No, no I was awake, I didn't sleep.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
I dunno then.
VALERIE
Did you say two o'clock.
SHIFTY
Yeah.
VALERIE
Are you sure it wasn't two thirty.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
It may have been.
VALERIE
I was out on the balcony at two
thirty.
A BEAT.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
But I was in here at two.
A BEAT.
VALERIE (CONT'D)
I'll make us some tea.
SHIFTY
Yeah, that'll be sweet.
70
*
Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front
room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks
up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days,
fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He
looks slightly shocked to see this.
CUT TO:
Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room.
He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves
his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not
moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all
the cats in the room are stuffed.
34.
Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the
deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the
wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat
ornaments rattle.
71
*
Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the
counter top.
SHIFTY
How you been, alright.
VALERIE
Yeah, I'm alright babe, you
alright?
SHIFTY
Yeah, I'm alright.
VALERIE
Good, good.
Silence as Valerie prepares the tea.
SHIFTY
She visited you yet?
VALERIE
No... not for a long time,
Shifty... not seen her for a long
time really, darling.
Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the
tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He
places a hand on her arm.
SHIFTY
She'll come back one day.
They carry on making the tea.
72
*
The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A
fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink.
Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before
Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what
he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small
yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a
smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments
falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie
walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully
back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by
the music.
35.
We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to
her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her
lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.
CHRIS
No, no, I'm fine......thanks
though.
CLOSE ON SHIFTY.
SHIFTY
Look Val we're gonna have to do
one...
THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO
SHIFTY...
Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding
bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly
unsettled by what he's seen.
73
*
Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark
hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty
peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway -
a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the
hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal
a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays
out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old,
Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the
films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty,
cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to
the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just
staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed.
Shifty stares him out.
36.
*
SHIFTY
Alright mate?
OTIS
Alright.
Shifty looks about at the room.
SHIFTY
What's your name?
OTIS
Otis.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Where do you get your weed from?
OTIS
It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my
mate left it, he left it here... I
could phone him if you want, he'll
sort you out...
SHIFTY
Where d'you get your fucking weed
from rude boy?
A BEAT.
OTIS
I get it from this geezer... Glen
Dowdy innit.
Shifty smiles.
SHIFTY
No, you don't.
74
OTIS
No his names Glen, I'm sure it is
man, his names Glen innit?
OTIS' GIRLFRIEND
Yeah, I think so.
37.
SHIFTY
From now on you get your weed from
me...
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
At half the price.
Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly
confused.
76
SHIFTY
I'm gonna sell you your weed half
price, and your gonna keep this
noise down.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Yeah?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
(with threat)
YEAH?
At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris
standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the
situation.
OTIS
Yeah, alright, yeah.
SHIFTY
Because if I hear one word of
complaint from next door, just one
single complaint, I'll come back
here and I'll take your TV, I'll
take your stereo, and I'll shove em
up your birds arse.
He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Do you understand me?
38.
Otis nods.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
OTIS
Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry,
man, I didn't know I had it on
loud, I would have turned it down,
I'm sorry.
Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty
picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis'
wall.
SHIFTY
Call me if you need any more weed.
He walks into the hallway, past Chris.
CHRIS
(almost disdain)
You don't miss a fucking trick.
SHIFTY
You know it.
78
Shifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of
the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates.
CLOSE ON: THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE READS: TREVOR P MOB.
Shifty hits the reject button. Chris follows behind.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
That was all a bit fucking surreal.
SHIFTY
What d'you mean?
CHRIS
I can't believe you just sold crack
to Miss Marple and struck a deal
with Blazing Squad.
Shifty laughs as they carry on descending.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
How old is she?
39.
SHIFTY
About 70.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
She's been doing drugs longer than
we've been alive.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
Yeah, d'you reckon.
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
When did you start knocking out?
SHIFTY
Knocking out what?
CHRIS
(lowers his voice)
Crack.
SHIFTY
I dunno, about...three, three and a
half years ago.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Why when d'you stop knocking out
pills.
CHRIS
When do you think?
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Do you get involved?
SHIFTY
No.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Have you?
CHRIS
Fuck that.
They still descend the stairs.
40.
SHIFTY
Do you wanna try it?
Chris looks at him, unsure if he's joking.
CHRIS
Only if I get a fucking discount.
SHIFTY
(Asian accent)
I have to charge you wholesale, you
know. I got family in Pakistan,
they need ticket for plane travel,
man.
They both laugh.
79
Jasmine is at the kitchen table with Freddie and Katie who
are doing potato painting. Jasmine is dialing her mobile. She
presses it to her ear.
80
Trevor is parked up in his van, just staring out. We see his
phone vibrating on the dash board. He answers.
TREVOR
Jasmine...
81
Her tone is cold distant.
JASMINE
Where's the credit card?
TREVOR
What for?
JASMINE
I want to book a hire car.
TREVOR
We don't need one.
JASMINE
How are we gonna get about with two
kids.
TREVOR
We'll get taxis.
41.
JASMINE
It'll be cheaper to get a hire car.
TREVOR
Jasmine, we're not getting a hire
car.
JASMINE
Don't ruin this for me, Trevor.
TREVOR
What do you mean?
JASMINE
Don't ruin this holiday for me.
Trevor goes quiet.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
Are you still there?
TREVOR
Yeah.
JASMINE
Where are you?
TREVOR
Where do you think. I'm on site.
JASMINE
It doesn't sound like it...
A BEAT.
TREVOR
Babe, look I've got to go,
JASMINE
Well what should I do about the
car?
TREVOR
Babe, I've gotta go, Bob's calling
me... we'll talk about it later...
I'll call you...
CLICK! He puts down the phone.
82
Jasmine sits there for a moment, slightly distracted, then
carries on painting with the kids, her mind elsewhere.
42.
83
Glen sits perched on the end of the bed, his top off. Loretta
lays on her side, behind him.
GLEN
Magnus, Magnus...
He gets up and walks about.
GLEN (CONT'D)
... is that better?...it's Glen...
you alright... can you hear me?...
yeah I'm good mate, I'm good... No,
you...no mate... no I, erm, I put

a lot of `em have said the same
thing... it's, erm, it's Shifty
innit... Shifty... yeah, yeah

(MORE)
48.
GLEN (CONT'D)
I mean I could have told you that
in the first place, mate...who else
is it gonna be... Cos I tell you
one thing, I aint fucking cutting
up the gear, Lenny aint fucking
cutting it up is he, look at the
*

prick told me to go fuck myself,
said he'll call you himself... the
geezers getting out of control
Magnus, something needs to be
done...alright mate...alright, I'll
speak to you later...cheers
mate...CLICK!
He stands there for moment, thinking. He walks over to
Loretta and pulls back the sheets. He leans over and starts
kissing her all over, she tries to ignore him, but he's
licking her ear, grinding his crotch into her arse.
LORETTA
Glen, I'm not in the mood.
He doesn't listen, and pulls down her knickers.
90
*
Trevor's makes his way through the lifeless avenues of
Dudlowe, a repetitive New-York house tune plays out - Trevor
does a line of coke off the tip of a credit card.
92
*
We see Trevor walk back to the van, in his hand he has a can
of beer. Getting in, he settles down and begins to unwrap his
gram of coke on the passenger seat. He places down the can to
take a hit when suddenly he knocks it, spilling beer all over
the cocaine.
TREVOR
No, no, no, no, oh fuck, oh fucking
hell.
He's at it. His fingers dabbing at the clammy remnants,
fingering it into his gums and teeth.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Fuck...fuck...
94
We're at Blair Wyards, 35. His room is full of twelve inch
vinyl and cool framed posters. They all sit around on low
comfy chairs. Blair smokes on a stacked spliff.
SHIFTY
How many do you want?
BLAIR
Just two... fuck it, it's Friday,
make it three... Yeah, make it
three.
SHIFTY
How about four!
BLAIR
Do me a favour, Jesus Christ.
98
Shifty's phone goes off on vibrate. He looks at the screen:
TREVOR P MOB. He ignores it, rifles through his cellophane
bag and pulls out three grams of coke.
SHIFTY
What's work saying?
BLAIR
Fuck all really.
SHIFTY
(to Chris)
Blair works at St. Marks.
53.
CHRIS
I used to go there, what do you do?
SHIFTY
He's head caretaker.
CHRIS
Oh right.
Blair laughs.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
What?
BLAIR
I'm not, I'm head of English.
Chris' laugh is met by silence.
CHRIS
What really?
Blair nods.
BLAIR
Yeah.
CHRIS
Mental.
100
BLAIR
How's business?
SHIFTY
Yeah it's good, mate, thriving.
BLAIR
I was reading the other day that
it's a good time to be in the drugs
trade... government's raging war on
terror... no one gives a fuck about
drugs anymore...
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Yeah but I'm a Muslim drug
dealer...
CHRIS
So he's fucked either way.
Blair and Chris laugh.
SHIFTY
Ha Dee fucking Ha... wankers.
Shifty sits back in his chair, thinking.
55.
102
They're driving. Trevor almost fanatical, eyes searching -
Malik in the back of the car, looking anxious, offering
directions.
103
Trevor scours the streets, Malik in the back. The house tune
thumping out.
104
Blair sniffs up a line of coke and offers some to Shifty and
Chris who decline. The mellow tunes plays out. Chris passes
the spliff to Blair who takes a deep drag. Shifty sits back
and looks at the clock on the wall. It reads 18:45. He thinks
for a moment. He looks at the lines of coke lined up on
Blair's table. He looks back at the clock. 18:46. Chris is
watching Shifty.
CHRIS
I tell you what?
SHIFTY
What?
CHRIS
I could fucking smash one of your
mum's curry's.
Shifty looks at Chris straight in the eyes.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Do you think she would have made
food?
SHIFTY
Always.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
We could still make it, man.
Shifty looks at Chris.
A BEAT.
56.
105
Rez stands in the hallway of his parents house, we can see
Shifty's parents in the kitchen chatting to an elderly
gentleman in a suit. Rez looks at his phone, it reads: Shafiq
Mobile. He looks at it for a while. Then answers.
SHIFTY (O.S.)
Rez, it's Shifty
REZ
Yeah.
SHIFTY (O.S.)
Where are you?
REZ
Mum and dads.
106
Rez puts down the phone. He stands there for a while,
thinking, then walks into the kitchen to join his parents and
their guest.
108
Silence as Trevor and Malik drive. Suddenly Trevor notices
Shifty and Chris walking down a grass verge, making their way
beneath the underpass.
57.
He brings the van to a halt at the side of the street. He
exits the van, leaving Malik sitting in the back passenger
seat slightly non-plussed.
109
Jasmine is in the front room ironing. In front of her she has
two suit cases laid out perfectly. She keeps and eye on the
kids who are still painting. She presses one of Trevor's
shirts perfectly.
111
*
Trevor gets back in the van, wiping the blood from his nose
with the sleeve of his shirt and breathing heavily. He's
counting the money, looking in the bag of drugs - PAY DIRT.
He's a bundle of nervous energy.
VOICE
(off screen)
Who d'you fucking rob - Cuba?
Trevor spins round in his seat.
TREVOR
JESUS MALIK... what are you doing?
MALIK
I thought you wanted me to wait.
Trevor starts to laugh; it's a nervous display, almost
relief.
62.
MALIK (CONT'D)
Sort me out with some out that (he
nods to the coke).
A BEAT.
TREVOR
What's it worth?
Malik considers, puts his hand in the bag and pulls out a
camcorder he nicked earlier with a bunch of tapes.
113
*
In a respectable dining room sit Shifty's parents and Mr.
Ahmed. Their silence is awkward as they sit waiting for
Shifty. Shifty's mum pours Mr. Ahmed some tea.
114
*
Trevor takes out a wrap, places a huge pile on the end of a
credit card and tries to snort the lot in one go. His broken
nose proves difficult, blocked by clotted blood, so he eats
the remainder.
115
*
Rez sits on a stool drinking a cup of tea, he tries to ring
Shifty but gets no answer. Rez's face shows frustration.
116
*
Shifty walks down the path and opens the front door, calling
out.
SHIFTY
REZ...
The house is empty.
117
*
Shifty's on the phone.
SHIFTY
... Why... that's not true... Magnus...
Magnus it wasn't... come on, man... I
know but... I know... what the fuck was
I supposed to do... you know I don't...
Magnus, chill out, man... Yeah...
yeah... I'm... fucking... WHAT! I'm
*
not in on anything with Glen...
(MORE)
63.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
*
whatever your problem is with him
that's nothing to do with me... Why
you even use that prick... I...
what...when... I do know who it
was... yeah, Trevor Palmer... you don't
know him... yeah... you don't know him...
but I... yeah... I will, I will, look
man, I didn't kno... I will... CLICK!
FUUUCK!!!
Shifty's punching his bedroom door yelling out.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!
118
*
Shifty's mum shuts the door as Mr. Ahmed leaves. She turns
back into the hallway and suddenly begins to cry. Shifty's
dad walks in and holds her tight, Rez holds back, not knowing
what to do.
119
Trevor unlocks the door and walks into the house, his nose
swollen, face sullen, guilty. We follow as he walks toward
the front room where we see suit cases placed over the floor
as Jasmine busies herself packing. She doesn't look at
Trevor, she's too angry with him.
TREVOR
What are you doing babe?
JAMES
What does it look like.
TREVOR
We've got another three days yet?
64.
JASMINE
I've got two kids to pack for...
Silence.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
...three including you...
TREVOR
Where are they?
JASMINE
Where do you think they are,
they're in bed?
TREVOR
What's wrong with you?
JASMINE
Nothing.
Jasmine walks past him, still not looking him, and into the
kitchen where she takes wet washing from the machine.
TREVOR
Babe, what's the matter?
She walks back past him to the front room.
JASMINE
When did you start using again?
TREVOR
What?
JASMINE
When did you start using cocaine
again?
TREVOR
What are you talking about?
JASMINE
I'm not going through this again
Trevor, don't fucking lie to me.
TREVOR
What are you going on about?
JASMINE
Is that why the card failed.
TREVOR
What?
65.
JASMINE
I tried to book a car and the card
failed?
TREVOR
I told you not book it.
She turns to look at him.
JASMINE
I swore to you Trevor, I said to
*
you...what the fuck happened to
*
your face.
122
The five heavies sit in the car, heavy music playing out, the
motorway lights flashing past.
123
TREVOR
*
Babe people walk into scaffolding
*
all the time.
JASMINE
*
No Trevor only you walk into
*
scaffolding... cos coked off you're
just off you're fucking tits.
TREVOR
I'm not off my tits babe.
JASMINE
What did I say to you Trevor, I
said as god is my witness, I'll
walk out of that door with my kids
and never look back...
TREVOR
Jasmine.
JASMINE
What did I say?
TREVOR
Babe.
JASMINE
What did I fucking say.
Trevor drops his head.
66.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
You promised me you'd stopped, You
swore on your baby daughter's life
that you were clean, Trevor. You
swore on our nine-month old baby
daughter's life that you wouldn't
touch that... that shit anymore.
Trevors starts crying.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
No, don't you cry, don't you dare
fucking cry, because to me that's
even more repulsive. I want you to
be a man for Christ's sake. I want
you to be a fucking man about this,
Trevor, for once in your life take
control of the FUCKING situation.
She's at him, screaming, hitting. He just stands there limp,
absorbing her blows.
JASMINE (CONT'D)
WE'RE YOUR FAMILY, YOU SHOULD BE
FUCKING LOOKING AFTER US YOU WEAK
USELESS PRICK.
Jasmine walks away from him. Trevor's just left there,
pathetic, alone.
124
*
We jump cut as Shifty cleans his cut, puts on a fresh tee
*
shirt, freshens his face in the sink.
124A
*
*
Shifty is then down in the kitchen, at the washing machine.
He pulls out the powder tray, nothing there, he's digging
about inside, he gets a torch, he's trying to peer in,
frantic.
REZ (OS)
Where the FUCK have you been?
Shifty's head darts. They stare at each other for a moment.
SHIFTY
Rez, I'm sorry, man.
REZ
Where the fuck have you been... why
didn't you phone mum and dad?
Rez walks into the kitchen.
67.
SHIFTY
I ran out of juice.
REZ
Why didn't you use a pay phone?
Shifty doesn't answer. Rez looks at the open tray on the
washing machine. Shifty look him in the eye.
SHIFTY
I need it Rez, where is it?
REZ
*
Where is it? Where the fuck is it.
You bring drugs into my fucking
house... the house that I pray
in...
He pushes Shifty hard in the chest.
SHIFTY
Rez, Rez, man.
REZ
I looked after you Shifty, I took
you under my roof, let you live in
my house, and this, this is how you
repay me...
Rez pushes Shifty again hard. Shifty grabs Rez but Rez
punches him around the face, they fall to the floor in a
messy clinch, Rez pulling at shifty's face, hitting him.
SHIFTY
Rez, Rez, Rez...
Shifty
manages to wrangle himself free. Rez is up and at
him.
REZ
Get out of my fucking house, get
out...
*
SHIFTY
Rez, Rez, I need that bag...
REZ
Get out.
SHIFTY
Rez, if you don't give it to me I'm
a dead man.
Rez storms off upstairs. Shifty stands just rubbing his face
with his hands muttering under his breath.
68.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck...
*
He can hear Rez rustling about upstairs. Shifty starts
*
ascending the stairs.
124B
*
*
Shifty's enters the bathroom to see Rez emptying the drugs
into the toilet.
*
SHIFTY
REZ, NO!
REZ
Fuck you.
SHIFTY
REZ!
Rez flushes the chain. Shifty pushes Rez aside and reaches
into the toilet but it's too late.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
What the fuck have you done, what
the FUCK have you done?
REZ
Get the FUCK out.
SHIFTY
Rez.
REZ
Get the FUCK out of my house.
Rez is pushing Shifty again. Shifty backs away down the
steps.
125
The motorway lights flicker through the glass, illuminating
the guys faces. One of them rotates a knife in his hand.
126
Jasmine, still in a bit of a state, her eyes reddened from
tears, sits sorting stuff out in the front room. She picks up
the carrier bag that Trevor brought home with him and looks
inside, she pulls out the camera and tapes.
128
Quietly Trevor sniffs up a corner of coke. He carefully opens
the door to make sure Jasmine's not nearby. He exits and we
follow him into the front room where Jasmine sits with the
Camcorder. She aims it at Trevor and presses record. Jasmine
peers into the Lens.
131
*
Shifty and Chris approach a rundown council flat. The door is
shabby, black bin liners decorate the floor. Shifty knocks.
They stand for a moment when suddenly the door creaks open to
reveal Loretta peaking through.
SHIFTY
Loretta, is Glen there?
She watches them for a moment then shuts the door. Shifty
looks at Chris. They stand for a moment when Glen opens the
door.
71.
GLEN
Shifty.
SHIFTY
Alright mate.
GLEN
What?
SHIFTY
I need to talk to you about
something.
Glen just looks at him.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Can we do it inside.
Glen opens the door. They both walk into the flat. Glen stops
shifty and points for him to go into the bedroom.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
(to chris)
Mate, I'll only be a minute.
Chris walks into the front room where he sees Lenny and
Loretta playing Connect 4.
He looks at Lenny.
CHRIS
Alright mate.
Lenny looks slowly up.
LENNY
Alright.
Chris perches himself on the edge of a dusty old armchair. He
looks at Loretta.
CHRIS
You alright Loretta.
She smiles at him.
LORETTA
You alright Chris.
He smiles nervously.
132
GLEN
What's going on, what are you
fucking doing here?
72.
SHIFTY
Something happened today...
something, I dunno, something
serious... so I phoned Magnus...
talked to him about it... told him
what happened...
GLEN
What Losing all his gear?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Who told you that?
GLEN
Magnus did.
SHIFTY
And what did he say?
GLEN
That you've lost all his gear...
all of his money.
Shifty pauses thinking.
SHIFTY
Yeah well he went mental, saying
some other shit about me cutting it
up, mixing the coke, he was saying
all sorts of... bullshit...
Glen stays quiet. Shifty waits for a reaction.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Why would he be saying that...
who's been talking to him?
A BEAT.
GLEN
Dunno mate, you're guess is as good
as mine.
Shifty pulls out his phone.
SHIFTY
Perhaps you should phone him up
now, here, in front of me, tell him
it's all bollocks.
Glen just looks at Shifty.
GLEN
You can tell him yourself.
73.
Shifty holds the phone to Glen's face.
SHIFTY
Go on mate, call him up, tell him
that I don't cut up the coke.
Glen knocks down Shifty's arm.
GLEN
I don't know what the fuck you do
Shifty?
133
Chris watches Loretta and Glen play connect 4.
134
GLEN
I know that you bowl around this
town like it's your fucking
manor... with your smooth fucking
Paki chat... giving it the large..
SHIFTY
What are you talking about you
prick?
GLEN
Mugging off Magnus, saying that
he's getting weak, losing all his
gear...
SHIFTY
What the FUCK are you going about.
GLEN
And then you come to my house and
you threaten me...
Shifty stays quiet.
GLEN (CONT'D)
...Shooting off your fucking mouth,
telling me what you're gonna do to
Magnus... telling me how you're
gonna take him down...
Shifty stares at Glen, seething.
74.
135
Lenny and Loretta, having ditched the connect 4, are chasing
the dragon from a piece of tin foil. Chris looks totally
uneasy, the situation is making him uncomfortable.
136
SHIFTY
You've been chopping up the fucking
*
gear all along. Selling half of it
to the fucking Turks, cutting out
Magnus.
A BEAT. Glen looks a little shocked by Shifty's revelation.
GLEN
Who told you that?
SHIFTY
Fuck you.
GLEN
Fuck you, you cunt. You're just
jealous cos you didn't think of it
first. You're not that fucking
smart.
SHIFTY
I didn't think of it, cos I'm not
that fucking stupid.
There's a knock at the door. Shifty hesitates, then answers
it.
CHRIS
Mate, can we go?
SHIFTY
Don't worry about it, I'm fucking
leaving.
Shifty goes to walk out with Chris. Glen follows them into
the corridor.
GLEN
It's about time you both fucked
off.
SHIFTY
Fuck off Glen.
GLEN
After what happened.
Shifty and Chris carry on walking out.
75.
GLEN (CONT'D)
No wonder you left mate.
CHRIS
What?
GLEN
Couldn't show your face after what
you did.
CHRIS
What did I do exactly.
GLEN
Get the fuck out of my house.
CHRIS
What the fuck did I do?
SHIFTY
Mate, just leave it the geezers a
wanker.
CHRIS
WHAT DID I FUCKING DO?
GLEN
Don't start shouting mate.
CHRIS
FUCK YOU?
GLEN
Or what... you gonna kill me like
you did Serena.
Suddenly, with out hesitation Chris grabs Glen by his tee
shirt and slams his forehead into Glens nose. It breaks in a
clean crack, blood spurting out. Glen doubles over, holding
his face. Chris smashes his fist into the back of Glens head,
Glen goes down on his knees. Chris is kicking him. Shifty
comes in and pulls him away, laying in a few boots himself.
Glen stands up.
GLEN (CONT'D)
You broke my fucking nose. You're a
fucking dead man Shifty... you're
all ready a fucking dead, man,
*
you're fucked... fucked...
137
*
INT/EXT RANGE ROVER. MOTORWAY. NIGHT
The black Ranger Rover soars along the motorway.
76.
138
Through the front windscreen we see a sign indicating a
turnoff for Dudlowe New town. The jeep veers, making the exit
just in time.
140
Silhouetted by the night sky, Shifty and Chris sit on dining
chairs, before the front window, lights off, waiting.
142
CHRIS
Does everyone think it was me?
SHIFTY
If they did you'd be in prison
mate?
A BEAT.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Running off didn't help.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
I can't even remember giving it to
her.
SHIFTY
We were all pretty fucked Chris.
A BEAT.
CHRIS
She told me she'd done pills
before.
A BEAT.
SHIFTY
Chris if it wasn't you, she would
have got it from someone else mate.
CHRIS
Yeah but she didn't did she.
Shifty leans forward and opens the leather sports bag. He
pulls out a .38 six shot revolver and a hand full of bullets.
He starts loading the gun. Chris stands up.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ man what the fuck are
you doing?
Shifty gestures for him to be quiet, and points upstairs to
his bother.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Fucking hell, man, this is
bullshit.
SHIFTY
Sit down.
A BEAT.
78.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Chris sit down, man.
Chris sits down. Shifty reaches in the bag and hands him a
knuckle duster. Chris looks at it.
CHRIS
Glad you're fucking sorted.
144
They sit there, just waiting.
CHRIS
Do you think they'll come.
SHIFTY
Don't know.
A moment of silence.
CHRIS
Wish I'd slept last night.
A BEAT.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'm fucked.
Shifty nods. He's feeling the pain.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Got any coke?
SHIFTY
I'm out.
Silence. Chris laughs.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
We've been chased by the police...
Chris' laughter increases.
CHRIS
We got fucking mugged...
They're both starting to laugh.
79.
SHIFTY
And my brother flushed my gear down
the toilet...
They're both cracking up.
SHIFTY (CONT'D)
Party was blinding though weren't
it?
They're both laughing, Shifty motions for them to quieten
down in case they wake Rez.
CHRIS
Fuck the party. I never wanted to
go anyway.
146
Chris is falling asleep, head drooping. Shifty's trying to
stay awake, one eye open, struggling, but he's too tired.
Both their heads are drooped, they're dead to the world.
148
Shifty jolts as if he's heard something, going for the gun in
his jacket. He looks around... nothing there.
150
Shifty and Chris are silhouetted against the night sky.
152
A shadow streaks across the front window but Shifty and Chris
are asleep.
154
Shifty awakes with a jolt to see broad day light streaming in
through the windows of the house.
156
Shifty rips open the Jiffy envelope. He pulls out a
Camcorder, a Polaroid falls to the floor, face down. Shifty
looks at both. His face displays concern.
JUMP CUT TO:

Shifty's packing, fast. Loading stuff into a sports bag, tee
shirts, jeans, socks.
JUMP CUT TO:
159
Shifty pulls out a large bundle of money that he's been
saving.
160
Shifty places an envelope on the table. REZ scribed across
the front.
81.
161
Shifty walks into see Chris sitting up on the sofa. He throws
Chris' bag at him. He looks at his bag. At Shifty's bag slung
over his shoulder.
JUMP CUT TO:
162
The bus pulls away. Chris settles back, and offers Shifty one
of his head phones to share. Shifty takes it and sits back,
looking out the window. The track we heard at the beginning
of the film begins to play: Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day". It
plays softly over the following scenes.
165
Shifty stands, staring at the camcorder in his hand, and the
Polaroid, face down on the floor.
166
Loretta awakes from a drug inflicted sleep and sits up. She
looks around. No one.
82.
167
Shifty leans down to pick up the Polaroid.
168
Loretta walks towards the bedroom, she reaches for the
handle.
169
We see the same scene from the night before. But from a lower
angle to see Shifty holding his mobile phone by his side.
CLOSE ON SCREEN: IT SHOWS AN OPEN LINE TO MAGNUS' MOBILE
GLEN
Who told you that?
SHIFTY
Fuck you.
GLEN
Fuck you, you cunt. You're just
jealous cos you didn't think of it.
You're not that fucking smart.
SHIFTY
I didn't think of it, cos I'm not
that fucking stupid.
170

LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION.

Shifty turns over the Polaroid.
172
Loretta opens the door to reveal Glen taped to a chair and
beaten to death.
83.
173
Shifty turns over the Polaroid to see a picture of Glen,
taped to the chair and beaten to death.
174
Shifty opens the LCD on the Camcorder and presses play and
begins to watch.
175
CAMCORDER: Jasmine peers into the lens. She then turns the
camera and follows Trevor who plants himself on the other
settee, he looks uneasy.
TREVOR
Babe, do me a favour.
There is a colossal banging sound.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
What the fuc...
Trevor's up on his feet. The banging becomes a crash as
something gives way.
JASMINE
TREVOR WHAT IS IT? PHONE THE
POLICE!
Three heavyset men in balaclava's charge into the front room.
Jasmine screams, dropping the camera on its side yet still
giving a viewpoint on events. Three men are on Trevor, he's
receiving a serious beating.
THE MUSIC ON THE SOUND TRACK BEGINS TO GET LOUDER.
A man grabs Jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle
of the room, she attempts to fight back, feisty as ever. This
is bedlam. Suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays
a vicious right hook to Trevor's head. He goes down like a
lead weight. Jasmine's crying, fear washing over her. A child
cries out from upstairs.
VOICE (OS)
Tell that fucking slag to stop
crying... NOW!!
Two hooded men drag Jasmine off to another room. She's
fighting back clawing at them. Trevor's face is pressed
against the cold lino flooring. Someone has grabbed the
camera and angles it on Trevor's bloodied features. Congealed
blood envelopes his eyes and nose cavities.
84.
A hand moves into shot and grabs hold of his face, squeezing
his cheeks so he looks sadly comic. Trevor's eyes flicker
open.
VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
Look into the lens...
Trevor fails to comply. The hand slaps him hard and grabs his
face again.
VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
Look into the FUCKING lens!!!
Trevor complies.
VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
Say you're sorry.
Trevor begins to weep - a painful sight.
VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
SAY YOU'RE FUCKING SORRY!!!
The voice echoes out.
176
Rez' opens the envelope on the side and pulls out a mass of
money left for him by Shifty.
177
Loretta puts on her jacket and walks out of the flat.
178
Shifty sits looking out the window, Dudlowe passing him by as
he exits the town. He nestles back into his chair and closes
his eyes. He and Chris seated next to one another. Shoulder
to shoulder.
The music rises.
CUT TO BLACK.
THE END
