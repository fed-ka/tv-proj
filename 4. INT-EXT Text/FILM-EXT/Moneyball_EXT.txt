At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty
diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.
BRENNAMAN V/O
- Rivera looks in for the sign, he has
it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -
The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut
off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that
wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in
fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure
seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:
STEVE LYONS V/O
- a ground out to second, Thom, is not
what the A's were looking for from Saenz -
down by two in the ninth -
The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of
peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty
diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the
baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the
radio back on -
BRENNAMAN V/O
Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout
to bat for Menechino -
2.
2.
He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.
Switches the radio back on -
BRENNAMAN V/O
- the A's are down to their last strike
and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -
Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,
delivers and -
Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits
just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -
BRENNAMAN V/O
It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -
down two games to none - have come back
to win three, and the Division Series.
The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on
Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and
climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly
hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward
an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -
STEVE LYONS V/O
This is an exceptional feat not only for
New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though
not the kind you can be proud of: Only
once before has a team lost a Division
Series after winning the first two games -
A lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the
Coliseum. We HEAR-
TARA V/O
They had three times your payroll, Billy.
BILLY
Yeah...
TARA V/O
You're not watching them celebrate,
right?
Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone.
BILLY
No. That would be, uh--
TARA V/O
Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic?
BILLY
Are you asking me to pick one?
TARA V/O
What you should be doing is thinking
about what an amazing job you did and how
great you are.
BILLY
I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not
thinking about either of those things.
4.
4.
TARA V/O
You take a team with that payroll to the
playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth
game? I'm not even sure the better team
won.
BILLY
They were down two-love and then beat us
three in a row. Trust me, the better team
won.
BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit
with sound of sports talk radio--
CALLER V/O
--while embarrassing the entire city and
making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick
of this.
TARA V/O
Let's go away.
BILLY
That sounds good.
CUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME -
Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's
premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi,
Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen.
TARA V/O
Someplace they don't have a baseball
team.
BILLY
How about Oakland?
TARA V/O
Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You
can do anything you want but you can't
give any quotes to the press, go on the
internet or hurt my car, we have a deal?
BILLY
Yeah.
TARA V/O
They had three times your payroll, Billy.
From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an
unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "--
Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--".
5.
5.
BILLY
Yeah.
TARA V/O
How about Hawaii? I'll make a
reservation someplace. The place with
the turtles.
Billy gets out of the car.
BILLY
Great. I'm on my way.
Billy chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts
it in gear. HARD CUT TO --
CRACK! A ball sails well over the heads of the SCOUTS in
the outfield who are shagging the batting practice flies.
The KIDS in the parking lot have seen Billy play before
and so know just how far back to stand in order to shag a
ball.
BILLY's at the plate, crushing pitches from a pitching
machine.
CRACK!--he sends another one sailing over the heads of
the cluster of scouts.
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!
BILLY, tanned and glistening with sweat, looks over to
see THREE GIRLS watching him from behind the backstop.
They're looking at him like he's Elvis and BILLY tries to
nonchalant it but can't help a small smile to himself
BEFORE--
CRACK!
CRACK! CRACK!
SABATINI
This is the guy.
MARTINEZ
He's got a great path. I love the
extension in his swing and the backspin
he creates.
SABATINI
That's some amazing power right there,
huh?
26.
26.
MARTINEZ
Good approach, great balance. How's he
compare to the others around the country?
SABATINI
He's number one. Let's just hope he's
still there when we pick.
MARTINEZ
This guy'll go in the first round.
CUT TO:
The scouts put the players through their paces --
sprinting, fielding...
CUT TO:
SABATINI and MARTINEZ are talking to BILLY, who's
toweling off and is still a little aware of all the
people who are standing nearby to watch the birth of a
star.
SABATINI
Billy. I'm Sabatini, Area Scout, New
York Mets. Can we get a couple minutes
of your time, find out more about you?
BILLY
Of course.
SABATINI
I'd like to introduce you to Tom
Martinez.
MARTINEZ
Very impressive performance today. In my
job as the national cross-checker for the
New York Mets, I see the top 200 players
in the United States. It's been a while
since I've seen a five tools guy, the
complete package. Your throwing ability,
your fielding skills... Ed told me you had
power but I had no idea it was of the
light tower variety. I hope you're as
interested in professional baseball as we
are in acquiring you in the upcoming
draft.
27.
27.
BILLY
Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with
my parents, decide if baseball is
something I want to do full time. I have
a scholarship to play football at
Stanford.
MARTINEZ
Well, Billy, we're certainly looking
forward to meeting your folks and talking
to them as well. And we believe in
college, but that's something you can do
in the winter months. You need to know
the sky's the limit with your ability.
You could be a superstar before you've
even graduated. But to get to that
level, you need to work with our people.
Pro-ball is where you need to be to
develop the skills God gave you.

MONTAGE: Peter pulls into the parking lot for his first
day of work, takes in the sight of the colossal, concrete

It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's.
SCOTT was expecting that it would be someone else...

BILLY (VO)
Can we talk?
SCOTT
Yes.
BILLY (VO)
You want to invite me in?
SCOTT
What?
BILLY (VO)
I'm outside. I can see you in the window.
SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the
glass to see outside.
ELIZABETH
Honey?
Two silhouettes are standing on the edge of the fairway.
One of them waves.
The door of a suburban house opens, revealing a WOMAN.
BILLY
Hi.
SHARON
Hi, Billy.
She pulls the door open so he can come in. As he does -
BILLY
She home?
SHARON
She's out, but she'll be home soon.
LEGEND: 1984
BILLY's at the plate, a batting helmet snug around his
head, wearing a METS uniform, as a 97 mph fastball buzzes
by him and the UMPIRE calls--
UMPIRE
Striiike!
BILLY steps out of the box, taps the dirt off his cleats
and steps back in.
A younger-looking SHARON is sitting in field level seats,
looking on nervously and trying not to show it.
BILLY half-swings at the breaking ball, holding his swing
at the last minute.

The CATCHER and PLATE UMPIRE both point down to first
base for the call and the FIRST BASE UMPIRE makes a fist
in the air, indicating that Billy swung.
UMPIRE
Striiike!
And Billy's out.
SHARON holds her head in her hands and BILLY walks back
to the dugout, passing a player with "STRAWBERRY" on his
back.
And now the quick scenes of failure become staccato--

BILLY in an A's uniform. He stands and watches a called

Billy breaks the bat over his thigh and drops the pieces
on the plate. He begins to walk off.

Hey Billy, clean up after yourself.
Billy hears him but continues to walk off.

BILLY looks up at SHARON in the seats behind the dugout

Billy gives an interview to a SPORTS REPORTER.
SPORTS REPORTER
Billy, will the fans still come out now
that you've lost Giambi?
BILLY
I don't know, Graham. Will they listen to
your insipid radio show?
Various stations have been set up at which infielders go
through their warm-ups - wind sprints, arm loosening.
Infielders field grounders hit by Art Howe from a fungo.
Billy paces in the foul territory off the first base
line. HIS POV: JEREMY GIAMBI missing a fly ball, DAVID
JUSTICE looking tired, HATTEBERG missing the scoop.
Art hits another grounder which Hatteberg botches again.
Art looks at Billy a good long beat, then hits to another
infielder.
Peter walks up to Billy, just as -
A poke off the bat sends Jeremy Giambi scrambling back
like a postman trying to escape a mad dog. The ball
lands behind him.
BILLY
Well, we didn't pay him for his defense.
Art and Washington hit grounders to Carlos Pena and Scott
Hatteberg. Hatteberg miraculously gets his mitt on it.
BILLY
That's the way, Hatte. Pickin' Machine.
Behind a portable backstop, a guy with a radar gun gets
ready to clock a trio of relievers. Mike Magnante has
his pant legs pulled up to adjust knee-braces. Magnante
gets up and begins throwing, increasing his velocity each
time.
BILLY
None of those broke 85.

They watch the second pitcher - the gentle-faced kid from
the locker room - Chad Bradford - step up.
BILLY
Chad I have high hopes for.
Bradford overthrows his first submarine hand-scraping-
the-ground pitch, and the ball sails wide of the catcher.
Somebody ducks. Art Howe glances with a long-suffering
look to Billy.
BILLY
It just got away from him.
They watch David Justice do wind sprints.
BILLY
He's still got it.
Then Justice stops, winded.
A towering portrait of David Justice has been painted
where Jason Giambi's used to be.
The hardest diehard fans file under it and through the
turnstiles. You know what they look like, dripping A's
merchandise, radios and Sharpies, arriving so early the
B.P. cage is still being dragged into place.

Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming
out. Got a good box? You want a

Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know
what I like about opening day?
Everyone's even. Thank you. You all
enjoy the game.
BILLY gets his picture taken with KIDS from an area
Little League team. He's laughing and being a good host.

BILLY greeting some VIP's in their field-level seats.
Throughout this we'll hear bits of talk radio.
HOST #1 (FROM RADIO)
With the departure of head scout Grady
Fuson and a roster that I'll describe as
unusual, if not eccentric, you have to
wonder what Billy Beane is thinking.
BILLY catches a glance of ELIZABETH HATTEBERG taking her
seat nearby.
In the family area, Elizabeth introduces herself to Tara.
ELIZABETH
Hi, I'm Elizabeth.
TARA
Hi. Tara. Which is yours?
ELIZABETH
Scott Hatteberg. Catcher - actually first

You can't be in there, Billy.
BILLY doesn't move. He just watches ART as he comes into

REPORTER #2 V/O
None of the Oakland fans in their cars
down there have forgotten the A's
inglorious history-making choke in Game 5
of the ALDS last October and tonight--
BILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied
himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in
play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in
the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there.
143.
143.
BILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the
3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as
Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The
A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching.
Billy looks around. He sees the scoreboard, a FAN with a
big funky cowboy hat, the charged-up crowd in the stands,
it's like the Coliseum at Rome.
IBANEZ of the Royals singles to center field.
RANDA of the Royals singles to left field.
But the Oakland fans are still jubilant and do the wave.
Then a big error from Tejada puts runners on 1st, 2nd and
3rd (MAYNE, Ibanez and Randa).
As if we've entered the Twilight Zone, it becomes
twilight and LIGHTS GO ON.
DEE BROWN of the Royals singles to right, bringing Ibanez
and Randa home, and Mayne to 3rd.
Ibanez and Randa high-five each other at the plate,
passing Billy as they head to their dugout. Okay, the
Royals are on the board now: 11-2, but just barely. Until-
PEREZ of the Royals singles to center field, bringing
Mayne home.
Then TUCKER of the Royals doubles to left field. Justice
makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown
and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they
leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and
suddenly the Royals have 5.
Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd,
Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with
Peterson and Hudson.
And finally Billy, who WALKS OUT.
MIKE SWEENEY of the Royals singles to left-center field --
Neither Justice or Long get it, it lands between them.
And they have WORDS.
144.
144.
Randa makes a sloppy single to left field... this one
goes between Justice and Tejada.
MONTAGE of A's at bat: Hernandez grounds out, DURHAM
strikes out, Mabry grounds out... A stunned A'S FAN
stands up with his arms out in a "WTF??" gesture. While
the A's are still up, this is excruciating for the fans.
143 OMITTED 143
ANNOUNCER V/O
Kansas City's scored five and Oakland's
lead is down to six as Art Howe comes out
to the mound to pull Tim Hudson.
Art Howe comes out of the dugout, gives the signal for
"underhander," takes the ball from Hudson.
ANNOUNCER V/O
He'll go with the submariner, Chad
Bradford.
We see SHOTS OF FANS in the sold-out stadium experiencing
the height of tension and excitement in sports.
Chad Bradford comes off the bullpen mound to relieve
Hudson, and begins counting his steps -
CHAD
One, two, three, four -
Chad arriving at the mound taking the game ball from Art,
who we see is genuinely supportive and encouraging to
Chad.
Chad finishing his warm-up pitches.
CHAD
I know what it is to be in need and to
have plenty. I am content. I can do all
things through Christ who gives me
STRENGTH--
CHAD walks Mayne. An angry fan throws toilet paper onto
center field, the one thing Long manages to pick up. The
crowd grows anxious.
CHAD's submariner pitch to the next batter, DEE BROWN,
walks him. BROWN trots down to first and there are now
two runners on.
Some FANS have to cover their eyes. There's a pitcher
conference.
Art Howe simmers in frustration. He signals Rincon to
warm up. The fans aren't happy either.
ORDAZ of the Royals grounds to Tejada, who throws home
for the force, and misses. Now it's 11-6!
Howe pulls Bradford.
Rincon throws a controversial strike out. The Royals
batter, TUCKER, protests, and fans go crazy BOOING.
Brown scores, 11-7 now, Royals chipping away that lead,
AND --
Howe pulls Rincon. Tam comes in to relieve him.
Sweeney's up. In rapid succession, we seem him battle off
TEN PITCHES of Tam. He's got two strikes on him, more
toilet paper flies on the field, Bowie comes in to warm
up which Tam sees, then -
SWEENEY HITS A THREE-RUN HOMER TO MAKE IT 11-10! This is
excruciating.
149 OMITTED 149
BOWIE is already gone. KOCH is on the mound. There's a
Royal, PELLOW, on 2nd. According to the scoreboard, it's
2 outs, 2 strikes. If Koch throws a strike, the game is
over. The fans are fucking feverish.
ALICEA of the Royals singles to left and Pellow scores.
The game is now TIED.
In their dugout, Royals GLOAT.
146.
146.
He's ended the inning, but in the A's dugout, Koch slams
the wall.
151 OMITTED 151
The scoreboard shows us that it's still tied in the
bottom of the ninth. Nobody's out. DYE grabs a bat and
walks to the plate. Then, inexplicably, Howe turns to-
ART
Hattie. Grab a bat.
SCOTT HATTEBERG actually points to himself and mouths,
Me?
ART
Let's go.
SCOTT pulls a bat from the rack and heads to the on-deck
circle. He only manages a warmup pitch or two before -
As ROY STEELE's booming voice echoes:
VOICE OF GOD
Pinch hitting for Eric Byrnes--Scott
Hatteberg.
Scott's wife, ELIZABETH, watches from the VIP seats. She
clutches her face.
SCOTT lets the first pitch go by.
UMPIRE
Ball!
Art Howe looks like he can't stand it any longer. In the
dugout, Koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill.
SCOTT steps out of the box to catch his breath. He steps
back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks
the pitch will leave the pitcher's hand.
The pitch. SCOTT swings.
147.
147.
Crack! 55,000 erupt. The A's leap to the front of the
dugout steps and watch.
We see the ball ascending on a strong trajectory, but
before we can know for sure where it's headed, TIME SLOWS
TO A CRAWL-
The place is going crazy. ELIZABETH is screaming as she
watches her husband get mauled by his teammates at the
plate.
The same shot as at the beginning: the Coliseum from high
above, only this time the final game of the division
series is being played at home.
LEGEND:
2002 ALDS
DECIDING GAME 5
Minnesota Twins at Oakland A's
The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's
excruciating. The numbers on the board tell us it's been
an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one
run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody
on.
151.
151.
Ray Durham stands in at the plate. Strike one to the
Durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPN's Joe
Morgan, who's speaking post-game.
JOE MORGAN V/O
The flaw in the A's thinking, and this
comes from the top of their organization--
is their failure to comprehend you have
to manufacture runs in the post season.
Durham fouls off a pitch. Strike two.
JOE MORGAN V/O
You have to steal. You have to bunt. You
have to sacrifice. You have to trust in
small ball, not Billy Ball.
Durham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a
pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs.
The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER
runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the
middle of the field to begin their victory celebration.
Durham turns away and heads back to the dugout.
The A's have lost the series.
JOE MORGAN V/O
They think they've devised a science to
win games. They think it resides in a
computer. They thumb their nose at
fundamentals. At tradition. At Baseball.
164 OMITTED 164
A LOCKED-OFF SHOT begins to slowly move towards the pile
of celebrating players on the mound and as we near, the
sound begins to fade and the PLAYERS BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR,
as do the FANS and ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE COLISEUM. DRIFT in
an empty stadium, towards the dugout, where the last of
the CLEANING CREW brooms the floor.
We establish the famous home of the Red Sox before
finding BILLY standing on home plate. He looks around at
the historic stadium...
JOHN (O.S.)
Billy Beane!
JOHN HENRY, the new owner of the Boston Red Sox, is
shouting at him from the owner's box. BILLY gives a kind
of wave.
HENRY
Due respect to the Coliseum, but this is
a ball park.
BILLY
Yes it is. It is.
HENRY
(SHOUTING)
You ever play here?
156.
156.
FLASH CUT:
BILLY swinging hard at a pitch in the dirt.
CUT BACK TO:
BILLY
No.
JOHN
That's a shame. Let's walk the field.
BILLY and JOHN begin a stroll around the perimeter of
Fenway.
JOHN
Hey, I'm sorry I kept you waiting but
believe it or not there was snow on 84.
The second week in October. The car
turns on to Yawkee Way and it's 53
degrees and this. How can there be an
entirely different weather system here
than there is three miles from here? Is
that global warming or a sign that
there's no such thing?
BILLY
I don't know.
JOHN
What's that Billy Joel song? Oh the snow
it was falling from Stockbridge to
Boston. And the hilltops seemed
something because of that frosting.
BILLY
I think that's James Taylor and I'm
certain those aren't the words.
JOHN
Well whatever, it was snowing from
Stockbridge to Boston so I'm sorry I'm
late. We'll have lunch in a little bit
but why don't I have some coffee sent up.
(he's already got his
cell phone open)
Denise?
(back to BILLY)
We've got espresso, cappuccino, latte,
we've got a machine that makes whatever
you want.
BILLY
We've got free soda.
157.
157.
JOHN
I heard about that.
(INTO PHONE)
Can you have some coffee in there for us?
(BEAT)
Thank you.
He snaps the phone shut.
Billy haunts the field, talking to himself. Eventually
he stands at the plate, and has an imaginary at bat.
CUT TO:
165.
165.
Billy wanders over to the pitcher's mound. Lies down.
His POV of perfect sky...
BILLY's driving along and listening to the continued
DRONE of talk radio criticism.
RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
ARCHIVAL RADIO CHATTER
BILLY keeps listening a moment, then reaches in the glove
box and pulls out a CD marked "Dad's Mix".
BILLY slips it in the CD player. The sound of the radio
immediately snaps off and the momentary silence is soon
broken by CASEY's VOICE--
CASEY (V.O.)
Hey, Dad. I picked these songs out just
for you.
And then the first track on the CD comes on (SONG TBD).
And BILLY smiles.
He continues on down the freeway into dusk, as--
David Justice at the plate. As he takes ball four and
trots down to first, the image freezes -
Legend: David Justice retired after the 2002 season,
leaving baseball with a team-leading on-base percentage
with most walks.
Scott Hatteberg, looking comfortable on the infield dirt
finally, dives for a line drive - freeze.
166.
166.
Legend: Scott Hatteberg played three more seasons with
the A's, then signed with Cincinnati in 2006 - as a first
baseman. He retired in 2007.
Chad Bradford goes into his windup from Mars. As his
hand scrapes the dirt - freeze.
Legend: Chad Bradford went to the Red Sox in 2005. In
2008, he was traded to Tampa Bay who went on to the World
Series with a payroll even lower than the A's.
Kevin Youkilis, in a Red Sox uniform, shimmies at the
plate. As he lays off ball four and the umpire points to
first - freeze.
Legend: Boston never traded to Billy - or anyone else -
their Greek God of Walks, Kevin Youkilis. He was part of
the historic World Series Championship Red Sox of 2004,
and is still with the club.
Peter, in a Yale Bulldogs uniform, scoops a grounder to
second. As he throws out a Yale Bulldog - freeze.
Legend: Peter Brand left Oakland in 2004 to become the
General Manager of the Dodgers. He's now with the San
Diego Padres.
Billy - 18 years old - in his Mount Carmel High uniform,
takes his stance at the plate with the supreme confidence
of youth. The pitch comes. He swings. And as his bat
makes contact - freeze.
Legend: Billy Beane is still the General Manager of the
Oakland A's.
The Coliseum's floodlights switch off and the green of
the grass darkens -
