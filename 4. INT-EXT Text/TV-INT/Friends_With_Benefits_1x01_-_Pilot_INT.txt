    The squeaking stops as a woman, SARA WELKER (28), rolls off a 
    man, BEN HARRISON (27). They look up at the ceiling, catching 
    their breath. Sara leans over and shuts off the music.

                              SARA
                  You realize that s a weird song to 
                  have sex to?

                              BEN
                  Is it?

                              SARA
                  You have 16,000 songs on your Ipod. 
                  You chose that one. Just saying.

                              BEN
                  I like that song.

                              SARA
                  Yeah I could tell.

    Sara stands up to get dressed. 

                              BEN
                  So... was it all that you hoped for?

                              SARA
                  It was... ok.

                              BEN
                  What do you mean  ok?

                  time tonight.

    INT RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT NIGHT

    Where a good-looking guy, RICH (30s, Anchorman-style haircut), 
    raises a glass to toast Sara. It s a nice, romantic moment.

                              SARA
                  Haha. So what was wrong with the girl

    Ben sits watching  Caddyshack.  He belly laughs at the movie. 
    All around him people are reacting similarly. Not so Ben s 
    DATE (late 20s).

                              BEN
                  What s the matter?

                              DATE
                  Nothing. This is fun. I m having fun.

                  I just don t think this is funny. And 
                  that gopher looks fake.

    Off Ben s horror, CUT TO:


    Where Ben sits with Sara (in her scrubs) and his best friend 
    AARON GREENWAY (27, nerdily cute). Reacting to the previous:

                              AARON
                  That is sick! I don t even -- Who 
                  does this girl think she is? 

    Sara and Ben exchange a look. 

                              SARA
                  I m not saying a word.

                              BEN
                      (to Aaron)
                  Let me ask you something... you think 
                  I m too picky?

                              AARON
                  No I think you re selective. It s a 
                  good thing.

    HOON (27, Aaron s roommate, Ed Hardy style douchebag) walks 
    up, flicks Aaron s ear. When Aaron turns reflexively, Hoon 
    steals his drink. The whole thing takes half a second.

                              BEN
                  Sense of humor, Hoon. It s important.

                  Really, Ben? Can you have sex with 
                  her sense of humor...? Can you play 
                  leapfrog with her sense of humor 
                  while her sorority sister films 
                  it...? I rest my case.

                  The worst part is... I was gonna 
                  bring her to my sister s wedding. 
                  Molly will kill me if I don t bring a 
                  date.

                              AARON
                  Why would she care?

                  You know how expensive these things 
                  are? You RSVP d plus one, you d 
                  better show up plus one.

    A girl comes in from outside dressed head to toe in a 
    bumblebee costume. This is RILEY KULECK (24, effervescent, 
    adorable). Upon seeing Hoon:

                              RILEY
                      (to Sara)
                  What s he doing here?

    Sara rolls her eyes. Aaron just throws up his hands. Nothing 
    he could do. Meanwhile, Riley has hopped over the bar and 
    begun to change out of her costume in front of the gang. They 
    look at her like what s up with that?

                              RILEY
                  This guy I m seeing...

    As if that explains anything. Sara s beeper buzzes.

                              SARA
                  Back to work.                      Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       7.


                              BEN

                      (shrugs)
                  Text me.

    And that s that. She leaves. As Riley changes, Aaron looks 
    away, uncomfortable while Hoon is enjoying the show. 

                              HOON
                  Daddy like.

                              RILEY
                  Look away or I will punch you in the 
                  balls.

                              HOON
                  You d still be touching them...
                      (snaps out of it)
                  What were we talking about?

                              AARON

    They try to stop him but it s too late. Hoon heads over to hit 
    on a BLONDE at the other end of the bar. As soon as he s gone, 
    the guys turn away.

                              AARON
                  Look at Hoon. Out there sleeping with 
                  a different woman every night. That s 
                  not what you want.

                  That s... not it either.                      Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       8.


                              AARON
                  But you know what I m saying. Why 
                  waste time on someone who isn t your 
                  soulmate?

                              BEN
                  You ve been watching The Notebook 
                  again, haven t you?

                              AARON
                  Ben, they were meant for each other. 
                  And I ll tell you, the first time I 
                  saw Kelly Finelli, it was like a 
                  lightning bolt, no, like a taser to 
                  my soul. I knew instantly she was the 
                  one.

    Both Ben and Riley roll their eyes at this.

                              BEN
                  You realize you ve said that about

    YEARS AGO). 

                              AARON
                  I ve never felt this way before.

    - Aaron and Ben in the same bar, in the exact same spot 
    (SUPER: JUNE):

                              AARON
                  I ve never felt this way before.


                              AARON
                  Well this time is different.

                              BEN
                  You ve been on three dates.                      Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       9.


                              AARON
                  The best three dates of my life. 
                  Friday night s our two week 
                  anniversary. 

                              BEN
                  And let me guess, you re gonna do 
                  something crazy?

                              AARON
                  I wouldn t put it past me.

    ANGLE ON: Hoon and the Blonde. He writes her number down in a 
    matchbook. 

                              HOON
                  I ll call you.

    She smiles. Hoon winks at her, turns and walks across the bar. 

    On the way, in plain view of both his friends AND the Blonde, 
    Hoon proceeds to light the matchbook -- phone number and all -- 
    on fire! The Blonde is horrified. Aaron is horrified. Ben is 
    horrified (and kind of impressed). 

    Hoon smiles. Passes another GIRL on the way back. Lights her 
    cigarette with his flaming matchbook.

                              HOON
                  What are you doing tonight?

    At which point, Riley grabs him by the ear and says:

                              RILEY
                      (to Hoon)
                  Get out.


    Sara leaves an exam room. Feels a buzz in her coat. It s not 
    her beeper, however, it s her private Blackberry. She looks at 
    the message from Rich.  I d love to see you again. 

    Sara pumps her fist in excitement. Her colleagues, both older 
    nurses, ANNIE and KAY (50s), catch this.

                              SARA
                      (excited)
                  He asked me out again. 

                              ANNIE
                  In a text message?

                              SARA
                  Of course.
                      (off their look)
                  He s not a stalker!

                              SARA (CONT'D)
                  A phone call is aggressive. Means 
                  he s a little too eager, a little too 
                  soon. Now an email, on the other hand 
                  -- no matter what it says -- means he 
                  just wants to be friends. An IM means 
                  he just wants to have sex and a BBM 
                  means he s gay. So a text message, 
                  that s what you want, trust me. 

                              ANNIE
                  Oh thank God I m married.


    Ben is  hard at work  at his computer -- hard at work on his 
    fantasy football team. A young woman pushing the mail cart 
    catches his eye. Potential?

                              BEN
                      (to himself)
                  Hello...

    When she gets closer, Ben notices she s wearing Mom Jeans.

                              BEN
                  ...and goodbye.


    CLOSE UP: a woman s ass in tight spandex. It rises and falls.

                              VOICE (O.C.)
                  That s it. Yes. A little deeper.

    REVEAL: the ass belongs to a SEXY MILF (late 30s) doing leg 
    lifts. The voice belongs to Hoon, her personal trainer. Hoon 
    puts his hand on her ass (for  spotting  purposes). Hoon 
    smiles. He loves his job.

    ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. Ben is running on a 
    treadmill. Next to him is Aaron, walking slowly, reading a 
    magazine. Attractive women are everywhere.

                              BEN
                      (gesturing)
                  How bout her?

                              AARON
                  Hooned.

                              BEN
                  That one?

                              BEN
                  Over there?

    Hoon happens to walk by. He points to the same girl.

                              HOON
                  Hooned her last night.

                              BEN
                  Are there any girls here you haven t 
                  slept with?

    One walks towards them... 

                              HOON
                  Never seen her before.

    And once she s walked by, seeing her from behind...

                              HOON
                  Oh yes I have.

    Aaron closes his magazine.

                              AARON
                  Why don t you just take Sara to the 
                  wedding?

                              BEN
                  Because... I m not dating Sara.

                              AARON
                  Oh right, you re just sleeping with 
                  her.

                              BEN
                  Exactly.

                              AARON
                  Not dating, just having sex.

                              BEN
                  You got it.

                              AARON
                  I don t understand.

                              BEN
                  Understand what?

                              AARON
                  You re friends... but then 
                    occasionally... you poke each other 
                  in the sexual way. It makes no sense.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       12.


                              BEN
                  You can invent an algorithm that 
                  Google buys for 12 million dollars 
                  but this is over your head?

                              AARON
                  You don t have sex with your friends! 
                  Friends are like family. You don t 
                  get naked with your family. 

                              HOON
                  Where do people come up with these 
                  rules?

                              BEN
                  You didn t have sisters.

                              HOON
                  But I had a mom and two Great Aunts. 
                  Tremendous Aunts.

    Ben and Aaron absorb this. Ignore him.

                              AARON
                  I don t get it, Ben.

                              BEN
                  What s not to get? We like sex, we 
                  like each other...just not in that 
                  way. 

                              HOON
                  You wanna know what I think?

                                AARON/BEN 
                  No!

                              HOON
                  Three things. 1: It s a wedding. You 
                  don t take someone you re already 
                  boning to an event that s guaranteed 
                  sex with somebody new. That s bush

                  Hooned... And 3: Take my advice. Show 
                  up stag, find yourself a slutty 
                  bridesmaid, and bang her in your car. 
                  Hoon style. Trust me, you ll love it.

    Ben s place is slightly less adult than his age (vinyl records 
      everywhere, movie posters, more video game systems than 
    furniture, etc). Ben is playing Madden when his phone rings. 

    The screen splits. On the left, Ben on his couch. On the 
    right, Ben s sister MOLLY, the bride-to-be, staring at a giant 
    seating chart.

                              BEN
                  Hey Molls. Listen, about the wedding,

                  ...there s a chance -- wait, what?

                              MOLLY
                  Don t worry, I wasn t counting on you 
                  bringing a date.

                  That is not -- you know what, it just 
                  so happens I do have a date. And... 
                  she s... my girlfriend.

                  He used the word  soulmate. 

    Mom starts freaking out with excitement. Ben has to hold the 
    phone away from his ear.

                              MOM
                  Oh Ben, this is wonderful! We all

    Ben stares intently at the computer. Deep in stressful work 
    stuff? REVEAL, no, he s on Facebook. ANGLE ON THE SCREEN. A 
    cute girl. CLOSE UP on her  status :  In a Relationship.  Ben 
    clicks on another girl. Same  status.  A third. Same.

                              BEN
                  How is it possible every girl I ever 
                  went out with is  in a relationship?  

    Eventually he finds one that reads:  It s Complicated.  Hmm. 
    What does that mean? Stares it down, curiously. Then takes out 
    his Iphone. The screen splits.

    On the left, Ben in his office. On the right, Sara in the ER.

    TEXT BUBBLES appear over their heads. Like so:
    BEN:  Your friend Jane, what does that mean -  it s 
    complicated?  

    Sara stops what she s doing. Reads this. Types back. 

    SARA:  Lives with her ex, dates his best friend. Stay away! 
    BEN:  Still need a date for the wedding. 

    Sara winces. Picks up the phone and calls Ben. (CONTINUE SPLIT 
    SCREEN, END BUBBLES).

                  That came out wrong.

                              SARA
                  I m not desperate. You think I m 
                  desperate? Cause I am not desperate.

                              BEN
                  That sounded a little desperate.

    And Sara s now thinking about it.

    Aaron on his cell phone driving down the highway.

                              AARON
                  ...did you see Dancing with the Stars 
                  last night? They played that song you 
                  like so much. I thought of you.


    Still on the phone, Aaron walks to the fancy elevator.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       18.


                              AARON
                  ...Skype d with your Mom today, she 
                  says hi...


    INT AARON AND HOON S PENTHOUSE LOFT - CONTINUOUS

    The doors of the elevator open right into Aaron s crazy loft.

                              AARON
                  ...anyway... That s all. Hope you 
                  like the puppy.
                      (beat)
                  You should probably open that box 
                  soon. Ok call me. Bye. Call me.

    As he walks out, a WOMAN gets in. Matchbook girl from the bar! 
    Aaron can t believe it. Hoon is in the kitchen pulling up his 
    pants and writing something on a wipe-off board.

                              AARON
                  What s that?

                              HOON
                  My goal for the month. I m trying to 
                  be more spiritual... And have sex 
                  with someone from each of the world s 
                  7 major religions. 

                              AARON
                  Which one was she?

                              HOON
                      (crosses one off)
                  Hoon do Hindu!

    Aaron slumps down on the couch.

                              HOON
                  What s the matter with you?

                              AARON
                  Don t want to talk about it.

                              HOON
                      (heading upstairs)
                  Great. Don t want to hear about it. 

                              AARON
                  Kelly s acting weird. 

    And Hoon has to stop walking.

                              AARON
                  I haven t heard from her all week.

                              HOON
                  Maybe she s sick.

                              AARON
                  You think she s sick?

                              HOON
                  Of you.

    Sara comes in with a fury.

                  Ben called me  desperate. 

                              AARON
                  Sara, thank god you re here --

                              SARA
                  Just because I have a particularly 
                    well-considered life plan that s 4 
                  months behind schedule does not make 
                  me desperate.

                              HOON
                  Are you sure? Cause I would totally 
                  hit that --

                  You know I can take out your kidneys 
                  while you sleep...

                  Desperate... Please. If I was 
                  desperate, I d be dating Ben. 

                              AARON
                  I thought you were dating Ben.

                              SARA
                  Why would you think that?

                              AARON
                  You re having sex with him.

                  Never mind. 

    At which point Ben comes in out of breath.

                              BEN
                  Got your text, what s wrong?!

                              AARON
                  It is an emergency. Three days now. 
                  No emails, IMs, Facebook messages...

                              BEN
                  Are you still on for Friday?

                              AARON

                              BEN
                  Then you re fine.

                              AARON
                  I m not fine I m going crazy!

                              BEN
                  Wow you so need a job.

                              AARON
                  I have 12 million dollars. Do I 
                  really need a job?

                              SARA
                  Do you really need a roommate?

                              HOON (FROM UPSTAIRS)
                  I heard that!

                              AARON
                  Let me ask you something. You re a 
                  woman. Why wouldn t you call someone 
                  back?

    Sara and Ben share a look. Know what to do.

                              SARA
                      (beat; lying)
                  Cause I m busy. Doesn t mean 
                  anything.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       21.


                              AARON
                  I should go over there.

                              SARA/BEN
                  No!

                              AARON
                  Maybe buy her Mom a house?

                              BEN
                  Do nothing!

                              AARON
                  Really?

                              SARA
                  Sure. You ll see her on Friday. 
                  You ll have a great time. It ll work 
                  itself out.

                              BEN
                  That s exactly right, Aaron. Just 
                  take a deep breath. Relax. Don t do a 
                  thing. 
                      (beat)
                  Can you do that?


    Where Aaron is now outside Kelly Finelli s door with six dozen 
    roses. And YO-YO MA playing  Lady in Red.  Kelly answers. 
    Surprised to see him. Aaron just walks in.

                              AARON
                  Sorry to come here like this but I ve 
                  been so worried, Kel. Did you get the 
                  puppy?

    And then the door buzzes. Kelly hears it. Doesn t get it. 

                              AARON
                  Something s bothering you, isn t it? 
                  It s ok. I know it s something...

    Another buzz. Kelly Finelli remains frozen.

                              AARON
                  You need to get that or...?

    Kelly Finelli blinks a few times. Presses the intercom.

                              AARON
                  If you re busy, I can --

                              KELLY FINELLI
                  Listen Aaron --                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       22.


                              AARON
                  Whatever it is, just know that I m 
                  here for you. Ok? It know it s early 
                  but I think I might be fallin--

    And a TALL BLONDE GUY appears in the doorway. With the puppy 
    (wearing a red bow) on a leash.  

                              AARON
                  -- who the hell is this?

                              KELLY FINELLI
                      (not sure what to do)
                  This is Helmut.

                              AARON
                  Helmut?!

                              TALL BLONDE GUY
                      (German accent)
                  I m Helmut.

                              AARON
                  He s German?

                              KELLY FINELLI
                  I was going to tell you.

                              AARON
                  I don t care that he s German, what s 
                  he doing here?
                      (off her silence, realizes)
                  Wow. I mean... wow. I don t even... 
                  this is... Wow. Just... wow.

    Aaron falls into a chair in shock. Sits there saying nothing.

                                HELMUT
                      (to Kelly, impressed)
                  I think that s Yo Yo Ma.

                              KELLY FINELLI
                  Aaron? 
                      (but he s in his own world)
                  We re going out now. You want to stay 
                  or --

                              AARON
                  I just need a minute. 

    And he takes his minute. Kelly and Helmut stand there 
    confused. What s happening right now? Finally, Aaron gets up. 
    On his way out the door, he scoops up the dog from Helmut.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       23.


                              AARON
                  This is mine!
                      (beat)
                  Come on Yo-Yo, let s go.

    And as the three of them walk off...

                                  END OF ACT TWO                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       24.


                                      ACT THREE

    Music Up:  Stellify  by Ian Brown. SUPER: FRIDAY NIGHT. 

    SERIES OF SHOTS - DATE NIGHT

    On the backbeat of the song...

    Ben: outlook positive. He shaves, brushes his teeth, tries on 
    several different t-shirts, plucks a grey hair.

    Sara: outlook, also positive. Blow-dries her hair, puts on 
    make-up, tries different outfits. Looks good in all of them.

    Hoon: the most psyched of all. He shaves, brushes his teeth, 
    puts on cologne. He also flexes his arms, shaves his balls, 
    rinses the razor in the sink, blow-dries his hair, and makes 
    faces in the mirror like the killer in  Silence of the Lambs.  

    Finally, Aaron (and the puppy): They just stare at us. Aaron 
    looks like shit. Feels like shit. Turns out the lights. END 
    MUSIC.


    Ben is drinking at the bar with Riley, waiting. In walks THE 
    WORLD S MOST BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTE. He cocks his head in 
    surprise. That can t be her. BRUNETTE (Devan) sees Ben and 
    sure enough: 

                              DEVAN
                      (waving)
                  Ben!

    Ben is in shock. They hug. He can t believe how cute she is.

                              DEVAN
                  It s been a while. I m surprised that 
                  you called.

                              BEN
                  Yeah I, uh, traveling, swine flu, was 
                  your hair always this shiny?

                              DEVAN
                  I... think so?

                              BEN
                  And you ve always had...
                      (re: legs)
                  ...those?

                              DEVAN
                  Well this one is new. 

    Ben laughs. She s funny too. This date has some potential.                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       25.


                              BEN
                  You hungry? Let s get some food.

                              DEVAN
                  I thought we were just having drinks.

                              BEN
                  I just got really hungry. Wait...
                      (beat, suspicious)
                  You re not Vegan, are you?

                              DEVAN
                  Oh hell no.

                              BEN
                  Andiammo!

    He holds the door open, watches her exit. Looks back at Riley -
    - stunned but psyched!


    The most romantic restaurant in all of Chicago. Candlelit 
    tables. At every one a loving couple. And then there s Aaron. 
    Miserable. REVEAL he s with Hoon, enjoying the rolls.

                              HOON
                  Aren t you glad I dragged you here?

                              AARON
                  This was a bad idea.

                              HOON
                  This was a great idea.  And I got my 
                  passport with me. How do you say 
                   Menage A Trois  in French?

                              AARON
                      (looking around, paranoid)
                  Everyone thinks we re a couple. 

                              HOON
                  Don t be ridiculous...

                              AARON
                  They re all looking at us.

                              HOON
                  They re just looking at me.

    In a gesture of friendship, Hoon touches his hand which he 
    immediately, self-consciously pulls away. 

                              AARON
                  No touching!

                              HOON
                  No one sulks around the Hoon. I 
                  promise when I m done with you, you 
                  won t feel a thing.

    The WAITER approaches.  He totally heard that last part.

                                WAITER
                  Ready to order, gentlemen?

                              AARON
                  Uh, yeah. Porterhouse. Medium.

                              HOON
                  Yummy, I ll have the same.

                              AARON
                  Wait, what, no.
                      (to Hoon)
                                (MORE)                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       27.

                              AARON (CONT'D)
                  We can t order the same thing. That s 
                  what couples do.

                              HOON
                  Then I ll get the fish. We ll go 
                  halfsies. 

                              AARON
                  No!

                              HOON
                  Why not?!

                              AARON
                  That s even worse!

                              HOON
                  Shhh!

    They very much look like a fighting couple.

                              AARON
                        (exasperated)
                  This is why I don t take you to nice 
                  places.

    Aaron signals for the Waiter. He returns.

                              AARON
                  I ve changed my mind. I ll have the 
                  filet of sole instead.

                              HOON
                  That sounds good. I ll have that too.

    Aaron shoots Hoon the look of death. 


    Where Sara and Rich are having dinner. Rich is talking but we 
    only hear snippets of what he s saying.

                              RICH
                  ...then I moved to Lincoln Park...

    Sara is pretending to listen. Here s what s happening instead:

                              SARA (V.O.)
                  We could buy a nice house with our 
                  salaries. A big one. And our kids 
                  would be tall. That s important.

                              RICH
                  Want another?                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       28.


                              SARA
                  No, I m good thanks.
                      (voice over)
                  Is he going for a record? Hmm. Must 
                  have had a rough day.

                              RICH
                      (to a passing Waitress)
                  One more CHAR-donnay.

                              SARA (V.O.)
                  He s not pronouncing it --

                              RICH
                      (to Waitress)
                  CHAR-donnay. Thanks.

                              SARA (V.O.)
                  Oh god, he is. That s unfortunate. 
                  But is it a dealbreaker? No. It s 
                  most certainly not. Not with that 
                  hair and those eyes --

                              RICH
                  ...and that s when Heather and I 
                  split... 

                              SARA (V.O.)
                  He says the word  Heather  one more 
                  effin  --

                              RICH
                  Do you know how beautiful you are?

    That takes her by surprise.

                              RICH
                  You re just so lovely.

    Sara can t help but be charmed. He takes her hand. She beams. 

                              SARA (V.O.)
                  See Ben. Sometimes you are just so 
                  wrong.


    Where Ben and Devan are on a couch having drinks.

                              DEVAN
                  Football s my favorite but I also 
                  like baseball, hockey. March 
                  Madness...

                              BEN (V.O.)
                  She must be hiding something. What is 
                  it? Cankles?                    Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       29.


    Ben drops his napkin on the floor. Bends down to retrieve. 
    Checks out her ankles. 

                              BEN (V.O.)
                  It s not cankles.

    Her ankles are perfect. Ben sits back up.

                              BEN
                  Please. Continue.
                      (VO)
                  Those legs are tremendous. And those 
                  lips. Look at her. She s interesting, 
                  smart.
                      (out loud)
                  I can t find anything wrong with you.

                              DEVAN
                  Um... thanks?

    And then a song comes on.  I m Alright  by Kenny Loggins.

                              DEVAN
                  Ooh I love this song. It s the theme 
                  song from Caddyshack!

                              BEN
                  You like Caddyshack?

                              DEVAN
                  Who doesn t like a fake dancing 
                  gopher? 

                              BEN (V.O.)
                      (beat)
                  She must have a penis. 


    Aaron sits, guzzling whisky. Riley tends the bar.

                              AARON
                  How many dates do you have to go on 
                  before your girlfriend tells you 
                  she s longshoring with Dolph 
                  Lundgren?

    She pours more drinks for them both.

                              RILEY
                      (glass raised)
                  Screw relationships.

    Aaron sees the bee costume in the trash.

                              AARON
                  You too?

                              RILEY
                  Said I was too into it. Believe that? 
                  It was his fetish! I m allergic to 
                  bees! 

                              AARON
                  You know what my problem is?

                              RILEY
                  What s your problem?

                              AARON
                  I feel too much.                     Friends With Benefits   Pilot   1/31/10       31.


                              RILEY
                  So feel less.

                              AARON
                  I don t know how. I m not like you. I 
                  can t just roll with the punches. 
                  Punches hurt. Now If I was more like 
                  Hoon, who doesn t have feelings, or 
                  like Ben who just sleeps with his 
                  friends like it s Scrabble or 
                  something... how does he do that?

                              RILEY
                  Who?

                              AARON
                  Ben. Anyone. How does anyone have 
                  casual sex? 

                              RILEY
                      (shrugs)
                  Easily.
                      (off his look)
                  It s just sex. Doesn t always have to 
                  be a big deal.

                              AARON
                  Of course it does.

                              RILEY
                  It really doesn t.

                              AARON
                  That s ridiculous. 

                              RILEY
                  Ok.

                              AARON
                  It s sex, Riley. Sex! It s never 
                  casual. It s the most serious, 
                  meaningful, intimate thing two people 
                  can share with -- 

    Riley shuts him up -- with a kiss. Hold, before we CUT TO:


    Riley and Aaron tumble in from the hallway, lip-locked, 
      frantically removing clothes. Aaron pauses for a moment.

                              AARON
                  Are you sure about this?

                              RILEY
                  Not at all.

    She yanks him into the bedroom, shuts the door in our faces.


    Where Ben sits in his tux at the kiddie table, surrounded by 
    children. His Sister walks by in her wedding gown, gives him a 
    knowing, disappointed look. Ben waves.

                              10-YEAR OLD BOY
                  She likes  The Wiggles.  I hate  The 
                  Wiggles.  It could never work out.

                              BEN
                  Trust me, Owen. Give  The Wiggles  a 
                  shot. You might be surprised.

    The kid s not convinced. At which point, Hoon, also in a 
    tuxedo, walks over excited.

                              HOON
                  Dude, you never told me your cousin 
                  was Native American.

                              BEN
                      (alarmed)
                  That s not a religion. 

                              HOON
                  They re spiritual people. Give me 
                  your car keys.

                              BEN
                  No!

    Before Ben knows what s happening, Hoon reaches into his 
    pocket and grabs the keys. Runs off. Ben chases him. 

                              BEN
                  Hoon!
