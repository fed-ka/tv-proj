      WE WERE JUST WATCHING A SCENE FROM MYSTERY GIRLS, ONE OF THE 
      HIGHEST-RATED SHOWS OF THE 90 S.

      THE VOICE WE HEARD BELONGS TO MICHAEL BROOKS (40 S), WHO S 
      SITTING IN FRONT OF A SMALL TV IN A KITCHEN.

      AT THE STOVE IS HIS WIFE, MARIA BROOKS. A.K.A. VERONICA

                Man, you looked hot in the 90 s.

      ONE LOOK AT MARIA AND YOU CAN TELL IT S NOT THE 90 S ANYMORE.

      SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT SHE IS: A HOUSEWIFE LIVING IN THE 
      SUBURBS. STILL PRETTY, BUT SPORTING A TRACKSUIT, A FEW EXTRA 
      POUNDS, AND HAIR THAT HASN'T BEEN FLAT-IRONED IN A DECADE.

      AT THE KITCHEN TABLE ARE MARIA S TWO DAUGHTERS, DEMI (14) AND 
      JENNY (15), BOTH TEXTING AWAY ON THEIR PHONES.

                                  JENNY

                the fake mustache I wore, but I sold 

                it on eBay a couple years ago.

                  filtration systems. And I keep busy. I 

                do a lot of cleaning. And cooking. Not 

                as much now, since we just got an 

                Olive Garden in town. Pretty excited 

                about that.

                Oh come on! Please? I was going to go 

                back to Ohio after the murder. But 

                then I met you guys, and it was so 

                exciting and thrilling and 

                  electrifying and titillating and--

                                  MARIA

                                  NICK

                --and I realized: why run back home 

                when I can help the Mystery Girls 

                clean up this city?

                                  HOLLY

                  I reserve the right to fire him.

                                  HOLLY

                You can t. We like the same sushi 

                rolls. It s meant to be.

                                  MARIA

                I just don t understand how he ll 

                become a valued member of this team.

      NICK HANGS UP AND HOLDS A PIECE OF PAPER IN THE AIR.

                                  NICK

                Got our first case!

      HE WALKS OVER TO THE GIRLS.

                                  MARIA

                  I thought that was just someone 

                looking for phone sex?

                                  NICK

                Yeah, it was, but then I asked him if 

                he was calling because he was lonely. 

                Turns out someone stole his dog. A 

                prized show pug. I told him we d find 

                it for $3,000.

                                  HOLLY

                Thank you, Nick. You truly are a 

                valued member of this team.

      MARIA SIGHS. IT'S ONLY DAY 1 AND SHE'S ALREADY OUTNUMBERED.

      AS NICK GLEEFULLY UNPACKS, MARIA POINTS TO THE  MYSTERY GIRL  
      SIGN ON THE WALL.

                                  MARIA

                Now that I m here, I think we should 

                add an  S  to that sign, don t you?

                                  HOLLY

                Well, I mean, I m kind of the face of 

                the brand. And people are probably 

                already used to it just being GIRL, so 

                we should probably leave it. I don t 

                want to confuse the public.

                                  MARIA

                Add an  S.  Now.

                                  HOLLY

                Fine.

      HOLLY MELODRAMATICALLY OPENS HER DRAWER, TAKES OUT THE  S  
      AND TAPES IT ONTO THE WALL. MARIA SMILES, BUT ALMOST 
      IMMEDIATELY THE  S  LOOSENS AND CRASHES TO THE GROUND, 
      SPLITTING IN TWO.

      HOLLY LOOKS TO MARIA.

                                  HOLLY (CONT D)

                We ll get that fixed.
