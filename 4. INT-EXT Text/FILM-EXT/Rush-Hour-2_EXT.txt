A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.
Skyscrapers sit like
watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
a half million people a day.
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side.
HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
VENDOR across the street.
She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
bite we see:
THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER
TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
erupting over one side of the embassy.
People panic and run.
Hu Li doesn't even flinch.
She takes
a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
street vendor.
HU LI
(Chinese, subtitled)
Someone better call the police.
The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
a Chinese-cut suit.
He's holding a Chinese-English
dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
look to two girls in a convertible.
CARTER
(int Chinese)
Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.
The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
is driving and singing to his radio.
LEE
(singing)
...wish they all could be California...
wish they all could be California
girls...
Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
out of the SUNROOF.
CARTER
I warned you about playing that shit
when I'm in the car.
LEE
That was my CD.
Don't you ever touch a
Chinese man's CD.
CARTER
Did you see the way those girls drove
off?
I did you a favor.
LEE
Those girls drove off because of you.
CARTER
All I did was invite them for a drink.
LEE
You invited them to get naked and
sacrifice a small goat.
CARTER
(checking Chinese-English
dictionary)
I said that?
Which word was "goat?"
Lee picks up his CD case.
LEE
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
CARTER
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.
I've
been here three days and we haven't done
shit.
We haven't been to a club,
haven't even talked to a girl.
I'm on
vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
LEE
Mu-shu?
You're hungry?
CARTER
Not Mu-shu.
Mu-shu.
I want to see some
women.
Now stop playing dumb and show
me the shu!
Carter flips through the dictionary.
A CALL COMES in over
LEE'S CELL PHONE.
INTERCUT
Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
way to the door of the Raven Club.
Carter is combing his
hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.
CARTER
That's what I'm talking about.
A real
Hong Kong night club.
You want an
Altoid?
LEE
No.
CARTER
You better take one.
Your breath has
been a little funky all day.
Let me
look at you.
Carter looks at Lee.
Fixes his collar.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Just relax and don't worry about a
thing.
I'll hook you up in there.
You
got condoms?
LEE
No.
CARTER
Take this.
It's a Magnum.
You can fold
it in half.
Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.
Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
and several gangsters round a corner.
CARTER
Stop!
LAPD!
Lee takes off and chases them on foot.
The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.
The
GANGSTERS look around frantically.
An apartment building is
under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom.
Their only way out is UP.
Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.
Lee wastes no time going after
them.
With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.
CARTER
Hang on, Lee.
I'm coming.
Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.
NOT EVEN
CLOSE.
He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!
ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.
They all tear off the
LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.
The clatter of wood
against wood as they beat at each other.
Wrestling over his
pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.
BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
to pull himself up.
Just as he gets his chin above the
bar... snap!
It BREAKS and he drops.
Then...
WHAM!
WHAM!
The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
CARTER.
HE takes one look at their pain.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Forget this...
He dashes into the stairwell.
ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
come at Lee.
He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
SEE-SAWS them off-balance.
With the advantage, he BATTERS
them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.
He climbs
after the GANGSTER LEADER.
ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS
Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
the hill.
Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
WHAM!
He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.
Lee TOPPLES
OVER THE EDGE!
We see his adversary for the first time.
HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS
As she steps to the edge... BOOM!
The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.
Gun low and ready.
Hu Li is gone.
CARTER
(out of breath)
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below.
Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.
She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
ROOF!
He falls along the side of the building.
He manages to grab
the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.
LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!
They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.
Hu
Li looks down at them.
She has no weapon to finish them off.
She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.
CARTER AND LEE
holding on with all their strength.
The bamboo is starting
to bend.
CARTER (CONT'D)
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
LEE
Try to land on your feet.
Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.
CARTER
I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
miles for this shit.
The POLE BREAKS
SUPER THE TITLE:
RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON
Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
year olds are going through their warm up routines.
MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.
CARTER
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
this shit.
There's two billion Chinese -
let one of them be your partner.
LEE
This won't take long.
Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.
MASTER FU
Dragon kick!
Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.
MASTER FU (CONT'D)
Lotus block!
The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.
Master Fu
notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.
MASTER FU (CONT'D)
Twisting Tiger!
No response.
The students exchange baffled looks.
MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
(staring straight at Lee)
Twisting Tiger!
Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
that leaves the students blown away.
Lee smiles, basking in
the glow...
...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.
MASTER FU (CONT'D)
Didn't I teach you to always arch your
back?
LEE
(bowing, humbled)
Yes, Master.
While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle.
Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.
CARTER
I was watching you kids.
My name is
Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
black belt.
At least that's what I tell
the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
where I work out.
Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
reaction.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Let me give you kids some tips.
The key
to Kung Fu is the follow through.
Why
don't you stand up.
THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.
Carter continues to throw
punches.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Go ahead, kick me, hit me.
I'll show
you how to block.
Come on, stand up,
give me your best shot -- try to kick
right to my head.
The kids still don't move.
Carter, working up a sweat from
shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.
He swings back around
to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
flying back onto the mat.
He looks around and sees ALL of
the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.
CARTER (CONT'D)
That's pretty good.
Which one of you
kids did that?
Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
hands, and sitting on the last one.
CARTER
And that's how you use the LAPD choke
hold.
Now start practicing and don't
make me come back here!
LEE
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.
LEE
Just follow my lead and act like a
tourist.
CARTER
I am a tourist.
Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.
The door flies
open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway.
Both men are completely naked.
A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
people.
The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
behind.
CARTER
Goddamn you got a small ass.
LEE
Don't look at my ass!
CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
tourists alike.
He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS
CARTER
How you doing?
Can you direct me to the
Heaven on Earth massage parlor?
The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
filled with birds.
CARTER (CONT'D)
No, I don't eat live birds.
I like my
birds dead and deep fried.
You ever
been to Popeyes?
The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.
CARTER (CONT'D)
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.
I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
just put the blade down and let the bird
go.
Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
BIRD inside.
He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
store.
CARTER
How you doing?
I'm looking for Heaven
on Earth.
The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:
ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY
CARTER (CONT'D)
Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
zi.
MAN
You wish to spank my sister with a ping
pong paddle?
CARTER
No man, I was just asking...
MAN
Wait here.
I'll go see if she's awake.
As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.
Pause.
Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
if it's worth staying...
Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.
Carter ducks
to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
waiting Daimler.
The Daimler drives off.
Carter rushes to the middle of the
street with a determined look on his face.
CARTER
I'm gonna solve this case myself.
Taxi!
Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.
A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.
Ricky Tan
walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
crowd of people who are partying on the ship.
Carter steps out of the cab.
CARTER
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
You
understand?
CAB DRIVER
Yes.
I understand.
Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
leaving him alone on the docks.
Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.
The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea.
Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
the slip.
He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.
He
clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --
As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner
- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
REIGN.
Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
money.
He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
as sociopath.
Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.
Carter
hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
for signs of trouble.
He heads into the main party.
Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
champagne.
Carter lights her cigarette for her.
CARTER
How you doing, baby?
My name is Prince
Mubutu from Nigeria.
ISABELLA
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.
That
seat is taken.
CARTER
(in mangled Spanish)
San Juan!
You must know my good friend
Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
Elizondo.
ISABELLA
(in English)
I don't think so.
CARTER
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
in the best circles.
But hey, I
understand.
Make yourself at home,
Isabella.
Champagne, caviar, whatever
you want.
My ship is your ship.
ISABELLA
This is your ship?
CARTER
That's right.
I'm the owner, the
Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
ISABELLA
El Capitan?
CARTER
I don't want to play games with you,
Isabella.
I like you.
I can see myself
with you -- in one of those bathrooms
over there in about five minutes.
ISABELLA
Well, I'm very tempted.
It's such a
beautiful yacht.
What's it called?
CARTER
Called?
What's my ship called?
(he has no idea)
Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
Johnson.
ISABELLA
The S.S. Minow Johnson.
Funny, the name
on the back was "Red Dragon."
CARTER
Red Dragon?
You sure about that?
ISABELLA
I'm sure, because this is my friend's
yacht.
And it's his party.
CARTER
Your friend's ship?
(looking around)
Oh, man.
I must've walked onto the
wrong yacht.
I knew there was a reason
my keys didn't work.
STEVEN REIGN
(taking seat next to Isabella)
Who's your friend?
ISABELLA
Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.
CARTER
Wait a second.
You're Steven Reign?
You're big time.
You own all them big
hotels.
What are you doing in Hong
Kong?
STEVEN REIGN
(ushering away Isabella)
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
in the sights.
ISABELLA
Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.
Carter nods, waves.
Steven Reign and Isabella walk away.
Carter's watching.
Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.
RICKY TAN
Despite what people suspect...what you
suspect --
LEE
Don't.
Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.
RICKY TAN
... if your father were alive, I would
be turning to him now.
(beat)
I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
but I believe some of my people did.
My
enemies are trying to frame me.
(beat)
There is a war going on within the
Triads -- and I am going to lose.
My
name has been written into the book of
death.
LEE
The police can protect you.
RICKY TAN
Nobody can protect me.
I'll make a deal
with you, Lee.
But only iff you'll get
me out of Hong Kong.
LEE
Tell me why they killed the customs
agents.
RICKY TAN
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
Harbor...
Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.
Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.
Hu Li
screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.
Tan
falls back, over the rail, and into the water.
Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
attacking from all sides.
Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
off the bodyguards.
Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
one.
A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
Bodyguard #2.
Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.
Carter turns his head, sees --
-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
during a gangland shooting.
Wordlessly, Reign disappears
back into the shadows.
The yacht is anchored.
A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs.
Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.
Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
Quite a night, Inspector.
Ricky Tan was
our only bait, and now he's gone.
You
finally got your revenge - at the
expense of a U.S. Government
investigation.
CARTER
What "revenge" is he talking about?
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
off this case.
I don't ever want to see
you again, you got that?
CARTER
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
you --
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
Stay out of it, Carter.
You're going
back to L.A.
CARTER
Fine with me.
Sterling walks away disgusted.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
fully cooperate with the Secret Service.
Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.
Chin
motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
approach.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
(to police officers)
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
LEE
I'll take him.
CARTER
Hell no.
The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.
Beat.
CARTER (CONT'D)
(to Lee)
Fine.
But don't expect me to talk to
you.
Carter stalks off.
LEE
Don't push me, Carter.
I'm in no mood
for your bullshit.
Carter gets in Lee's face.
The two men look like they're
about to come to blows.
CARTER
What are you gonna do about it,
grasshopper?
LEE
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
CARTER
Give me your best shot, you flat assed
mama's boy.
LEE
Don't be talking about my mama.
Or my
ass!
CARTER
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
LEE
No.
She's a school teacher.
CARTER
You're not very good at this, are you?
LEE
Good at what?
CARTER
Forget it.
A long beat while Lee considers what to say.
LEE
Five years ago, my father was Chief
Inspector working a big international
smuggling case.
CARTER
Ask me if I give a shit.
Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.
LEE
Ricky Tan killed my father.
Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.
LEE (CONT'D)
He found out his partner, Tan, had been
working for the Triads all along.
(beat)
Before my father could prove it, he was
killed in the line of duty.
CARTER
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
LEE
All the evidence against him
disappeared, the smuggling case was
unsolved.
Tan resigned and went over to
the Triads openly.
CARTER
(pause)
This is about your Daddy's death?
Hell,
Lee, you know my father died on the job.
You could have told me...
(realizing)
This is about more than all that, isn't
it?
This is about your Daddy's last
case, right?
Lee's caught, fibs badly.
LEE
No, no, that would be crazy --
CARTER
You thought the "Customs Agents get
blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
Tan" and you put it all together and
came up with a five year old case.
That's why you didn't tell me what we
were doing...
LEE
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
CARTER
IT IS CRAZY!
LEE
I know.
I know.
I am sorry.
Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
car.
Carter watches him.
Finally he rolls his eyes and
yells.
CARTER
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
LEE
What?
CARTER
Come on, we still got time to order the
Kosher meal.
Always get the kosher
meal, they bring it first.
LEE
I cannot go to LA...
Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
cop beneath the attitude.
CARTER
It sounds impossible --
LEE
You said --
CARTER
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
square up my father's death, I'd go to
hell to do it.
Carter turns, walks away without looking back.
CARTER (CONT'D)
You want to figure out why they killed
your Daddy, get on the plane.
LEE
Why LA?
CARTER
(still not turning)
I guess you're going to have to trust me
on this one.
Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
entrance of the hotel.
Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible.
He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.
LEE
Wait!
There's people down there!
CARTER
There's people up here!
LEE
Get it out of here!
CARTER
Take it!
Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
OF ISABELLA.
She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.
ISABELLA
Get on your feet.
Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
begins to open the package.
CARTER
I wouldn't do that!!!
LEE
It's a bomb.
Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
DOLLAR BILLS.
ISABELLA
You see, no bomb.
Now stay away before
I throw you both in jail for
obstruction.
CARTER
Throw us in jail?
I'm about to bust you
right now.
ISABELLA
I'm an undercover agent for the United
States Secret Service.
CARTER
How do we know you're not lying?
Let me
see your badge.
Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
her bra.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Let me see it again?
LEE
We can help you.
I'm a detective in
Hong Kong.
ISABELLA
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
LEE
Then you know I'm not walking away from
this case.
CARTER
Yeah, that's right.
ISABELLA
We need to get out of sight.
Come down
to my suite.
Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
Agents.
They approach Carter's parked VETTE.
CARTER
Secret Service Agent Carter.
This is my
calling, Lee.
Give me six months and I'll be in
Washington protecting a white guy.
LEE
We both know you would never take a
bullet for someone else.
CARTER
They don't know that.
What are they
gonna do, try and shoot the President
during the interview?
I'll bet Isabella
can pull some strings.
You saw the way
she was staring at me.
LEE
She never even looked at you.
CARTER
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
me.
I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
third world ugly.
LEE
I am not third world ugly.
Women like
me, they think I'm cute.
Like Snoopy.
CARTER
Snoopy is about six inches taller than
you.
I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
chance.
Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.
Lee
reluctantly gets in, too.
Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.
Establishing.
Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.
Carter and Lee enter.
CARTER
(to a worker)
We're looking for a guy named Zing.
Is
he here?
Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.
Then RUNS.
Carter
and Lee exchange looks and run after him.
Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
stairway -- coming almost face to face with --
HU LI
Who has her gun out.
Waiting for them.
ISABELLA is standing
near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.
An 18-WHEELER
in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.
A LIMO is
parked beside it.
Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.
When most of
the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.
They can't blink
without getting mowed down.
HU LI
(in Chinese)
The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
be remembered for ridding the Triads of
your petulance.
Hu Li savors the moment.
CARTER
I hope you just said I have no business
being here, 'cos I was just leaving.
Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
freezing him in his tracks.
Isabella slowly walks several
feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.
ISABELLA
Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
want to talk to them first.
Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.
BANG!
Lee
falls.
Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
of her gun.
BANG!
Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
the jaw with her fist.
CARTER
...oh, that's a filling right there.
That's gonna cost you.
Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.
HU LI
Put them in the truck.
The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.
CARTER
I should kill you right now, but I'm
gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
and maybe you can be reformed.
The WORKERS start towards Carter.
He holds up his hands.
CARTER (CONT'D)
No more hitting.
I'll get in the truck
myself.
As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
look of sheer hatred.
As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.
The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.
The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.
The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.
The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.
The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.
It's
approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.
Soldier #1 opens the
TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.
Lee and Carter are gone.
Except for boxes of money, the
truck bed is EMPTY.
Two soldiers enter the truck bed.
ANGLE UP TO REVEAL
Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
bed.
Above the doors and over the soldiers.
Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
to the ground.
In the next instant:
ON LEE
still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
onto the roof of the truck.
ON CARTER
who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
use a shield as gunfire erupts.
Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
ground.
He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
the first two guards.
Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
the closest way out:
A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.
The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.
CLOSE ON
Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
VEGAS STRIP.
They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
light show in the world.
LEE
Vegas...
CARTER
Lee.
I just got an idea how someone
could launder a hundred million dollars
in cash.
They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:
A TEN-STORY DRAGON.
Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
SECONDS.
FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
at the RED DRAGON.
The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!
Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.
LEE
Red Dragon.
CARTER
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.
The richest of the
rich are making their way inside.
LEE
Let's go.
CARTER
Wait a second.
We can't go in like
this.
Look at this place, we gotta look
fly.
We gotta Mac out.
LEE
What is Mac out?
CARTER
Follow me my Asian brother.
Carter and Lee start to walk away.
CARTER (CONT'D)
Just stay down wind, because I think you
stepped in some serious rat shit down
there.
Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.
Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit.
Le is awkward in "player" guise.
CARTER
(whispering)
Remember, Lee, you're a player now.
You
own the place.
Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
they walk through the doors.
LEE
I own the place.
The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
towards Carter's table.
A TAXI is parked out front.
Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof.
SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
WINNER!"
Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
PENTHOUSE BLOWS!
The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
of the hotel.
THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.
Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER.
They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
SIGN.
It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.
Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.
A HUGE
TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives.
The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.
LEE
I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
miles for this shit!!
They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.
The sign dips
and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
STRETCH LIMO.
