  To establish.  The sun is just rising.  Sprinklers turn on...



  As Jane CRAMS the last of SEVERAL BOXES into the back of her 
  SUV, Melanie approaches.  

                              MELANIE
                Can I bring this?

  Jane turns to find Melanie holding...

                              JANE
                My flat iron?

                              MELANIE
                You don t use it.

                              JANE
                That s not true.  I use it.  When I 
                dress up.  

                              MELANIE
                When do you ever dress up?  Or go 
                  anywhere? 

  Melanie makes her point.  Jane cedes.

                              JANE
                Sure.  Fine.  Take it.

  Melanie happily makes a bee-line to the passenger door and 
  climbs into the car.  As Jane follows suit--

                              MAN (O.S.)
                Ms. Bilinski?

  The UPS GUY is standing behind her.  Sexy, built, nice smile.  

  Jane blushes.  Instantly nervous.  She has a crush.

                              JANE
                Oh.  Hey.  Hello.  Yes.  That s me.  
                Our UPS man.  Nice to see you 
                again. 

  The UPS guy is holding a PACKAGE in one hand.  A computerized 
  clipboard in the other.

                              UPS GUY
                Need you to sign for this.                                                                                  8.



  He holds out the clipboard.  Jane grabs the pen.  Holds it 
    upside-down.  Realizing, she adjusts the pen in her hand, 
  fumbles, awkward, laughs clumsily...

                              JANE
                Woops.  Sorry.  First day with a 
                pen.  

  He hands her the package.

                              UPS GUY
                There you go.

                              JANE
                Jane.  

                              UPS GUY
                I m sorry?

                              JANE
                It s Jane Bilinski.  That s my 
                name.

                              MELANIE (O.S.)
                Mom!

                              JANE
                As well as  mom .  And a few other 
                  not-so-charming appellations I 
                answer to.   

  She s flirting.  Or trying to.  A beat.  Awkward.  Jane is 
  smitten.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                  Anyway...

                              UPS GUY
                  Okie-doke.

  The UPS GUY turns, heads back to his truck.  

  Jane stares at his ass.



  Jane pulls the LAST BOX from her SUV as Melanie joins...  

                              MELANIE
                That the last one?                                                                                10.



                              JANE
                Not quite.  There s actually one 
                more.

  Jane HANDS Melanie the same PACKAGE the UPS GUY delivered 
  earlier.  It s a gift.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                This one s from me.  
                        (pleased with herself)
                Go ahead, open it.

  With that, Melanie tears the tape off.  Excited to have been 
  given a present.  But her SMILE FADES when she sees what s 
  inside.  

  Pulls it out, holds it up.

                              MELANIE
                Night goggles?

                              JANE
                I know I can t stop you from 
                drinking beer or schnapps or 
                whatever it is you ll be getting 
                  intoxicated with, but at least, 
                with these, you ll stumble home 
                safely.

                              MELANIE
                I m not wearing these, mom.  I ll 
                look like a douchebag.

                              JANE
                If Stephen Moscerelli was wearing 
                them, he wouldn t have ended up on 
                crutches now would he?

  Melanie looks at Jane in disbelief.

                              MELANIE
                  Orientation starts in like twenty  
                minutes.

                              JANE
                Okay.  Well.  I love you.  So much.

  Jane hugs her daughter.  Tight.  Fights back the tears.  
  Melanie barely hugs back.   

                              MELANIE
                See you Sunday.                                                                                11.



  Melanie picks up the last box and walks off.  Jane watches 
  with nostalgia, heartbreak and pride, when she suddenly 
  realizes Melanie forgot something.  

  The BOX with the NIGHT GOGGLES inside.  Jane CALLS out...

                              JANE
                Wait, Mel!  You forgot--

  But a CUTE BOY has already approached Melanie, offering to 
  carry her things.  Melanie lets him.  It s official.  Melanie 
  has left the nest.

  Jane blows air, as we...



  ... they help Jane to her feet and tuck her back into her 
  vehicle.  



  Two cars in the driveway.  Jane s is smashed in.  



  To establish.  The parking lot is empty.  

                              CLIFFORD (O.S.)
                Top of the morning, folks.



  Jane s found privacy.  Holds the card in one hand, her cell 
  in the other.  

                              JANE
                      (into cell)
                Hi.  This is Jane Bilinski.  I 
                found what you re looking for.



  Jane stands beside the sign -- THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.                                                                                  34.



  Tourists pose beside her.  Cameras flash.  

  But Jane isn t there for a photo op.  She s meeting someone.  
  Scans the crowd.  

                              MAN (O.S.)
                Excuse me.

  Jane turns, expectantly.  Only it s an overweight TOURIST.  
  She deflates.  Was expecting someone else.

                              JANE
                Can I help you?

                              TOURIST
                Would you mind?

  The man holds out his camera.  Jane reluctantly agrees.

                              JANE
                Sure.  Okay.

  As the TOURIST and his WIFE pose for Jane, she lifts the 
  camera to her face.  

  JANE S POV THROUGH THE LENS:

  At first we just notice the Tourist and his wife.  But then, 
  in the background, our eyes are drawn to a familiar face in 
  the crowd.  

  Paramedic #2 from the ambulance earlier.  

  The one who gave Jane a number to call.  We get a better look 
  at him now.  40s, clean cut, handsome.

  He s staring right back at Jane.  She drops the camera from 
  her face.  Looks right at him.  He s standing alone.  

                              TOURIST
                Gotta wait for the light to blink.

  Jane takes the photo, hands the Tourist his camera.

                              TOURIST (CONT D)
                Thanks so--

  But Jane is already gone.  


  Jane stands with Paramedic #2.  He gestures to the crowd.                                                                                35.



                                PARAMEDIC #2
                This busy enough for you?

                              JANE
                It s fine.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Let s walk.

  They do.  Through the mass of people.

                                PARAMEDIC #2 (CONT D)
                Y know, Daniel Chester French, the 
                guy who sculpted the Lincoln 
                  Memorial, was deaf.  That s why 
                  Lincoln s hands are shaped as an 
                 A  and an  L  in sign language.

  Jane s not up for small talk.

                              JANE
                  Interesting.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                  Lincoln... talk about an honest 
                  upstanding citizen.  
                      (then)
                How s your head?  

                              JANE
                My neck is still stiff, thanks.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Yeah, sorry about that.  We had to 
                make sure you were alone.  And that 
                we had your undivided attention.  
                You understand.

                              JANE
                No, frankly, I don t.  I don t 
                  understand any of this.  Who is 
                 we ?  Who are YOU?  I mean, 
                  honestly, I have no idea what I m 
                doing here.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                You said you found your husband s 
                second cell phone.

                              JANE
                I have what you want.  But first 
                you tell me who you are.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                36.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                Is my husband having an affair with 
                your wife?  

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                No.

                              JANE
                Okay.  Is my husband screwing your 
                client s wife?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                I m not a private investigator.  
                And your husband is not having an 
                affair.  At least, not to my 
                  knowledge.

                              JANE
                Then what do you want from me?  And 
                what the hell is my husband doing 
                with a second cell phone?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Jane...
                      (then)
                Is it okay if I call you Jane?

                              JANE
                Fine, whatever.

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                Jane, for the last seven years your 
                husband has been an International 
                Spy, selling highly sensitive 
                security information to Russian 
                  Intelligence Agencies in exchange 
                for money.  

  A beat.  Jane, at first, is speechless.  Then she can t help 
  but laugh.  

                              JANE
                Come again?

                                PARAMEDIC #2
                And my name is Agent Michael Winter 
                with the Federal Bureau of 
                  Investigation.

  He ever so inconspicuously flashes a badge.  Jane stops in 
  her tracks.  

                              JANE
                That is the craziest thing I ve 
                ever heard.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                37.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                Richard is a computer technician 
                for Global Tech Services.  And has 
                been.  For the last twelve years.

                                WINTER
                Global Tech is the sole provider of 
                tech support to every Government 
                agency in the country.  They have 
                access to files as high as the 
                White House.

                              JANE
                This conversation is ridiculous.

                                WINTER
                We don t think so.

                              JANE
                Okay, this is obviously a big joke.  
                Did Rachel put you up to this?

                                WINTER
                No ma am.

                              JANE
                You have some beef with Richard and 
                this is all just payback?

                                WINTER
                I m afraid not.  

                              JANE
                Well, y know what then, Mr. Winter 
                or whoever you really are.  I m 
                  offended.  You screw up my car, 
                which I now owe the deductible on, 
                  I could ve been seriously injured.  
                You plant absurdities in my head 
                that have me sneaking around my 
                house all night and yeah, okay, so 
                I did find another cell phone, 
                which is probably for my husband s 
                mistress or whatever to reach him 
                on, but A. I don t care, and B. I 
                don t have time for this crap.  I 
                just got promoted to Floor Manager 
                and I certainly don t have time to 
                be screwed with by some guy who 
                gets his rocks off watching a soon 
                to be middle aged woman run around 
                in circles after--                                                                                38.



                                WINTER
                --where did you find the second 
                cell?

  Jane stops, can t believe the cajones on this guy.

                              JANE
                In his car.  It was hidden inside 
                the vent.

                                WINTER
                  Impressive.  That couldn t have 
                been easy to find.  Let me guess, 
                you tried turning it on but he 
                keeps the SIM card hidden somewhere 
                else.

  Jane won t admit it, but Winter s right.

                              JANE
                Don t get me wrong, I am hardly 
                Ingrid Bergman here, standing by my 
                man out of some sort of 
                  responsibility.  In fact, we ve 
                been nothing more than roommates 
                for the last ten years, it s just, 
                this is all a bit far fetched and 
                silly, frankly.  So, I m leaving.

  As Jane walks off--

                                WINTER
                We transferred four thousand 
                dollars into your bank account.  
                The one you re using for Melanie s 
                tuition.  

  This stops Jane.  

                                WINTER (CONT D)
                That outta cover the insurance 
                  deductible, medical expenses and 
                the rest for your trouble.  Bank Of 
                America account number 17738409.  
                Check it yourself.  It cleared this 
                morning.

  Jane s eyes narrow.  Taking him more seriously now.

                              JANE
                How did you know my bank account 
                number?                                                                                39.



                                WINTER
                We know a lot of things.

                              JANE
                I ve been married to this man for 
                almost twenty years.  How can you 
                expect me to believe this?

                                WINTER
                In the last three months your 
                husband traveled five times for 
                  business.  Twice to New York, twice 
                to San Francisco, and once to 
                Texas.

                              JANE
                What s your point?

                                WINTER
                On three of those occasions he 
                didn t fly home from the city he 
                did business in.  Caught puddle 
                jumpers to remote areas, stayed for 
                one night, then flew back to DC.

                              JANE
                What are you talking about?

                                WINTER
                Bottom line.  We re offering you an 
                  opportunity.  That would entail you 
                to stay married to Richard, live in 
                the house, and continue your life 
                exactly as you have been.  Day to 
                day chores, the kids, Walmart.  And 
                help us understand who your husband 
                is working for and why.  

                              JANE
                You want me to spy on my husband?

                                WINTER
                And we ll pay you in exchange.

                              JANE
                If you re so sure Richard s 
                breaking the law, why not arrest 
                him?

                                WINTER
                Because he s a small cog in a very 
                big wheel.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                40.

                                WINTER (CONT'D)
                He s worth much more to us out of 
                jail than he would be inside. 

  Jane hands Winter a disc.  

                              JANE
                Even without Richard s SIM card I 
                could still access his photos.  I 
                  downloaded them while he was 
                  sleeping, before I put his cell 
                phone back.  But I think you ll be 
                  disappointed.  It s just some 
                pictures of public mailboxes and a 
                few trees.  
                      (then)
                I m sure there are Americans who 
                spy for other countries, Agent 
                Winter.  But I highly doubt my 
                husband is one of them.  

  But as Jane walks away from Winter, her face says something 
  contrary.  She doesn t know what to believe...



  To establish.  The work day comes to an end.  EMPLOYEES exit 
  the building.  Walk to their cars...



  Richard WALKS OUT.  His briefcase in hand.  He goes to his 
  car.  Gets in.  Drives off.



  To establish.  The sun is rising.  A new day.



  The BLUE SPORTS CAR parks curb side.  Richard climbs out.  

  JOGGERS, DOG WALKERS, and GARDENERS keep the grounds alive 
  with activity.



  Rachel and KAREN (15) sit on the FRONT STOOP.  Smoking 
  cigarettes.  Jane s car pulls in the driveway.  

                                RACHEL
                Shit.  The Warden.

  Rachel and Karen toss their smokes.  Jane gets out of her 
  car, approaches them.  

                              JANE
                Give me those.

  Instead, Rachel introduces her friend.

                                RACHEL
                This is Karen.

                              KAREN
                What s up.

                                RACHEL
                Not that it s any of your business, 
                but we re going to Erica s.

                              JANE
                I want them now.

                                RACHEL
                What re you talking about?

                              JANE
                The cigarettes you re hiding.
                      (Rachel plays dumb)
                Under your right butt cheek.

                                RACHEL
                No.  Forget it.  They re my 
                  property.  You can t confiscate 
                them.

                              JANE
                I don t want to.  I want to smoke 
                one.

                                RACHEL
                What?  Why?

                              JANE
                Because I ve had a shitty day.                                                                                54.



                                RACHEL
                You ve never smoked a cigarette in 
                your life.

                              JANE
                Never too late.  Besides, I m 
                pretty sure I paid for them.

  Rachel reluctantly PULLS OUT HER PACK OF SMOKES and PULLS ONE 
  OUT for Jane.  Hands it to her.  

                              JANE (CONT D)
                Thank you.  

  Jane walks inside.  Karen turns to Rachel.  Taken aback.

                              KAREN
                That s your mom?

                                RACHEL
                God.  What is up with her?  She s 
                acting so... normal.



  Amidst the crowd of TOURISTS, Jane and Winter WALK along the 
  list of engraved names, messages, cards, etc.                                                                                56.



                              JANE
                You were right about Richard.  He 
                did cancel those flights, then lie 
                about them.  So, I followed him 
                last night.  A couple hours away.  
                And watched him leave an envelope 
                in a trash can.  Another man later 
                picked it up.  Then disappeared.  

                                WINTER
                Was he onto you?

                              JANE
                My husband?  Hardly.  I m about as 
                  invisible to him as I am to the 
                rest of the world.  He didn t 
                notice a thing.

                                WINTER
                Did you confront him?

                              JANE
                No.  
                      (then)
                He also goes by the alias Stuart 
                Walker if that helps. 

  Winter pulls out a small tablet.  Jots it down.

                                WINTER
                Stuart Walker, huh?  That s a new 
                one.  

                              JANE
                That s all I know.

                                WINTER
                So, why did you call me here today?

                              JANE
                I talked to a divorce attorney--

                                WINTER
                --we know.

                              JANE
                --yeah, you mentioned that earlier. 
                Clearly, there s no hiding much 
                from you guys.  I always wanted a 
                big brother, but it s not exactly 
                what I had in mind.  Anyway, I came 
                back this morning and started 
                packing.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                57.

                              JANE (CONT'D)
                Just wanted to run as far away from 
                this marriage as I could. So sad 
                that this is what became of all the 
                hopes and dreams I had when we met.  
                When we started a family.  I had it 
                all planned out.  How my life would 
                look.  But somewhere along the way 
                I became a spectator.  Life was in 
                cruise control and I was just along 
                for the ride.  Believing that if I 
                strayed off course I d be letting 
                everyone down somehow.  But in the 
                process, I ve only let down myself.  
                I don t know who I am anymore.  Or 
                what my purpose is.  I don t think 
                I ve ever known, really.  I met, 
                then married Richard before I had a 
                chance to figure all that out.

                                WINTER
                And now?

                              JANE
                As I was packing to leave, it hit 
                me.  I m so angry.  So appalled by 
                my husband s betrayal.  And not 
                because he s been lying to me for 
                so long.  But because he s been 
                living this life of excitement and 
                intrigue for years.  And I haven t.

  Jane stops.  Turns to Winter.

                              JANE (CONT D)
                As hard as it was to follow Richard 
                like that... it s the first time in 
                years I ve felt alive.  
                      (a beat; then)
                So, I m in.   What Richard s doing 
                is wrong.  And I want to help you 
                figure out who he s working for.  
                And why.  

                                WINTER
                I m very pleased.  Had a feeling 
                you d come around.

                              JANE
                Can you at least pretend I m not so 
                  predictable?

                                WINTER
                I ll work on that.                                                                                58.



                              JANE
                Thanks.

                                WINTER
                Those photos you downloaded, 
                despite your concern that images of 
                trees and a mailbox were useless... 
                our techs were able to analyze 
                them.  They re convinced of the 
                  contrary.  They re actually a tip-
                off to Richard s next exchange.

                              JANE
                So what does that mean?

                                WINTER
                It means, live your life as you 
                have been and we ll be in touch.  
                You ll be notified of your next 
                  assignment when we re ready.  Until 
                then... we ll go our separate ways.  
                But I think this is the beginning 
                of a beautiful friendship...

  Winter nods, smiles slightly and moves off.  As Jane watches 
  Winter disappear into the throng... 

                              JANE (O.S.)
                I ve been more hopeful lately...
