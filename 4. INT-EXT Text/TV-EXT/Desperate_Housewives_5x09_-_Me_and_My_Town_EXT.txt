Katherine opens the door to find Susan. 

SUSAN
Hey, you want to take a walk? I need a 
little girlfriend time. 

KATHERINE
Well, I ve got something in the oven. 
But you can come in if you want. 

SUSAN
Thanks. 

As they enter and head to the kitchen...

KATHERINE
So what s on your mind?

SUSAN
Mike. about It s

Unseen by Susan, Katherine reacts.

KATHERINE
Mike?

SUSAN
He s dating someone. And he won t tell 
me who, and he s being all weird about 
it. So tell me... when you were at the 
hospital yesterday, did you see anyone 
coming out of his room? 

Katherine stands frozen -- a deer in headlights.

Sorry, I was just thinking. Nope, 
 anyone. see didn t

During the following, Katherine opens the oven and takes out 
a sheet of cookies. She places it next to a rack of cookies 
that are cooling. 

(CONT D) KATHERINE
But what difference does it make? I 
mean, you re not still...

SUSAN
No, no, of course not. That s the 
point. Does Mike think I m some 
delicate flower who can t handle it if 
 someone? seeing he s

KATHERINE
Well, I m sure he has his good reasons 
for keeping it from you.

SUSAN
Yes, and I know the reason. It s 
someone I know. That s why he s being 
so evasive. 

KATHERINE
Wow, you re quite the detective there. 

SUSAN
You don t sleep with a man that long 
and not know him. 
(beat)
Wait. I know who it is!

KATHERINE
You do?

SUSAN
It s Lisa Wallace. She s been wanting 
to get her hooks into him for years, 
and I just heard she s getting a 
divorce.

KATHERINE
That s it. Case closed.

SUSAN
Unless... it s Barbara Ritter. You 
know, Mike was always a boob-man.

As Katherine crosses her arms across her chest, Susan takes 
one of the cooled cookies. 

(CONT D) SUSAN
God, what kind of back-stabber would 
go after a friend s ex like that? I 
mean, it s only been a couple years. 
(bites into cookie; mouth 
full)
But I guess some people just think 
about themselves. Doesn t matter to 
them if --

Realizing something, Susan stops chewing. Beat. She looks up 
and glares at Katherine. 

KATHERINE
What s wrong?

Susan spits a macadamia nut into her hand. As she stares 
daggers at Katherine...

follows. As Susan strides briskly toward her house, Katherine 
tries to keep up. 

KATHERINE
Susan, I swear, I was going to tell 
you --

SUSAN
(clipped)
It s fine. It s fine. 

KATHERINE
I just didn t think it would be such a 
big deal. I mean, you re with Jackson 
now.

SUSAN
Yes, I am. You re perfectly right. 

KATHERINE
And I ve just been so lonely lately.

SUSAN
Bree?

KATHERINE
Yes. A few weeks ago she told me I 
should tell you. That if I didn t, it 
would blow up right in my face. 

SUSAN
So Bree knew? 

KATHERINE
Yes.

Okay. Well, have a nice day.

As an angry Susan marches up Bree s front walk...


CLOSE ON the door, as a hand angrily pounds on it. The door 
opens, revealing Bree, who looks like she just woke up.

SUSAN
You knew about Katherine and Mike?

BREE
Oh God, Susan. Can this wait until 
after my nap?

SUSAN
Why didn t you tell me?

BREE
I didn t think it was my place. I 
thought Katherine should tell you.

SUSAN
 didn t! she Well,

BREE
sorry. I m

SUSAN
Uh, not good enough. You had a million 
chances to say something and you 
didn t. That s the same as lying to my 
face. 
(then)
You know, the one thing I always 
thought I could depend on you for is 
honesty. What happened to that?

Bree considers this, then:

BREE
You want honesty? Fine. You never 
wanted to divorce Mike. You hit a 
really bad patch after the accident, 
but you never stopped loving him. And 
why would you? The relationship didn t 
have a natural end. So face it, you re 
not mad at me or Mike or Katherine -- 
you re mad at yourself for letting 
your marriage fall apart!
(then, realizing)
That was very harsh. I haven t had 
much sleep lately. 

Susan takes this in for a beat, then:

SUSAN
So, what am I supposed to do?

BREE
Make a decision. Either tell Mike how 
you feel, or move on. Because that s 
what he s trying to do. And it s not 
fair of you to stop him.  

Off Susan...


ANDREW is on his cell. 

ANDREW
I just got a call from the lady at the 
cookware store. She said Mom s late. 

ORSON
Late for what?

ANDREW
The cooking demonstration. 

ORSON
I thought that was scheduled for 
tomorrow. 

ANDREW
No, it s scheduled for ten minutes 
ago. I m in Mt. Pleasant getting my 
sofa. You need to get her there -- 
Orson? Orson? Hello?

Dave exits the front doors of the Fairview Police Station. He 
walks toward the camera. Beads of sweat have collected on his 
forehead from the visit.  

MARY ALICE (V.O.)
But there are those with wounds that 
cannot close. And for them, the only 
option is to hurt.

As Dave walks out of frame...

FADE OUT.
