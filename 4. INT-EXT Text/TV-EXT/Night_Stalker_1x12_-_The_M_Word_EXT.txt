    An ominous full moon hangs in the night sky, portending only 
    one thing -- this episode s gonna have a monster in it.


      Somewhere in the foliage, heavy guttural BREATHING is heard, 
    as two silhouetted figures (hunched shouldered, wild, out-of-
      control hair) appear in view.  As these creatures (monsters?) 
      begin GRUNTING, they come through a clearing, revealing only 
      a couple of STONERS (#1 and #2), giggling stupidly.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, don t make me laugh like that  
                    -- the glue almost came out my 
                    nose!  Whoa -- look at that moon!   

                                  STONER #2
                    Dude!

      Stoner #2 has looked up, but in the wrong direction.  Stoner 
    #1 nudges him towards the  real  moon, which causes Stoner #2 
    to do a double take.  They stare hypnotically for a while.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, what would you do if I turned 
                    into a werewolf right now, and tore 
                    your head off?

                                  STONER #2
                    How would you get home?

                                  STONER #1
                    I d take your car.

                                  STONER #2
                    Werewolves can t drive.

                                  STONER #1
                    I d only be half wolf.  The  were  
                    half would still know how to drive.

                                  STONER #2
                    A stick shift?!

      Stoner #1 nods, defeated. Suddenly, a non-human SHRIEK and a 
      human SCREAM, erupts o.s.  The stoners exchange nervous looks 
      before heading towards the noises.  Parting through some 
      shrubbery, they come upon a tableau of terror.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  2.



      A man (PARK RANGER) is being attacked by a ... well, we don t 
    get a good look at it, but the man-size creature looks 
      reptilian, resembling a horned lizard (including, obviously, 
      some occipital horns).  Its features also have a humanness to 
      them, in the manner of Jack Pierce s classic Universal make-
    up designs of yore.  In short -- it s a MONSTER! 

                                  STONER #1 & #2 
                    Dude!

    The Monster, belting out a hiss-like SHRIEK, releases its 
      victim, and darts straight towards the stoners, who dive for 
      safety.  After a moments pause, with neither one of them 
      hurt, they regard each other.

                                  STONER #2
                    Did that just happen?

      Stoner #1 gets up, and followed by his colleague, moves to 
    the blood-covered attack victim, kneeling down over him.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, are you okay?

                                  RANGER
                    Yeah, I think so. 

                                  STONER #2     
                    Dude, are you okay?

                                  RANGER
                    Yeah, I m all right.

                                  STONER #2
                    Dude, are you okay?

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, he just said he s okay.

                                  STONER #2
                    No, not this dude -- thisdude. 

      Stoner #1 and the Ranger now look over and see that Stoner #2 
    is addressing another person lying nearby.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, I don t think that dude s 
                    okay.

      CAMERA MOVES TO REVEAL the exposed rib cage of this other, 
      LIFELESS VICTIM.  His upper torso appears ... devoured.

                                  ACT ONE


      ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS mix with POLICE OFFICERS as the dead 
      body is lifted into an ambulance by EMTs.  A small crowd of 
      BYSTANDERS (HIKERS, MOUNTAIN BIKERS) looks on in concern.

    The Park Ranger, a ruggedly handsome man with a wide gap in 
    his front teeth, leans against his truck, still shaken from 
    his attack, but robust enough to answer questions from REED.

                                  RANGER
                    I was informing him the trails were 
                    closed after sundown, and started 
                    lecturing about how dangerous it 
                    was to be hiking up here alone at 
                    this time of the night, when ... 
                    wouldn t you know it? 

                                  REED
                    When did you first see the lion?

                                  RANGER
                    To be honest, I never did.  Cougars 
                    ambush their prey from behind -- I 
                    now know from experience.

                                  REED
                    What were you doing while the lion 
                    was attacking the hiker?

                                  RANGER
                    I m afraid I was unconscious.  I 
                    only came to later.  I just wish I 
                    could have done more to save him.

                                  REED
                    You were trying to warn him, and 
                    you risked your life to do it.  
                    That makes you a hero in my book.

                                  RANGER
                    I was just doing my job.  And I d 
                    be dead now, too, if it weren t for 
                    those kids.  They re the heroes.

                    I don t think of us as heroes.  
                    We re more like anti-heroes.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  4.

                    We don t have any actual powers.

      Standing in a different area of the crime scene, the stoners 
      answer questions from Reed.

                                  REED
                    What were you two doing up here so 
                    late at night?

                                  REED
                    Did either of you get a good look 
                    at the lion?

                                  STONER #1
                    We keep telling  em it wasn t a 
                    lion, but the cops are like,  Aw, 
                    shut up, ya hippies.   Yeah, they 
                    called us  hippies! 

                                  REED
                    If it wasn t a lion, what was it?

                    Dude ... it was a monster!

                    Did somebody just say,  Monster?

                          (raising hand)

                    What did this monster look like?

                                  STONER #1
                    It was huge and scaly, and had 
                    fangs dripping with blood, and 
                    claws, and it had three eyes!

                                  STONER #2
                    Dude, that thing only had one eye.

                                  STONER #1
                    I saw three.  Maybe when you looked 
                    at it, the other two were blinking.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  5.

                    Did it have a tail?

                    Did what have a tail?

                                  REED
                    Kolchak ... why?  Why must you 
                    always leap to the most 
                    preposterous angle?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why call it preposterous before all 
                    the facts are in?  You don t even 
                    know if this thing has a tail.

                    A person was attacked in an area 
                    where mountain lions live.  Why 
                    drag a ridiculous monster into this 
                    very human tragedy?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What makes it any less a tragedy if 
                    a monster was involved?  Besides, 
                    the witnesses say it was a monster.

                                  REED
                    You re going to take the word of 
                    these two?!  They don t even know 
                    we re talking about them right now.

      Reed pauses, letting the Stoners stare back as blankly as 
      cows, proving her point.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That doesn t mean what they re 
                    describing doesn t actually exist.

                    tail, but it had some gnarly horns.

    As Kolchak jots this down, Reed rolls her eyes and moves 
      away, crossing to the GRIEVING MOTHER, who is being supported 
    by a FAMILY MEMBER, as they stand by the ambulance.

                                  REED
                    Hi, I m Perri Reed of the Beacon.  
                    I m so sorry for your loss, and I 
                    know this is a difficult time, but 
                    could I get a few words about your 
                    son, or possibly a picture ....

    As Reed continues off with the Mother, CAMERA HOLDS on a 
      nondescript, middle aged man (GUY MANN) crossing through the 
      scene.  Wearing an unusually designed tie, as well as a light 
      blue-striped seersucker coat and white shoes (reminiscent of 
      a certain TV character of the 70 s), he holds his head in his 
      hands, obviously distraught.

                    Kolchak, why must you always leap 
                    to the most preposterous angle?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    All I m asking is why aren t you 
                    taking their claims serious?

                    Those kids had enough airplane glue 
                    on  em to build the Spruce Goose. I 
                    cut them some slack, because they 
                    saved that ranger s life.

      hustles over, with Kolchak on his heels.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  7.




    Not a cave, but simply a secluded area, off the beaten path.  
    The lair is piled high with HUMAN REMAINS, most reduced to 
      SKELETONS, but some are naked and half-devoured.

      Animal Control and Police stare down at the scene in horror, 
    and as the Sheriff, Kolchak, and then Reed, join them, their 
      expressions conform with the others.  Everyone is too aghast 
    to speak.  Well, not everyone:

    The Monster rears its ugly head.  With a slightly seedy motel 
    in the b.g., the Monster -- seen from behind, and in 
      silhouette (its horns give it away) -- rises slowly from the 
      bottom of the frame.  A CLICKING NOISE emits o.s., and the 
      Monster whips its head in that direction.

    The clicking comes from the stiletto heels worn by BABYCAT, a 
      streetwalker walking the street in front of the motel.

      MONSTER S POV - BABYCAT

      From behind a parked car, watching as Babycat eyes passing 
      cars.  Stalkingly, the CAMERA creeps towards her, but stops, 
      darting behind another parked car, as a CUSTOMER pulls up to 
    the curb, and Babycat leans into his passenger window.

    We watch as Babycat flirts, for quite a while.  CAMERA TILTS 
      DOWN, revealing the Monster s clawed hand and scaly arm, 
      around which is a wristwatch (which it then shakes, 
      irritably.)  TILT BACK UP to see the car pull away, leaving 
      Babycat alone on the sidewalk.  As she turns her back, CAMERA 
      rushes towards her.  At the last second, Babycat turns 
      around.

    As her eyes widen in fear, she SCREAMS.  As she desperately 
      swings at the oncoming attacker, and her purse fills the 
      frame --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Which way did it go?

                                  BABYCAT
                    I told those animal control people 
                    it slithered towards the motel,   
                    but they just ignored me.  They 
                    think I m on crack.

                    Sure, but that s no reason to be 
                    rude.

      Kolchak shows her his political cartoon sketch.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Does this resemble the  dragon  you 
                    saw?

                                  BABYCAT
                    Well, it wasn t wearing a top hat 
                    and monocle.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Ignore that part.

                                  BABYCAT
                    It was only wearing underwear.

      Kolchak is unsure how to respond, so Reed does for him.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  13.

    She puts her arm seductively through Kolchak s.  He pauses.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You re not a  damsel , are you?

                    So, did it have one eye or three?


      Behind some buildings that are under minor construction 
      (scaffolding, a port-a-potty, etc.), Kolchak and McManus 
      listen to a frustrated Animal Control Officer.  The Officer 
      gets in his truck, and drives off, leaving the journalist to 
      begin their own search of the area. 

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Sightings of a  monstrous-sized
                    animal  provide proximity, but 
                    closeness doesn t count in the 
                    darknessof our souls.

      MONTAGE

      Series of shots of Kolchak and McManus driving and walking 
      down various back alleys.

                    When others are too afraid to face 
                    the face of fear, its up to the 
                    stalkers of the night to search the  
                    dark shadows, looking for a pair of 
                    eyes to peer back out.  The 
                    monstersof our nightmares never 
                    sleep, so their pursuers can never 
                    rest, can never relent, can never --


      Kolchak s v.o. abruptly stops, allowing Kolchak and McManus, 
      standing at the side counter of Pink s hot dog stand, to eat 
      their chili cheese dogs in peace.  After a couple bites --


      McManus is walking down the original back alley.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Your prey considers you prey, and 
                    thinks you re the evil menace.  On 
                    this murky battlefield ... 

      Annoyed, McManus looks over at Kolchak, who is revealed to be 
      dictating into his portable tape recorder.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    ... who stalks who, and for which 
                    side is fear rooting --
                          (notices McManus  look)
                    What?

                                  MCMANUS
                    You were doing that all night.  Are 
                    you going to do it all morning, 
                    too?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It sometimes helps me get down my 
                    first drafts.

                                  MCMANUS
                    You mean your roughdrafts, right?  
                    That was just a very rough ... 
                    outline kind of thing, right?

      Shooting McManus a look, Kolchak clicks off his tape 
      recorder.  The two continue walking down the dark alley.

                                  MCMANUS (CONT D)
                    You know, you have to come up with 
                    a name for this thing.  You can t 
                    just keep calling it  The Monster. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why not?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You think that s the reason?

                                  MCMANUS
                    How about ...  Lizardo ?  Only you 
                    spell it with a  y , to make it 
                    more exotic.  Or with three  z  s -- 
                    one for each eye.   Another bloody 
                    rampage by Liz-z-zardo!   That 
                    would sell some papers.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I think I ll wait  til we catch it, 
                    then just ask it what its name is.

                                  MCMANUS
                    Wouldn t it be weird if it said 
                    it s name is  Lizardo?   That d be 
                    pretty creepy.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not as creepy as this.

      McManus follows Kolchak s look down to the ground, where, 
      partially obscured by debris, is a naked, partially devoured 
      dead body.  Kolchak bends down to inspect it.

                                  KOLCHAK (CONT D)
                    It looks like it s found a new lair.  
                    At least, we know it s been here.  

    As McManus takes a picture, the flash illuminates the alley, 
      where a distant figure suddenly darts away.  Kolchak and 
      McManus take off in pursuit.  They reach the end of the 
      alley, but the figure is gone.

      Cautiously, they begin searching about, slowly breaking off, 
      spreading out in different directions.

    As McManus heads down a dark side alley, he flashes some 
      pictures, just to light his way.  A silhouetted figure slowly 
      rises behind him.  McManus continues on, unaware of the 
      entity encroaching from behind.

      Just before he is pounced upon, McManus turns around.  He 
      speed shoots his camera, causing a STROBE-LIGHT look at the 
      SHRIEKING Monster lunging at a SCREAMING McManus.

      KOLCHAK

      Immediately, runs towards the SCREAMING, racing down the side 
      alley, until suddenly freezing in his tracks.

      McManus lies on the ground, motionless, covered in blood.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  18.



      Kolchak kneels down beside him, touching his face.  McManus 
      slowly opens his eyes.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Are you all right?  What happened?

                                  MCMANUS
                    Lizardo.

    The sound of a DOOR SLAMMING emits from the outer alley.  
      Kolchak helps McManus up, and they resume their pursuit. 

    Out in the main alley, by the construction work, STRANGE 
      NOISES are heard coming from within the port-a-potty.

      Cautiously, the two approach the john.  Kolchak grabs a 
      nearby pallet, ripping out one of its wooden planks (it 
      retains a bent nail at the end of it), and wielding it as a 
      weapon, Kolchak reaches for the door, as McManus readies his 
      camera.  

      Kolchak yanks open the door, and rears back to use his board-
        with-a-nail-in-it club, as McManus speed shoots his camera.  

      Sitting in the port-a-potty, with his pants around his 
      ankles, reading a copy of TheBeacon, is a human man.  The 
    man glimpsed in Act One, Guy Mann.  

      Kolchak and McManus share looks of confused disappointment.

                                  GUY
                    Uhm ... do you mind?

      Kolchak sits in his car, jotting down some notes, as Reed 
      comes out of the house, and gets in the car.

                    So anything that would be of

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I just prefer stories with a bigger 
                    scope, that s all.

                    Bigger -- as in giant horny toads?

                    They re horned lizards.

                    You re just bitter because he 
                    didn t confirm your monster theory.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t need him -- I got my 
                    confirmation right here.

      From below his seat, Kolchak holds up a blood shirt.

                                  REED
                    What is that?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    His bloody shirt.  I  borrowed  it 
                    from his trash can.

                    That s tabloid journalism.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It s only tabloid if you re digging 
                    up dirt on someone.  I dug up 
                    evidence.  If this blood matches

      Kolchak questions a couple of POLICE OFFICERS, who give the 
      appearance that this was a call of no consequence.  As they 
    get into their patrol car, Kolchak heads towards the office. 

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Another incident, at a previous 
                    sighting, offers the promise of 
                    capture, but, alas, when it s 
                    revealed to be a mere 
                      misunderstanding, hopes are dashed.  
                    Or are they?


      Kolchak heads back to his car, but notices the door of one of 
    the rooms is ajar.  He walks over, and peeks inside.


      Kolchak pulls into the parking lot, and seems to leap out of 
    the car before its even parked.  As he runs inside --


      CLOSE on a statue of St. George, slaying a dragon.  WIDER TO 
      REVEAL Guy, in abject depression, studying the figure, 
      amongst the statuary in a cemetery.

      Kolchak s Mustang pulls up on the cemetery roadway.  Kolchak 
      gets out, and, grabbing some flowers off a grave, heads 
      towards Guy, stopping a few headstones down from him.  

    Guy glances over at Kolchak, who puts down the flowers as if 
      visiting that grave.  Kolchak nods at him, but Guy simply 
      turns away.   After a pause, Guy SIGHS wearily.

                    like ... well, you re not planning 
                    on ... doing anything rashare you?

                                  GUY
                    Rash?  No.  I m just going to kill 
                    you.  Are you ready?

    No, Kolchak was not ready for this response, nor is he ready 
      when Guy pulls a Heineken beer bottle out of his coat pocket, 
      SMASHES the end against a tombstone, and with the jagged 
      edge, lunges at Kolchak, who barely leaps out of the way.

      After a few feints, Guy charges at Kolchak, causing him to 
      tumble backwards over a tombstone.  Oddly, rather than 
      attacking while Kolchak is on the ground and vulnerable, Guy 
      tosses the broken bottle down near Kolchak.

      Kolchak gathers his senses, and seeing the broken bottle, he 
      grabs it, as he springs to his feet.  Guy now strangely 
      resumes his attack.

                                  GUY
                    I m gonna kill you!

    Guy clutches Kolchak around the throat.  Kolchak moves to 
      stab Guy, but suddenly stops.  Guy strangles him a bit more, 
      before trying to help Kolchak defend himself.  Grabbing 
      Kolchak s bottle-wielding hand, he pulls the bottle towards 
    his own lower abdomen.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  37.



                                  GUY
                    Defend yourself, you idiot!

      Just as it is about to pierce Guy, Kolchak manages to let go 
    of the bottle, which falls harmlessly to the ground.  Guy 
      stops chocking Kolchak, and crumbles to the ground, SOBBING.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I know what your trying to do.  The 
                    green glass, the appendix.  But I 
                    won t do it.  I won t kill you.  I 
                    want to help you.

                                  GUY
                    You can only help me by killing me!  
                    Please -- put me out of my misery!

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (pause)
                    Okay.  I ll do it.  I ll kill you.

    Guy gets to his feet, and profusely shakes Kolchak s hand.

                                  GUY
                    Oh, thank you, thank you.  You re 
                    the only kind person I ve ever met.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But before I kill you, you have to 
                    answer me something.

                                  GUY
                    What?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

      This gives Guy pause.  Not sure if  he can explain it all, or 
    if he even wants to, he takes a deep breath.  Then, he 
      reaches into his inside coat pockets, and pulls out a couple 
      bottles of beer.  He hands one to Kolchak.

                                  GUY
                    This could take a while.

                                  ACT FIVE


      Sitting on a bench with Kolchak, Guy studies the monster 
      sketch, nodding in recognition.

                                  GUY
                    It s accurate. Corporations are 
                    really sticking it to the unions.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Ignore that.  Is this what you look 
                    like, when you transform into a ... 
                    horned lizard?

                                  GUY
                    Horned Lizard?  They re like this!
                          (holds out hand)
                    It s funny -- I don t know what I m 
                    called, or if I look like this.  
                    I ve never seen myself.  I guess 
                    I m a Giant Horned Lizard.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Well, how long have you been a ... 
                       were-lizard? 

                                  GUY
                    Only a couple of days.  I remember 
                    the night it began.  I was just 
                    minding my own business.  No, I 
                    wasn t even doing that much.  I was 
                    just ... simply ... alive.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Looking as carefree as Tom Sawyer, the Monster lies on the 
      ground, staring up at the stars,  with a grass stalk sticking 
    out of his mouth.  

      A RUSTLING NOISE, o.s., causes him to sit up like a prairie 
      dog.  He scurries into the top soil, practically vanishing, 
      just before two men (the teaser Victim and Park Ranger, whose 
      identity we don t want to emphasize) appear, grappling to the 
      death, and crashing to the ground next to the unseen Monster.

    The Monster watches with one eye that is not submerged under 
    the soil, as the Ranger starts killing the Victim.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  39.



                                  GUY (V.O.)
                      Instinctively, I knew not to move, 
                    but when the predator started  
                    devouring his prey ... I panicked.

    The Monster springs up from the ground, strikes a terrifying 
      attack pose, and belts out a SHRIEK.


    Guy is in the identical pose, now looking not-so-terrifying.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    And then you attacked him?

                                  GUY
                    No, I shot blood out my eyeball at 
                    him.  It s my defense mechanism.  I 
                    was trying to scare him off, but it 
                    just made him more rabid.


    The Man (Ranger) bites the Monster s neck.  The Monster 
      SHRIEKS IN PAIN, and wriggles free.  It runs away, straight 
      towards the Stoners, who SCREAM and dive to the ground, 
      causing the Monster to SCREAM and run away in the opposite 
      direction.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I managed to escape with my life, 
                    not knowing how much my life had 
                    changed, until the next morning.


      Naked, Guy sleeps buried in the top soil.  He awakes.  
      Shielding his eyes from the sun, he notices his hand.  It s 
    now a human hand!  He stares at it with horror.  He checks 
    his other hand, then the rest of his body.  He touches the 
      bite mark on his neck.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    My transformation was not only 
                    physical, but mental.  I was now 
                    ... thinking, not merely reacting.  
                    Then I reacted.

    Guy starts pounding his fist into the ground, looking not 
      unlike Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes.

                                  GUY

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    As my mind raced on, I became aware 
                    of my own thoughts, and suddenly I 
                    had my first epiphany of self-
                      consciousness:

    Guy suddenly stops pounding his fist, and sits bolt upright.

                                  GUY
                    I m naked.

      Looking about, he spots a backpack partially buried beneath 
    the brush.  He goes over, and finds clothes, wallet, and 
      watch inside.  As he begins dressing:

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Even though I d never worn such 
                    things, I somehow knew how to put 
                    them on.  And then, I became 
                      overwhelmed by an unnatural, 
                      irrational, psychotic desire.  I 
                    fought against it as best I could, 
                    but I had lost control over myself.  
                    Now, nothing could stop me.

    Guy is knotting his tie.  A crazed look comes over him.  He 
      clutches his head in pain, struggling to not give in, but the 
      crazed look overtakes him again, and as he tightens his 
      necktie, he breathes heavily, like a blood-lusting beast. 

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I was going to go and hunt down ... 
                    a job!


      A reprise of ACT ONE, as a distraught Guy walks through the 
      crime scene, not noticed by both Reed and Kolchak.

                                  GUY
                    Why?  Why?  Why?

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Compelled by these unseen forces, I 
                    walked straight down into town.


                                  KOLCHAK
                    Wait.  Wait a second.  First of 
                    all, you re claiming a man attacked 
                    and bit you?      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  41.



    Guy pulls back his shirt collar, revealing a strange scar, 
      much too small to be a human bite mark.

                                  GUY
                    It doesn t look like a bite mark, 
                    because I looked different when the 
                    rabid man bit me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But ... you re saying you were this 
                    monster to begin with, and then, 
                    after being bit, you turned into a 
                    man?  That doesn t make any sense!

                                  GUY
                    None of it makes sense.  I mean -- 
                    why a job?  I didn t even know what 
                    a job was, but I had to have one.  


      CLOSE --  Help Wanted  sign in a storefront window.  A hand 
      grabs the sign, but then another hand grabs that hand, as if 
    to stop it.  WIDER TO REVEAL both hands belong to Guy, who

                    advantage humans have over all 
                    other creatures: I can  b.s.  my

                    You wouldn t be  b.s.-ing  me right 
                    now about all this, would you?

                                  GUY
                    Maybe.  I don t even understand 
                    half the things I m saying to you.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s ... disconcerting.

                                  GUY
                    Imagine it from my end.  Even worse 
                    is what I did after work.  I 
                    checked into a motel, and spent the 
                    rest of the day ... watching TV. 


    Guy steps out of his room, and sees Babycat plying her trade 
    on the sidewalk.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                      Eventually, I stepped out for some 
                    air, and that s when I saw her.  It 
                    was mate-for-life at first sight.

    In a love trance, Guy walks out towards Babycat.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    But as I went out to introduce 
                    myself, a change came over me.

    Guy stops, and looks down at his crotch.  As he pulls away 
    the elastic top of his briefs --      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  43.



      GUY S POV - HIS OWN CROTCH

      Underneath his underwear, (besides being genital-less) his 
      skin has transformed into that of a lizard s.  The LIZARD 
      SKIN TRANSFORMATION spreads up his belly and down his thighs, 
    and his hands become claw-like.

    GUY

      Ecstatic as he transforms.

                                  GUY
                    All right!


                                  GUY
                    I turned back into myself, I guess 
                    because the sun had gone down, or 
                    the moon had come out.  I don t 
                    really get how that all works.  
                    Anyway, I was back to normal, but 
                    completely disoriented.  I tried to 
                    return to the safety of my roost.


      From behind a parked car, the Monster, in white briefs, 
      dashes back towards the motel, in the direction of Babycat, 
    who turns, SCREAMS, then CONKS it on the head with her purse.  
    The Monster staggers towards its room.


                                  GUY
                    Why would she do that to me?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    She thought you were attacking her.  
                    Or rather, him.  She was a man.

                                  GUY
                    She had transformed into a man?!

                                  KOLCHAK
                    No, he s a transvestite.  A man who 
                    dresses like a woman.

                                  GUY
                    Why would a man do that?  That s 
                    the craziest thing I ve ever heard.

                    So, anyway, after I turned back 
                    into a Giant Horned Lizard, I fell 
                    asleep peacefully in my motel room.

                    So I tracked down the guy who had 
                    bit me -- the man responsible for 
                    turning my life into a living hell.

                    city of Los Angeles by your sense 
                    of smell?

                                  GUY
                    Yeah, I can see how that would be 
                    the one part of my story that s 
                    hard to believe, but the proof is 
                    ...I found him.


      Crouching behind the port-a-potty, Guy spies on the killer 
      (Ranger), forcibly escorting ANOTHER VICTIM down an alley.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    When I laid eyes on him, I wanted 
                    to tear him apart, limb by limb. 

    Guy removes his jacket and shirt, spits in his fists, and 
      stalks towards the alley, ready to rumble.  But when he gets 
      there, his mouth falls open in shocked horror.  He covers his 
      mouth with one hand, while the other clutches his sensitive 
      stomach. 

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    But before I could, he started 
                    doing the same to someone else.

      Down the dark alley, we see only a hint -- but it s enough -- 
    of the killer viciously attacking his victim.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Never had I witnessed such 
                    brutality. In the wild, I ve seen 
                    some harsh things -- hell, I 
                    watched coyotes eat my mate -- but 
                    this was so ... unnecessary.  I was 
                    so transfixed, I didn t even notice 
                    when I transformed.

    The Monster, in the same exact position and posture that Guy 
    was in, continues watching the killer in horror.

                    After returning to normal, I lost 
                    my taste for vengeance.  I found 
                    refuge behind a trash bin, but come 
                    morning, some guys chased me into a 
                      port-a-potty.  I don t know why.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  47.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    That was me.

                                  GUY
                    I thought I recognized you!  Isn t 
                    that funny?  Oh, god -- I squirted 
                    your friend with eyeball blood.  I 
                    was just trying to scare him away. 
                    Please apologize to him for me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    He didn t take it personally.

                                  GUY
                    Good.  Well, after that, I didn t 
                    know what to do about my life, so 
                    ... I went back to my motel and 
                    watched porn all day.


                                  KOLCHAK
                    Stop.  That did not happen.

                                  GUY
                    I know it s hard to believe by 
                    looking at me, but apparently I m 
                    terrific in the sack.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    No.  What you just told me was a 
                    lie.  I know -- for a fact.

      Kolchak stares Guy down, who sheepishly averts his eyes.

                                  GUY
                    Okay ... you got me.  Ever since 
                    becoming a man, I exaggerate my 
                    life to make it sound more 
                    interesting.  Why?

                    Why should I care what you, or 
                    anyone, think of my sexual prowess, 
                    or lack thereof? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Go back to the woman in the donut 
                    shop. What really happened?

                                  GUY
                    She asked me a bunch of questions, 
                    then she told me donuts were bad 
                    for you.  Did you know that?  I got 
                    so upset. The one thing in this 
                      godforsaken life I like, and it 
                    turns out --

    Guy has pulled out a pack of cigarettes, and put one in his 
      mouth.  As he brings out a lighter, Kolchak shakes his head.

                                  GUY
                    Not cigarettes, too?  You got to be 
                    kidding me?  Why?!

    As Guy leaps up and furiously crushes his cigarettes, a 
      CLICKING NOISE emits from Kolchak s coat pocket.  A pause.

                                  GUY
                    What was that?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Nothing.  So, after the donut --

    Guy reaches into Kolchak s pocket, pulling out a tape 
      recorder.  Guy looks at Kolchak for an explanation.

                                  KOLCHAK (CONT D)
                    I m a reporter.  For The Beacon.

                                  GUY
                    Wait a second -- you re not Carl 
                    Kolchak?  The monster guy?!  You 
                    weren t going to kill me at all, 
                    were you?  You just wanted to write 
                    a story about me, to sell your

                                  KOLCHAK

    Guy SMASHES the recorder against the bench, and bolts.  
      Kolchak makes a move to get up and follow, but hesitates, and 
      then merely watches as Guy dodges past headstones, scaring 
      other CEMETERY VISITORS, as he keeps yelling back: 

                                  GUY

      Kolchak pulls up, stopping at full speed.  He leaps out, and 
      races into the house.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  53.




    In the Mustang, Kolchak cruises around, on the lookout.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  55.

                    Once in your grasp, even the most 
                    desired catch can escape, 
                      necessitating the pursuit again.


      Kolchak shows Guy s photo to Babycat, who shakes her head 
      while trying to put her arm through Kolchak s.


                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    You must start over.  From the very 
                    beginning --

    As Kolchak drives up the fire road, his headlights catch Guy 
      walking up the trail.  Kolchak gets out, and rushes up to 
      Guy, who is taking off his shoes and socks.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Hey, they caught the killer!

                                  GUY
                    What do I care?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But you were right about it.  I 
                    doubted you, because ... well, some 
                    of what you said sounded absurd.

                                  GUY
                    Are you kidding?  It all sounded 
                    absurd!  Because everythingis 
                    absurd.  I mean, look at this 
                    thing!  

    Guy yanks the tie off his head, holding it up for display.  
      Dropping it to the ground, he shakes his wristwatch, and 
      struggles to get it off.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  56.



                                  GUY
                    Can you get this off me?  Like this 
                    isn t absurd -- living your days 
                    according to an arbitrary construct 
                    of time intervals?!

      Kolchak removes the watch, which Guy then tosses into the 
      darkness.  As Guy starts taking off his jacket --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What ... what are you doing?

                                  GUY
                    This is when I d normally 
                    hibernate.  A whole season of 
                    resting in peace!  I m praying -- 
                    even though this whole  God  thing 
                    seems like the biggest absurdity -- 
                    that I stay asleep even if I 
                    transform.  You want this? 

    Guy offers his jacket to Kolchak, who takes it, ever-so-
      gingerly.  Guy rips off his shirt, and takes off his pants 
    and underwear (o.s.,  natch), then starts walking away.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But ... I still have so many 
                    questions to ask you.

      Seen from the waist up, Guy keeps walking, nearing the edge 
    of the headlight beam, as he looks back at Kolchak.

                                  GUY
                    Answer them yourself.  You 
                    understand this as much as I do -- 
                    which is not at all.  Good night!

    Guy turns and walks on.  Just when we should see his naked 
      butt, we don t -- it is covered by a tail.  As the rest of 
      Guy s body begins to transform into the Monster, he 
      disappears into the darkness.

      Kolchak stands alone, holding his new jacket, staring off 
      into the shadows.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Mysteries abound in our universe.  
                      Unfortunately, the only witnesses 
                    to this one were druggies, 
                    perverts, serial killers, and  
                      journalists.Who d believe any of 
                     em?

      Kolchak sitting on the hood of his car, dictating into his 
      tape recorder, which is scotch taped back together.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe no one would believe it 
                    anyway.  The very idea of a 
                    monster, in this day and age, 
                    living amongst us, is preposterous.  
                    But is it any more preposterous 
                    than the very idea of ... us?  The 
                    mystery of Life will always --

    The tape recorder starts CLICKING, and GEARS are heard 
      GRINDING.  Kolchak gives it a whack with his hand, causing 
    the batteries to fly out, and the whole machine falls to 
      pieces.  Kolchak sighs wearily.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

    As he looks up to the heavens for an answer, TILT UP, 
      revealing there are no answers up above, only the moon, still 
      hanging ominously in the night sky.
