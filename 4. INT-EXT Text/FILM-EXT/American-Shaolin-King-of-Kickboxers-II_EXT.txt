ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE AT NIGHT, THE LIGHTS
OF THE CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A
BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.
His is the only one still
occupied, and it doesn't look that
permanent. In the window
is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads
"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".
What remains visible behind the poster and
the security grate is an
IMPRESSION of people moving and milling
around.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.
It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is
candlelight inside, and it is moving around  an effect not unlike a
ghost carrying a candelabra.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR GOTTITALL ESTATE, A HUGE PALATIAL SPREAD.
The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully
laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR
and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite
applause is
COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
As he knocks out an opponent.
ANGLE ON CROWD
Applauding.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique
and puts the guy down and out.
ANGLE ON TEAM
(Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
As he plays with the next fighter.
TREVOR
They said you were good... ha!
He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no
denying that he's a superior fighter.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Can't you get me any quality sparring partners?
The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist,
DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over.
PFEELGUT
It's
not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy
your
opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat
him
once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear
you
forever.
Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to
leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool.
Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.
PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
Exactly!
Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it
to this guy,
alternately playing with him and hurting him. As
the guy tries to
hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose
and they start to
fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and
Trevor starts to
back up, laughing with the rest of the group.
ANGLE ON PFEELGUT
Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor.
PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
GET HIM! NOW!!
Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees
what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and
(in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull
his pants up.
ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY
Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.
People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front
reads "Diamond Nationals".
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND KWAN WALKING ALONG A BRIDGE, THE ENTIRE
NEW YORK NIGHT SKYLINE IN THE B.G.
They are not talking, they are just walking, Drew kicking a can and
contemplating the future, and the past.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW RUNNING ALONG BEIJING'S CHANG AN LU, A SEA
OF BICYCLES AROUND HIM.
Bicycle bells ring loudly as figures dressed in the same drab clothes
ride around him, their faces covered with scarves and surgical masks
against the northern China dirt.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL TIAN AN MEN SQUARE and the huge photo of
CHAIRMAN MAO on the front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City.
Drew continues his run, past a group of western-dressed lyou mang,
who watch him run by through dark glasses.
Drew runs through a large city park, stopping to watch a group of
older citizens going through Tai Zhi routines under the weeping
willow trees there.
Drew runs through an open air food market, picking his way through
flipping fish, dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables.
People yell at each other, trying to get the best price. Young man
brushing his teeth in the street. A group of toddlers, strung
together with rope, walks down the street, their split pants showing
glimpses of bare bottoms as they walk.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED TRAIN, PEOPLE PUSHING AND
SHOVING TO GET ON.
Drew walks up to it, a huge backpack on his back. He hesitates a
moment, then starts forcing his way onto the train like everyone
else. He manages to get in through a window.
TRAIN RUSHING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE.
Drew watches the countryside go by. Temples, farms and rice paddies
slide by, with an occasionally glimpse of the Great Wall.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, BACKPACK ON, AS HE WALKS ON THE GREAT
WALL.
TRAIN RUSHING THROUGH DARKENED COUNTRYSIDE.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE.
He stops at
a drink stand and orders one. As soon as he stops, he is
ringed with
people watching his every move  he feels almost like a
movie star.
The woman in the stand hands him a drink, and takes the
money out of
his hand.
DREW
Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin?
The woman just smiles and shakes her head, not comprehending.
ANGLE ON DREW
Walking aimlessly. He comes to an intersection and sees a sign that
says "Shaolin Temple" with an arrow. He goes in the direction that
the arrow points.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP OF GIRLS STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR SCHOOL.
Drew walks up and says hello.
DREW
Hello, ladies! Can you tell me how to get to the Shaolin
Temple?
They titter with laughter, covering their mouths with their hands.
Drew is not really amused, however, he is frustrated and tired.
DREW (CONT'D)
The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be? Geez, doesn't
anyone speak English here?
ANGLE ON ASHEMA
As she pushes her way to the front of the group. She is a strikingly
beautiful young woman.
ASHEMA
I do. But wouldn't it make more sense for you to speak
Chinese than to expect us to speak English?
DREW
(flustered)
You're right. I apologize  I've just been trying to get
to the temple for a long time now.
ASHEMA
Why do you want to find the temple?
DREW
(not without pride)
I am going to join the temple as a monk.
Ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. They
gesture to Drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts
at martial arts movements.
ASHEMA (CONT'D)
I'm going that way  I can take you.
DREW
You have a car?
ASHEMA
The next best thing.
(beat)
This is a Chinese car.
She pulls out her standard-issue black bicycle  she has customized
it, however, with some colorful additions.
ASHEMA (CONT'D)
Hop on.
Drew does, and they take off, the girls from the school tittering as
they drive off.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ASHEMA PEDALING DREW.
It is not the most stable ride  Ashema is struggling to keep moving,
while Drew is doing his best to stay on the bike.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW PEDALING ASHEMA.
He is riding strongly, and she is comfortable in the back. They are
getting stares from the people they pass, but Ashema seems to be
enjoying the attention. Drew hits a bump, and Ashema holds his waist
a little tighter. Neither of them mind  in fact, Drew starts looking
for more bumps.
He pulls around the corner into a wide area lined with drink and food
stands.
ASHEMA
We are here.
DREW STOPS THE BIKE AND LOOKS BACK AT HER. ASHEMA GESTURES TO THE
TEMPLE FRONT, AND DREW TURNS IN AWE.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE TEMPLE.
This is it  the temple he came halfway around the world to see. The
Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts.
DREW
Whoa!
Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at
his awe-struck face.
ASHEMA
I have to help my grandfather with our stand. If you get
a chance, come by later.
DREW
(distracted)
I'll try, but monks aren't allowed to be around girls.
ASHEMA
Good luck.
DREW
Shaolin monks don't need luck...
(beat)
Hey, thanks a lot for the ride. I hope I see you again.
They wave at each other, and Ashema pushes her bike off.
Drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it
all sink in.
After a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front
door. He pulls it open and disappears inside.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.
All manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men,
posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams,
etc.).
A monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of
a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood.
The post TREMBLES with every strike.
Drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk
takes no notice of him.
DREW
Excuse me, Master.
No answer.
DREW (CONT'D)
Hello? Busy, huh?
Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post,
over and over.
Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes
are on either side of him. He can see the "pagoda forest" in the
distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the
path.
Drew walks up to the monk and bows.
DREW (CONT'D)
Master, may I ask you a question?
No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment.
DREW (CONT'D)
What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple?
Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you?
Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter?
He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed.
He walks back into the chanting chamber.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW LANDING ON THE FLAGSTONES OF THE COURTYARD
WITH A THUMP!
A group of people stop and watch the foreigner. The temple door
closes with a solid boom.
DREW
Hey! What about my...
The temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack.
It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear,
and some socks.
The people standing around laugh.
Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He
sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops
and stands ringing the courtyard.
He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running
them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man
is sitting down sipping his tea.
The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on,
when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall.
ASHEMA
Drew?
DREW
Hi.
Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him.
Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising
from it.
DREW (CONT'D)
Make it a double. Rough day.
ASHEMA
What happened?
DREW
They kicked me out...
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, ASHEMA AND OLD MAN, STILL SITTING AT THE
TABLE, NOW LIT BY CANDLES AND A LANTERN.
A bunch of tea bowls are scattered in front of Drew, as if he's been
drinking heavily. He points to his teacup, and Ashema shakes her
head.
ASHEMA
You've had enough.
Drew's shoulders slump even more.
ASHEMA (CONT'D)
Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New
York.
DREW
I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk.
I'd be even more of a disgrace...
The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in
Chinese, motioning towards Drew.
ASHEMA
Not now, Bau Bau.
DREW
Bau Bau?
ASHEMA
My nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about
the temple.
The grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really
don't want to listen.
ASHEMA (CONT'D)
He is telling a story about a monk who was refused
admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be
allowed to be a monk.
DREW
What did he do?
Ashema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese.
ASHEMA
He decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until
they let him in.
DREW
How long?
ASHEMA
A long time  through the worst weather. He just sat
there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.
DREW
Did they let him in?
ASHEMA
No.
(beat)
Of course they did  what kind of story do you think my
Bau Bau would tell? He stayed in front of the temple
until they could no longer say no. He went on to become
one of the most famous monks in the history of the
temple.
Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up
and smiles.
DREW
Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise
man. And that he tells a good story.
The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head.
ASHEMA
What are you going to do? Are you going home?
Drew shakes his head.
DREW
I'm camping out.
He starts away from the stand.
DREW (CONT'D)
In front of the temple.
He walks off into the Chinese night.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MIST-LADEN COURTYARD.
The sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are
illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged
in front of the door.
It is Drew, backpack at his side.
The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around,
and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he
quickly disappears inside.
Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is
standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there.
ADMISSIONS MONK
Go home! You cannot stay here!
No response from Drew. He just sits there, staring straight ahead.
ADMISSIONS MONK (CONT'D)
Do you hear me? Go away!
Drew doesn't move.
San De, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind
him carrying a suitcase. He walks past Drew, noticing him sitting
there. He walks on.
The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry.
ANGLE ON DREW SWEATING IN THE HOT SUNSHINE
Sweat is running into Drew's eyes, and he is trying to keep them from
stinging.
ANGLE ON DREW BEING TORMENTED BY LOCAL KIDS
They are playing games around him, throwing stones at him, messing
with his hair and his clothes, touching the things in his backpack
(frisbee, football, walkman), etc.
ANGLE ON DRILL SERGEANT
As he comes out of the temple, chasing away the kids.
When they are gone, he turns to Drew.
DRILL SERGEANT
Will you give up? I think so.
ANGLE ON DREW SHIVERING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
His eyes are closed, and it is obvious he is very uncomfortable.
ANGLE ON SPIDER AS IT CRAWLS OUT TO SEE DREW
It lingers for a moment, then goes away.
ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA
She is giving him food, and all he is moving is his mouth. They do
not speak.
ANGLE ON DREW SITTING IN THE RAIN
He is miserable, and he is looking at the relative comfort of the
stands around the temple, where there is food, warmth and light. His
spirit is wavering.
ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA AGAIN
ASHEMA
Give this up, Drew! Please?
No response from Drew. Just a small smile.
ANGLE ON SPIDER, WHO IS BACK
This time it stays even longer. Drew looks down at it and smiles.
ANGLE ON MONKS FROM TEMPLE
Looking out the windows at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard.
ANGLE ON DREW IN COURTYARD
As a school group comes through the temple.
The children are tied together with a rope, and the teacher motions
to the crazy American. Drew has become an attraction!
ANGLE ON DREW, SURROUNDED BY OLD MEN
They are marveling at his perserverance.
ANGLE ON DREW, WIND AND RAIN
This time it doesn't seem to bother him so much.
ANGLE ON DREW WITH ASHEMA AND HER BAU BAU THERE
Bau Bau speaks quickly in Chinese.
ASHEMA (CONT'D)
My Bau Bau says, keep it up! He is proud of you...
Drew nods.
ANGLE ON DREW SURROUNDED BY KIDS
They are no longer tormenting him, they are playing around and with
him. Drew is not moving, but he is part of their group.
ANGLE ON DREW, THE SPIDER NOW SITTING ON HIS HAND
Drew stares at the spider, his companion in the vigil.
ANGLE ON DREW, BIRDS ALL AROUND HIM
The birds are keeping him company, and they are singing for him.
ANGLE ON DREW, THE FULL MOON IN THE B.G.
Drew's form is firm and solid, the determination in his eyes easily
seen as he stares at the moon. He will see this through.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STILL SITTING IN THE COURTYARD.
The
old monk, San De, comes back, the same monk following behind him
with
the suitcase. He looks at Drew, a little surprise showing in his
face
at seeing the American still there. He doesn't stop, though. He
goes
into the temple, shaking his head.
ANGLE ON DREW
Same as the first shot, all alone in the temple.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF COURTYARD, DREW ALL ALONE.
The door to the temple opens and out comes San De, alone this time.
He walks over to where Drew is, stares at him for a moment, then sits
down across from him.
Drew tries not to look at him.
San De runs his hand across his bald pate and smiles.
SAN DE
My head is shiny enough already, don't you think?
Drew, in shock at his ability to speak English, sputters
DREW
You... You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just
goofing... I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun
of you...
San De shrugs it off. Apology accepted.
SAN DE
What are you trying to do?
DREW
I want to become a monk  they won't let me in... Hey,
you're just a grunt, a janitor sweeping up and all, don't
sweat it. It's not your problem...
SAN DE
Why are you sitting here?
DREW
I got the idea from a story about a monk who wouldn't
leave. I thought...
San De nods.
SAN DE
Has it been hard?
DREW
It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually,
but as time went on, I got... into it, I guess. The
sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what I
mean?
SAN DE
(nodding)
Much of the training at the temple is in that direction 
self sacrifice. Tell me more.
DREW
At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,
things changed. Maybe it's like hitting the wall in
running  it was like I became part of the courtyard, and
I felt powerful. Even the spider became my friend...
Drew opens up his hand to reveal a spider sitting in his palm.
DREW (CONT'D)
It was an incredible experience  I said I'd do it, and I
did it.
San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and
bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position.
SAN DE
I wish you all the best.
DREW
Same to you.
San De turns and goes into the temple, leaving Drew still sitting in
the courtyard, the setting sun in the b.g.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF COURTYARD, DREW ALL ALONE.
O.S. comes the sounds of gongs and drums.
A crowd has gathered in the courtyard. Ashema and her grandfather are
in the crowd, and they work themselves up to where Drew is.
Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some
older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.
The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all
in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.
The young men who are walking in all still have hair, and they are
carrying some baggage. They begin to enter the temple.
ASHEMA
They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting
monks at Shaolin.
Drew, very concerned, watches as the monks-to-be file through the
temple doors.
The mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go
through.
The temple doors close.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is crushed. His chance is gone.
ASHEMA (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Drew. It was a good effort.
Drew is sitting there, trying to understand what is happening when
the door to the temple opens again. The Drill Sergeant appears in the
doorway and impatiently motions for Drew to come in.
The crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold.
Drew gets up warily, expecting some trick.
The Drill Sergeant motions again, wanting Drew to hurry up.
Drew looks at Ashema and her Bau Bau and smiles. He picks up his
backpack and starts towards the temple, limping from sitting for so
long.
The crowd goes crazy, clapping and yelling.
Drew runs into the temple. The door closes behind him.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS, THEIR HEADS NEWLY SHAVED, STANDING OUT IN
THE COURTYARD.
They are running their hands over their heads. Drew comes out of the
building, his head shaved completely clean.
DREW
What outside world? I don't want to be seen by anybody...
He rubs his hand over his head, and then sees the others.
Li is smiling.
DREW (CONT'D)
If I look half as stupid as you guys do, I'm really in
trouble...
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ALL THE DISCIPLES LINED UP, READY FOR THE
TRAINING.
In the b.g. are the fighting monks, going through their routines.
ANGLE ON FIGHTING MONKS
As they go through forms or free sparring. There are SHOTS of monks
throwing stars, working with weapons, etc. It is all very exciting.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is more excited than all the others.
ANGLE ON THE D.S.
As he walks to the front of the group. In his hand he is carrying a
shovel.
D.S. Bodhidharma, the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple taught us that
to train the mind, we first have to train the body.
ANGLE ON WU, WHO SHIELDS HIS MOUTH AND WHISPERS
WU
Basics, I told you.
ANGLE ON D.S.
Who motions to one of the monks behind him, who has a wheelbarrow
filled with shovels.
D.S.
Each one of you take a shovel.
DREW
We're using the shovels as weapons?
D.S.
(smiling)
Weapons...
(beat)
... in the war on infection.
D.S. motions with his hand, and in the distance is the latrine
building.
D.S. (CONT'D)
You will be digging today, digging our new latrines.
DREW
Latrines? Why?
D.S.
A Shaolin fighting monk-in training does not ask
questions. He just obeys.
The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples
follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not
believing what they are doing.
DREW (CONT'D)
I came halfway around the world to dig latrines? I could
have just joined the army...
DISSOLVE TO:
LATRINE WORK AREA  MONTAGE
MONTAGE SEQUENCE OF WORK DETAIL.
ANGLE ON DREW AND THE OTHER DISCIPLES
Digging with their shovels. Their training clothes are already
sweated through and dirty. Their shirts are off, and their arm
muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the
pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back
straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it.
As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He
drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as
he can, but there is no one to be seen.
ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES
As they are working hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an
American song as they work.
DREW (CONT'D)
"Ain't no cure for the Shaolin Temple Blues... "
OR
"Working on a Chain Gang"
OR (CONT'D)
"I fought the law and the law won"
OR (CONT'D)
"16 tons"
The monks are singing along with him. All except for Gao.
ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES AS THEY EAT THEIR LUNCH
It is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece
of scrawny meat. Drew looks at it for a moment. The
D.S. is standing over his shoulder.
D.S.
Any problems?
Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up
onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the
D.S. is there in front of him.
He examines the baskets. They are not full.
He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.
DREW
(shocked)
What'd you do that for?
D.S.
Do a job well or don't do it.
ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full,
then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When
Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head.
D.S.
Sorry, all gone. Get some more.
Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up
at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of
water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The
D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to
work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to
himself.
DREW (CONT'D)
I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah...
Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM.
Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders
are straining from the weight of the buckets.
He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over
chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at
the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for
him.
Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a
little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S.
motions for him to put the buckets down.
Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall
over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop
them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the
ground.
DREW
Don't tell me, I know. Get more water...
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING ON A RIDGE BETWEEN TWO LARGE HOLES,
CARRYING HUGE BASKETS OF DIRT ON HIS POLE.
He is balancing as he walks.
ANGLE ON GAO
Who is working at the other end. He starts across the same ridge.
They come to the middle: a stand off.
GAO
Back up and let me pass.
DREW
No chance, Gao. You back up.
Gao smiles and shakes
his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew
in the leg with a leg
sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and
fights a valient, but
losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt
in his buckets flying
everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and
continues walking.
CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND
A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S.
walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.
D.S.
(heartlessly)
Shaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you
will be fine.
He walks away.
ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
On a work break. They are watching the monks training in the
distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable.
In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks.
They are leading him out.
The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the
disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The
two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim.
Li turns to the D.S.
LI
What happened?
D.S.
He failed to pass through the wooden man chamber. He must
leave the temple.
The D.S. walks off.
LI (CONT'D)
The "Wooden Man Chamber"! The ultimate test of a Shaolin
monk...
WU
Did you see his face?
SHU
Poor guy.
GAO
He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if
half of us go out the same way.
The D.S. appears and motions for them to work.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DARK BROWN LIQUID BEING POURED INTO A LARGE PIT.
Drew is walking with Li, having just dumped their buckets into a
large hole.
DREW
So what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway?
LI
Human waste.
DREW
Oh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's
disgusting!
They turn to go back, and there is Gao, balancing a huge basket of
night soil over his head, peasant-style. He is on the same ridge that
they are going to walk on.
DREW (CONT'D)
Hi, Gao. How you doing?
GAO
(a little worried)
Let me pass.
He reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and
then closes on Gao a little bit.
DREW (CONT'D)
There's something on the bottom of your basket.
Drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over Gao's head. Then,
he JAMS the stick in, and holds it there.
DREW (CONT'D)
Oops! I think I found the problem.
(beat)
A hole.
Drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down
onto Gao's head. They back away as Gao goes running towards the pit
where the night soil is deposited.
DREW (CONT'D)
(to Li)
Well, somebody sure smells!
THE DISCIPLES ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD.
As they work, a group of fighting monks walk by after a workout. Drew
stops working and watches them pass.
DREW
This is ridiculous.
Suddenly, a bamboo pole CRACKS Drew on the shoulder. He turns around,
ready for a fight, only to see the D.S. standing there, the pole
raised for another strike.
D.S.
Back to work.
Drew is about to say something, but doesn't. He returns to work.
DORM AREA  NIGHT
ANGLE ON DREW MASSAGING HIS MUSCLES
He is sitting with Li and a couple of the other disciples, Wu, Shu
and Low.
DREW (CONT'D)
I've got an idea on how to get even with our beloved
Drill Sergeant...
They all huddle a little closer.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF D.S. AS HE WALKS ALONG THE PATH.
In the b.g. can be seen Drew, Li, Wu and a couple other of the
disciples. They are waiting for something.
The D.S. hits the trip wire and suddenly two bamboo poles HURTLE
towards him, ready to slam him in the shoulders.
With one beautiful move, the D.S. breaks both poles, shattering when
they hit his arms.
The D.S. hardly breaks stride and continues walking. He looks back
once, and sees the outline of the group of disciples.
ANGLE ON DREW AND THE GUYS
Who are up and running as soon as they are spotted. They run by Gao,
who was watching from another area.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO WAITING OUTSIDE D.S. ROOM.
He looks around, knocks, and then goes in.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ENTIRE CLASS GATHERED TOGETHER.
The D.S. walks into the front of the courtyard and addresses the
group.
Gao is standing off to the side, a smug smile on his face.
D.S.
You are all responsible for anything that happens within
your group. What happened yesterday falls on everyone's
shoulders. So, all of you will do double work...
ANGLE ON GAO
The smug smile gone now.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE ENTIRE GROUP LABORING IN THE FIELDS.
They are all singing "Chain Gang".
TIGHT ON SEVERAL OF THE DISCIPLES
They are good workers, and they don't mind the hard work nor the hot
weather quite so much.
ANGLE ON DREW
Working hard.
ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF WEDGE THWOCKING INTO THE GROUND.
A hand COMES INTO FRAME, grabs the wedge and pulls it back out of the
ground.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Drew, along with the other disciples, lined up
and throwing these sharp wedges into the ground and pulling it back
out. Their muscles are bulging with the effort.
ANGLE ON HUGE SMOKING BRASS URNS
Filled to the brim with small stones. Drew is forcing his arms into
the urn in "Iron Palm" training.
ANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES
He is going through a complex form, kicking and punching, never
missing or faltering a step. Some of the poles are as high as 6 feet
off the ground.
ANGLE ON GAO ON THE POLES
He is less sure, but at least he doesn't fall.
ANGLE ON DREW
Trying the poles. He starts out well, but he soon misses and falls,
almost impaling himself on a pole.
DREW
I can't do this!
D.S.
Here at Shaolin, can't doesn't exist. Only won't.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF.
Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series
of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to
blocked by a special Shaolin technique.
Each time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD.
His block isn't working. A monk comes up to him.
MONK
Block the way I showed you.
DREW
(showing him a block)
This is the way I was taught.
MONK (CONT'D)
Do it this way. You won't get hit.
Drew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time,
however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew.
Drew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily
deflect Drew's kick.
GAO
(menacingly)
My turn.
He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way
he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao.
Gao stands over him, smiling.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING
KICKS, AERIALS, ETC.
A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and
kipping up.
Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of
which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no
trouble.
Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is
very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist.
MONK
Emotions cloud the spirit  eliminate them.
DREW
This isn't martial arts  it's gymnastics!
MONK
This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue.
Drew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the
air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.
The entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete
floor. D.S. stands in the middle.
D.S.
I want to go over some takedowns before we end for the
day. I'll need a partner...
He scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully,
walks to the front and bows to D.S.
D.S.
Watch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from
shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling.
DREW
(looking at ground)
Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.
D.S.
Do they always use mats in America?
The group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now
challenged.
D.S. (CONT'D)
If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao
would assist me...
ANGLE ON GAO
Who is already getting up, ready and willing.
This changes Drew's mind right away.
ANGLE ON DREW AND D.S.
DREW
Let's do it.
D.S.
Attack me straight on...
Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard
concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow.
Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the
ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.
ANGLE ON THE GROUP
Who can barely watch the destruction.
ANGLE ON THE FIGHT
The D.S. does not let up at all, taking
Drew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew
gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood
coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more.
Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of
all of them, the D.S. calls it a day.
D.S.
Any questions? Good, that's all for today.
Before anyone can move, however, Drew raises his hand as high as he
can, obviously in pain.
DREW (CONT'D)
I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.
The group gasps, knowing how much Drew must be hurting, admiring him
for his guts. Even Gao is impressed.
D.S.
I said that's enough.
DREW (CONT'D)
If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I
understand.
D.S.
Attack!
Drew attacks, and the D.S. executes the manuever perfectly, crashing
Drew down almost on his head. Luckily, Drew is able to twist at the
last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. He
moans and groans and lies there.
DREW (CONT'D)
I think I've got it now. Xie Xie!
The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to
Drew, who is still lying on the ground.
LI
Are you trying to kill yourself?
DREW
He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's
all.
He tries to get up, but moans in pain and falls back down.
Li helps him up and takes him to the showers.
ANGLE ON D.S.
Watching them go. There is a slight smile on his face.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LI RUBBING THE BRUISE ON DREW'S SHOULDER WITH
TIGER BALM.
It is huge, and looks really painful.
LI
If you go to San De, he can send you to a doctor...
Drew pulls away and stands up. He backs up to the wall of the
dormitory, right underneath a window.
DREW
I appreciate your concern, Li, but it's not that serious.
I'm all right.
Just as he is talking, Gao comes to the window with a pan of dirty
water (from washing the floor of the dorm).
GAO LOOKS DOWN (GAO POV) AND SEES DREW
Hhe smiles, then pours the huge bucket over the edge, dousing Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW
As the dirty water hits him, drenching him.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WATERFALL.
It is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above.
ANGLE ON A MONK, INSIDE THE WATERFALL
He is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders
onto him.
ANGLE ON D.S. AND GROUP
As they stand on the bank.
D.S.
Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try
to hold your stance. Li, you're first.
Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes
behind the thundering water.
He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance.
He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.
ANGLE ON D.S.
Who motions him farther into the water.
ANGLE ON LI
Who nods his head and walks into the thundering water. As soon as he
gets into the main stream of water, he is forced off the ledge and he
falls about 20 feet into the pool below.
D.S.
Next...
Each of them try it in turn. Everyone fails.
Gao goes in, and he manages to stand under the impact of the water
for a moment, before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool.
ANGLE ON DREW
It's his turn. He walks to the waterfall and goes in. He picks up an
umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall (imprinted with a "NEW YORK
GIANTS NFL" logo on it  unmistakably American).
He walks into the waterfall, and the umbrella works for a moment.
Drew is holding it with both hands, and he gets into a deep horse
stance.
He turns to smile at the D.S., and then waves at the others. As soon
as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams
him and off he goes into the pool.
He lands with a huge splash, doing a painful bellow flop. Drew comes
to the surface, still clutching the now- destroyed umbrella. He
smiles at the other disciples, who are still swimming, sheepishly.
DREW
Thought I'd join you guys.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI
PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE.
Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying
watching him.
To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.
DREW
This sure beats sweeping...
ANGLE ON FRISBEE
Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely
missing them.
Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder
than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it
dead center, right in the face.
The statue starts to tip!
Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips
over and smashes on the ground.
They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't
fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S.
coming towards them.
Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.
He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S.
rounds the corner.
The D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent.
D.S.
Sweep the main chamber, Drew.
DREW (CONT'D)
Yes, master.
He bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training
chamber.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, THE SUN SETTING IN THE
DISTANCE.
Drew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in
which he is made to look extremely fierce.
San De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment.
SAN DE
He was an amazing monk...
DREW
Yeah, what's up with him?
SAN DE
Come with me...
San De walks away, and Drew follows him.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS TEACHING A SOFT STYLE OF
SHAOLIN WU SHU.
His body moves with the wind, bending and swaying. Another monk is
attacking him with a hard style, and the soft style is very
effective.
Drew and Li try it, and Drew is having a lot of trouble. He is used
to training hard style, and the soft style seems too weak for him.
D.S. comes over.
DREW
It's not fighting  I feel like I'm dancing or
something... This soft stuff is unnatural  Fighting
should be hard, tough...
The D.S. holds out his hand, in a tight fist.
D.S.
If my hand was always like this, what would you call it?
DREW
(after a beat)
Deformed.
He opens his hand, letting it go limp.
D.S.
And if it was always like this?
DREW (CONT'D)
Again, deformed.
The D.S. nods and walks off, leaving Drew to stare questioningly at
Li.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, WHERE ALL THE DISCIPLES ARE
COLLECTED.
They are not dressed in their monastic robes, however. They are in
street clothes.
It is their day off!
A monk comes down the line, handing out hats to the disciples. They
put them on, and wait for instructions from the D.S.
D.S.
Remember, let no one know you are disciples at the
Shaolin Temple, but do not forget that you are. Dzai
Jyan.
They file out.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE DISCIPLES EXITING THE TEMPLE.
As soon as they are out, the serious faces break into smiles, and
they are teenagers again. Some of the disciples run off to join
relatives waiting for them in the courtyard, while a group of them
stick together.
Drew is walking with Li, Wu and several others.
ANGLE ON THE GROUP
As they walk through the small town outside of the temple.
They pass by Ashema's stand, but only the Bau Bau is there.
Drew bows to the Bau Bau, then slips off his hat, rubbing his bald
head for Bau Bau to see. Bau Bau laughs, and the rest of the guys
rush up to Drew, forcing his hat back on his head.
LI
Drew! We're not supposed to...
DREW
Chill out, guys! It's our day off!
He bows to Bau Bau and then they walk off.
They walk through the small town, checking it out.
They walk through the countryside, enjoying their freedom.
Drew has brought a frisbee with him, and they are tossing it around.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP AS THEY WALK IN THE HILLS HOUSING THE
FAMOUS LUO YANG CAVES.
The hills are filled with Buddhist carvings.
ANGLE ON CARVINGS  INTERCUT
ANGLE ON DREW
As he walks by the carvings. The detail and the artistry are amazing.
ANGLE ON DREW AND GROUP
As they walk by a riverside park. The park is filled with people, and
a group of kids swinging into the river on a rope. Drew stops to
watch them, then looks back at the others.
They all shake their heads.
Drew nods his.
They continue to shake their heads.
Drew starts running towards the kids, stripping off his shirt at the
same time. The others pause for a moment, then follow his lead.
ANGLE ON GROUP
As they swing into the river, trying to keep their hats on as they
splash into the water. they are having the time of their life.
ANGLE ON GROUP
Resting on the bank of the river. Drew and the guys spot a group of
girls down the bank from them.
DREW
Check it out, guys!
WU
Girls!
DREW
Good work, Wu. What tipped you off?
LI
(alarmed)
We are not allowed to have contact with females. It is
the most serious rule of the temple.
DREW
It's a stupid rule, Li. But...
He is about to turn away, then spots Ashema as she runs down a path
to the group of girls. He stands up immediately and starts over to
her. He is jogging, at the same time trying to straighten his clothes
and his hat.
Li starts running after Drew. The others follow.
DREW (CONT'D)
ASHEMA!
ANGLE ON ASHEMA
Who hears her name. She looks around, sees Drew but doesn't
immediately recognize him. She looks around the park.
DREW (CONT'D)
ASHEMA! Here!
She looks at Drew again, and this time recognizes him. Drew arrives
and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her.
Li arrives and pulls them apart.
DREW (CONT'D)
What!?!
LI
You can get kicked out of the temple for this...
DREW
Who's going to tell, Li? You?
He turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is
looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is
embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling.
DREW
(pointing at girls)
Not the giggle girls again! How've you been? You look
great!
ASHEMA
(hiding a laugh)
You look... funny.
DREW (CONT'D)
Thanks.
ASHEMA
How do you like the temple?
DREW
Shhh... nobody's supposed to know.
Li tugs at Drew's shirt.
LI
We really shouldn't be doing this...
DREW
I'm trying to show you guys a good time.
(to Ashema)
I guess I gotta go. It was great to see you.
One of the giggle girls behind Ashema whispers something in her ear.
She nods and smiles.
ASHEMA
My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you
and your friends come?
Li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies, but
Drew smiles and takes Ashema's hand. The girls start to giggle again.
He brings her hand up to his lips, and kisses it gently.
DREW
We'll be there.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TWO BODIES FIGHTING, KICKING AND PUNCHING.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew and Gao going at it. The other
disciples are paired off as well, but the only real action is here in
this ring.
Drew is getting tagged, hard, while the points he scores are all
relatively controlled. After one particularly powerful shot, Drew
stops.
DREW
I thought this was light contact!
GAO
Fight, you coward!
Drew stares at Gao, then looks around for the D.S. He is over at the
other side of the training area.
DREW
You got it.
Before he can move, however, Gao attacks, slamming him full power in
the face. Drew almost falls to the ground, then attacks him and the
battle is joined.
The fighting is fast and furious, and soon the others see what is
happening, and gather around. One of the monks comes over and tries
to break it up, but they continue fighting, wrestling, kicking and
punching.
The D.S. finally gets over to them, and without moving a muscle,
barks 
D.S.
Stop!
Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring
daggers at each other.
D.S.
(to others)
Back to work.
He turns and walks off, motioning for Drew and Gao to follow him.
Drew follows immediately, with Gao behind him. Gao shoves him once.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF EMPTY COURTYARD BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.
Suddenly, a figure lands on the ground with a PUFF of dust.
In a crouch, Drew scans the area, then motions for the others to jump
down.
Immediately, other figures land with PUFFs of dust all around him. As
soon as they have all landed, they move off.
ANGLE ON GROUP
As they
sneak
through the courtyards and training areas of the
temple.
They
are about halfway across from the front door of the
temple
when a
monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and
bobbing
 he
looks drunk.
Drew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple?
They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk
makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a
tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and
Gao are standing, but he walks on.
GAO
(whisper)
Drunken Kung Fu...
Drew nods and leads them out of the temple.

TOWN. EUPHORIA STRIKES, AND THEY ARE HAVING FUN (AD LIBS HERE) JUST
BEING FREE AND A.W.O.L.

It is the same school where Drew first met Ashema. The guys, still
happy, arrive at the school, and the realization of what they are
about to do sinks in.
They stop talking and are staring at the building. Drew starts toward
the door, and nobody follows his lead. He stops and motions for them
to join him. Nobody moves.
DREW
Are we men or are we sheep?
A beat, then the entire group bellows:
GROUP
SHEEP!
And they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making
noises like sheep.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES SPRINTING THROUGH THE DARKNESS.

Drew and the others spot the cops, and walk quickly to their dorm
room.
DREW WALKS BACK TO THE DORM ROOM, SLOWLY.
ANGLE ON DREW
Walking through the courtyard, for the last time. Only a few monks
are around, and they don't meet Drew's eyes.
The sounds of training can be heard O.S. Drew stops to listen to
those sounds for a moment, then heads for the door.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he leaves the temple. He pauses for a moment with the door open,
then shuts it sadly. He looks out over the courtyard, which is
completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his backpack onto his back
and starts out.
As he comes out of the doorway and into the courtyard proper, he
sees...
THE ENTIRE CLASS OF DISCIPLES
Dressed in street clothes with their bags packed. Li and Gao are in
the front, their bags in their hands, smiling.
GAO
You're either with us or against us, remember?
DREW
(smiling)
I'm with you!
A cheer goes up from the entire group as Drew, Li and Gao embrace. In
the b.g. can be seen the D.S., who is observing all this.
DREW COMES OUT, FINDING GAO AND LI WAITING FOR HIM.
GAO
Are you staying?
Drew waits for a moment, studying their hopeful faces.
DREW
Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of
trouble!
They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as
one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell.
Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound.
LI
Drew! Are you allright?
DREW
Yeah, I'm just a little on edge, that's all. Ever since I
got to the temple, some nut has been attacking me with a
stick  at night, in the toilet... anywhere! It's driving
me crazy...
Gao and Li look at each other, nodding.
DREW (CONT'D)
What? Honest, it's happening! I...
GAO
Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential
is singled out for special training. We were wondering
who it was... now, we know.
DREW
Special training? You mean...?
Gao and Li nod, and Drew walks with them, shaking his head.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ASHEMA STANDING NEXT TO THE STREAM, WATCHING THE
WATER RUSH BY.
In the b.g. comes Drew, dressed in his monastic robes, no hat on his
head. He is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk.
Drew walks up to Ashema and takes her hand, and they stand like that
for a moment. She then turns to him, and starts to say something.
Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.
DREW
Ashema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I
will... miss you and remember you... always.
Ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head
against Drew's shoulder.
ASHEMA
Are they making you do this?
She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to
hear it.
Drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. It
would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.
DREW
No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry...
He embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. He
holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last
long look at Ashema, walks away.

The D.S. in the b.g. comes up and corrects his technique, and Drew

and punching. He
tries an especially difficult sequence of moves, and
falls with a

He tries the same set of moves, falls again. Instead
of being angry,
Drew just laughs at himself, then climbs back up on

third time, and Drew raises both buckets over his head to block it 
and drenches himself with the water. Then, the staff hits him in the
stomach.
His attacker has vanished, leaving Drew alternately moaning from the
pain, and chuckling at himself in the bamboo.
ANGLE ON DREW AND LI
As they go through a very intricate, beautifully staged series of
techniques. The last technique is a very powerful kick, and one which
Drew is to block using the blocking technique he refused to learn

technique, sending Li pitching to the ground is a cloud of dust.
Drew turns around and high-fives Gao.

laughter.
TIGHT SHOT OF D.S.' ARM
Gao's hands are around his elbow, pulling down.
D.S.
Using your muscles, bend my arm.
Gao pulls down, while the D.S. tries to fight back with his muscles,
but finally, after great strain, his arm bends. A cheer goes up from
the group.
D.S. smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his
place. the old man puts his arm up on Gao's shoulder, and takes a
deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.
Gao looks questioning at the D.S.
GAO
What if I hurt him?
D.S.
You will not.
Gao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the
old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting
all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his
expression of relaxation and piece has not changed.
Gao quits, not able to bend the arm. D.S. motions for Drew to get on
the other side of the monk.
D.S.
Grab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance.
Drew and Gao shrug at each other and take an arm. They pull and push,
straining and groaning, but there is no movement from the old monk.
It is like he is a heavy stone.
They give up, and the D.S. bows to the old monk.
D.S. (CONT'D)
Master Shu's spirit is indeed strong.

Drew doesn't jump, but just calmly avoids it. The staff WHOOSHES over
his head. Drew stands up, and the staff comes again, from a different
direction. Drew avoids, and the staff finds empty air again.
Drew goes on with cleaning the plates, a slight smile on his face.
After a BEAT, he looks around, trying to find the attacker. When he
is sure no one is around, he smiles bigger.

As soon as he finishes saying that, the staff comes out and SLAMS him

He is getting the hang of it.
The D.S. walks up with another monk with
a spear. Together, they
position a wooden target. The monk bows
to D.S. and to the rest of
the disciples, then positions the point
of the spear in the hollow of
his neck. He then hands the shaft of the
spear to the D.S.
The D.S. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear,
slowly but surely.
ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
Amazed.
ANGLE ON THE MONK
The spear is now almost bent double.
With a flick of his head, the spear goes flying into the target
positioned behind him, its point finding the bulls-eye.
Drew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point
is imbedded deep into the wood of the target.
DREW
(bowing)
Boy, his spirit is strong...
TIGHT SHOT OF AMERICAN FOOTBALL SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR.
Set against a deep blue sky, it could be spinning anywhere  but the
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Shaolin Temple "forest of stupa",
where the disciples are having a pick up football game  it's Sunday,
the disciples' afternoon off. The football spins into the hands of
Gao, who drops it.
Drew runs over, showing Gao how to catch the ball, and how to make
the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over).
Gao follows Drew's instructions, then they run the play. This time
Gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown.
Drew runs up and high-fives Gao, then teaches him how to spike the
ball.
They are playing some more, having a great time. This time Drew goes
out for a pass, with Gao playing defense. Li throws the pass, and Gao
intercepts. Drew, laughing, goes after Gao.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who goes long for a pass, which Gao lets fly.
It is immediately obvious that it is way too long.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who is walking along through the stupa, meditating as he walks.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who stops running and sees san de. the ball is going towards San De.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
The ball is heading right for his HEAD!
ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND OTHERS
They are bracing for the impact, and the trouble it will cause.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional
receiver. He holds the ball and looks right at Drew, a very stern
look on his face.
ANGLE ON DREW
Expecting the worst.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
His stern face now taking on a mischevious look. He hefts the ball
and puts his fingers on the laces.
SAN DE
Go long.
Drew pauses for a moment, not sure
what San De said, until San De
motions with his left hand, like a
NFL quarterback, for Drew to go
out. He takes off sprinting, with
Gao covering him like a blanket.
San De throws the ball to him in a
perfect spiral, to a spot where
Gao has no play on the throw, and
Drew catches it in stride.
San De immediately returns to his meditation, while Drew and the
others stand around dumbstruck.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO, LI AND DREW RUNNING THROUGH THE
COUNTRYSIDE.
They come to a stream, and there by a stream is a beautiful young
woman who can't get across the stream without getting her clothes
soaked.
Without thinking twice, Drew allows her to get on his back and
carries her across the river. He deposits her on the other side and
then continues running.
Gao and Li run up next to Drew, and together they go back to the
temple. When they stop outside the temple, they are breathing
heavily. finally catching his breath, Gao turns to Drew.
GAO
I can't believe you carried that girl over the stream!
After all the trouble you got into...
LI
Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that
kind of thing...
Drew smiles slightly.
DREW
I left that girl at the stream. Are you two still
carrying her?
He turns and walks away, leaving Li and Gao to puzzle that one out.
As he walks away, San De comes out from behind a pillar where he had
been sweeping, smiling and nodding his head at Drew's answer.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING GROUND, WHERE SEVERAL GROUPS OF
DISCIPLES ARE GOING AT IT.
The action is fast and furious.
ANGLE ON DREW AND GAO
Who are squared
off and fighting. They are intense, and the
techniques they
are throwing are full power. Drew hits Gao, and he
bends over. Drew
closes, thinking that he has Gao at his mercy. At
the last minute,
Gao stands up and cold cocks Drew, who sags to the
ground.
TIGHT ON DREW
Who is trying to get his bearings.
DREW
Lucky shot, slant eye!
ANGLE ON GAO
Who gives him a mean look.
GAO
You stink, American!
ANGLE ON DREW
Who stands up, mad.
DREW
That's it! You're dead meat!
He comes at Gao, and they start fighting again, throwing all kinds of
acrobatic kicks and techniques.
A gong sounds, O.S., and Gao and Drew stop, bow to each other, and
then embrace, smiling.
DREW (CONT'D)
Saved by the bell...
GAO
I had you...
Drew moves off to the side to get a drink of water, and to towel off.
As he rubs his neck, D.S. comes up to him.
D.S.
San De wants to see you, in his chambers.
Drew raises his eyebrows, then looks over at Gao and Li. He rolls up
his towel and snaps Gao with it as he walks by.
DREW
I wonder what you did now...
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING OUT OF THE TEMPLE INTO THE MIST-
SHROUDED COURTYARD.
He is off on his quest.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON DREW
Walking strong. the sun is high in the sky, and the scenery behind is
incredibly beautiful (Guilin?).
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STOPPING IN A SMALL TOWN, IN THE MIDDLE OF
AN OPEN AIR MARKET.
He goes over to a drink stand, and buys a cool drink. Just as he is
about to drink it down, it is KNOCKED from his hand.
Drew turns around and see four dirty thugs and their leader  the one
who hit the glass. They are yelling at Drew in Chinese, which he
doesn't understand.
DREW
OK, boys, just let me get my glass and...
Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and
the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the
ground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on
him.
A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles
this situation.
The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch,
hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew
tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and
drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick
dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.
They soon tire of the sport and move on, the crowd staring at Drew in
pity.
DREW (CONT'D)
(to himself)
This humble, not fighting stuff is harder, and more
painful, than it looks!
ANGLE ON THE THUGS
Who have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded
down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take
the things from them, and start to walk off.
The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending
him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the
thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face.
Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his
wrist, stopping it.
DREW (CONT'D)
Oh, I don't think so...
ANGLE ON THE CROWD
It's getting good now.
The fight
starts, and this
time Drew is unencumbered by
vows of non-
violence.
He has a cause,
and he's enjoying every minute
of the
fight. It
is over quickly,
as Drew is a superb fighter,
using
incredible
techniques. The
thugs limp away, leaving Drew
with the
little boy
and his father.
Drew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy
and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy,
looking deep into his eyes.
A whisper is going through the crowd: "Shaolin".
Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He
moves on, the crowd watching him walk away.
HOLD ON BOY'S FACE
He now has a hero.
ANGLE ON DREW WALKING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE. HE STOPS AT A CROSSING
IN THE ROAD, CONSULTS THE MAP SAN DE GAVE HIM, THEN WALKS ON.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he climbs the side of a mountain.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, MEDITATING NEXT TO HIS SMALL FIRE.
It is dark around him, with vague forms of the temple columns and
statues. Drew is sitting with his eyes closed, oblivious to his
surroundings.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WORKING OUT NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN LAKE.
He is throwing kicks and going through his routines, concentrating on
his breathing. As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he
strips off his clothes and dives into the lake.
As Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see
a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes.
Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked 
he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore
as he can without coming out of the water.
The woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has
on. She is very sexy.
DREW
No, don't do that!
WOMAN
Why not?
DREW
I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain...
WOMAN
No one will know...
DREW
I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please.
Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but
they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge.
DREW (CONT'D)
Nice throw...
ANGLE ON DREW
Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a
cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to
put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him.
He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye.
DREW (CONT'D)
Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream
come true, I can't!
He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting.
DREW (CONT'D)
Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with
you.
He kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his
clothes, running up the path away from the lake.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE.
Drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment,
then takes a drink of water from the well out front.
Just as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air
brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of
AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple,
jostling Drew from side to side.
TOURIST 1
Not another temple!
TOURIST 2
Do they have a gift shop?
TOURIST 3
Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'?
GUIDE
You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.
The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after
them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk,
and turn back to Drew.
TOURIST 1
A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture!
The tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The
cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the
first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him,
he raises his hands up to his face and bows.
DREW
Oh Mi Two Fwo
He then turns and walks away.
GUIDE (O.S.)
Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a
different world.
DREW
I'll say...
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL.
Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his
expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get
where he is going.
Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then
starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall
is incedible  steep and deadly.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he enters the waterfall. The water hits his back, almost pitching
him into the abyss. Drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but
surely.
He emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp.
Jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps.
Drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can
jump from place to place and make it across.
DREW
Just like at the temple...
He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the
others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance.
He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.
He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head
of an alligator! Its mouth opens to bite him!
Drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. When he lands on the
stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else.
He continues across, more careful this time.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW CLIMBING UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.
It is much steeper now, and the going is much tougher.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge, the way to the
arhat. Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope
bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces
himself to look straight ahead.
He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns
around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
DREW
Is this rope strong enough for both of us?
No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is
inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go
quicker.
DREW (CONT'D)
OK, OK, I'm going!
ANGLE ON THE ROPE BEHIND THEM
Which is starting to fray from the weight.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who sees that and is hurrying.
The rope is fraying more, and when Drew is almost there, the rope
snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll POPS out of
his pocket and goes up in the air.
Drew, groggy from the impact, manages to lash out and PIN the scroll
to the cliff wall with the BACK of his hand.
ANGLE ON MAN
Who is barely hanging on, just below Drew.
He has his hand out to Drew for help.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who doesn't know what to do. If he tries to save the scroll, the man
might fall. If he goes for the man, the box will certainly fall.
ANGLE ON THE MAN
Screaming for help.
DREW (CONT'D)
Hold on...
Drew hears the headmaster's voice.
SAN DE (O.S.)
The scroll that is in this box is more precious than
life. Guard it well.
He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.
DREW
What the heck...
Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall.
Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up.
ANGLE ON BOX
As it spins down into the abyss.
ANGLE ON DREW AND MAN
As Drew pulls him up onto his back, and carries him up the rope to
the other side of the gorge.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING UP THE PATH TO THE ARHAT'S CAVE.
There is no bounce to his step, and he is dreading this audience.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ARHAT HUT.
Drew walks up to the entrance, looks around. He doesn't see anyone.
He walks into the hut.
DREW COMES OUT OF THE HUT AND WALKS AROUND TO THE AREA BEHIND THE
HUT, HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.
The view is incredible. Drew stands looking at the view, and slowly
becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him.
He looks down, and it is the ARHAT!
DREW
Master! I apologize, I did not see you.
The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll.
Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.
DREW (CONT'D)
I failed, Master. A person was in danger...
The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.
DREW (CONT'D)
Of course, you're right. No excuses...
Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his
robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the
temple.
DREW (CONT'D)
You have it? How?
The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears
it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.
DREW (CONT'D)
So, I didn't fail, huh?
(beat)
I can ask my question, then?
The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes.
DREW (CONT'D)
What is the meaning of life?
The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles
on his head and stands up.
ARHAT
What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.
He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.
DREW
(smiling ruefully)
I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning
of life.
He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is
standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.
ARHAT
For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest
to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese.
DREW
No. American.
ARHAT
I notice the littlest details.
DREW
How many succeeded?
ARHAT
A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious
than human life.
DREW
But, I didn't obey.
ARHAT
(smiling slightly)
At the beginning of your training, you were to obey
without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must
learn to question everything, and obey yourself.
Drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in
the b.g.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW COMING OUT OF THE HUT, HAVING JUST GOTTEN
UP.
The Arhat is already out there, moving through his gong fu moves.
DREW
I have to leave. What is the easiest way to get back to
the temple.
ARHAT
The bus.
Drew laughs at the crazy reply and starts for the mountain path that
brought him to the hut. The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve
and pulls him over to a place behind his hut.
DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT
A road! After all he went through to get there?
ARHAT (CONT'D)
Bus stops every 20 min., will take you straight to the
temple.
Drew smiles and shakes his head, then bows to the Arhat.
The Arhat returns the bow.
DREW
Thank you, Master.
ARHAT
They should give you a bus schedule with that map...
He walks off to the hut, while Drew makes his way down to the bus
stop.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING BACK INTO THE TEMPLE.
He is dirty, weary but triumphant. As he walks back through the
temple to San De's chambers to report, he sees a group of people
walking out the other way.
The group is made up of the thugs who attacked him, the woman by the
lake, and the man from the bridge. They are talking together on their
way out.
ANGLE ON DREW
Smiling as he realizes that it was all a test  every moment of it.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND THE DISCIPLES TRAINING.
They are expert fighters now, and they move through the complicated
routines with ease.

They move from pole to pole, throwing kicks and punches at each
other.

SWELTERING SUMMER SUN IN FRONT OF A RUN DOWN FARM BUILDING.
The D.S. is standing in front of them.
DREW
We've got to rebuild this?
D.S.
No.
(beat)
Tear it down.
Smiles grow on the faces of the disciples. They rush into the
building.
FOLLOWING MONTAGE SECTION
Different shots of the monks tearing the building apart with kicks
and punches. Shots of Drew, Gao and Li kicking through walls, through
doors, through windows, etc. Some the three of them destroy together,
others are seperate. Several shots of disciples as they concentrate
on particularly difficult things, using their chi, smashing the
bricks and wood apart. They are destroying the building, and they are
having a GREAT TIME!

disciples hang off his arm.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING THROUGH THE COURTYARDS OF THE

He is going nowhere in particular, just walking and thinking.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, comes the staff and the ATTACK.
Drew calmly avoids the first few strikes, blocks a couple more, then
grabs the staff and PULLS.
Out comes the D.S. into the night on the other end of the staff. He
looks proudly at Drew.
ANGLE ON D.S.
As he smiles and bows in respect to Drew.
Drew returns his bow.

WHITE PAPER.
The CAMERA follows the sweeping brush, as it ends with a FLOURISH.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the temple courtyard, where San De
and the D.S. are standing in front of the group of disciples.
SAN DE
Only one trial remains before you become full fledged
fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
They are remembering the stories they have heard about the chamber.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
I warn you all, any monk who fails must leave the temple
forever, and will NEVER be called Shaolin.
San De pauses, letting this remark sink in.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
Disciple Drew Carson, as you will return to America, and
never intended to live as a monk in the temple, you need
not enter the chamber.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who rises to the challenge.
DREW
Master San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?
San De nods.
DREW (CONT'D)
Then I must pass this final test. Furthermore, I request
that I be the first one through.
SAN DE
(very proud)
Your request is granted.
ANGLE ON DREW
In front of the entrance to the Wooden Man Chamber. San De and D.S.
are flanking Drew as he pauses in front of the door. Drew turns to
look at San De, and the D.S. smacks Drew in the back of the head.
DREW (CONT'D)
What did you do that for?
D.S.
My last chance  when you come out the other side, we
will be equals.
Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look
at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes
through.

There are a few missing from their ranks, monks who did not make it
through the chamber, but the majority of them are there. The entire
temple is gathered to watch the ceremony.
San De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes.
After he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements,
including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his
hands
SAN DE
You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as

A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all
around.

Who digests this. He smiles a little.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
I would like to ask a favor.

Before you leave for American, can you help at an
international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple
has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over
the world  I'd like you to be there.
DREW
No problem.
(he smiles)
Without pause.
SAN DE
Now, a friend would like to see you.
(beat)
... alone.
From out of the bamboo grove comes Ashema, her hands in front of her
and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.
Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They
are alone.
Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look
at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little
fear.
Drew kisses that fear away.

Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,
and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then

of his life shining in the b.g.
