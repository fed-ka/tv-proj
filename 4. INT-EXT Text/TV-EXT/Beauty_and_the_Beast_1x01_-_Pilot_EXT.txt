      ...locking up.  She walks towards a DUMPSTER, when suddenly -- 
      RUSTLING.  She jumps, startled.  Just a POSSUM.  Still, she 
      hurls the TRASH into the dumpster, hurries to her lone car...


      VANESSA CHANDLER, 40s, in SCRUBS, pulls out JUMPER CABLES from her 
      CAR --

                                    VANESSA
                    I m like Triple A, but with outerwear.  
                    Here, it s cold out.  

      -- and hands a SWEATER to Catherine, who guiltily takes it.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I m so sorry I dragged you out here.  
                    Good news is, I made a lot in tips? 

                                    VANESSA
                    Enough to cover tuition?

                                  CATHERINE
                    Books.  At least for one class?

                                    VANESSA 
                          (chuckles, bemused)
                    Already a lawyer, like Dad.  You re just 
                    lucky I was on call.  He would ve killed 
                    you.

      Just then, HEADLIGHTS FLOOD the parking lot.  They turn to 
      see a beat-up CAR pulling in - who else is out at this hour?  
                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  3.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Uch, we re closed.

      But Vanessa s wary.  The Driver s door OPENS --

                                    VANESSA
                    We re good here.

      -- through the HIGH BEAMS, they see a MAN get out --

                                    VANESSA
                    I said we got it.

      No response.  Catherine uneasily turns to her Mom --

                                    VANESSA
                    Get in my car.

      -- she hesitates but Vanessa shoots her an urgent look.  
      Later she ll wonder, maybe her mom knew something, but for 
      now, Catherine does as she s told, starts towards the car --  

                                    VANESSA
                    Look, we already called Highway Patrol so-- 

      -- He pulls out a GUN, SHOOTS HER.  WHIP PAN to Catherine, 
      who stops, stunned, terrified... barely audible:

                                  CATHERINE
                      ...Mom...?  
                          (then, frantic)
                    Mom!

      Just as ANOTHER MAN emerges from the passenger side.  A 
      horrifying beat as she realizes he s headed for her.  She 
      TEARS off, DARTING across the parking lot, into&


      ...BRANCHES whip at Catherine from every direction as she runs, 
      tears streaming down her face, gasping for air.  FOOTSTEPS GAIN on 
      her as she whimpers in terror.  She glances back at her ATTACKER -- 
      TRIPS over a ROOT, falls HARD, hitting her head SMACK on a ROCK -- 

      Catherine s POV: everything s OUT OF FOCUS.  She turns to see 
      a FUZZY IMAGE of her Attacker, raising his gun...

                                  CATHERINE
                      ...please, no...

      She closes her eyes, bracing herself when -- a deep, guttural 
      GROWL -- then a DARK BLUR SPRINGS out of the woods with INHUMAN 
      SPEED -- POUNCES on the Man, sending his gun flying --

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  4.

      CONTINUED:

      Catherine s barely able to make out what s happening but the 
      sounds are clear: RIPPING FLESH, SCREAMS of AGONY.  Just as the 
      other Attacker arrives --

                                  ATTACKER #2
                    What the -- ?

      He raises his gun, but before he can shoot -- the BLUR 
      POUNCES again.  Catherine s too terrified to move as, more 
      SOUNDS of a MAULING then SILENCE... STILLNESS... 

      She can just make out a FIGURE, broad-shouldered, muscular, 
      CANINE S glistening, eyes GLOWING, a Man-Creature, the BEAST.  

      They lock eyes, is she next?  And maybe it s her head injury or 
      the way he looks at her but she knows he won't hurt her.  Before 
      she can utter a word, distant SIRENS sound.  The Beast takes a 
      beat, almost not wanting to leave.  Then takes off, disappearing 
      into the woods.  Off Catherine changed forever we HEAR: 

                                  CATHERINE (V.O.)
                    Everyone told me it was a wolf.  That 
                    this thing I thought I d seen was the 
                    result of my concussion, or PTSD...

      PAN UP to the TREETOPS, out over Westchester, Queens, Bridges 
      and Tunnels, to the Manhattan Skyline as... 

                                  CATHERINE (V.O.)
                    ...You know, the men who'd killed my 
                    mother were beasts, so I'd created him 
                    in my mind as a way to deal.  
                          (then)
                      I believed them, until now. 

      We DESCEND into the CITY, as we CHYRON UP:  Present Day.  


      You know the saying, what doesn t kill you, makes you stronger?  
      Well, that s Catherine, now 28, her pluck and sense of humor 
      having gotten her through. 

      We find her running, this time not for her life but for an 
      Adele Concert.  She weaves through the CROWD, pulling her 
      hair out of a ponytail, primping when she sees --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Zeke!

      -- ZEKE, 30, handsome Music Exec, waiting under a MARQUEE, 
      turns, surprised to see her.  She kisses him, not noticing.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  5.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Sorry, you know how my boss hates his 
                    wife, which means he never wants to 
                    leave, which means I don t get to --

                                  ZEKE
                    -- You didn t get my text.

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, what?

      Zeke takes a beat, almost annoyed, then:

                                  ZEKE
                    Okay, look, I m just not into this. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    What, Adele, or that I m five minutes late?  
                    Because I was stuck wrapping up a case --

                                  ZEKE
                    No, Adele s awesome.  It s just, at first 
                    your job was kind of a turn on.  Now it s 
                    kind of a drag.  Like tonight, if I wanna 
                    smoke some pot --

                    You can smoke pot, I don t care --

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey, Z-babe!

      Catherine follows Zeke s gaze to a hot, decked-out WOMAN, 
      20s, all smiles, approaching.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Z-babe?

                    Sorry, Cat, this...
                          (gesturing between them)
                    ...has just been stressing me out.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Really?  That s what you texted me? 

                                  ZEKE
                          (shrugs, then)
                    We gotta bust.

      With that, he heads off to his new date.  A beat, then: 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  6.

      Media Vans, Squad Cars.  Catherine s partner and friend TESS 
      O MALLEY, 28, with all the brass and sass that comes from being in 
      a family of cops, reacts, disgusted as she and Catherine stride 
      towards a taped-off crime scene -- 

                                  TESS
                    -- You should ve tazed him.  And what, was 
                    he just in it for the handcuffs?  I hate 
                    it when guys do that.  Don t they know 
                    they just remind us of work?

                                  CATHERINE
                    Tess, he never asked for cuffs --

      They get to an ND COP, flash their BADGES, and we realize 
      Catherine isn t a lawyer, but rather --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Homicide.
                          (as they duck under the tape)
                    Look, good thing about this job is, 
                    there s always someone who s had a worse 
                    night than you.


      Catherine and Tess pull up in front of an abandoned 
      industrial building.  If the CHAINLINK FENCE isn t enough to 
      keep you away, SIGNS warning  BIO-HAZARD  should do it.

                                  CATHERINE
                    According to IRS, Koslow s former 
                    roommate JT Forbes works for Straker 
                      Pharmaceutical.  And we know he was a 
                    medical researcher, so maybe chemical 
                    plants are his thing? 

      They get out, head towards the dilapidated building as...

                                  TESS
                    Or it s a meth lab. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    My sister would say he s just my type.

                    A little Zeke rebound.  Perfect, you 
                    can make out in that.

      Tess points to a BEAT-UP HATCHBACK --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Unless he s married.  Then you can 
                    have him.

                                  TESS
                    Very funny, but we broke up.  NYPD!  

      No answer, but it s unlocked.  They head inside... 


      Images of a village decimated by what looks like a wild 
      animal attack: empty streets, SHREDS of clothing streaked 
      with blood BLOW in the WIND, one landing on a mauled body as: 

                                    VINCENT (V.O.)
                    We couldn't be stopped. 


      Amongst rocks we can just make out Vincent's eyes, which GLOW 
      LIKE A CAT'S as he crouches, hiding.  Nearby, the sound of a 
      CONVOY, then GUNSHOTS.  Vincent grimaces from fear& 

                                    VINCENT (V.O.)
                    ...To eradicate all of us...


      Catherine heads out alone, lost in thought as she starts down 
      the street when she stops at the sight of a MILITARY VAN  
      parked at the LOADING DOCK.  She watches as TWO SOLDIERS 
      carry a BODY BAG out of the Precinct.  

      She approaches, forcing a smile as they LOAD it onto the VAN:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hey, don t see you guys around here 
                    too often.  What s going on?

      No response.  She flashes her BADGE.

                                  ARMY GUY #1 
                    Just following orders, Detective.  

      He shows Catherine TRANSFER ORDERS.  They re for  Agent 
      McCleary  -- holy shit, when she HEARS a POP --  

      She looks up, sees a silver-haired gentleman in a suit, SILVERFOX, 
      stepping out of the passenger side, who  pops  his gum.

                                  SILVERFOX 
                    Of course, we re going to need to take 
                    that back.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  55.

                    not stealing a case.

                    It s not polite to interfere with other 
                    people s affairs, Detective Chandler.

      With that, he steps back into the van.  Catherine watches 
      them pull away, utterly rattled.  How d he know her name?


      Catherine, armed with a FLASHLIGHT, sees JT s HATCHBACK -- 
      Vincent s not alone.  She s about to leave, when -- 

                                    VINCENT (O.S.)

                    You re the one snooping around my place.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Some military guys just showed up to take 
                    that agent from the platform away.

      Vincent stops at this --

                    You didn t talk to them, did you?

                                  CATHERINE
                    I just asked what they were doing, but
                    I didn t tell them anything, I came 
                    straight here. 

                                    VINCENT
                    You shouldn t have done that.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I wanted to warn you.  I lost my phone 
                    on the platform, what if they have it?  
                    The guy knew my name.  

                                    VINCENT
                    This is why you have to stop all 
                    contact with me. 
                          (brow starting to SWEAT)

                    Did you?

                                    VINCENT
                    Look, it was one night, now you have 
                    to forget about me.

                                  CATHERINE
                    And my mom?

                                    VINCENT
                          (through gritted teeth)
                    I told you, I don t know anything.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    I don t believe you! 

                                    VINCENT
                    You don t get it, do you?!

                                  CATHERINE
                    I do, you can t tell me the whole 
                    story, which is fine, I don t need all 
                    the answers.  It s just, last night 
                    was the first time since my mother was 
                    killed that I haven t felt... crazy.

      That s it.  Vincent snaps, his eyes GLOW, CANINES appear --

                                    VINCENT
                    You are crazy!  Showing up here alone?  
                    I m a monster, I could kill you in 
                    less than a second!!  

      And to prove it, he picks up a RUSTED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, 
      HURLS IT with INHUMAN SPEED and STRENGTH, a BLUR of MOTION -- 
      it TEARS through the CONCRETE with a sickening CRUNCH.  

      She stands there, frozen.  He turns to her with a roar: 

                                    VINCENT
                    Go!!!

      Catherine runs off, scared, humiliated, hurt, and we...
