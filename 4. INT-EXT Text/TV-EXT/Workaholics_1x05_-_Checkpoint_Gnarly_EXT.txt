                    So tonight, throwback video games. 
                    Goldeneye or MarioKart?

      Adam holds up the video games.

                                  BLAKE
                    Yes!

                    I thought we could throw Bradley a 
                    Taste of Italy Night.  I ll fire up 
                    the Panini press--

                    Yeah, maybe if our grandmothers 
                    were visiting from the old country.  
                    We re playing MarioKart and I call 
                    Bowser.  See you on Rainbow Road.

      Anders, Blake, Adam, and Bradley stumble out of a bar.  
      Bradley, who is smoking, finishes the rest of an almost empty 
      beer, and then throws the bottle against a brick wall.  

                                  BLAKE

                    This totally beats Alice and her

                    Speaking of Alice, we should call a

      three other guys are sitting in the car waiting for Ders.  He 
      SIGHS, defeated and walks to the car.


      Ders and Adam standing outside the car (trunk open), playing 
      hackey-sack with their keys.  Ders holds up Blake s cop 
      uniform to his chest, before throwing it back in the trunk.

                                  ANDERS
                    You always say you re not gonna

                    into the ride, you are opening 
                      containers like crazy.

      Ders and Adam are confused, but they jump in the car and 
      start it up.  The Cashier is nearing the car, but Blake jumps 
      in and LOCKS his door in time.  Bradley goes for the other 
      side, but he s blocked by the Cashier.  Bradley and the 
      Cashier go back and forth around the car, one way, then the 
      other.  He has no choice -- He dives into the trunk with the 
      beers, and Ders peels out.

                                  ADAM
                    Did B-Rad just jump in the trunk

                    Wait!  Bradley!

      They turn back to see a COP approaching the car.  There s no 
      way they can go back.  


      Adam and Blake lie in the TALL GRASS, twenty feet from the

      ANGLE ON Sebastian, who looks hurt, but continues jamming, 
      sadly.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    He d be great for radio, though.

      Adam jams away, when Ders comes on through the walkie.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              20.

                    Guys, problem.  Bradley s gone!

                                  ADAM
                    What?!

      Suddenly, the van JOLTS.  Adam topples into Karl and 
      Sebastian.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Oh god--

      REVEAL: The van is being towed.  We see signage indicating 
      that it is very clearly parked in a tow-away zone.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              21.


                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Adam, Karl, and Sebastian now stand facing an angry, burly 
      TOW YARD GUY.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    So you guys realize that you parked 
                    in a clearly marked tow-away zone, 
                    outside of a tow yard.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, we re crazy like that.  You 
                    wanna throw down with a bunch of 
                    crazies?  Because it s three versus 
                    one.

      REVEAL: Karl and Sebastian running away.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Okay, now it s more fair.

      Ders comes on through the walkie, in Adam s pocket...

                                  ANDERS (O.S.)
                    Adam, where are you?  We re in here 
                    with the car, but--

      Adam futzes with the walkie.  Tow Yard Guy s onto him.

                                  ADAM
                    So you tow cars and stuff, that s 
                    cool.  Love your tatts.  What is 
                    that, Satan?  I got a nautical star 
                    on my calf.  Tatt brooooos.


      Adam, Blake, and Ders face the angry looking Tow Yard Guy.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                          (re: Ders  car)
                    You guys broke in here to steal 
                    this piece of shit?

                                  ANDERS
                    It s not a piece of shit, it s very 
                    reliable.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    Whores are reliable.  Now, you guys 
                    broke into my lot--

                                  ADAM
                    I was brought in against my will.

      Off the Tow Yard Guy s menacing look, Adam shuts up.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                      Regardless, you re here now, so I 
                    can do whatever I want to you.  

      He pulls out an EXPANDING BATON and FLICKS it open.  

                                  BLAKE
                    Why does everybody except me have 
                    one of those?

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    So who s asshole needs a baton up 
                    it?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              23.

      CONTINUED:

      Our dudes look freaked.  Then from out of nowhere:

                                    BRADLEY (O.S.)
                    Hold it right there!

      The guys look over to see Bradley emerging from the shadows, 
      DRESSED IN BLAKE'S COP OUTFIT. 

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    This vehicle is part of an ongoing 
                      investigation, which makes it 
                    police property.  I ll be taking it 
                    and these gentlemen.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    You re a cop?

                                    BRADLEY
                    What, you don t think I could be a 
                    cop?  

      He taps his badge.  The Tow Yard Guy stammers.

                                  TOW YARD GUY
                    No, no, that s not what I meant.  
                    They re all yours.  Sorry about 
                    that, Officer.

      Bradley nods and the three guys walk toward the car.

                                    BRADLEY
                          (to Tow Yard Guy)
                    Don t make me come back here.

      As Bradley opens the Kia door for the guys to get in, his 
      pants get caught and they BREAKAWAY, revealing the tiny 
      STRIPPER SHORTS.  Tow Yard Guy realizes he s been fooled.

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    Go!  Go!  Go!

      They jump in the car and PEEL OUT.


      Alice gets in her car and starts it up.                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              25.



      Alice pulls up to a STOP LIGHT.  A car pulls up next to her, 
      she looks over.  It s our guys, but Blake has put his hair 
      over Bradley s head as a disguise.  Alice does a double take, 
      but when she looks back, they ve driven away.


                                    BRADLEY
                    Turn by the sign!  Now left!  We re 
                    almost there!


      Alice pulls up near her house.


                                    BRADLEY
                    We made it!

      REVEAL: The guys are at an IHOP.

                                  ANDERS
                    What are you talking about?!

                                  ADAM
                    We thought you were taking us to 
                    your house!

                                    BRADLEY
                    Yeah, my house of pancakes.  I m 
                    starving, let s get some fucking 
                    SHORT STACKS!!!

                                  ANDERS
                    We should also pick up some 
                      applications, because we are going 
                    to need new jobs.  

                                    BRADLEY
                    You guys, stop.  I m twenty-five 
                    years old, I m not your prom date.  
                    I can be out as late as I want.  

      The guys look at each other, unsure.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 105 - Network Draft - 4/2/10              26.

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                      Seriously, I ll talk to Alice, and 
                    tell her the truth: I had a total 
                    blast, and that you guys showed me 
                    a great time.  She won t be mad, 
                    trust me.

      They consider this for a beat.

                                  BLAKE
                    Are you sure?  Because now I can t 
                    stop thinking about the IHOP 
                      International Crepe Passport.

                                  ANDERS
                    That s like a bunch of different 
                    crepes?

                                  BLAKE
                    You know it.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, we re doing this.

      As they jump out (Bradley still in little shorts) and head to 
      the IHOP, we REVEAL that they ve parked in a TOW AWAY ZONE.
