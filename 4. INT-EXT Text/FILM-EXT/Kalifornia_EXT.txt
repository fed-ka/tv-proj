It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary
glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below
us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the
drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes
of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks
strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud...
Closer... Closer...
Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench
it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover
that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with
every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!*
Lightning obliterates the frame.
(* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights,
photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout
the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)
We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of
an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished.
Flash!!
Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a
70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting
image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright
red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.
Emerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands
that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket
clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of
the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up
against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal
the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.
The CHEVY brakes... Skids across the rain-slicked pavement
and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood.
ANOTHER ANGLE: CLOSER
The CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the fractured front end of the
overturned CHEVY. The twisted hunk of metal hisses...
steams... groans. The front tire spins lazily to a halt on
its mangled axle.
IN THE BACKGROUND - HIGH OVERHEAD
We see a man standing on a highway overpass. He's leaning on
the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.
CLOSER
EARLY GRAYCE, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black
hair, stands by the railing. Rain streaks down his
expressionless face. He dropped the rock.
EARLY'S POV - THE 70'S CHEVY
Lying in the deserted highway. The Driver crawls out covered
with blood. Still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette
lighter. Its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint
glow.
ANGLE: CLOSER ON EARLY
Calmly looking down with no pity. Even closer... Water running
down his face. Closer yet... On his eye... And right into
the dilated pupil.
As we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel
filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping
of powerful machinery.
FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BLACKNESS
The distant echo of a Woman's voice.
KIM (O.S.)
Are you dead or alive?
A relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain
has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of
shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks
into the diner.
A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.
Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He
looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless
junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway
of the trailer in her bathrobe.
ADELE
Early...
She glances around to make certain that no one's looking,
then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.
ADELE
Have a good one.
Early smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then,
remembers...
ADELE
Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr.
Diebold was by again yesterday.
Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold
lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.
ADELE
He said, if he ain't got the rest of
his money by the end of the month,
he's gonna "kick us the...
(spells the word fuck
to avoid saying it)
F-U-C-K outta here."
Early works his jaw, thinking.
EARLY
He said that, huh? Cursed in front
of you?
Adele nods.
ADELE
You gonna talk to him?
Early gets in his car.
EARLY
If he comes back, don't answer the
door.
Early revs the raspy engine.
ADELE
Suppose he hears me inside?
Adele's words are unheard as Early pulls away flinging his
beer bottle at a couple of chained PITBULLS in Diebold's
front yard.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Early's Grand Prix has a head of steam up as it tears across
the drive and hangs a hard right into his parking space next
to the trailer. Suddenly, Early hits the brakes hard! Another
car is parked there.
Early exits the trailer and climbs into his Grand Prix.
Tires screeching, the car surges toward Diebold and the dogs.
Scared shitless... Diebold begins back peddling. Confused,
the pitbulls bark, then follow suit.
Early laughs as he stalks Diebold.
Diebold jumps out of the way of the Grand Prix just as it
pulverizes his portable barbecue.
Early shifts it into drive and barrels out of the drive.
NEW ANGLE - DIEBOLD
As soon as the Grand Prix is out of sight...
DIEBOLD
(hollering)
You sonofabitch! Come back here!
Furious, he turns to find Adele staring at him from the window
of her trailer.
DIEBOLD
That's it! You tell him... I want
you both the fuck out of here by
Sunday or I'm gonna call the Police.
Adele starts laughing, she tries to hide it with her hand.
DIEBOLD
...You won't be laughing come Sunday
little girl.
Muttering to himself, he turns back toward his house. He
then notices what Adele is laughing at. One pitbull is trying
to hump the other.
DIEBOLD
Elvis! Get the fuck off him!
NEW ANGLE - ADELE
Peering out at him from the trailer window laughing at the
dogs.
Brian pulls up in his BLACK '62 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL. The
suicide doors and leather interior have seen better days.
Brian locks his car and walks into the building.
Adele steps out of the trailer.
ADELE
Early?
She walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard
to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers
in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a
shovel digging.
ADELE
Early? You down there?
The sound of digging stops.
EARLY
(from inside the hole)
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
ADELE
Almost.
After a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging.
ADELE
Early...
The digging stops again.
ADELE
Tell me more about California.
The moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her.
EARLY
Well... for one thing... They think
faster out there, on account of all
that warm weather they got; cold
weather makes people stupid, that's
a fact.
ADELE
I guess that'd explain why there's
so many stupid people around here.
EARLY
Yeah, and in California you never
have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on
the trees everywhere you turn...
(beat)
...and, 'course there ain't no speed
limit out there, and all drugs are
legal... And I heard your first
month's rent is free; state law. I
figure 'til we get settled we can
just move around month to month...
ADELE
What'll we do out there?
EARLY
Well... the very first thing we're
gonna do... is get us a couple of
six packs of Lucky Lager and climb
up on toppa' that famous Hollywood
sign and howl at the moon...
Early lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her
shoulder at the moon.
ADELE
You know... I read once... Ain't
nothin' on that big old moon 'cept
some old golf balls those astronauts
left behind.
EARLY
Bull. That ain't right... Government
sends people there all the time,
just don't want us to know about it.
Adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer.
ADELE
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout
ready.
EARLY
I heard that.
After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in
the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked
except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early
gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.
Brian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying
a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car.
CARRIE
What did he sound like on the phone?
OMITTED
BRIAN
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags.
BRIAN
(grins)
I like that.
CARRIE
I still think we should have met
them first.
BRIAN
Beggars can't be choosers. They were
the only ones who answered the ride
share note, remember?
Carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer.
CARRIE
Please God, we're gonna be stuck
with these people for a week, don't
let them be as boring as Brian's
friends. Anything... but that.
Brian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car
hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel.
The engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the
street.
PAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele
speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice.
ADELE
We shouldn't be doin' this, Early.
You leavin' the state, ridin' around
with strangers... besides, what kinda
people would want to stop at places
where other people was murdered.
The camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is
alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early
approaches. Just in time to hear...
ADELE
What if they're dangerous?
EARLY
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're
writers.
Startled, Adele drops her shoulder bag. It lands on top of a
couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag --
all their possessions. A few personal items spill out of it.
ADELE
Early Grayce!
She kneels down to pick things up.
ADELE
(changes subject)
Did you settle things with Mr.
Diebold?
EARLY
Yeah I left him with the car... We're
all squared up now.
EARLY'S POV
As Adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, Early
notices her prized cactus in the bag.
EARLY
What's this?
He angrily reaches in and grabs it.
ADELE
Early!
She reaches for the cactus but misses.
EARLY
What kind of a person would carry a
cactus in her purse!
Adele bites her lip almost crying. Suddenly, Early looks
past Adele to see something, Adele turns too.
NEW ANGLE
The Lincoln comes gliding into view.
Brian stops the Lincoln and gets out. He approaches Early
and shakes his hand, then Adele's.
BRIAN
Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must
be Adele.
An awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until
Brian reaches for Adele's bag.
BRIAN
Let me help you.
Brian picks up her bag and carries it to the Lincoln. Adele
is instantly won over by the gesture -- Early leery of it.
From the blackness... The camera rises from a pile of rubble.
As it ascends we reveal Diebold's pitbulls howling and digging
at a mound of fresh earth where Early's hole used to be.
The crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene.
Deep in the distance, the wail of approaching sirens.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Reveal that it's Early's trailer and car that are on fire.
On the Lincoln as it exits the Bus Station. The camera
descends toward a lone trash can, to find there, lying amidst
the debris inside... Adele's cactus.
The Lincoln passes through on its way out of town.
Everyone takes a last look at the familiar countryside. Carrie
is snapping photos of the twisting concrete overpasses and
the gloomy grey sky beyond.
Lincoln drives off down the highway.
Police and Firemen sift through the smoking ruins of Early's
trailer. The Parole Officer pulls up in his car, he gets out
and approaches a Police Officer.
PAROLE OFFICER
What happened?
POLICE OFFICER
Who are you?
PAROLE OFFICER
His Parole Officer.
POLICE OFFICER
Right, I talked to you on the phone.
They say it's a torch job, that sound
like your boy?
PAROLE OFFICER
Could be.
POLICE OFFICER
Where would we find him?
PAROLE OFFICER
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch
said he was thinking of moving to
Texas.
POLICE OFFICER
Without his car?
We see the smoldering remains of Early's Grand Prix. In the
background Diebold's pitbulls are being dragged away by a
Dog Wrangler.
POLICE OFFICER
What about the owner of the house...
(reads from note pad)
...this John Diebold, any idea where
he might be?
PAROLE OFFICER
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna
be too happy about this.
From inside Early's hole we hear a voice call out.
LABORER (O.S.)
Jesus Christ!
Parole Officer and Police Officer turn back toward the
trailer, as people rush to the site.
NEW ANGLE - OVERHEAD
The camera aerials down past those gathering around the
freshly dug hole to... a Laborer standing at the bottom of
the pit. Alongside his shovel, we see that a man's arm has
been unearthed.
LOW ANGLE UP TO THE TOP OF THE HOLE
The Police and Parole Officer join several others standing
there.
PAROLE OFFICER
...Diebold?
POLICE OFFICER
...That'd be my guess.
PAROLE OFFICER
Looks like somebody cut off his ring
finger.
POLICE OFFICER
Well now I'd say that's the least of
Mr. Diebold's problems.
The two men look to one another... as others begin to unearth
the body.
Close up, Diebold's ring on a hand twisting open a bottle
cap. Pull back to reveal that it is Early as he opens a bottle
of Lucky Lager beer and takes a sip. On the back seat between
them sits a brown paper bag. Adele reaches into the bag and
pulls out a cheap pocket camera. Excitedly she rips open the
box and pulls out the camera. She leans over and kisses Early.
ADELE
Thank you.
Early reaches in the bag and pulls out a small plastic bottle
of mineral water and an orange juice.
EARLY
All right, who gets the...
(can't pronounce name)
...water.
Carrie turns around, Early hands her the water. Early leans
forward and hands Brian the orange juice.
EARLY
Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a
bags of chips and some jerky, just
holler if you want some.
Then Early reaches past Brian to the rear-view mirror and
hangs a plastic St. Christopher statue around it.
EARLY
Can't hurt.
BRIAN
How much do I owe you?
EARLY
Forget it.
Adele struggles to understand the camera instructions on the
side of the box. She leans forward and shows Carrie her
camera.
ADELE
(embarrassed)
Guess I don't know the first thing
about cameras.
Carrie deliberates her response for a moment, then...
CARRIE
Well, the first thing... is you need
film. Preferably black and white.
Carrie pulls a roll of film out of her bag and takes Adele's
camera to load.
ADELE
You wouldn't have any color film,
would ya?
CARRIE
...Yeah, sure.
She pulls a roll of color film out of her camera bag and
quickly snaps it into the camera.
ADELE
I like things in color, pink, purple,
and red. I dunno, black and white is
kinda... boring.
Carrie points the camera at a smiling Adele and snaps the
first picture.
CARRIE
You just aim and press the button.
Adele takes the camera.
Adele leans out the side rear window to get a better view.
ADELE
I've heard of that! It's where Dolly
Parton has her park. "Dollywood". I
just think that's so clever.
Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it?
With that, she plops back down into the back seat.
As we see the car disappearing into the distance, we can
still hear Adele rambling on.
ADELE (O.S.)
...I've always wanted to go there...
It could be such fun.
FADE OUT:
The Lincoln approaches on a dirtroad and passes a mailbox
with the name "BAXTER" on it. The Lincoln turns into the
long driveway.
The Lincoln slows to a halt. Carrie and Brian exit the car
and begin walking toward the house. Early follows. Adele,
uncertain about what's transpiring, trails behind.
ADELE
Hey you two.
Brian and Carrie turn to see... Adele training a camera on
them.
ADELE
Give me a smile now.
Brian and Carrie look to one another then force a weak smile.
Early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind
Brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks.
Brian and Carrie quickly turn their attention back on the
house.
BRIAN
(continues into tape
recorder)
Neighbors said he was a quiet young
man, who was often seen pushing the
children on the swing set.
An unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard.
To the side of the house are the remains of an old swing
set. Carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set,
with the house in the background, SNAP! She fires off a shot.
BRIAN
(continuing)
Everything was fine until the day
the family ran out of work for
Michael, and had to ask him to leave.
As Carrie frames up another shot, Early crosses in front of
her camera. Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and
poses. Carrie looks to Brian.
BRIAN
Sorry, Early... Could you step out
the way, for a second?
Early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph.
He wanders away from the front of the house. Meanwhile, Adele
photographs the moment.
BRIAN
The first one to die was the nine
year old daughter...
Just then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around
the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of
them. Carrie snaps a final photo.
BRIAN
Hello.
The little girl scans all their faces.
BRIAN
...My name's Brian, what's yours?
The little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie
then back to the little girl.
BRIAN
...Could I speak to your parents?
After an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the
yard to the porch and opens the front door.
GIRL
(rudely)
Pa! There's more of them.
Looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see
into the entrance hall and through to the open front door.
Brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters
the house looking for her father. Inside the kitchen, right
next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a
purse on it.
Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has
obviously seen the purse.
AT THE FRONT DOOR
Brian motions for Carrie to join him.
AT THE SWING SET
Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses
interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins
swinging.
AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE
Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts
three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the
little girl and her father step to the front door.
A MIDDLE AGED FARMER with tanned leathery skin. He is not
happy. Brian extends his hand...
BRIAN
(friendly)
Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.
The father says nothing and does not respond to the extended
hand. Brian retracts his hand.
BRIAN
(continues -- less
confident)
I'm a writer, I'm working on a book
about famous murderers.
AT THE SWING SET
Adele swings higher. Her summer dress ripples in the wind. A
smile on her face.
Early's entire arm is through the opening. His shoulder
presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach
the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it
toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the
while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room.
EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to
the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.
BRIAN
...I'm sure you're aware that this
is the Novak house...
AT THE SWING SET
Adele swings even higher. She's lost in the moment. Euphoric.
BRIAN
(corrects himself)
...I mean, this was the Novak house...
(pause)
With your permission I'd like to
come in and photograph...
Before Brian can finish, the man slams the door in his face.
Brian is surprised. He just stands there a moment. He's not
sure whether to knock again.
The empty swing sways back and forth.
Brian and Carrie walk back to the car.
BRIAN
(upset)
We could have been in and out of
there in less than ten minutes...
CARRIE
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's
okay.
Brian continues on in a huff until Carrie breaks stride and
stops. She pulls him next to her.
CARRIE
It's okay... okay?
Brian glances back at the house. She interrupts his glance,
kisses him.
BRIAN
(continuing on the
heel of the kiss)
...That house is part of American
history now, whether he likes it or
not.
They enter the car.
EARLY
Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be
surprised if that Karma thing don't
come back and get him.
Carrie, surprised at Early's new found philosophical belief.
She looks into her side view mirror... And sees Early smiling
back at her. Carrie looks away...
CARRIE'S POV
Shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as
the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches
from her porch.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Early exits his motel room, opens a bottle of Lucky Lager
against a soda dispenser, and walks over to the motel diner.
Early walks toward the Lincoln. It is parked outside Brian
and Carrie's room. The front door is ajar, he pushes it open.
He sees Carrie's reflection in the bathroom mirror, she's in
her underwear, pulling on her jeans. Early watches her for a
moment. There's no mistaking what's on his mind... as his
eyes scan her body. Carrie pulls on her T-shirt, steps out
of the bathroom and sees Early just outside the door.
EARLY
...Need a hand with those bags?
CARRIE
No, thanks, I can manage.
Early places the bags in the Lincoln's trunk. Adele sees
Early carrying Carrie's bag, Adele looks jealous.
In the foreground Carrie's door closes.
TO BLACK.
Lincoln passes through frame.
Brian and Early unload the trunk to get to the spare tire.
AT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE
Brian struggles with the wheel and the jack.
EARLY
Here Bri' let me do that.
Early takes over. He pulls off his shirt, jacks the car up
and begins replacing the wheel with ease.
EARLY
How did he get away with it for so
long anyhow?
BRIAN
He almost always killed strangers.
Spent years moving on from one place
to another. That made it real hard
to track him down.
Carrie scans the landscape with her camera. She sees Adele
walking around a small roadside graveyard. She is reading
the epitaphs on the headstones. Carrie fires off a few shots.
Then she sees Early, she can't help but notice Early's lean
body. She zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo. Click!!
Early completes the task. Together he and Brian begin putting
everything back in the trunk.
Suddenly, from behind, Adele jumps onto Early's back,
surprising him. He gives her a "horsey ride" around the
Lincoln.
ON CARRIE
She notices Early's wallet on the ground.
ON EARLY AND ADELE
She's riding him, covering his eyes playfully.
ON CARRIE
She picks up the wallet.
BENEATH THE LINCOLN
Early's feet galloping.
ON CARRIE
She opens the wallet to find two one dollar bills inside.
WITH EARLY AND ADELE
As they come around the side of the car and to a stop in
front of Carrie. She holds up his wallet... watches his eyes.
CARRIE
You dropped this.
ADELE
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky
day.
She hands the wallet back to him. Something between them
goes unspoken.
The Lincoln pulls in.
Early starts toward the gas station store. He checks his
wallet, two dollars left. Carrie and Adele lean against the
car. Carrie lights up a cigarette. She watches Early to see
what his next move will be. Brian removes the gas cap and
sticks the gas pump nozzle in. It pumps away.
CLOSE ON THE GAS METER
It starts turning over... $$$$$ Click... Click... Click...
(crossing the tarmac)... with Early. His face expressionless.
His mind racing...
Brian walks around the Lincoln; checking the tires. Carrie
watches Early intently.
CLOSE ON EARLY
He walks toward the entrance.
HIS POV
Inside the store he sees a video surveillance camera. It
worries him. Distracts him momentarily.
Suddenly from behind him... o.s. A car horn HONKS LOUDLY!
Early turns to see a late model Mercedes behind him. He just
gazes at the driver. Aggravated, the driver leans on the
horn and motions Early out of his way. Early stares at the
man a moment longer, then steps to one side and lets the car
pull past him.
WIDE ON THE GAS STATION
A FAT MAN in his late thirties exits from behind the wheel
of the Mercedes. Early watches him as he takes a money clip
from his pocket and walks toward the entrance to the mini
market.
The gas meter dial continues to go around. $$$$$ Click...
Click... Click...
NEW ANGLE
The girls leaning against the car. Adele watches Carrie take
a drag on her cigarette.
ADELE
I used to smoke before I met Early.
But he broke me of that.
Her remark gets Carrie's attention.
CARRIE
Broke you?
ON EARLY
He watches the Fat Man inside the office.
The Fat Man pays THE ATTENDANT for gas and is handed the
restroom key.
Brian walks to the front of the Lincoln. He passes Carrie
and Adele...
ADELE
Early don't think women should smoke
or curse or drink liquor.
CARRIE
So you don't do any of those things.
Carrie takes a quick look to the mini-market. She's lost
sight of Early.
ADELE
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
CARRIE
(back to Adele)
He whips you?
The Fat Man turns the key and enters the bathroom. The door
starts to swing shut behind him, but...
TWO FINGERS catch it before it does.
ADELE (O.S.)
Only when I deserve it.
Brian lifts the hood of the Lincoln... Reaches for the
radiator cap.
A BLAST of steam from the radiator startles Brian!
Brian checking the oil, pulls out the dip stick.
NEW ANGLE: CU
Black oil runs down the metal blade.
Brian slams the Lincoln's hood shut.
Brian steps up to the gas nozzle and pulls it out of the
car.
The gas meter stops turning.
Brian pulls a squeegee across the front windshield. Water
washes the dirt away.
The bloody water spiralling down the drain hole.
Early exits the bathroom... and runs straight into Brian,
about to enter.
EARLY
(friendly)
Hey Bri'... ah... You don't want to
go in there. It's a real mess, if
you know what I mean.
Brian glances at the bathroom door. Down below, a thin stream
of the Fat Man's blood begins to trickle out from under the
door... just barely touching the toe of Brian's shoe.
BRIAN
That bad?
EARLY
...Then some.
Early puts his arm around Brian and turns him back toward
the car.
AT THE CAR
Adele takes a photo of them, approaching. The attendant steps
up to Carrie.
ATTENDANT
(to Carrie)
Comes to twenty eight dollars.
CARRIE
Talk to him.
Carrie points to Early. As Brian and Early approach the car,
Early pulls out the money clip.
EARLY
Call it an even thirty.
Early peels off thirty bucks from the money clip. He sees
Carrie watching him, Early smiles.
EARLY
I'll drive Bri'.
Hearing that, Carrie climbs into the back seat. Adele climbs
over the backrest into the frontseat.
EARLY
Adele, get in the back.
She climbs again into the backseat.
The Lincoln passes by the LARGE SIGN.
BRIAN (O.S.)
I can hold my own...
A high angle looks down on the modest cluster of rooms below.
The motel sign pulses erratically in foreground. Moths flicker
about the light.
CLOSER
The Lincoln is parked in front of Brian and Carrie's room.
The horn honks. Early is behind the wheel, engine running.
Brian steps out of the motel room.
CARRIE (O.S.)
Hey Minnesota Fats!
Carrie appears at the door holding her camera.
CARRIE
(sarcastic)
Don't forget your key.
She hands Brian the key.
BRIAN
Why'd I open my big mouth?
Brian takes the key and walks to the car.
Carrie sees Adele standing outside her door. Brian enters
the Lincoln.
CARRIE
(to Adele)
Why didn't you go with them?
The Lincoln pulls away.
ADELE
I told you how Early feels 'bout a
woman drinking.
CARRIE
How'd you meet Early?
Carrie swings the camera around to Adele, and snaps off a
shot.
ADELE
(grins)
I was hitchhiking' one day and he
picked me up. At first I wasn't gonna
get in on account of his car was in
such sorry shape. I said, "I ain't
never seen a white man drivin' a car
like this."
Carrie snaps another shot of Adele. Every once in a while
Adele feels like she should be "posing" for the shots that
Carrie's taking of her. So, occasionally, as she carries on
her conversation with Carrie, she does.
CARRIE'S POV THRU CAMERA
ADELE
(continues)
An' he said right back, "You shouldn't
judge by appearances little lady...
this vehicle might just be a flying
saucer disguised as a car, for all
you know."
CARRIE'S POV THRU CAMERA - AS SHE ZOOMS IN TIGHTER ON ADELE
ADELE
Well, I got in and we got to talkin',
and the next thing I know, I'd moved
in with him in this old trailer.
(beat)
Hey! Wouldn't it be something if we
all ended up sharing a house together
in California?
ON CARRIE
She lowers the camera from her eye and studies Adele.
CARRIE
You know I can fix that haircut for
you, if you want?
ADELE
You can?
A nondescript "joint" on the outskirts of town. American
cars. American pickup trucks parked outside. The Lincoln
pulls into foreground and parks. Early gets out of the Lincoln
and looks around.
EARLY
I wonder if there's any "doors" out
here?
Brian exits the Lincoln and looks at Early questioning.
EARLY
You know... "openings" to other
dimensions.
(pause)
I read there are a lot of them out
West, mostly in the desert. They say
if you know what you're doing, you
can travel anywhere in the Universe
in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't
that come in handy?
Brian looks at him blankly. He can't think of a thing to say
in response. Early walks toward the entrance of the bar.
Brian joins him.
BRIAN
By the way, I'm not much of a pool
player.
EARLY
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I
can teach you everything ya need ta
know.
BRIAN
Yeah?
EARLY
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few
points first game.
BRIAN
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle
me?
EARLY
Nah... how much money have you got?
They both laugh and enter the bar.
CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
Adele is sitting in a chair in front of the dresser mirror
drinking a beer. Carrie is cutting her hair. In the mirror
Adele watches Carrie for a moment. She notices the cigarette
dangling from her lips.
ADELE
How do you get your cigarette to
stay there like that.
Carrie looks in the mirror.
CARRIE
I'm cool.
ADELE
Could I try that?
Carrie takes out a fresh cigarette and hands it to Adele.
Together they stare into the mirror with their dangling
cigarettes. Adele drops her cigarette, as she reaches down
for it she notices Carrie's portfolio.
ADELE
What's this?
CARRIE
It's a portfolio of my work.
ADELE
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
CARRIE
Sure.
Adele grabs the black leather binder and sets it in her lap.
Carrie continues to cut Adele's hair. Adele opens the binder
and takes a look at the first erotic image and slaps the
cover back down. She's embarrassed.
ADELE
Jesus!
Carrie watches her in amusement. After a moment, Adele
reconsiders, and opens the book. She gazes at the shocking
photograph.
ADELE
You took this picture?
CARRIE
Took 'em all.
Carrie resumes cutting Adele's hair. Adele thumbs through
several photographs.
CARRIE
That's me.
ADELE
No it is not!
CARRIE
Hold still.
ADELE
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early
found a picture of me like that I'd
be black and blue for a week.
Adele notices Carrie's scowl in the dresser mirror. Carrie
stops cutting.
CARRIE
(suddenly serious)
You shouldn't let him do that to
you...
ADELE
Do what?
CARRIE
Adele... are you serious?
ADELE
(defensive)
You think Early's bad to me, don't
you?
CARRIE
Yeah.
Carrie starts cutting Adele's hair again.
ADELE
Well... You're wrong. I ain't saying
Early ain't never hit me... but he
never hurt me.
When Carrie doesn't respond, Adele grabs Carrie's scissor
hand and stops her from continuing. Carrie looks at Adele's
reflection in the dresser mirror.
ADELE
(continues)
...When I was fourteen years old
three boys raped me in the back of a
truck, and beat me so bad I was in
bed for almost four months...
(beat)
...I feel safe with Early, most the
time he treats me pretty good. And I
know he wouldn't let nothin' like
that ever happen to me again...
Carrie is speechless, Adele looks in the mirror at her new
haircut.
ADELE
Hey, that ain't so bad now.
Early and Brian exit the bar. They make their way to the
Lincoln. On the way...
EARLY
Got to see a man about a mule.
Brian looks at Early, doesn't understand.
EARLY
Gotta take a piss.
Early branches off behind the car.
EARLY
Any reebs left in the back seat?
Early starts to take a leak.
EARLY
Aaahhhhh...
(relief)
That's what we used to call a beer
when we was kids... Beer spelled
backwards.
Brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last Lucky Lager.
He crosses to the other side of the car and hands Early the
beer.
BRIAN
Last one.
Early stares at the last of the Lucky Lagers.
EARLY
...Well I probably drunk more than
my share, anyway... you go on an'
have it.
BRIAN
No, it's all yours. It's on me...
for saving my ass back there.
Early takes the beer.
EARLY
Hey, that's what buddies are for,
right...?
Early polishes off the rest of the bottle and heaves it into
the woods.
EARLY
(voice drops almost
to a whisper)
You know those doors I was talking
about? Found two of them back in
Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking
for one the first time. Me and the
boys are just swingin' our sickles
by the side of the road, and I turned
around and there it was... this door
with this bright blinding white light
all around it... course I'm thinkin'
I must be sunstroked or somethin'...
so I close my eyes figurin' I'll
count ten and it'll be gone right...
so I'm countin'...
(he closes his eyes)
...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta
piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10.
An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it
won't be there right...
When Early opens his eyes, he sees a concerned look on Brian's
face.
EARLY
(unconvincingly)
...and it wasn't.
An awkward silence.
Then Early starts laughing. Brian follows suit. They both
climb back in the car. Their forced laughter trails off.
Brian shifts the Lincoln back into gear and segues
awkwardly...
BRIAN
What were you "swinging a sickle"
for?
Early stares at Brian. For a moment Brian is unsure what
Early will say, or do? Then Early grins...
EARLY
For... 'bout three years.
Brian brakes their eye contact, looks back out onto the
highway and just drives off.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Carrie leaves the motel room, ice bucket in hand.
CARRIE
(to Brian inside room)
Try not to lose consciousness 'til I
get back.
At the far end of a narrow hallway, Carrie finds an ice
machine rumbling away noisily. The only illumination, a single
fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it.
AT THE ICE MACHINE
With her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges
for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of
her eye, she notices...
SOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The
silhouette of a man.
Carrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for
another way out. There is none.
She tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of
ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind
races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the
fluorescent light. It's Early.
EARLY
Ain't you done enough drinking for
tonight?
CARRIE
...Brian hurt his foot.
Early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a
solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His
torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at
him.
EARLY
Sometimes... Don't know why it is...
I get so hot I can't stand it. I
just start sweating like a dog. You
ever get like that?
CARRIE
(tenuous)
No.
Early spits the ice cube back into his hand. He presses it
against the back of his neck.
EARLY
I can feel it start to run down my
neck...
(he turns his back to
show her)
...and down my back... right into my
pants.
Carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between
his shoulder blades and along his back.
EARLY
...and everything starts stickin'
together... keeps running down the
back of my legs like two rivers racin'
for my boots, see who gets there
first.
He snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his
ass. She diverts her glance.
EARLY
You never get that hot, huh?
Carrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see
that his ice cube has melted.
CARRIE
I gotta get back before this ice
melts.
Carrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the
machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice
cube. His face only inches from hers.
EARLY
...never?
CARRIE
No, never. Excuse me.
He pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.
EARLY
You like Skynard?
No response, Early chews up the ice cube.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
The car crawls out of the parking lot.
THE CAR IS HEADING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD.
She furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt.
A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is
broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian
how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old
car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of
shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.
EARLY
Only thing my old man ever gave me
is that goddamn .45.
Brian fires off another shot, misses again.
EARLY
Bri', you're jerkin' it when you
pull the trigger, hold it real steady.
Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of
her pocket.
ADELE
Boys'll be boys.
Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.
ADELE
You know any tricks?
Carrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer.
ADELE
You wanna learn some?
Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian.
ON EARLY AND BRIAN
Early helps Brian to hold the gun.
EARLY
Steady... Breath in... now let half
of it out, and... fire.
BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie
to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to
the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow
after her... But Early grabs his attention.
EARLY
Bri, I want you to keep this gun...
consider it a present. Never know,
California could turn out to be a
dangerous place.
Brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand.
The Lincoln rolling along.
The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In
the distance, we see a large rundown building.
The Lincoln passes through frame. In the background, the
surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie
artificial light.
The Lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before Carrie
storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station
interior. She leaves Brian to break the news to Adele and
Early.
Through flashes of lightning and thunder she sees Brian in
the car talking to Early. Early listening quietly. Brian
looking adamant yet apologetic. The attendant fills the
Lincoln's tank.
Brian's still talking -- using his hands to explain. Early
is watching him with a resigned expression.
Early drags Carrie out of the office toward the car. Brian
sees them running toward the car. They spill into the back
seat. Brian sees Carrie is upset.
BRIAN
Carrie, what's wrong?
(to Early)
Early, we went through this already,
you have to leave.
From the back seat Early wipes some more feathers from his
face, then points the Attendant's gun at Brian's head.
EARLY
(spits out a feather)
'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele.
Adele starts the car. She pulls out of the station and into
the rainstorm.
The Lincoln pulls up at the rear of the store. Adele exits
carrying a couple of bags of Chinese take-out food.
The Lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops. They
all get out, Early unties Brian and Carrie.
EARLY
Figured your hands might be starting
to hurt.
Early looks down the hill to the old mine building.
EARLY
Let's have a look. You girls coming?
Carrie's steely gaze answers Early's question.
ADELE
Can I just wait here?
Early leans into the car and picks up Adele's camera.
EARLY
Don't worry Bri', I'll take the
pictures.
(to Adele, with a
kiss to her cheek)
...you stay here with Carrie.
(to Carrie)
You run off... Bri' pays the price.
Karma, remember?
Pistol in hand, Early follows Brian down the hill. Adele
begins nervously playing with her yoyo.
Carrie watches as Brian and Early disappear around a bend in
the dirt road. Out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on
Adele's yoyo.
Adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the
yoyo, controlling it. Until she's lost in it. A momentary
refuge.
ADELE
This is called walk the dog.
NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU
A huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion.
Its string unraveling as it spins downward. Carrie pulls her
gaze away.
CARRIE'S POV
The desolate surrounding landscape, a bright blue sky, the
scrubbrush. And no one who can help them. Carrie turns and
looks over her shoulder down the hill.
The old mine building, rusted and deserted since the late
'20's.
EARLY
So tell me... what happened here?
BRIAN
Two brothers, prospectors, lived
here. Up until a few years back.
Flash! -- Early takes a photo with the Instamatic.
EARLY
(coaxing)
...and?
BRIAN
They picked up hitchhikers... young
men... and brought them back here.
Early scans the grounds.
EARLY
Where'd they do it?
Reluctantly Brian leads Early toward the old mine building.
At the opening, Early hesitates.
EARLY
Bri.
Brian stops in his tracks.
Adele's yoyo skitters across the gravel road surface.
Brian turns back to Early.
EARLY
This ain't going to give me
nightmares, is it?
Then in a snap!... the yoyo recoils into Adele's palm.
CARRIE'S POV
A distant empty ribbon of road.
ON CARRIE
Her eyes searching for anyone who could help.
ADELE (O.S.)
This is one of my favorites... rock
the cradle.
In slow motion Adele's hands manipulate the yoyo and string.
Carrie walks over to Adele at the car. Adele doesn't miss a
beat with her yoyo.
CARRIE
Adele, listen to me... Early's sick;
he should be in a hospital.
Adele screws up the trick. She pulls the yoyo off her finger
and throws it in the back seat. She leans into the front
seat and cranks the radio up to the max. Closing her eyes,
she begins moving to the music, and tries to ignore Carrie.
CARRIE
(shouting over the
music)
The police are after him, he's a
murderer!
ADELE
(uncertain)
...That's not true.
CARRIE
(shouting)
What?
ADELE
(shouting back)
That's not true!
NEW ANGLE
A POLICE CAR pulls into frame, unnoticed by Carrie and Adele
in the background.
The radio is blaring. Adele continues to dance despite
Carrie's pleas.
CARRIE
(shouting)
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . .
I saw him kill that man.
ADELE
(defensive)
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't
do that. I don't know why you're
saying those things. You ain't my
friend.
With that, Adele stops her dancing and turns away from
Carrie... To see the Male Officer walking toward them.
ADELE
Please don't say anything Carrie.
The Male Officer continues toward them. It looks like he's
talking to them... but his voice is inaudible under the
deafening radio.
NEW ANGLE: FAVORING THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS
The Female Officer sticks her head out of the police car and
yells to her partner. He turns to listen.
FEMALE OFFICER
We got a match, I'll call for back
up.
As the Male Officer turns back, he sees Adele reach into the
front seat of the Lincoln. The Male Officer draws his revolver
and levels it at Adele.
NEW ANGLE: FAVORING ADELE AND CARRIE
Click! Adele shuts the radio off, total silence. As Adele
leans back out of the car, she turns, facing directly into
the barrel of the Male Officer's gun.
MALE OFFICER
All right ladies, I want both of you
to slowly step away from the ca...
BANG! A single gunshot rings out! The Male Officer jerks
back and falls to the ground. Adele screams! Carrie whips a
panicked glance around and sees... Early running toward them.
Brian, bewildered, follows behind.
BRIAN'S POV (RUNNING)
Ahead of him, he watches Early race past the wounded Male
Officer. He kicks the Officer's revolver out of reach and
rushes toward the police car.
Early fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car!
The Female Officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of
the car, when... a shot shatters the windshield hitting her
in the chest. She collapses back onto the seat.
ON BRIAN
He stops at the sight of the wounded Male Officer. Shocked,
he watches the man writhing in pain. His hands clutching his
crotch. His blood oozes into the dirt.
Early approaches the police car. He sees the dead cop and
hears the radio dispatcher.
POLICE RADIO
Officer needs help, shots fired, six
Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects
wanted in multiple murders. Location
unknown, last seen...
Brian is not sure what to do. He looks around... sees the
Officer's handgun lying in the dirt. He takes a step toward
it, when... another gunshot rings out! Brian stops. Looks to
the police car. He sees Early standing there, smoke belching
from the dashboard... the police radio is dead.
Early walks back toward Brian and the others. He steps over
to the injured Male Officer on the ground.
EARLY
Tell me that don't hurt.
Early picks up the wounded cop's gun. He hands it to Brian
as he trains the .45 automatic at Brian's chest.
EARLY
Shoot him. You'll be doing him a
favor.
Brian looks to Early in disbelief.
OMITTED
BRIAN
No, no, I can't.
Early cocks the pistol and pushes the barrel to Brian's head.
Brian looks down at the wounded cop who is writhing in pain.
EARLY
(No,) It's the answer to all them
questions of yers.
Brian won't do it. He drops the gun to the ground.
EARLY
Now you'll never know.
Early cocks his pistol.
BRIAN
...Don't do it. Early, look at him,
look at his face. That's not your
father.
Early stares at the wounded cop's face.
EARLY
I know that. That there is a policeman
in a world of pain. And this is what
you call a mercy killin'.
Early shoots the cop again. The cop lays still.
Early reaches down and takes the dead cop's handcuffs. He
casually points the little camera at the dead cop. Flash!!
The Lincoln hurtles down the road.
The Lincoln drives along an old deserted highway passing
occasional gas stations and dilapidated motels.
A home in a secluded valley near the desert. It has a cactus
garden. The garden is illuminated so it can be enjoyed at
night.
Reveal... the Lincoln parked by the front door.
Adele gazes out the passenger-side window. She's enthralled
by the sight of all the cacti.
ADELE
...I luv' cactuses 'cos they're so
strong. Don't need much care really.
Reveal Brian handcuffed to the steering wheel beside her. He
cranes his neck to see out the rear window...
BRIAN'S POV
Early steps up to the front door of the house and rings the
bell. Carrie stands beside him. A light comes on inside. The
door slides open a crack and MRS. MUSGRAVE, an attractive
older woman with silver hair, peers out with a puzzled look.
Everything is quiet beneath the star studded sky. The same
elderly man pictured with Mrs. Musgrave is studying the sky
through a powerful telescope. MR. MUSGRAVE is an amateur
astronomer. o.s. the SOUND of a door opening. Then footsteps.
MR. MUSGRAVE
(excited)
Is that you Peaches? Come, you must
see Saturn tonight. The rings are
sensational!
Early is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope.
ADELE (O.S.)
Early?
He pulls his eye away as Adele arrives.
ADELE
(excited)
Early, Mrs. Musgrave has the most
beautiful little guest house out
back and... well, no one's stayin'
in it... it's just empty. And she
said if me and you wanted to, well
maybe we...
Suddenly, o.s., a scream pierces the moment!
Early and Adele turn toward the doorway to see Mrs. Musgrave
screaming. The older woman's eyes staring past Adele to the
floor nearby. Adele follows the terrified woman's gaze to
find... Mr. Musgrave's body lying on the floor. A bloodied
wound in the back of his head. All of Adele's enthusiasm
drains from her face.
EARLY
(to Mrs. Musgrave)
Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow
now.
Mrs. Musgrave collapses to the floor.
Aside from the occasional pools of light illuminating the
cacti, it's very dark. There's no sign of Mrs. Musgrave.
As Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little
Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of
beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides
into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is
now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses.
EARLY
Think anyone will notice?
Carrie doesn't answer, Early laughs.
The Lincoln heads out, past the cactus garden, into the
darkness.
THE LINCOLN'S HEADLIGHTS REVEAL
Adele's lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti.
FADE TO BLACK WITH THE DEPARTING HEADLIGHTS
In the distance, a cloud of dust reveals the Lincoln,
traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road.
Early throws the bottle of beer out the window (it ain't
Lucky Lager), slams the Lincoln into "drive" and accelerates
along the dirt road.
An anxious Brian hustles into the cab of the pickup truck.
Some tools are in the back. Brian still wears the handcuffs
around his wrists. Mrs. Musgrave stands near the front door.
BRIAN
Which way did they go?
MRS. MUSGRAVE
(pointing)
He took the fire road.
BRIAN
Take your car and get to that phone.
Call the police.
Brian starts the pickup and drives off.
The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire
road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see.
The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier.
The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.
The pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt.
Brian tries to guess which direction to take. Then he spots
Early's discarded beer bottle up ahead. The truck accelerates
straight ahead, tires spinning.
The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder.
The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is
streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view.
Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to
a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln
has had it.
Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards
away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old
1950's style building.
The sun is starting to set behind a distant mountain range.
In the far distance... The pickup truck, revealed by its
trail of dust, crosses the vast landscape.
Early and Carrie struggle through the growing sand storm.
Carrie throws a last curious glance back to the Lincoln as
they reach the front door.
Early slams the front door shut.
CAMERA PULLS AWAY - REVEALING
The building is a single story '50's home of extremely cheap
construction. It's in bad condition.
The last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck
heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate. The
pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the Lincoln.
NEW ANGLE
On a collapsed old wooden sign. It lies on the ground a few
feet away from the gate posts.
"DREAMLAND" - NUCLEAR TEST RANGE DANGER - KEEP OUT
Sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked
pickup truck. Brian is upside down with his eyes shut. A
trickle of blood runs down his face. Camera booms up a dirt
slope to reveal the Lincoln, beyond it on the hill above
sits the desert house. The glow of the kerosene lamp is
visible through the windows.
FADE OUT:
The storm is over... No sand blowing. No wind. No nothing.
COMPLETE SILENCE!!!!
The dawn light reveals the devastated '50's house to be one
of a cluster, set at the end of a 'Doom Town' cul-de-sac.
A blow knocks Early back through the doorway. He slams to
the ground, on his back. The gun falls from his jeans and
slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the
blood covered remains of his face, he tries to get up, but
can't.
EARLY'S POV
Brian, silhouetted, steps into the doorway. He holds a shovel
raised, ready to deliver a second, fatal blow... but when he
sees Early incapacitated on the floor, he lowers the shovel
to his side. His handcuffed hands reach down and picks up
Early's gun. He trains it on Early, then walks around him to
enter the house. Brian's eyes slowly adjust to the interior...
EARLY'S POV
From on his back, Early looks out the open "door." He sees
two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand,
reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes
that the glass, placed there by Brian, is what created the
effect of the "door." He starts to laugh.
EARLY
(laughing)
That was damn tricky of you Bri.
Brian searches for Carrie.
BRIAN
Carrie... Carrie... it's over.
ON BRIAN
He moves into the back bedroom and finds Carrie. She is
crouched on the floor, handcuffed to the bedframe. He moves
to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised
face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night.
Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes.
With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of
the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early.
in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the
room. He wields the pistol toward the ground where Early
lay... but Early's not there.
Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from
behind him, Early grabs him!
He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife
toward his throat!
Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before
the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious
wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the
gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls
away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but
Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to
his knees.
EARLY
Go ahead Bri, ask me something.
(beat)
You wanna know how I'm feeling'?
Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn
good.
On all fours, Brian reaches out for the gun, but Early kicks
it across the room.
EARLY
How 'bout you? You feelin' good?
Another kick to Brian's chest. The wind rushes out of him.
EARLY
...'Cause you sure don't look so
good.
(beat)
Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful.
That it, you feeling powerful?
Superior? I know I am.
Early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of Brian's face!
His head snaps back, his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls
flat to the ground.
EARLY
What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now
why would I be angry with my daddy...
you're the one hit me with the shovel.
And you're the one's gonna wish you
hadn't.
With one last effort, Brian manages to pull himself back up
to his knees. He focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries
to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips
over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway.
Early moves toward him, knife in hand.
As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the
doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past.
Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face.
Early stumbles backward.
Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he
turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires.
Hitting Early square in the chest!
Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself
to his feet.
He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway,
and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the
leg.
Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still.
Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain
around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs.
Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's
arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt
collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that
Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm
drops back down to his side.
EARLY
Hey Bri... I think I need a doctor.
What d'ya say?
The two men stare at one another for a moment... then Brian,
with one hand still on the handcuff keys, shoves the .45
automatic firmly under Early's chin.
CLOSE ON BRIAN
BRIAN
...Sorry 'bout this Early.
o.s. BANG!! rings out as...
CLOSE UP on the chain and keys snapping free from Early's
neck.
CLOSE UP on Brian's handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor.
CLOSE UP on Carrie's handcuff swinging empty against the
rusty bedpost.
