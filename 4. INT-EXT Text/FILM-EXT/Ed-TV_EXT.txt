A BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, "Would you
like to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a
phone number) Coming (and a date)."
Ed exits the building with the Operators walking backwards in front
of him, bumping into PEOPLE- People watch, curiously.
Ed reaches his car. He takes out his keys and drops them in a muddy
puddle. Disgusted, he fishes them out.
CUT TO:
36A
Ed is doing his morning errands. A little shopping -- a little
banking -- always ON CAMERA. At one point, he WALKS INTO a
GLASS DOOR with the word "Pull" on it. He pushed,
banging his forehead. A CHILD points to the word "Pull." Ed turns
to the camera, embarrassed. Later he buys a slice of pizza at a
little place that's doing no business.
ED
(to the camera)
Best pizza in New Jersey.
As he walks down the street, PEOPLE call out "Hey Ed!" People
in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact
moment.
The camera shoots some of the people in the windows. They see
themselves on TV and they go wild. Ed also is confronted by
GUYS grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things
like "Hey, Ed, holding your own?" or "Hey, Ed, howls the grand
ballroom." Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles
it with good grace. He seems to be loosening up.
38
Ed is walking. He passes the little pizza place he touted earlier.
There's a LINE out into the street. The STOREOWNER is working hard -
- deliriously happy. Ed passes, oblivious to what he's created.
42
Ed comes outside and he's accosted by a GROUP of angry Polish
Americans, many of whom are carrying signs decrying Polish
jokes and anti-Polish attitudes. They SCREAM ANGRILY when they
see Ed. Ed is completely shocked. He runs back inside. He
locks the door, leaving Carlos outside. The demonstrators
attack Carlos.
53
ED
What the --?!
BOY
I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Ed just stares in disbelief.
61
Ed is walking. PEOPLE YELL at him.
GUY
Ed! Your show stinks!
The Guy LAUGHS like he really got in a good one. Ed ignores him.
TWO TEENAGERS run in, one has a camera and quickly snaps a
picture of Ed and the other Guy. Merrily, they shake his hand
and run off, whooping.
There are PEOPLE who trail along. Many of them will show up
again and again, throughout the movie, following Ed. Some of
them will look mentally or emotionally impaired.
62
A CAMERA is shooting at a second-story window. We SEE
SILHOUETTES.
85
We can SEE them KISSING...
87
The silhouettes are kissing.
89
"DAY SIX"
This is a fairly old, modest private home. Ed pulls up. He
and Carlos get out of the car. Ed hurries up to the front door
and enters.
91
Ed arrives for work.
People CALL OUT to him-- PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE FROM CARS, TRUCK
DRIVERS. "Hey Ed, my man." Ed waves. People shake his hand.
A teenage boy looks into the camera, making a funny face.
Someone else looks into the camera and says, "Hi, Ma."
Suddenly, Ray is there with a WOMAN. Ray is not happy. He's
wearing DARK GLASSES and a HAT.
RAY
Hi.
Ed stops.
ED
... Ray?
RAY
Yeah.
ED
Oh, man, I've been trying to call
you.
RAY
I know.
ED
Look, we gotta talk.
RAY
Save it.
A GUY in a car appears and points at Ray.
GUY
Hey, you're that French guy on TV.
RAY
French guy?
GUY
Monsieur Bad-a-lay.
The guy drives away. Ray is steaming.
RAY
Let me just do what I came here
to do.
Ed thinks he means to fight. Ed tries to calm him.
ED
What are we gonna fight? Ray,
please, listen to me --
RAY
(beckoning)
Cassie...
CASSIE, a woman about Ray's age, steps forward. She's slightly
self-conscious.
RAY (CONT'D)
Go ahead.
Ray points Cassie to the camera.
CASSIE
This is really hard.
RAY
You promised me.
CASSIE
(to the camera)
I went out with Ray a few years
ago for... a couple of months.
And we... were intimate. And.
he's really not as bad as that
girl said he was.
Ray nods.
CASSIE (CONT'D)
I mean, I've definitely had
worse.
RAY
That's enough.
Ed is amazed that Ray would do this.
RAY (CONT'D)
(to Ed)
Good-bye, brother!
ED
Ray, come an--
Ray leaves, still angry.
Cassie lingers.
CASSIE
(flirting slightly)
So you're Ed.
Ray returns and yanks Cassie away with him. Ed still hasn't
recovered from the bizarreness he just witnessed. Two girls
YELL in unison from across the street.
GIRLS
Ed... we love you!
95
Shari, in her Fed-ex uniform is making a delivery. A WOMAN's
signing for it.
WOMAN
This is so exciting! A real
celebrity delivering my figs.
SHARI
(uncomfortable)
Sign here, please.
WOMAN
That Ray was a pig. Ed is
doll. You latch on to him
honey.
SHARI
By the X.
WOMAN
Some more make-up wouldn't do you
any harm. On TV you look a
little washed out.
SHARI
What would I actually have to do
to get you to sign this?
WOMAN
(insulted)
Oh, an TV a minute and already an
attitude.
SHARI
(annoyed)
By the X. That's were two lines
cross -- forming an X.
ANGRILY, the Woman signs and slams the door.
She heads back to her truck. She looks up and Ed is there with
flowers. The TV cameras are there also. Shari is startled.
But she's also glad to see him.
SHARI
What are you doing?
ED
I missed you.
She's camera-shy.
ED (CONT'D)
You know, I never saw you in your
uniform before.
SHARI
Yeah, well...
They both LAUGH.
ED
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
SHARI
You should see the one we wear
when it rains.
ED
Sunday night at the Devils game,
I'm driving the Zamboni.
SHARI
The what?
ED
You know, the big machine that
cleans the ice.
SHARI
Oh yeah.
ED
It's quite an honor. Will you
come with me?
She looks at the camera.
ED (CONT'D)
(gently)
Look, I know this is weird.
But... I don't want to wait. I
really think we might have
something together. Don't you?
EMBARRASSED, she nods.
ED (CONT'D)
Come on. Be my zamboni date.
She doesn't say "no."
They KISS -- a little hesitantly, not passionately, but
affectionately. She's still self-conscious, but she's going
with the flow.
97
BOUNCERS squeeze Ed and Shari out the door, protecting them.
Ed is unnerved. Shari is somewhat bedraggled. Her clothing is
torn.
101
Written on the screen -- "Day 28"
Two WOMEN on Stairmasters.
WOMAN
V11 bet he goes out with her.
It's like those actors -- as soon
as they get famous -- Pfft -
there goes the wife.
117
The dorm girls.
118
Shari is working. Ed is following her around. Shari is ANGRY.
The cameras are there.
SHARI
Get them away from me.
She takes PACKAGES OUT OF the TRUCK and THROWS them at the
cameramen.
ED
It's not their fault.
SHARI
No. It's your fault.
She throws a package at him.
ED
What do you want me to do? You
want me to quit the show?!
SHARI
No... Could you?
ED
No. If I quit I don't get the
balloon payment.
SHARI
The what?
ED
Ray borrowed this whole tub of
money against this balloon
payment that I don't get if I qu --
it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
SHARI
What?
Pause.
ED
You see how people look at me.
Like when they ask for my
autograph or say "Hi" to me...
It's like I'm a basketball player
or a... you know, like I'm
someone.
SHARI
Everybody's someone.
ED
Well, yeah, everybody's someone.
But I mean someone they want to
be. I mean let's face it, I'm
working in the video store, no
one's coming in saying "oh, I
wish I was that guy. 1 wish
was rewinding that huge pile of
tapes." At least for a month
I'm not just a guy with a name
tag. I'm famous.
A GUY YELLS from across the street.
GUY
Shari! Nice nipples.
ED
And so are you.
GUYS keep YELLING "Shari!"
She tries to go after them. Ed holds her back.
SHARI
I don't want to be famous for
getting caught with my shirt off.
If I'm going to be famous --
The camera is right in her face. She grabs it.
SHARI (CONT'D)
(to the camera person)
This is going right up your ass.
ED
Come on.
He returns the camera.
Shari starts for her truck.
SHARI
Look... maybe we just better put
us on hold until this is over.
She gets in her truck.
ED
Come on! Loosen up.
(trying to joke)
See -- this is why seventy-one
per cent of the people don't like
you.
She SLAMS the TRUCK DOOR.
ED (CONT'D)
It was a joke! A... vicious,
thoughtless stupid joke.
He bangs himself in the head.
She drives away.
He BOWS.
ED (CONT'D)
(to the camera)
And that, for you kids out there,
is how you screw up a relationship.
137
SEAVER (CONT'D)
It's in violation of his contract
and if we wanted to be hard-nosed
about it, he could forfeit all
pay, including money he's already
received.
CYNTHIA
(dutifully, but a tad
resentfully)
I will see that he's properly
threatened.
SCHARLACH
Now what? What's on the young
man's agenda? We don't want to
see him sitting around like a
lovesick puppy.
GREG
Young males do not want to see Ed
get back with Shari.
SCHARLACH
(impatiently)
Enough with her. That sailed.
McILVAINE
Could Ed live with two girls?
GREG
You know who the audience is
requesting a lot? That girl,
Jill, that Ed met at the
Letterman show. She really
scored.
SCHARLACH
Cynthia...
He wants it accomplished.
139
Ed is walking from his car to a building. CROWDS are behind
barricades. They YELL at Ed as he passes. Ed is used to this.
140
CYNTHIA
Yeah.
ED
You asked me if I had a dream.
I said "Sure, I have a dream. I
just don't know what it is yet."
CYNTHIA
Great line.
ED
What if Shari's the dream?
CYNTHIA
Ed, do you want my advice?
ED
Yeah, that's why I called. I
mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me
where she moved --
CYNTHIA
Leave her be.
ED
You said a woman likes to be
pursued.
CYNTHIA
Pursued, not harassed. Give it
some space. Can I tell you
something -- as a friend? My
sister was going with a guy
they hit a little rough spot
they started seeing other people
they got back together and last
month they had their third child
For what it's worth.
OPEN ON ANDY, Ed's half-Asian nephew. He's eight. He's
wearing a baseball glove.
ANDY
Throw me a high one, Uncle Eddie.
ED (O.C.)
Okay.
REVEAL ED, also wearing a baseball glove. He throws a high pop
up to Andy. Andy staggers around and almost catches it.
ED
Oh!!
JILL (0.C.)
We have to stop meeting like
this.
ED
Hm?
REVEAL JILL, walking a DOG. it takes just a second to
recognize her.
ED (CONT'D)
Oh, hi.
Ed is hit with the ball.
ANDY
Sorry.
REVEAL the Real TV Staff watching this on television in their
office. As Ed and Jill chat in the background.
ALICE
(to Cynthia)
Did you arrange this?
CYNTHIA
(points to the TV)
Whose dog is that?
ALICE
(surprised)
That's your dog.
Cynthia doesn't even smile.
MONTAGE
INTERSPERSED IN THE MONTAGE ARE SHOTS OF PEOPLE
WATCHING THEM ON TV
1. Ed and Jill going into a chic club -- ushered in
immediately. Here, as in the other times we see her, Jill is
comfortable with the situation. She's the opposite of Shari.
She poses willingly. She chats easily with paparazzi. She
clings to Ed. There's nothing overt or obnoxious about her.
She's just comfortable and good at it and always looks great.
2. INTERVIEW with the guys who didn't like Shari.
GUY #1
Way to go, Ed!
GUY # 2
Now, we're talking!
3. A N.Y. Post story:
"Readers Pick Jill over Shari."
Pictures of both women. Jill looks great. Shari is in her
uniform and looks like a mouse.
4. SHARI
In a new apartment. Watching Ed and Jill on TV. She's very
unhappy. She turns it off.
5. Ed and Jill at the nice restaurant he was at with Shari
earlier. It looks like he's starting to like her.
6. Ed is refereeing a pro-wrestling match. He counts out the
villain who, then, jumps up and chases him out of the ring.
144
Written on the screen -- "Day 48"
Ed is walking, the camera following. He looks tense. People
SHOUT "Hey, Ed" "Ed-die" etc.
ANGLE ON A NEWSPAPER VENDING MACHINE
The New York Post front page -- "Is tonight the Night?" with a
picture of Ed and Jill kissing.
ANGLE ON ED
ED
Oh man...
CON ED GUY
Hey, Eddie.
Ed looks up.
CON ED GUY (CONT'D)
(giving the "thumbs
up")
Go for it!
Ed continues down the street. People YELL to him "Good luck
tonight," "We're rooting for you" etc.
A STREET CHARACTER walks alongside for a minute.
STREET CHARACTER
Hey, man. This is Haitian Love Juice.
(he produces a vial)
You give her this, she be yours.
Security grabs him and the vial falls and breaks. The liquid
hits the pavement and smokes up.
ED
(looking at the smoke)
Jesus!
More shouts "Be gentle", "We'11 be watching", "Use a condom" etc.
A SCHOOL BUS passes. The KIDS YELL out the window to Ed.
KIDS
(in unison)
Good luck!
146
There is no line. At TICKET TAKER sits, bored. No one is
going in or coming out.
147
It's deserted.
148
It's empty. The HEADWAITER stands in the doorway with nothing
to do.
149
Ed's car turns the corner and he sees a CROWD gathered around Jill's
building.
152
ED
(understating)
I'm starting to feel a little
pressure.
Ed carrying his wine enters to APPLAUSE and CHEERS.
153
A LONG SHOT encompasses all the houses on the block. Their
living room TV's are visible. All but one are tuned to Ed.
154
Ed is being loaded into an AMBULANCE. He looks humiliated.
PEOPLE in the street are applauding politely as if Ed were an
injured ballplayer being carried off the field. Jill is by the
ambulance. She's PETTING a CAT who looks all right.
PHOTOGRAPHERS are taking her picture. She's posing willingly.
The ambulance drives off as Jill continues to pose.
162
"DAY 54"
Ed is walking. He's wearing a white, Velcro support around his
waist. He's agitated. He's carrying a copy of the New York
Post.
ED
Look at this!
WE SEE a headline -- "Ed: She Broke My heart."
ED
She did not!
(venting)
You know what she did?
ED (CONT'D)
She went out to California and
got one of those scandal agents.
One of those agents who handle,
like... Gennifer Flowers and...
Kato Kaelin and Joey Buttafuco.
That's what she --
A GUY YELLS AT ED
GUY
Hey Ed! ... She was a little too
much for you, huh? Must run in
the family.
ED
(angry)
Oh -- like this guy's ever been
with a woman.
(yells)
How about I kick your ass 'til
the crack goes the other way?
(to the camera)
All of a sudden, I'm like fair
game for everyone. I'm like --
He stops and looks like he's in shock. He stares in through
the display window of a bookstore.
ANGLE ON,
a big DISPLAY of cheap, rushed-out, exploitation books. On the
cover we read "My Brother Pissed On Me By Raymond L. Pekurny.11
And there's an old photo of two little boys. (Ed and Ray)
ED
Oh my -- He wrote a book?! Ray
wrote a book?! He never read a
book!
165
A MAN, on the sidewalk, has a STUFFED CAT stuck to his back to
tease Ed.
CAT MAN
Hey, look, I just fell off a
table!
Suddenly, a TUBFUL OF WATER crashes down on him.
169
Ed is driving Jeanette and Al to the funeral. A CROWD is held back by
POLICE. Someone yells "Adulterer". Someone else tries to offer Ed a
lunchbox. Someone else is carrying a sign "What a Way to Go".
182
Hank's COFFIN is being carried to his gravesite. Ed, Ray and Marcia
are pall bearers. One of the others pall bearers is Ed's BODYGUARD.
The OTHERS TWO are two guys who work for the mortuary. Carlos is
shooting.
ED
(to Ray)
You're not going to talk to me?
You're not even gonna say hello?
RAY
I have nothing to say to you.
Ed gives up. He turns to Marcia.
ED
How are you doing? Is Cliff here?
She doesn't answer. Ed reacts.
RAY
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
ED
Me?!
RAY
That's right. You put Cliff on
television. So then he decided he
was too good for her and he left.
ED
I put his -- who --
(to Marcia)
Look, Marsh, he's not that good
a singer, he'll be back.
MARCIA
(too loudly)
That's not funny!!
Ed CRINGES.
183
The service ends. The small group begins to walk away. Ray
and Marcia go off together, ignoring Ed. Jeanette is
attempting to wheel Al away from the grave, but she's hitting
ruts. Ed approaches.
ED
I'11 take it.
JEANTTE
(to Al, uncomfortably)
Sweetheart, I'm gonna go ahead
and sign all the papers.
AL
Right.
She touches him but he pulls away. Ed wheels Al.
ED
Are things gonna be okay with you
and Mom? Is there anything I can --
AL
I'm moving out.
ED
What?!
AL
I'm going to be living with my
brother. He's not in such good
shape as I am, but... I'm looking
forward to the pillow fights.
ED
(really upset)
Oh, Al ... This is just...
AL
Hank was always good with the
ladies. Always good-looking.
Hell, he's been dead for two
days, he still looks better than
me.
He stops wheeling and crouches down next to Al.
ED
I want to tell you something...
I love you. You're my father.
Pause.
AL
I love you, too.
Al KISSES him.
AL (CONT'D)
I'11 build a pirate ship with
you.
Ed wheels him away.
184
Ed is helping Jeanette. Ray arrives. He's ANGRY.
RAY
I'11 take her. You humiliated
our mother on national
television. You've single-
handedly destroyed this family.
ED
I -- Oh, but that book you wrote
was a real love-letter. That...
toilet paper with covers.
BYSTANDER #1
That book sucked. I want my
money back.
ED
Oh great. Where's Moe?
He looks around. Moe is gone.
RAY
Come on, Ma.
ED
(to Ray)
Let's remember how I got into
this. "Please, Eddie, do this
for me. I can't get a break."
(pretends to cry)
RAY
You know what your problem is?
ED
Yeah. My problem is I've got a
brother who writes a sentence
like "We grew up in a small,
little bedroom." As opposed to
a big, little bedroom?
RAY
I got paid by the word! No!
Your problem is you don't ever
want anything to be your fault.
ED
Me?! That's you!
RAY
I commit. I take a chance. You
wanted to be the guy on TV, but
you didn't want to say you wanted
to. So you have me talk you into
it so you get what you want, but
if it goes bad it's not your
fault.
BYSTANDER #2
Right. Like you say you love
Shari, but, you wouldn't mind
noodling that model.
ED
Moe!
BYSTANDER #3
The truth hurts.
ED
Yeah? So does a kick in the
nuts.
RAY
For once in your life, be honest
with yourself. I know you, Ed.
I know you look at me and Marcia
and Mom and you think you're
different.
You're like "How did I end up in
this family?" You're not
different. you're worse.
Because you have no guts.
You drift around, you don't commit,
you make fun of me -- okay. Just
don't kid yourself.
(to Jeanette)
Let's go.
JEANETTE
You're both good boys.
Ray and Jeanette leave.
187
Ed WALKING ZOMBIE-LIKE- CROWDS SWARM.
192
Ed and Shari are walking -- on camera.
SHARI
1 bailed. I bailed on you.
ED
Kinda'.
SHARI
It's what I do. I yell
"Geronimo" and jump out of a
relationship.
He laughs.
Pause.
SHARI (CONT'D)
You weren't able to make me feel
safe or secure -- no easy job for
any
man, I admit -- and my
problem is, if I think I'm
losing, I pull myself out of the
game. I bail. See? I told you,
I'm the love coroner.
ED
What did you do to your hair?
SHARI
My truck overheated, so I opened
the hood and my hair got caught
in the fan belt. So I had to get
a haircut.
ED
It's nice.
He touches her hair. They leap on each other. They're
KISSING.
