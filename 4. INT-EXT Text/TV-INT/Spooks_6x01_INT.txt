      A biological research laboratory. White, shining, sterile. *
    Two SCIENTISTS are working on equipment. *

      Without warning the lights go off. *

    The scientists panic.*

      Immediately they pick up torches and shine them into the *
      glass where we see the centifrugalspinner slow and stop. *

      Instinctively they turn their torches to a flask attached to *
      a rotary evaporator.  Because of the lost power, its grip *
      loosens and the flask drops off and cracks on the floor. And *
      from within the flask we see the vial, with a green liquid, *
      spilling out of it.*

    One of the scientists - Ebrahim- stares at it in horror. *

      Then we see the vial again. There is a vapourhaze coming off *
    it. Similar to one we will see coming from Asnik s suitcase *
      after the train crash.*

      Ebrahimhits the extractor fan. *

    The other scientist panics as he hits the alarm. *


    17 hours later. On a bench near an ELECTRON MICROSCOPE lies a *
      GLASS VIAL. We see the BIOHAZARD sign.*

    On the floor lies the TWISTED CORPSE of the IRANIAN *
      SCIENTIST. His fingers and neck BLACKENED BY LESIONS. BLOOD *
      pooling on the white floor - coughed up in his death agony. *

      EBRAHIM- blood round his mouth, blackened fingers - stands *
    at an OBSERVATION WINDOW. *

    On the other side of the glass, in civvies, stands MEHAN *
      ASNIK. Horrified.*

                                  ASNIK*
                    How did this happen?*

                                  EBRAHIM*
                    There was a powercut, back-up *

      Asnik splays his hand on the glass. Helpless. Angered at *
      being forced to witness the death of his friend. *

                                  EBRAHIM*
                    Make it safe. There is another vial *
                    behind you.*

      A long moment between them. And then the scientist COUGHS a *
      great, red gobbet. It splatters on the glass between them.*

      Asnik takes an automatic, horrified step backwards. And then *
      turns.  *

    On a BENCH behind him stands a RACK with space for TWO VIALS. *
    One of the vials is missing - the one in the lab.*

      Fade out on Asnik s face...*


      A seedy winter morning. An ALARM CLOCK. *

      Which begins to RING. *

      A WOMAN S HAND reaches out to shut it up. Flails at it *
      blindly. It shuts up.*

    And then ROS MYERS groans and sits up in the disordered bed. *
      Blinking. Tired. *

      Next to her is ADAM CARTER. He groans and throws a forearm *
      over his eyes. *

      Next to the alarm clock on the CRAPPY BEDSIDE TABLE is a *
      CHEAP JUG KETTLE, AN ALMOST EMPTY JAR OF INSTANT COFFEE, a *
      DIRTY SPOON, a SQUASHED CARTON OF MILK. *

    As ROS GETS UP, Adam LEANS OVER and turns on the kettle. *

    Ros and Adam, sitting on the edge of the bed. *

      Tired and barefoot, Adam is buttoning his shirt. His jacket *
    and shoes in a pile on the floor - hastily removed. *

      Dressed, Ros attempts to pour milk into her mug. No milk. *
      It s empty. She sips black coffee.*

      Frowning, Adam begins to pat himself down. He s lost *

    She throws them to him. He catches them. She smiles.*

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    Minister, this  Regional charter 
                    for Stability...  The new PM has 
                    talked of a turning point in 
                    British relations with the Muslim 
                    world, which has naturally been 
                    greeted with positive noises in the 
                    Middle East... But with all the 
                    hostile rhetoric and flash points 
                    of recent months, one has to ask if 
                    a lasting peace with Iran is just 
                    fantasy?

                                  HOME SECRETARY
                    We believe it isn t. The Prime 
                    Minister set out his stall when he 
                    began a direct dialogue with the 
                    Iranian government, something that 
                    no western politician has dared 
                    attempt in recent years. We are 
                    entering a new era. We have a 
                    relationship based on firm 
                      foundations - one, we believe, that 
                    will prove the cynics wrong... 

                                    INTERVIEWER
                    By  the cynics,  I assume you mean 
                    the insurgents determined to upset 
                    the process - do you believe these 
                    rogue elements can be contained?

                    - and that sonly because we re 
                    cancelling an engagement.

      Adam feigns disappointment.


      Malcolm and Jo. On SCREEN. One of the bodyguards is LEAVING

      Unnoticed by Ana, Adam s eyes DART to the door. He selects a

      Adam s betraying no anxiety. Unhurried, he flicks through the

    He gives her the book. She examines it.

      Adam smiles. Relaxed. Takes the book. 

    He turns to the COUNTER - 

      - just as the BODYGUARD enters, and approaches Ana.

      Adam hands the book to the BEARDED BOOKSELLER. His BACK TO 
    THE ROOM now.

                    I said I d be right out.

    The Bodyguard is large, menacing. But deferential. He hands 
    Ana the PURSE. She makes a comical face. Typical me. 

                                  ANA (CONT D)
                    Ah, yes. Thank you.

    The bodyguard sweeps the shop with his eyes. Sees nothing. 
      Just a man paying for a book. He exits. 

      And, as he does, Adam turns away from the counter. 

    His twinkling eyes lock with Ana s. Hers serious now.

                                  ANA (CONT D)
                    We were very lucky.

                    No such thing.

    He gives her the book, smiling.

    She takes it. INSIDE he has slipped a piece of paper. On it 
    is scribbled TUESDAY, 8.30?? PETER. X 

    Ana scrunches up the paper, destroys the evidence. But 
      smiles.

      And, unseen by Ana, Adam glances up at the CCTV CAMERA. And 
      very briefly, he GRINS.

                                  HOME SECRETARY
                    How possible?

                                  HARRY
                    The intelligence was secured as 
                    part of a foreign infiltration. 
                    Which means it can t be subject to 
                      independent corroboration. It s in 
                    the nature of these things; you can 
                    never be entirely sure.

                                  HOME SECRETARY
                    Harry, the Prime Minister s barely 
                    warmed his chair yet -- but he s 
                    made it abundantly clear that he s 
                    the Peacemaker, the waver of olive 
                    branches. If this lunatic s a 
                    threat to all that, why hasn t 
                    Tehran already stamped on him?

                                  HARRY
                    He s protected. Operation Green 
                    Leaf has revealed the division 
                    inside the Iranian secret services. 
                    The reactionary element, the die-
                    hards, are opposed to appeasement. 

                                  HOME SECRETARY
                    Whatever his personal motivations, 
                    Asnik s still an agent of the 
                    Iranian state. If he attacks 
                    London, it means Iran sattacked 
                    London -- and up in smoke and 
                    shrapnel go our hopes for peace in 
                    the region. And that s before we

                    step onto British soil -- let alone 
                    unleash his carnage here. Are we 
                    clear? If your man in Tehran 
                    corroborates Asnik s movements, 
                    deal with it. Over there.

                    Look. Zaf. I know it was a 
                    difficult call. But the point of 
                    this operation was to fabricate an 
                    inside job. Make it look like 
                    Iranian spies killing Iranian 
                    spies. But you warned that entire 
                    office what was coming. If that 
                    gets back to the wrong people, this 
                    entire operation s blown. And the 
                    consequences of that...if the 
                    Iranians discover what we ve 
                    done...

    The moment BROKEN by SUDDEN ACTIVITY ON A SECURITY MONITOR. 

      Adam TURNS TO IT.

    THE GUARDS have their WEAPONS RAISED. They re SHOUTINGat 
      Asnik. 

      Adam and Zaf are already RUNNING from the room.


      Adam and Zaf enter, running. 

      Asnik is lacing fingers behind his head. Getting to his 
      knees. Then lying face-down.

                                  ASNIK
                          (shouting)
                    I m unarmed! I m unarmed!

    The soldiers, holding him at gunpoint. 

      Adam approaches. Slowly. Asnik turns his head. Looks up at 
      Adam.

                                  ASNIK (CONT D)
                    My name is Mehan Asnik. I m here to 
                    defect. 


      Adam and Asnik, seated across the table.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, it s nice to see you looking 
                    so healthy. So what are you doing 
                    here, Mehan?

                                  ASNIK
                    Like I said. Defecting.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, last we heard, you were on 
                    your way to London to plant a bomb. 
                    So you ll forgive me if I decline 
                    to pay your airfare. 

      Adam, standing now. As if to leave.

                                  ASNIK
                    I had no intention of leaving Iran. 

                                  ADAM
                    Oh, that s all right, then. Do you 
                    prefer a window or an aisle seat?

                                  ASNIK
                    Your intelligence is gravely in 
                    error. Why would I detonate a bomb 
                    in London?

                    Your country and mine, we actually 
                    seem to be getting somewhere. Why

                                  ADAM
                    Because peace doesn t interest men 
                    like you?

                                  ASNIK
                    Men like us, you mean? If so, know 
                    yourself for a liar. Because men 
                    like us, you know what we are. 
                    We re peacemakers. We fight little

      Long beat. Adam considering.

                    I m a traitor. A double agent. A 
                    little mole. I ve been leaking

                    Copenhagen instructed me to be on

                    was a bomb on it.

                                  ASNIK
                    No. My death was to be entirely 
                      incidental.

                                  ADAM

                    I don t think Asnik had any 
                    intention of attacking London. 
                    Somebody used us to take him out. 


      Harry on the phone.

                    Why?

      Intercut Adam and Harry.

                    I don t know. But if Asnik s

                    second that Asnik s not lying. That 
                    means Copenhagen was able to 
                    manipulate MI5into doing his dirty 
                    work. Which means we urgently need

    The cars on a WOODED LANE, now. The road curving, enclosed by 
      TREES. 

      Suddenly -- A LOUD, MUFFLED NOISE:

      WHUMPF!

    And the DRIVER LOSES CONTROL as they head up an incline. The 
    car seems to DIE beneath them and rolls backwards. They come 
    to a halt on the flat road. 

    He tries THE IGNITION. Nothing.

      Adam checks his phone. His watch. Nothing. 

    He flips open the glovebox. THREE HANDGUNS inside. Hands one 
    to each of the AGENTS. Keeps one for himself.

      aiming into the TREES. 

    And Adam, barrelling down the road in the direction they came 
      from.

    All around him, the shifting, hissing trees. 

      Until he sees ZAF S CAR, approaching. 

      Adam waving his arms. Flagging it to a halt. 

    It screeches to a halt. Adam gets in.

                    looking at Bio-weapons. Who 
                    supplied the only known bio-weapon 
                    in the area? We did. Run down the 
                    checklist. Chances are this is our 
                    baby.

                    Far as we re aware, we picked up 
                    every last cubic ounce of E-34. So, 
                    chances are, the Iraqis managed to 
                    culture the strain, and if they did 
                      that...chances are, they also

    And the engine DIES. The driver struggling to bring the car 
    to a safe halt. 

    It rolls to a stop. 

      Leaving them inside.

                    Armour plating s no good against a

                    Yeah, thanks for that, Mehan. 

      Scanning the trees.

                    We stay, we go. Neither option s

    He turns to the SECURITY GUARD in the front passenger seat; 
      JOHN.

                    Try to make it back to the others. 
                    Call this in, somehow.

    He nods to THE DRIVER - SCOTT.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Okay, spray and pray. Suppressing

      Scott nods. He and Adam prepare... 

      JOHN leaps out of the car, running, ZIGZAGGING..into the 
      trees, heading south. As he runs, ADAM and SCOTT FIREinto 
    the woods around him.

      Then they DUCK back into the vehicle.

      They wait.

      A long beat of TOTAL SILENCE...

      Then TWO DISTINCT SHOTS. Deep bass: a big gun.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)

                    back to the airport. 

      ZAF s hand goes to the handle. He takes a breath. Then KICKS 
      OPEN THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR. 

    He and ASNIK dive out --

    -- and scramble for the TREES. Heading NORTH.

    At the SAME MOMENT, Adam and Scott leave the car. They split

                    1975. But, if Iran is found to have

    She points to the screen. A VERY FAINT, PALE BLUR on the 
      figure s BELT -- under the skirts of the Ghillie suit, where 
      he s raised a leg to stamp on the phone. Malcolm goes in 
      closer.

                                  ROS (CONT D)
                    It s a grenade.

                    How close can you go? Centre on the 
                    firing pin.

    He zooms in VERY, VERYCLOSE. The screen just blurred, 
      PIXILLATEDBLOCKSnow; the METALLIC COLOUR of the firing pin 
    in EXTREME CLOSE-UP. A slightly darker smudge along the 
      centre.

                                  ROS (CONT D)
                    This here. Can you clean that up?

                                  MALCOLM
                    It ll take some time. 

                                  ROS
                    Not too much time. This could be 
                    the only link to these mercenaries. 
                    That means, it could be the only 
                    way we can get to Zaf -- and to 
                    Asnik, before he becomes a living 
                    weapon of mass destruction. 

      Adam s phone rings. He reaches for it. But realizes it s his 
    2nd phone.

    He takes a moment -- and changes his mood. He puts on 
       Peter s  personality. We see his rage and frustration drop 
      away. His voice softens.

                                  ADAM
                    Ana?


      Ana, distressed. On the phone.

                    God, I ve wanted to call. I saw the

                    Yes. It s safe.

                                  ANA
                    How do you think? To see Iran get 
                    so close. And then to see it thrown 
                    away again, by men of violence. 

                                  ADAM
                    So you think it could be true? Germ

                                  ANA
                    It hardly matters, does it. All 
                    that matters is; more people are 
                    dead. And just as the world is 
                    beginning to look at Iran with 
                    fresh eyes, she gives her enemies 
                    exactly what they want.

                    a busy old day at work -- but can 
                    we meet, later, maybe? You need to

                                  ADAM
                    Of course. But if you change your 
                    mind, give me a call.

    He hangs up. And he s Adam again. Aware of Ros  proximity.

                    The mood she s in, she ll tell me

                    The trouble is, she doesn t know
                    anything. It s crumbs from the 
                    table.

    She walks off. Adam following her with his eyes. Knowing 
      she s right.


    Ros enters.

                    brokered in Helsinki, via bogus 
                    companies in Delaware and Chicago. 
                    But the end user is this man.

    ON SCREEN: a man we ll come to know as NICK RONSON.

                                  MALCOLM (CONT D)
                    Nick Ronson. Owner of Strategic

      Adam and Harry enter. The Home Secretary waiting for them.

                                  HOME SECRETARY

                    Well that s something. Because if 
                    the world learns that we unleashed  
                    a bio-weapon in Tehran, the 
                    consequences will be catastrophic. 

    He turns to Adam.

                    My sole concern is the people of

      Harry interjects. Pacifying.

                    Home Secretary. Intelligence

                    listening hard, we can hear on what 
                    square they set their pieces. But 
                    we can never be sure that we

      NICK RONSONenters. Closes the door. KEYS in a LOCKING 
      SEQUENCE. Sets down his briefcase. Loosens his tie.

    He stops. Frowns. Sniffs. 

      Curious, he walks through into -

      Ronson starts to back away. Towards the DOOR.

                                  ROS
                    Which, I d imagine, is exactly the

                    You wouldn t blow an MI6 asset.

      Ros  look tells him otherwise.

                    All right. Wait. 

    He stoops. Pauses. Makes a gesture -- he s only going to pick 
    up his BRIEFCASE. Ros nods. 


      This is the mercenaries  MOBILE BASE OF OPERATIONS. There s 
      COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.Sheets pinned to the wall. And a FIELD 
      HOSPITAL UNIT.

      Inside are FOUR MERCENARIES. 

      They re out of the Gillie suits, but still in their assault 
    kit (they ll remain in SKI-MASKS throughout). STILL ARMED. 
      Guarding ZAF and Asnik. 

      Asnik is very, verySICK. Coughing. Hacking. Pale and 
      sweating. Feverish. Shivering. The CHIEF MERCENARYis 
      checking Asnik s brow. Then he checks his WATCH. 

      Zaf, watching. He s laid out flat. Gut-shot and bandaged. 
      Speaking to the ceiling. But he s being relaxed, charming. As 
    if there s nowhere else he d rather be.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0741

                    It s a weaponisedvirus. It mimics 
                    pneumonic plague. And it s going to 
                    kill you.

    The Chief takes a hasty, unconscious step away from Asnik. 

    Zaf notes this. 

                                  ZAF (CONT D)

    No answer.

                    I thought it might have slipped 
                    their mind. I d imagine the 
                    contract was to deliver Asnik 
                    alive, after the heat s off. In 
                    what -- three hours? Four? Do you 
                    really think that s going happen?

      They look at the sick man.

                                  ZAF (CONT D)
                    Because what I think is, all that 
                    running in the woods. The exertion. 
                    It s brought things on a bit.

      Ronson nods. Flips open the laptop. Hits the POWER switch. 

      He s about to press his INDEX FINGERTIP to An ISOMETRIC PAD 
      near the power-button. When we notice a RED SPOT seeming to 
      seek through the blue cigarette smoke - it settles on 
      Ronson s BACK and then...

      THWIP!

      Through the WINDOW. A single, PERFECT SNIPER S SHOT. Through 
    the back. Out through THE CHEST.   

      RONSON collapses.

    And ROS, diving for cover beneath the window-sill. The one 
      place in the room the SNIPER can t hit. Looking at Ronson s 
      LAPTOP. And his DEAD, TWITCHING HAND, next to it. She looks. 

      From computer. To dead hand. Computer. To dead hand.


      More tentatively, the CHIEF MERCENARYis once again examining 
      Asnik. 

                                  ZAF
                    He s dying. And by now, so are we.

                    Whoever hired you knowingly exposed 
                    you to this. They were killing you.

    He lets this sink in.

                                  ZAF (CONT D)
                    So hand him back to MI5. Set a 
                    price. Take their money. Live to 
                    spend it.
                          (Beat)
                    Pick your enemy. The people who 
                    exposed you to this-

      Both of them now, looking at Asnik.

                                  ZAF (CONT D)
                    Or MI5. And this infection. Your 
                    choice.

      Asnik is slick with sweat now. Mumbling. Drifting in and out 
    of consciousness.

    The Chief doesn t answer. Instead, he looks at his MEN. 

      Suddenly, Asnik is WRACKED by coughing. He coughs. And 
      coughs. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0743

      steps back. There s a glob of blood on his clothes.

    He brushes at it with his fingertips.

                    Okay. We can t get to the 
                      mercenaries directly -- so we need 
                    to get to the people who hired 
                    them. That could be Copenhagen. Or 
                    it could be the Iranians.

      I/E. LONDON SQUARE, BAKHSHI S CAR (TRAVELLING) - DAY 2 19:068989

      A BLACK MERCEDESturns onto the square. 

    In the REAR SEATSare ANA and DARIUSH. They re DRESSED FOR 
    THE THEATRE.

      Behind the Mercedes, a SECOND CAR pulls into view. There s a 
      BLUE LIGHT attached to the roof -- it s an UNMARKED POLICE 
      CAR. It pulls ALONGSIDE the Mercedes -- and sounds its SIREN, 
      flashes its lights. Signalling the Mercedes to pull over.

                                  ANA
                    What s going on?

    Her husband hushes her -- gently enough. Then, to his driver:

                                  BAKHSHI
                    Pull over.

      Both cars pull up. A beat. And from the  police car  emerge 
      ADAM and JO.

      They approach the Mercedes.

      Inside, Dariushis worried. What s going on? 

    On Ana; her sudden, sick horror as SHE RECOGNISES ADAM. 

      He s standing at the window now.

                                  ADAM
                    Mr Bakhshi, my name s Adam Carter. 
                    I m an officer of the British 
                    Security Services. Please open the 
                    door.

      Adam s eyes flick to Ana. 

    An agonized question in her eyes. He looks away. 

      Dariush swindow descends.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0746

      A beat. The door opens.

                                  BAKHSHI
                    Then get in. Say it. And get out of 
                    my sight.

    Jo and Adam get into the limo and sit, facing Dariushand 
      Ana. 

      Jo s eyes flick to Ana. Assess her. ANA looking like she s 
      been kicked in the stomach.

      Jo s eyes flick away, to Bakhshi.

                                  ADAM
                    I m asking you: for all our sakes, 
                    return our officer, alive. And 
                    return what was taken -- before you 
                    make a mistake that can never be 
                    undone.

      A moment. Is Bakhshicalculating? Confused? Both?

    For the BRIEFEST moment, Adam s eyes meet Ana s. 

    She glares a narrow, enragedACCUSATION. Adam s gaze remains 
      perfectly blank. 

    Ana looks away. Helpless. Angry. Humiliated. Hurt beyond 
      measure.

    Jo misses none of this.

      Adam fixes his gaze back on Dariush.

                                  BAKHSHI
                    Do you think the world is a

                    This is Iran. Iran doesn t respond 
                    well to invasion. Now leave.

      Burning EYE CONTACT between Adam and Bakhshi.

      Then Adam and Jo exit. 


        BAKHSHI.Trembling with rage. 

    Ana watching Adam s back. Nauseated with betrayal.

                    Problems? You forced your way into

                    still in play -- still out there, 
                    somewhere. 

      They look up -- as ROS enters. She s carrying RONSON S 
      BRIEFCASE.

                                  ROS
                    Sorry I m late.              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0749



      Asnik is VERY, VERYsick now. And the Chief Mercenary is 
      deeply anxious. 

                                  ZAF
                    It s incubating inside you, right 
                    now. In a few hours, you ll be 
                    delirious and coughing up lung 
                    tissue. And wishing to God you d 
                    listened to me. The only way to 
                    survive this thing, is MI5.

                                  ASNIK
                    Do you have anything...? Please, 
                    you must have something - for the 
                    pain!

    And now the Chief Mercenary SPEAKS, for the first time.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    I d still need my money.

                                  ZAF
                    You d get your money.


    Ros and Malcolm are in there. Malcolm is examining Ronson s 
      laptop. 

                                  ROS
                    The information we need to bring 
                    down those mercenaries is on here.

                    This is a biometric security 
                    matrix. Fingerprint recognition. If 
                    I log in without that fingerprint, 
                    it ll destroy the hard drive.

    Ros fishes in her pocket. And she produces theZIP-LOCK BAG 
    she took from the kitchen drawer. Inside, it s packed with 
    ICE she took from the freezer. Also, RONSON S INDEX FINGER.

                                  ROS
                    Which is why I brought this along.

    ON SCREEN: What looks like a WHITE ROOM. Actually the back of 
    the mercenaries  van. A SHEET pinned to the wall and a SHEET 
    for a floor. IN a stretcher-bed is MEHAN ASNIK. Semi-
      conscious, mouth smeared in BLOOD.

      Propped against the wall is ZAF. Bleeding. In GREAT PAIN. But 
      ALIVE. And reading from a PREPARED STATEMENT.

                    disease. Enough for ten men. Don t

                    You made the right choices out 
                    there.

      This comment sticks in Adam.

                                  ADAM
                    Is that what you really think?

      A slightly tense beat.

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    You sure I m not in too deep?

      A long, uncomfortable beat. Are Adam and Ros on the edge of

      A bare room, giving directly onto the alleyway. As Adam walks  
      through the door, he sees a bare outline of a man above him.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    You re carrying no listening

                                  ADAM
                    None.

    The CHIEF MERCENARY chucks the backpack to the SILENT 
      MERCENARY - who unzips and EMPTIES it. It contains a SMALL 
      METAL CASE. He opens it. Inside: TEN LARGE HYPODERMIC 
      SYRINGES.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    Now strip. Shoes first.

      Adam strips to his UNDERWEAR. The CHIEF MERCENARY passes a 
      SCANNER UP AND DOWN his BODY. 

      Meanwhile, from his own backpack, the SILENT MERCENARY 
      produces a FLASK. He unscrews the lid. Fills the mug. Passes 
    it to Adam.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY (CONT D)

                    go home.

      Adam takes the cup. Hesitates. DRAINSit. And almost 
      immediately, he VOMITS. Painfully and fully. 

    The Mercenaries watch, until he s finished. Then the SILENT 
      MERCENARY bends to POKE at the vomit with a BIRO, examining 
    it.

    The Silent Mercenary removes SOMETHING ELSE from his bag. 
      Hands it to Adam. It s PAPER OVERALLS, the kind decorators 
      wear, and a pair of COMBAT BOOTS.

    As Adam dresses, the SILENT MERCENARY empties the metal case 
    of the SYRINGES, transferring them to his own, now empty, 
      back-pack.

      Adam is led outside.

    The car is jostling slowly over UNEVEN GROUND. Then it STOPS.

                    Out.

      Adam scrambles out of the car. Hands still tied behind his 
      back. 

      They re in a warehouse, empty but for the mercenaries  truck 
    and the car. Adam s blindfold is taken off. POWERFUL ARC 
      LIGHTS FLOOD the ground in that harsh, blue-white light. 

    The SILENT MERCENARY steps forward. Using a small lock-knife, 
    he cuts Adam s hands free. Then he opens the bonnet of the 
      car, rips out some wires and melts back into the darkness.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0755

    The MERCENARIESstand there -- five of them, we think. It s 
      difficult to be sure. They re amorphous shadows, painfully 
      backlit. They form a semi-circle around Adam. 

    He can t focus on them. He blinks. Squints. He s 
      disorientated, unarmed. And surrounded. 

    He rubs at his wrists. Getting the circulation back. 

      From somewhere to one side:

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY (CONT D)
                    Hey!

                    Catch.

    He LOBS something, underarm. It comes sailing out of the 
      light. Adam flails, catches it -- a cell-phone. He stands 
      there with it in his hand.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY (CONT D)
                    I m going to give you the details 
                    of a bank account. Into this 
                    account, you ll instruct your boss 
                    to deposit the money. 

                                  ADAM
                    Not without proof of life. 

      A beat. Then the Chief nods.

      Sounds of a LORRY DOORbeing opened. 

    And ANOTHER MERCENARY steps forward. He s supporting ZAF. 
      Zaf s in a BAD WAY. But still alive. 

    Eye contact between Zaf and Adam. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Asnik?

    Zaf NODS.

      Adam faces the Chief Mercenary. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Give me the details.

                          (clicks fingers)
                    Please.

      Adam lobs back the phone...underarm. The Chief Mercenary 
      catches it. Passes it to a COLLEAGUE. Who quickly, 
      efficiently, disassembles the handset. And CRUNCHES the 
      components under his boot heel.

      A THIRD MERCENARY opens a laptop. 

    And we WAIT. A tense few moments. And watch a PROGRESS BARon 
    the THIRD MERCENARY S COMPUTER.

      Then the third mercenary NODS. 

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY (CONT D)
                    All right. Now.

                                  ADAM
                    No. 

      Three Mercenaries STEP FORWARD.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    We agreed thirty million for Asnik 
                    and my colleague. You ve got that. 
                    I want what we just paid for.

    The Chief nods to his men. 

    And A MERCENARY jabs the BUTT OF his ASSAULT RIFLEinto 
      ADAM S KIDNEYS. Adam collapses. Curled up. In agony.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    I don t care who you are. All I 
                    want - I want to control this 
                    virus. Stop it spreading.

                                  ZAF
                    I warned you... 

    And a Mercenary puts a GUN TO ZAF S HEAD. Zaf holds his 
      ground. Long eye contact. Neither man backing down -

    As Adam is HAULED TO HIS FEET. Hands cuffed in front of him. 
      Then Adam and Zaf are FROGMARCHED -



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0757

    And bundled into the truck.


      ASNIK milky-pale.  

      Adam and Zaf. Forced into a SITTING POSITION. Zaf wounded, 
      bleeding. Weak. 

      Adam. BOUND AT THE WRISTS. The Chief is squatting before him, 
      removing a SYRINGE from the case. 

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    Now, I want to believe this

                    Trouble is -- you know that, don t 
                    you? So what if I inject youwith 
                    it -- what would happen? You 
                    wouldn t die, would you? Or 
                    anything tricky like that? 

    And the Chief Mercenary JAMSthe syringe into Adam s CHEST. 

      Adam bites down on the pain. 

    As the SMARTDUSTin the FAKE VACCINEis ACTIVATED BY HIS 
      BODYHEAT.

    The Chief Mercenary, squatting over Adam.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    Still alive?

                                  ADAM
                    You re wasting my time. 

      But, even as Adam is speaking, the truck is slowing.... 
      Stopping. 

      Adam and Zaf exchange a terrified look. Scared they know what 
      this means.

    The truck has stopped now. And TWO MERCENARIES begin to 
      LOOSEN ASNIK S RESTRAINTS.

      They SLAP Asnik awake. He opens his eyes. He s feverish. No 
      idea where he is. Begins to MUMBLE in Farsi.

    The Mercenaries lift him to his feet. Haul him towards the 
      door.

    And Adam leaps to his feet.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Don t! He ll infect everyone he 
                    passes! We ll never control it! 
                    You ll be murdering thousands!

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    I'd rather have MI5 out there 
                    looking for him, than looking for 
                    me. 

                                  ADAM
                    Don t do this! 

    The Chief, suddenly with his HANDGUN to Adam s head. 

    As the TRUCK DOORS are THROWN OPEN.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Don t do it!  

      Adam s POV: Outside, it s MORNING. And they re PARKED on a 
      QUIET LONDON STREET. Like a window on ANOTHER WORLD.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    He needs TO BE quarantined. Now. 
                    RIGHTNOW!

    The Chief HEADBUTTS Adam. 

      Adam falls BACK, into the wall of the truck. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    PLEASE!

    AS ASNIK is thrown onto the QUIET STREET. 

    And the DOORS are CLOSED.               SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0759



      Adam, still shocked by the headbutt.

    Zaf watches him. Adam meets his gaze. 

    Zaf seems to make a decision. And struggles to his feet. He 
      stands. Confronts the Chief Mercenary. Gets up in his face.

                                  ZAF 
                    I warned you not to make us your 
                    enemy. 

    The Chief PUNCHES Zaf in the guts. The gunshot wound.

    Zaf falls, in agony. 

    And now, enraged, Adam stands, to intervene...

    And IMMEDIATELY, FOUR ASSAULT RIFLES are pointed at him. He 
      backs up. Holding up his hands. 

    For THAT ONE MOMENT, Adam has monopolisedtheir attention.

      Which is the moment Zaf has been waiting for! He GRABS at the 
      GRENADEwhich hangs from the Chief Mercenary s belt.

    The FOUR ASSUALTRIFLES on Zaf, now -- as he scrambles 
      backwards. His HAND on the firing lever. 

      Towards the VACCINE. 

                                  ZAF (CONT D)
                    You shoot me and my hand will spasm 
                    on the firing mechanism. The 
                    grenade will go up and take you 
                    with it. Vaccine and all.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0760

                    Zaf...

                                  ZAF
                    It s all right, mate.

      Zaf s made his way back to the corner now. With his free 
      hand, he lifts the vaccine container. Sets it on his lap. 
      Then holds the grenade, in two hands, above it. Tension on 
    the firing lever. 

    The guns still on him. Zaf stops smiling for a second. Faces 
    the Chief.

                                  ZAF (CONT D)
                          (to the Chief)
                    Don t think I ll hesitate.

    The Chief and Zaf lock eyes. And -- knowing Zaf won t back 
      down -- the Chief gestures. The Mercenaries lower their 
      weapons.

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    So. What now? 

      A moment between Zaf and Adam. Adam knowing. Shaking his 
      head, once. No. No way.

    And Zaf. A tiny smile. Yes.

                                  ZAF
                          (to the chief)
                    You let him go. 

      A beat. 

      Then the CHIEF MERCENARY, into his WALKIETALKIE. 

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY
                    Pull over.

    And the truck pulls to the side of the road. Stops.

    TWO MERCENARIES throw open the REAR DOORS. 

                                  CHIEF MERCENARY (CONT D)
                          (to Adam)
                    You heard him. Go.

                                  ZAF
                    No choice. We need Asnik off the 
                    streets and quarantined -- before 
                    it s too late. 

      Adam, wrestling with it. To stay, in a hopeless situation. Or 
      fulfil his mission. Saving thousands. 

                                  ZAF (CONT D)
                    Get Asnik. Go. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0760A

      Adam, turning now to face the Chief Mercenary.

                                  ADAM
                    He lives -- or I come for you. We 
                    all come for you. Do you understand 
                    me?

      Fierce eye contact. The Chief Mercenary steps forward and, 
      with a knife, cuts Adam s wrist straps.

      A gun to Adam s head, now -- as he s forced backwards to the 
      door. Never breaking eye contact with Zaf. 

                                  ZAF
                    I ll catch you later.

                                  ADAM
                    My round, yeah?

      They laugh. Knowing this for a lie. And then the smiles fall.

                                  ZAF
                    Go, mate.

    And Adam is hustled out of the truck...

    And we see this image of Asnik on a CCTV monitor. As we pull 
    out we see Adam on another screen - a different location to 
      Asnik. And then we pull out further to see other monitors 
      showing images of OTHER PEOPLE. Each a different image of the 
      oblivious, imminently-infected. There are banks of monitors, 
      hundreds of people - out there.
