      We re looking at a car parked at a meter.  The distance and 
      the BLUR OF PASSING TRAFFIC keeps us from being able to see 
      inside.

      As we PUSH IN CLOSER on the car, we can make out Winona, 
      sitting frozen in the driver s seat.  As we get even CLOSER, 
      we see she s staring down at something in her lap as though 
      hypnotized.   


      We now see that the thing she s staring at is an old-style 
      $100 bill, clearly one of the bills she just found in the 
      evidence cage.

      As we watch, Winona appears to snap out of her trance.  She 
      tosses the bill on the seat beside her, starts the car...  
      but then, instead of putting the car in gear and pulling out 
      into traffic, she turns it off again.  

      She yanks the keys out of the ignition, grabs the bill from 
      the seat, shoves the door open, slides out.


      Out of sight of the front of the bank, Raylan pulls up in his 
      car, gets out.  Without drawing his gun, he starts to slowly 
      approach the bank, eyeing the blind spots and all the parked 
      cars in case the bank robbers have a look-out outside.  He 
      looks through the bank window -- the distance and the angle 
      make it impossible for him to see the whole room, but he sees 
      enough CUSTOMERS standing in line or filling out deposit 
      slips to know there s no robbery in progress.

      In his peripheral vision, he sees another car pull up next to 
      his, sees TWO FBI AGENTS -- DAVI (40s) and BURNES (30s) -- 
      get out.  He goes to meet them. 

                                  DAVI
                          (to Raylan, quietly)
                    You re Givens?
                          (off his nod)
                      Special-Agent Davi, Special-Agent 
                    Burnes, FBI.

      They shake hands.  Davi looks at the bank.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (re: bank)
                    I took a look.  Couldn t get a 
                    visual on the whole room.  Patrons 
                    I could see looked calm, though. 

                                  BURNES
                    Maybe the call s bogus.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Last job, they waited in line for a 
                    while, cased the place first. 

                                  DAVI
                    So basically, someone needs to go 
                    in there, casual, take a look.

                                  RAYLAN
                    The old man s our fugitive.  I ll 
                    go in.

      Burnes and Davi share a look.

                                  BURNES
                      I understand your ex-wife was in 
                    the bank this morning, one of these 
                    guys tuned her up.

                                  DAVI
                    Maybe one of us should go.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Look, last few hours all I ve been 
                    doing is watching the security tape 
                    over and over.  If they re in 
                    there, I ll spot them soon s I step 
                    through the door.  You sure you can 
                    do that, make them before they make 
                    you?  
                          (off their silence)
                     Cause if you don t it s  Dog Day 
                      Afternoon. 

      The FBI men look at each other for a long moment.  Then--

                                  DAVI
                    We ll cover the perimeter, case 
                    they have back-up.

      Off Raylan--


      Frank stops his car at the edge of the runway.  He gets out, 
      oxygen bottle in one hand, duffel bag full of cash in the 
      other, starts painstakingly making his way toward a Cessna 
      parked next to a maintenance shed, maybe a hundred feet in 
      front of him.  He s about three-quarters of the way there 
      when he has to stop to catch his breath.  He takes a couple 
      deep inhales, starts walking again, stops again when he sees--

      ART step out from behind the maintenance shed.  He has a gun 
      in his hand but doesn t aim it, lets it hang by his side.

                                  FRANK
                    Guess you didn t believe I was 
                    giving myself up.

                                  ART
                    No one did.  But I also didn t 
                    believe that blaze-of-glory 
                    bullshit.  Then I found all those 
                    flight simulators on your computer, 
                      remembered you used to own a plane 
                    back when, figured you might be 
                    getting re-familiarized. 

                                  FRANK
                    Guess I would ve been better off 
                    with the young hotshot.

                                  ART
                    Guess so.

      Frank s hand wanders toward the gun in his waistband.  Art 
      notices--

                                  ART (CONT D)
                      I wouldn t,  less you re changing 
                    your mind about the blaze of glory.  
                    I used to teach firearms at Glynco.

                                  FRANK
                    That why you came here all by your 
                    lonesome  cause you wanted to give 
                    me the chance to  High Noon  it?

                                  ART
                    I came here by my lonesome,  cause 
                    the whole office is out trying to 
                    deal with Bobby Green and his 
                    friend with the bomb vest.  Isn t 
                    that why you sent them in there in 
                    the first place, dimed them to us?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    44.

      Frank nods.  His hand stops moving.  He glances over his 
      shoulder at the car. 

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Reasoner, my knees can t handle a 
                    foot chase -- you try to run, I m 
                    putting a bullet in that tank.  You 
                    remember the end of  Jaws ?

      Frank yanks the cannula out of his nose.

                                  FRANK
                      I remember.

      He drops the oxygen tank and makes a run for his car.

                                  ART
                    Aw, damn it!

      He starts hobbling after Frank.

      By the time Frank reaches his car, he s so winded and weak he 
      doesn t even have the strength to open the door.  He sits 
      down against the door, coughs blood, struggles to get his 
      breath.

      After what seems like a long time, Art catches up.  He s 
      brought Frank s oxygen tank with him.  He reaches down, takes 
      Frank s gun out of his waistband, then hands him the tank.

      Frank nods his thanks, puts the cannula back in his nose, 
      takes several deep breaths.

                                  FRANK
                    You try glucosamine supplements for 
                    those knees, Chief?

                                  ART
                    For a while.  Doctor made me stop.  
                    Worried it d give me diabetes.

                                  FRANK
                    And then you get side effects from 
                    treating the side effects -- no 
                    free rides in nature.

      Art agrees, but doesn t answer.

                                  ART
                    This was the plan from the jump, 
                    huh -- steal some cash, then dump 
                    your partners and fly off somewhere
