A disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket
frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of
indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.
He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial
mansion of Pointe du Lac.
He comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he
dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate
one in Greek Style.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I had just lost my wife in
childbirth. She and the infant had
been buried less than half a year.
There is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with
a tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the
angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:
"DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791
INFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791"
Louis rips away the vines already covering the
inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face
is ashen.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I was twenty-four and life seemed
finished. I couldn't bear the pain
of their loss. I longed for a
release from it.
Loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians.
Louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking
from a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.
LOUIS
My invitation was open to anyone.
Sailors, thieves, whores and
slaves...
Louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a
wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The
pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to
slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He
turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him
into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the
whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her
mouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the
ground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his
face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,
off.
LOUIS (V.O.)
But it was a vampire that accepted.
IN THE WATER
The bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on
the wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He
turns, to see Lestat, towering above him.
LESTAT
They would have killed you -
LOUIS
Then my luck would have changed.
LESTAT
You want death? Is it death you
want?
LOUIS
Yes...
Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the
air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his
teeth in his neck.
ON LOUIS' FACE
Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is
drained from him.
ON THEIR FEET
Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.
THE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and
rigging of the boats around the wharf.
LESTAT
Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his
blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging
from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws
his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.
LESTAT
You still want death? Or have you
tasted it enough?
Louis can barely get the words out.
LOUIS
Enough...
Lestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets
into the water below.
LOUIS' FACE
Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the
wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside
him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him,
dangling from the rope of the shipmast.
Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,
the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the
mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.
LOUIS (V.O.)
He left me half dead that morning.
he wanted something from me. He
came back the following night.
The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis'
wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow,
as if seen through some unearthly eye.
LESTAT
Vampires, that's what we are.
Creatures of darkness, only we see
it that darkness more clearly than
any mortal has ever seen...
Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the
overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and
child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and
child.
LESTAT
Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain
goodbye? To wave away anguish and
grief? To embrace the peace of the
unending night?
The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The
angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife,
Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear-
streamed face. The child speaks.
MARBLE CHILD
Papa...
Louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself
touching cold marble. He cries out in anguish-
LOUIS
Diane!!!!
LESTAT
They are gone, Louis. Death took
them. Death which you can now
destroy...
LOUIS
NO!!!!!
Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters,
huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound
of whipping is heard.
LESTAT
Your grief has unhinged you. You've
let your estate rot.
In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is
whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.
LESTAT
You let your overseer run riot,
work your slaves to the bone. We'll
start with him.
LOUIS
How do you mean, start?
LESTAT
Call him.
Louis calls.
LOUIS
Carlos!!!
The overseer turns and comes towards them, with the
bloodied whip.
LESTAT
Why the bloody whip, Carlos?
The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror,
drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him
in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis
runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to
Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.
LESTAT
Let's call that a start.
LOUIS
I can't do it.
LESTAT
You've just done it -
LOUIS
Kill me if you will, but I can't do
this...
He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer.
Louis running up the steps leading to the gallery. He
is crazed with guilt. He looks up and sees -
LESTAT
Sitting collected at the head of the steps.
LOUIS
Backs away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so
fluidly he hardly seems to move.
LESTAT
Don't worry. He was white trash,
they come at two a penny. I dumped
him in the swamp and untied the
slave, licked his wounds clean.
LOUIS
You're the devil, aren't you?
That's who you are.
LESTAT
(gently)
I wish I were. But if I were, what
would I want with you?
LOUIS
I can't go through with it, I tell
you.
LESTAT
Your perfect. Your bitter and
you're strong.
LOUIS
But why do you want me?
LESTAT
Because you're as strong as I was
when I was alive.
Louis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he
turns and heads for a nearby swamp.
Louis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from
the flask, leans his forehead against the stone.
Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.
LESTAT
You really want to be with them?
LOUIS
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you
promised -
LESTAT
You asked for death. I didn't
promise it -
In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the
marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist
shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body
of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable
as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair,
flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over
it.
Louis gasps.
LESTAT
It's not your wife and child my
friend. It's death. Just that
simple. Think and choose. It
happens to everyone. Except us.
Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy
dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is
spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the
stones.
Lestat appears angelic in his radiance.
LESTAT
We shall be this way always, my
friend. Young as we are now. I'm
lonely for a companion, lonely for
your strength. But I'm not that
lonely. Do you want to come or not?
Louis capitulates in one long sigh.
LOUIS
Yes...
Lestat comes closer, smiling.
LESTAT
Did I hear a yes?
LOUIS
Yes...
Lestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks
his blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming
together. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as
his blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing
their focus.
LOUIS' POV
The moon, through hanging vines. The marble statue of
his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her
hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the
child's fingers reach out...
BACK TO SCENE
Lestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt.
Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above
him. radiant. Lestat speaks gently.
LESTAT
I've drained you to the point of
death. If you drink from me you
live for ever. If I leave you here
you die.
Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a
kiss.
LOUIS
No. Don't leave me here. Give it to
me.
Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs
slash his own flesh, blood falls.
LESTAT
You're sure?
LOUIS
Sure...
Louis rises to accept the first drops with his open
mouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand
on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.
The VAMPIRE THEME swells.
Lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement.
Louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.
LOUIS' POV
Vampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp,
the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all
come to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with
pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear
beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes
the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground,
astonished at the ease of it.
He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with
vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his
buttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is
clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and
color.
LESTAT
Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't
I tell you it was going to be fun?
Lestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished
Louis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is
suddenly racked by shudders of pain.
LESTAT
You're body's dying. Pay no
attention. It will take twenty
minutes at most.
LOUIS
Dying?
Louis dry-retches.
LESTAT
It happens to us all.
Lestat wipes Louis' brow.
LESTAT
Come, you're going to feed now.
LOUIS
I want a woman.
Lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in
Louis' ears.
LESTAT
That doesn't matter anymore, Louis.
You'll see. Come...
LOUIS' VAMPIRE POV - SWAMP
Small high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several
share a bottle of rum around the fire. A male slave
rises. A gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and
goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.
LESTAT
They're all beautiful now. Men,
women, the old, the young...simply
because they are alive. -
The slave walks towards them in the darkness. A
crucifix gleams round his neck.
LESTAT
Take him.
LOUIS
The crucifix -
LESTAT
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
Louis hesitates.
LESTAT
Resist no more Louis. Feed...
The slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white
beings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he
runs.
Louis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a
vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and
sinks his teeth in his neck.
Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent
body shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands
above, laughing.
The slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly,
engorged with blood.
LOUIS
What have I done?
LESTAT
You have fed. You were made for
this...
Louis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's
laughter echoes around him.
LOUIS
Dear God, what have I done?
LESTAT
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed
it.
Lestat laughs harder. Louis runs from him, screaming in
anguish.
Louis reaches his wife's grave. He falls to his knees,
throws back his head and bares his new fangs to the
moon.
LOUIS
Dear God, what have I become????
Louis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now
like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl
stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of
harpsichord music come from the interior.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Killing is no ordinary act. It is
the experience of another's life
for certain. That night I had lost
my own life and taken another's. I
was drowning in a sea of human
guilt and regret, with all the
heightened senses of a vampire...
Louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord
music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he
approaches.
Dawn spreading over the plantation.
A big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.
Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude
commedia dell'arte on the stage.
Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs
watch the show as tavern wenches move about.
LOUIS (V.O.)
This was New Orleans, a magical and
magnificent place to live. In which
a vampire, richly dressed might
attract no more notice in the
evening than hundreds of other
exotic creatures.
Louis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree.
Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring
drinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to
Lestat's lips as he flirts with her.
TERESA
Come on, mon cher. The best in the
colony. Once you touch this you'll
never go to any other tavern again.
LESTAT
You think so, cherie? But what if
I'd rather taste your lips?
TERESA
My lips are even sweeter still...
She kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then
runs it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then
he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking
playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and
fascinated.
ANTICS ON THE STAGE
Laughter rocks the tavern.
Lestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair
beside him and folds her hands on the table. No one
notices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches
Louis' knee.
LESTAT
Let's get out of here!
Lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.
A crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the
tavern. Louis looks up at the moon.
LOUIS
Have you ever been caught?
LESTAT
Of course not. It's so easy you
almost feel sorry for them.
They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies
in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Lestat killed two, sometimes three
a night. A fresh young girl, that
was his favorite for the first of
the evening.
Lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He
looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a
delicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet
spills from the french windows.
WIDOW ST. CLAIR
Now, young man, you really amaze
me! I'm old enough to be your
grandmother.
She leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed
with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He
allows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms,
gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She
swoons.
WIDOW ST. CLAIR
Yes, that's the melody, I remember
it. Oh yes...
Louis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but
still alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He
shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.
Lestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A
scream pierces the night.
WIDOW ST CLAIR
Murder!!! Murderer!!
The widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her.
Louis is trying to quiet her.
WIDOW ST CLAIR
My little papillions! My
butterflies!!! He killed them!!!
Lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth
and breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis.
LESTAT
You whining coward of a vampire who
prowls the night killing rats and
poodles. You could have finished us
both!
Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary
force, pummeling him towards the trees.
LOUIS
What have you done to me? You've
condemned me to hell.
LESTAT
I don't know any hell -
Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength
he never knew he had.
LOUIS
You want to see me kill? Watch me
kill you then -
He drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat
looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.
LESTAT
What strength, my friend, what
strength. I remember why I chose
you now.
Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.
LESTAT
But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I
you.
He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.
LESTAT
Feed on what you want, mon cherie.
Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll
leave you to it and watch you come
round. Just remember, life without
me would be even more unbearable...
He smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.
Their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first
fingers of light spread across the sky.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Being a vampire to him meant
revenge. Revenge against life-
itself. Every time he took a life
it was revenge. and the slaves with
a wisdom that was denied their
masters, began to notice...
The woman's scream pierces the sky, as Lestat walks
into the night.
Every chicken is dead, bloodies necks hanging down from
the cribs. Louis emerges from the entrance, blood on
his lips. He hears the scream.
The sound of drumming is heard, African, primal. The
woman runs through the quarters, screaming grief.
Others gather at doorways, restrain and console her.
A beautiful, elaborate eighteenth century dove-cote.
Every dove inside is dead, pierced at the neck. A black
hand throws in a flaming torch and it bursts into
flame.
Bodies of slaves floating in the swamp, with the bodies
of goats. Slaves at the edge throw ropes around the
bodies, pull them towards the shore. The drumming grows
louder.
Louis walking through. The slaves hush as he
approaches, gather in doorways and whisper. He turns
and looks at them, sorrowfully. He looks truly like a
ghost. Their eyes turn away when they meet his. He
walks on.
The slaves, gathered on mass around fires. Frenzied
drumming, dancing. Lestat rides through, scattering the
flames. The drumming stops. The slaves look towards the
house. Slowly, they begin to move towards it.
Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins.
The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion
steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of
Yvette. He is deranged with grief.
LOUIS
This place is cursed. Damned, do
you hear me? And your master is the
devil.
He places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the
veranda.
LOUIS
Get out while you can. You're free
men.
They don't move. They stare at him blankly.
LOUIS
Unlike me, you are no free men...
He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all
candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.
LOUIS
Do I have to convince you?
He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and
sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window,
lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.
SLAVES POV - MASTER
Setting fire to the house.
They rush up the stairs with shouts of "STOP HIM, HE'S
MAD". A wall of flame gushes out from the interior,
blocking their way.
With many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over
Lestat's shoulder.
From the sea, at evening, shrouded in mist.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Lestat I did not love. And he
survived.
A rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another.
Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind,
walking down the street, gripping one, then another.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Am I damned? Am I from the devil?
Is my very nature that of a devil?
And all the while, as these dreaded
questions caused me to neglect my
thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my
veins were threads of pain in my
flesh, my temples throbbed.
A smaller side street, in which every house is marked
with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis
is following them. A man passes with a lantern.
MAN
Don't go that way Monsieur. It's
the plague. Go back the way you
came.
Louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to
himself.
LOUIS
The way I came...
He walks on, following the rats.
LOUIS (V.O.)
... and finally, when I could stand
it no longer, I stood in an empty
desolate street and heard the sound
of a child crying.
A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The
sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it.
Louis running through an assortment of streets. All the
night life of New Orleans flows by him.
LOUIS (V.O.)
For years I had not savored a
human. And when I had Lestat's
words made sense to me. I knew
peace only when I killed and when I
heard her heart in that terrible
rhythm I knew again what peace
could be. Yet even then I could not
contenance it...
Fingers of light in the sky. Louis, pale and shivering,
walks splashing through the water. He comes to a huge
sewer-pipe, crowded with rats. He crawls inside.
The same sewer-pipe. Now the bodies of dead rats lie
all around. A pair of fine leather boots splash through
the water - Lestat's.
Two husky movers bring in furniture through the back
courtyard, past the fountain and the banana trees, up
the back stairs and into -
The tinkling of Claudia's piano is heard, over -
A well-dressed lady, walking through a square lit by
gaslight. The lady hears a child's sobbing and stops,
turns.
POV
Claudia, the picture of lost innocence, sitting on a
bench and crying.
WOMAN
Why are you crying, child?
The woman, all solicitude, goes to Claudia.
WOMAN
Are you lost, my love?
CLAUDIA
Mama...
WOMAN
Hush now, don't cry, We'll find
her...
CLAUDIA
Mama...
The woman takes Claudia in her arms. Claudia nestles
her head in her shoulder, her teeth near her neck.
LOUIS (V.O.)
They found death fast in those
days, before she learnt to play
with the, to delay the moment till
she had taken what she wanted...
Claudia walking along, clutching the doll.
Claudia and Louis looking through the window at a
display of coffins. Claudia point at the smallest one.
LOUIS (V.O.)
She grew, yet stayed the same. She
wanted a bed of her own, yet would
climb back into mine.
Street lamps are oil at this period. Houses are now
tall two-story Spanish style. Streets are flagstone.
Passing carriages are black.
LOUIS (V.O.)
It was a very different life. And a
new century was beginning. what had
once been a small godforsaken
French colony was growing into a
great port, giving us an endless
train of magnificent strangers...
Claudia, Louis and Lestat, dressed in the same clothes
walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows.
Crowd milling around, sailors, whores, children,
thieves, freed slaves, Indians. They pass a Wild West
display, jugglers, fire-eaters, three-card
tricksters...
LOUIS (V.O.)
All human life was here, for the
taking. And we took, all three of
us, in our different ways...
They come to a raised platform where a troupe of
perfectly-formed midgets do a burlesque show.
Claudia stops. She stares, at these small, perfect
creatures like herself, intrigued and troubled.
Louis and Lestat walk on, not noticing as -
CLAUDIA
Circles the troupe. She comes to a small tent, behind
it. At the entrance stands a midget youth.
YOUTH
You want to come inside, lovely?
Claudia walks up to him.
YOUTH
Ever been kissed?
Claudia shakes her head. He kisses her. Claudia allow
her to be kissed, then bites his tongue. he youth
struggles, as Claudia holds him and drains him. She
lets him go as Louis appears behind her.
CLAUDIA
She's like me, Louis. Small and yet
not small at all. Like me.
Louis hurriedly draws her away.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I watched her grow yet stay the
same, her doll-like face possessed
of adult eyes, eerie, powerful,
seductive...
Louis walking, holding Claudia as if he was about to
lose her.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Though everything was changed,
through the years had warped the
contours of the streets, I found my
way there, aware that I'd always
known where it was and avoided it,
not wanting to pass the doorway
where I'd first heard Claudia cry.
Louis back in the same street, outside the same house.
He stands with Claudia at the window. There is a family
inside, a picture of domestic tranquility.
LOUIS
I heard you crying. You were there
in a room with your mother. You
were hugging her for warmth, crying
pitifully as you had been for days.
Because your mother was dead...
Claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert.
LOUIS
I opened the shutters... I came
into the room... I felt pity for
you. Pity, but something else.
He can't go on. Claudia's eyes are remorseless.
CLAUDIA
You... fed on me?
LOUIS
And he found me with you. I ran,
sickened at what I'd done. Then he
cut his wrist and fed you from him.
I tried to stop him, but you were a
vampire then. And have been every
night hereafter.
CLAUDIA
You both did it?
LOUIS
I took your life. He gave you
another one.
Claudia speaks through indrawn breath.
CLAUDIA
And here it is. And I hate you
both.
She runs.
Louis, walking the streets, shivering.
LOUIS
I walked all night. I walked as I
walked years before when my mind
swam with guilt at the thought of
killing. I found myself at the
Cathedral.
A cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open.
LOUIS
I thought of all the things I had
done and couldn't undo. And I
longed for one second's peace...
Louis walks towards the doors, inside.
A sailing ship, by the docks. Louis and Claudia talking
to a shipping-clerk.
LOUIS (V.O.)
So we made plans. She was convinced
there were others of our kind in
Europe, that they would have the
answers Lestat couldn't provide.
Lestat whom she now hated, who she
thought she could be free of. I
doubted, but then she had a
surprise in store...
Louis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's
skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead
youths.
CLAUDIA
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our
own kind. Find the one who made
him. Learn what it means.
LOUIS
And suppose the one who made him
knows nothing and the vampire who
made him knows nothing, and it goes
back, nothing proceeding from
nothing, until there is nothing!
And we must live with the knowledge
that there is no knowledge.
The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere.
Overhanging creepers.
LOUIS
And if we find the one who made
him? Do we tell him we destroyed
his own creation? The vampire
Lestat?
Louis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them
into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the
water and the churning of alligators, as they attack
the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms.
He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed
towards it.
CLAUDIA
He belongs with those reptiles,
Louis. He deserved to die.
LOUIS
Then maybe so do we. Every night of
our lives. He was my brother. My
maker. He gave me this life,
whatever it is.
CLAUDIA
I did it for us, Louis. So we could
be free.
He stands there, saying nothing.
CLAUDIA
Louis, look at me.
LOUIS
(bitterly)
I can't. Go away from me.
Claudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis
stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement
of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't
heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia
sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the
first time in years. She is weeping copiously.
LOUIS
Claudia - You're crying -
We see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is
heartbroken, lost.
CLAUDIA
You never talked to me like that -
in all these years.
LOUIS
And you never cried -
CLAUDIA
I can't bear it when you do - I
would die rather than lose you
Louis. I would die the way he died.
Louis gathers her in his arms.
LOUIS
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
CLAUDIA
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I
did it for you -
Louis walks her towards the carriage.
LOUIS
I love you Claudia. Always. And we
are free now, Claudia. No Lestat.
Just the two of us, beginning the
great adventure of our lives.
He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving
the silent waters of the swamp.
Louis running, with Claudia in his arms. He looks back
at the flames of the house. Sound of a ship's horn.
CLAUDIA
The ship is sailing without us!
LOUIS
Not yet. Holding her tightly, Louis
runs.
Louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the
ship moves down the river. He sees...
CITY OF NEW ORLEANS
With flame lighting up the sky.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Though the fire seemed to spread
through the quartier, I stood on
that deck until dawn, fearful he
would come out again of the very
river like some monster to destroy
us both. And all the while I
thought, Lestat, we deserve your
vengeance. You gave me the dark
gift. And I delivered you into the
hands of death for the second time.
The ship, shrouded in mist.
LOUIS (V.O.)
Though the ship was blessedly free
of rats, a strange plague
nonetheless struck its passengers.
A body is slipped into the sea. A priest reads last
rites to a mourning family.
Passing through the Straits of Gibralter.
LOUIS (V.O.)
We reached the Mediterranean. I
wanted those waters to be blue.
They were black, nighttime waters
and how I suffered then, straining
to remember the color that a young
man's senses had taken for granted,
that my memory had let slip away
for eternity. It was black off the
coast of Italy, black off the coast
of Greece, Europe itself was black.
Claudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad,
sketching the bay of Naples. A beautifully realized
drawing, all in shades of grey and black. Louis
observes.
CLAUDIA
Louis, your quest is for darkness
only. This sea is not your sea.
They myths of men are not your
myths. Their history isn't yours.
The sketch changes to a sketch of -
THE ACROPOLIS
In the moonlight.
LOUIS (V.O.)
We saw the Acropolis by moonlight,
shades of grey and silver. And I
longed for the brilliant white of
those marbles in the hot sun of
Homer...
The sketch changes to a sketch of -
TRANSYLVANIA
And the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape.
LOUIS (V.O.)
We docked at Varna and searched the
rural countryside of the
Carpathians, for what she liked to
term "our kind"...
MONTAGE OF SKETCHES
A TRANSLYVANIAN VILLAGE, A GRAVEYARD.
RUINED CASTLE AFTER CASTLE, LOOKING INTO THE SKIES...
LOUIS
The quest for these Old World
vampires filled me with bitterness.
We searched village after village,
ruin after ruin and I was glad when
always we found nothing. For what
could the damned really have to say
to the damned?
Crowds and gaslight everywhere. Carriages, horses,
OPERA coming from the opera house.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I think the very name of Paris
brought a rush of pleasure to me
that was extraordinary. I was a
Creole, after all and Paris was the
mother of New Orleans, a universe
whole and entire unto herself...
The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in
pairs through the shadowy tulieries.
Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through
the glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there
seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
She peers deep into the shop and sees -
MADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting
a doll's face, oblivious to being watched.
Louis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father
and daughter. All around them are bourgeois Parisian
families on their evening stroll. Claudia points at the
children that pass.
CLAUDIA
Have I anything in common with her,
Louis?
She points to a beautiful French child walking by with
her mother.
CLAUDIA
Or her, or her - or any of them?
LOUIS
Claudia, you torture yourself.
CLAUDIA
They are ducklings, that will grow
into swans. Whereas I must be the
duckling forever.
LOUIS
You are more beautiful than any of
them.
We see Madeleine, inside, painting a doll's face. Louis
and Claudia arrive outside.
CLAUDIA
All her dolls resemble me.
POV
Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The
resemblance is uncanny.
CLAUDIA
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never
change either.
LOUIS
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop
this -
Madeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.
LOUIS
You know her?
CLAUDIA
Yes. Should I take her, Louis?
Among her dolls? make a doll of her
in turn?
LOUIS
Come, Claudia...
He takes her arm. But Claudia shakes him off, and moves
into the shop.
Louis walks briskly, head bowed.
LOUIS (V.O.)
For a time we had been almost
human, in the sensual whirl of what
Paris had to offer. But the human
delights of that city only served
to remind her of the ageless child
she had become. I felt her pain as
I walked until I become aware that
I was being followed.
CLOSEUP - LOUIS' FEET
Walking. A step echoes his.
Louis stops. Turns, sees nothing. Then walks again. The
echoing steps begin again.
Louis again. Sees a shadow, flitting.
LOUIS
Claudia!
Nothing. He walks again, hears the same effect. Then he
stops. He stares at a gaslamp opposite.
LOUIS (V.O.)
So it was when I had given up the
search for vampires that a vampire
found me...
Santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the
gaslight. And Louis gradually realizes that this
vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes
and hair-style as Louis.
Louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. Santiago
mimics. Louis takes a step forwards. Santiago mimics.
Louis folds his arms. Santiago mimics.
LOUIS & STATIAGO
(simultaneously)
Clever.
LOUIS
You mean me harm?
SANTIAGO
(a beat later)
You mean me harm?
Louis calculates.
LOUIS
Trickster. Buffoon!
Santiago echoes the first word, but not the second.
Louis has broken his composure. He turns his back on
Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right
in front of him.
Again Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing
him.
Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.
LOUIS
I've searched the world for an
immortal and this is what I find?
Slowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the
mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the
wall.
Louis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out
at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear
behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his
midriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at
Louis, throwing him down.
Louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement
sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks
both ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares,
awestruck, at this new one:
ARMAND
He looks like an angel.
ARMAND
You are all right.
He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved
invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis.
Louis reads it aloud, as we see:
"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES
By Special Invitation
Friday, 9 p.m."
ARMAND
Bring the petit beauty with you. No
one will harm you. I won't allow
it. Remember my name. Armand.
Armand bows and vanishes.
Louis listens to the silence.
EXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES -
NIGHT
Louis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on
his arm. They pass people buying tickets for the
theatre and go inside.
LOUIS
Remember what I've told you.
They'll have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts if you
allow it.
They draw close to:
HUGE POSTERS
Reading -
"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS
THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
By Edgar Allen Poe"
The posters are illustrated with cliched images of
vampires overcoming damsels in distress.
ANOTHER ANGLE
CLAUDIA
But this can't be real. This is
nonsense.
LOUIS
Nonsense all right. But something
tell me it's going to be the
strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Warily, they show their invitations to the mortal
ticket taker at the door. He glances away
indifferently.
Claudia and Louis enter the Lobby.
CLAUDIA
I loathe them! I can't stand the
sight of them! Stupid bourgeois
Parisians, all dressed in black
like some private club! I've
searched for them the world over
and I despise them!
LOUIS
What danger?
CLAUDIA
I can feel it from them! They want
to know who made us, what became of
him. They have their rules, their
idiotic rules!
They come to their room, enter.
Claudia, staring at the dolls. We see Madeleine inside,
painting a doll. She sees Claudia and smiles and waves.
Louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind
him.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I felt a kind of peace at last. I
had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.
I knew knowledge would never be
withheld by Armand. It would pass
through him as through a pane of
glass. And I knew Claudia must
leave me...
Louis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows
on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we
see...
SILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her
arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain
coming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains,
alarmed.
CLAUDIA
(whispers)
Louis!
Louis speaks without turning.
LOUIS
She is dying. It happened to you
too, but your child's mind can't
remember.
CLAUDIA
But if she dies...
LOUIS
It's only mortal death.
He turns to look at Claudia.
LOUIS
Bear me no ill will, my love. We
are now even.
CLAUDIA
What do you mean?
LOUIS
What died tonight inside that room
was not that woman. It will take
her many nights to die, perhaps
years. What has died in that room
tonight is the last vestige in me
of what was human.
She takes his hand.
CLAUDIA
Yes father. At last. We are een.
He bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the
wafting curtains. He sees -
MANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS
Silhouetted, coming closer.
CLAUDIA
Looks up and screams.
THE CURTAINS
Are ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge
through.
ESTELLE
Time for justice, little one.
The vampires close on them as Louis struggles,
Claudia's scream pierces the night air.
Claudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying. She is
dragged away. Vampire hands drag the coffin across the
stone floor.
Is thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed
over, mortar trowelled on.
Louis is slumped against the stone wall. Armand stands
beside him like a guardian angel.
ARMAND
I couldn't prevent it.
LOUIS
I don't believe you. I do not have
to read your soul to know that you
lie.
ARMAND
Louis, they cannot be brought back.
There are some things that are
impossible, even for me.
LOUIS
You let them do it.
Louis climbs to his feet.
LOUIS
You held sway over them. They
feared you. You wanted it to
happen.
ARMAND
Louis, I swear I did not.
LOUIS
I understand you only too well. You
let them do it, as I let Lestat
turn a child into a demon. As I let
her rip Lestat's heart to pieces!
Well I am no longer that passive
fool that has spun evil from evil
till the web traps the one who made
it. Your melancholy spirit of this
century! I know what I must do. And
I warn you - you saved me tonight,
so I return the favor - do not go
near your cell in the Theatre Des
Vampires again.
Wet and deserted, the streets around the theatre are
quiet.
CLOSEUP - CLOCK
Chiming five a.m.
CLOSE ON LOUIS
Looking at the paling sky. He is in an alleyway,
outside of Armand's cell. He has a huge keg with him.
he finds the door unlocked. He enters.
Louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the
thin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street.
He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to
fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -
A MAGNIFICENT HEARSE
As in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door
of the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the
interior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis
and pulls him inside.
The hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the
spectacle of the burning theatre.
The gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed,
exposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on
around it, oblivious.
Cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. Louis
emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.
LOUIS (V.O.)
I had returned to new Orleans. As
soon as I smelt the air, I knew I
was home. There was sadness there,
rich, almost sweet, like the
fragrance of jasmine. I walked the
streets, savoring it like a long
lost perfume...
Louis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions.
LOUIS (V.O.)
And then on Prytania Street, only
blocks from the Lafayette cemetery
I caught the scent of death and it
wasn't coming from the graves...
CAMERA PANS OVER white-walled Lafayette cemetery and
its surrounding mansions.
LOUIS (V.O.)
The scent grew stronger as I
walked. Old death. A scent too
faint for mortals to detect.
Louis sees rats darting across the street. They rush
into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined
mansion. No lights.
Louis stops at a rusted gate. He forces it open and
enters -
A VERITABLE JUNGLE
Of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a
faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass
window of a huge Greek Revival house. He approaches
then he sees -
OLD SHRIVELLED CORPSE
Of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny
rosevines.
LOUIS
Looks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost
nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the
roots of an oak overgrowing it.
He looks up at the distant light.
He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
vine, only bones and clothes.
LOUIS (V.O.)
They were like the doomed princess
caught in the thorny vines of
Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew
what it meant. A vampire had lured
them here, but had been to weak to
get rid of them.
Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.
LOUIS (V.O.)
It spelt weakness, madness, the
behavior of a dying animal that
pollutes its own lair.
Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves
along the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the
floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked
books. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down
from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the
books. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare,
except for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A
single mirror reflecting the moon.
Dead rats.
He moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The
candle flickers inside. He sees -
HIS POV
Lestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near
starvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a
skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
His clothes are rags. Blond hair beautiful, as always.
MALLOY'S ENTRANCES FACE SUPERIMPOSED OVER
MALLOY (V.O.)
Lestat escaped the fire!
LOUIS (V.O.)
He hadn't even been there. And all
those years I thought he was dead.
BACK TO LESTAT
One tiny candle stands beside him. He reads an early
comic, from the turn of the century. Without turning
his head, he speaks.
LESTAT
I'm so glad you're here Louis...
I've dreamed of your coming...
LOUIS
Don't try to speak... it's
alright...
LESTAT
I didn't mean to let them do it...
that Santiago, he tricked me...
LOUIS
That's all past, Lestat.
LESTAT
Yes. Past... she should never have
been one of us...
He turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken.
LESTAT
Still beautiful Louis. You always
were the strong one.
LOUIS
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you
no harm.
LESTAT
You've come back to me, Louis?
You've come again to me?
Louis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by,
piercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red
flashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his
ears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him,
until the lights pass over.
LOUIS
It's only a siren...
LESTAT
I can't bear it Louis! The machines
out there, that fly and that roar!
And such lights! They make the
night brighter than the day!
LOUIS
And they frighten you?
LESTAT
You know I love the dark. But
there's no dark anymore.
LOUIS
It's false light, Lestat. It can't
harm you...
LESTAT
If you stayed with me Louis, I
could venture out... little by
little... become the old Lestat.
Louis shivers. He releases him.
LOUIS
I have to go now Lestat...
LESTAT
You remember how I was, Louis.. the
vampire Lestat...
LOUIS
Yes. I remember...
Lestat shivers.
LESTAT
I tried to tell you Louis... that
night in Paris... when I first came
to you... no-one can refuse the
dark gift, Louis... not even you.
LOUIS
I tried...
LESTAT
And the more you tried, the more I
wanted you... a vampire with your
beautiful, suffering human heart.
And how you suffered... I need your
forgiveness, Louis.
LOUIS
You have it...
Louis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to
his candle, his magazine.
LESTAT
You'll come back, Louis... take me
out... little by little... and
maybe I'll be myself again...
A bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and
grabs it, squeezes the blood.
LOUIS
(whispering)
Yes, Lestat...
ON LOUIS
As he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are
expressionless.
LOUIS (V.O.)
And my story ends there. But in
fact it ended a long time ago, with
Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My
love died with her. I never really
changed after that. What became of
Lestat I have no idea. I go on,
night after night. I feed on those
who cross my path. But all my
passion went with her yellow hair.
I ma a spirit with preternatural
flesh. Detached. unchangeable.
Empty.
Malloy running for his car, a convertible. He leaps in
and screeches off through the night.
Malloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in
sheer, unfocused terror.
MALLOY
Jesus...
Malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge.
He breathes deeply, to calm himself. He takes a tape
from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks
it in the deck.
LOUIS (V.O.)
(tape)
1791. That's when it happened. I
was twenty-four. Younger then you
are now.
Suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat,
pulls his neck backwards -
LESTAT
Sinks his teeth in his neck.
MALLOY'S HANDS
On the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.
MALLOY'S EYES
Bulging, as the life drains out of him. Lestat sucking
him like a rat.
THE WHEEL
Swinging free of Malloy's dying hands.
THE CAR
Veers wildly into oncoming traffic.
LESTAT
Drinks regardless.
A TRUCK
Coming towards them, about to crush the car.
LESTAT'S BONY HAND
Grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.
THE CAR
Misses the truck by inches.
LESTAT
Throws Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.
The tape is playing.
LOUIS (V.O.)
(tape)
My invitation was open to anyone.
Sailors, whores, thieves. But it
was a vampire that accepted...
ON LESTAT
At the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger
seat. He smiles. We can see the blood renewing him.
LESTAT
Dear Louis... will I ever forget?
Lestat drives on, the car a tiny speck against the
bridge, the sea, the sky beyond, with the first fingers
of light spreading through it.
FADE OUT
