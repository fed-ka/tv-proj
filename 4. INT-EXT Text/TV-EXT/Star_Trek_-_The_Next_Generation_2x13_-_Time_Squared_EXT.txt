       Captain's log, stardate 42679.2. 
       While traversing an unexplored 
       section of the galaxy en route 
       to the Endicor system, a 
       Federation shuttlecraft has quite 
       suddenly appeared -- virtually out 
       of nowhere. There are no other 
       ships in the vicinity -- and no 
       indications whence it came nor 
       how it got out here. 
 
 
     Data takes the command position and attempts to 
     activate the system. 
 
         DATA 
       Both primary and reserve power 
       has been drained from the shuttle. 
       I am going to have to connect 
       to the Enterprise in order to 
       activate the shuttle's systems. 
 
         RIKER 
       Lieutenant La Forge -- report to 
       Shuttle Bay Two. 
 
         GEORDI'S COM VOICE 
       I'm on my way. 
 
         PICARD 
       Number One, I'll be in Sickbay. 
       Keep me informed.

        (indicating an unusual 
         burn on the skin of 
         the shuttle) 
       Did you see this, Captain? 
 
     Picard steps over to the shuttle and examines the burn. 
 
         PICARD 
       It looks like the kind of damage 
       caused by an antimatter explosion. 
 
         RIKER 
       Yes, the shuttle must have been 
       just out of range. 
 
         PICARD 
        (urgent) 
       Data, I need those logs.

         RIKER 
       We'll be on the bridge. 
 
     He and Worf EXIT as Geordi ARRIVES.

         PICARD (V.O.) 
       Captain's log, supplemental. Part 
       of the mystery has been solved. 
       The reason there are two NCC 
       one-seven-zero-one-D-five 
       shuttlecrafts is because one of 
       them is from the future... six 
       hours to be exact. And, so 
       presumably is the facsimile of 
       me. 
 
 
     It continues on course. 
 
         PICARD (V.O.) 
       Captain's log, supplemental. We 
       continue on course to Endicor. 
       We are now less than two hours 
       away from our rendezvous with 
       ourselves.

     trouble.

       Captain's log, supplemental. The 
       waiting is over. We have 
       apparently intersected with... 
       something. 
 
 
     But the Enterprise doesn't stop -- it instantly seems 
     to fall -- drawn along the beam of energy by an 
     irresistible force.
