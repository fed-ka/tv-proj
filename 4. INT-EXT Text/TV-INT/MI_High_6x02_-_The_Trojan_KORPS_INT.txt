      In virtual darkness, FRANK, ZOE, ANEISHA, DAN and TOM enter.
      FRANK s holding the torn off KORPS insignia from episode one.

                                    FRANK
                    Last time I saw one of these KORPS 
                      insignias I was working down here 
                    in our old MI9 war room. We used to 
                    call this place the Bunker. 

      FRANK turns on a few dim lights,revealing alarge,defunct 
      MI9 operations centre. In the semi-darkness it looks like a 
      mothballed NASAmission control centre. 

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                    At the height of the secret world 
                      warwith KORPS, we had one hundred 
                    and fifty agents working here, with 
                    over two hundred similar bases in 
                    other countries... even then it was 
                      a close run thing. 

      DAN taps a wall with a metallic clank.

                                  DAN
                      Titanium?

                                    FRANK
                    Yes, the whole place is a fortress - 
                    right underneath MI9 HQ.

      TOM has been nosing around a desk - he finds an old computer.

                                  TOM
                      Dinosaur alert! How old is this 
                      stuff. Did a caveman sit here? 

                                    FRANK
                    That was my desk. 

      FRANK picks up some battered old bits of electrical junk 
      piled up by his dusty old desk. All marked with a big  O .

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                    Ah, the circle mystery: a ton of 
                    KORPS junk I collected, all marked 
                    the same way. Never did find out 
                    why. Probably just how they marked 
                    their trash. 


                                                                                    1              TROJAN KORPS by Ben Ward  Shooting Script  06/06/12


      He drops it with a laugh. ZOE picks up a photo that s blue-
      tacked to the screen. It s of FRANK and a GIRL.

                                  ZOE
                    This girl you re with looks a lot 
                    like Stella.

                                    ANEISHA
                      Fraaankwas Stellayour girlfriend?

      The SPIES giggle. FRANK goes red and snatches the photo back. 

                                    FRANK
                      Focus, please!

                                  DAN
                    We get it. KORPS was a big deal. 
                    But come on, they re really just 
                    the old version of SKUL. 

                                  TOM
                    And look what we did to SKUL! Bosh! 

                                    FRANK
                      You re not getting it at all. Look, 
                    this is SKUL. 

      FRANK hits a grimy old light switch and a spotlight hits a 
      section of the wall showing a diagram of SKUL s organisation. 
      It has photos for various captains (i.e.someof the villains 
      from previous series) and the GMat the top. 

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                    And this... is KORPS.

      FRANK lights up the rest of the wall, revealing SKUL is just 
      one small part of a vast organisation made up of many similar 
      groups& TORSO, SPINE, MUSCLE, THE EYE, KLAVIKLE, FIST, 
      SKAPULA, NOSTRIL, etc. 

                                    ANEISHA
                    Woah!

                                  ZOE
                      Thevoice we heard in the message 
                    on the laptop said they were back.

                                    FRANK
                    And I m telling you it s not 
                      possible. I saw them destroyed. 
                      They re never coming back. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

      The SPIES are inspecting the diagram. There are photos of all 
      the section leaders. Each either has a red cross through it 
      or  Captured  stamped over the top... except for the GM. 

                                    FRANK
                    The Grandmaster was the only enemy
                      leader to escape in the final days 
                    of the war with KORPS. 

                                  DAN
                    How do these two fit in? 

      DAN is standing on a desk and pointing to two photos placed 
      above the diagram(a clear photo of the CRIME MINISTER and 
        surveillance shot of THE MASTER MINDto match how he looks if 
      seen in flashbacks in later episodes). The others explore the 
      room as they talk - wiping dust off desks and fiddling with 
      some of the antiquated electronics like massive old mobile 
      phones. 

                                    FRANK
                    The bosses. That s the Master Mind 
                    and his deputy, the Crime Minister. 

                                    ANEISHA
                    The Master Mind? Not, like the 
                    voice we heard on therecording?

                                    FRANK
                    It did sound like him but no.It 
                    can t have been. These two are both 
                    dead. 

                                  TOM
                    Do all super-villains have weird 
                      names? 

                                    FRANK
                    This one is no joke. He makes the 
                      Grandmaster look harmless. No-one 
                    ever saw him until the final battle 
                    at KORPS HQ. The Crime Minister 
                    used to pass on his orders, running 
                    the organisation for him.

                      I know Frank wants us to look into 
                      copycats but it s got to be worth

                    real KORPS... even he admits it

      The AGENTS are sitting around, depressed. FRANK is debriefing 
      them, using a handheld iPadstyle device. 

                                    FRANK
                    I was in on the interrogation. The

                    TORSO were a part of KORPS just *
                    like SKUL. It all leads back to 
                    KORPS again. 

                                    FRANK
                    We ve been through this. I don t 
                    know who we re fighting but it s 
                    not KORPS. 

      DAN grabs a TORSOmask off the desk, along with the KORPS *
      insignia from episode 1.

                                  DAN
                      Frank... TORSO, SKUL, KORPS,we ve *
                    seen them, fought them; we even 
                      captured two of them. We ve got 
                    their badges, their uniforms and 
                    we ve heard the Master Mind s 
                      voice. Why won t you evenconsider 
                    the possibility that this is KORPS? 

      FRANK slams the iPaddevice down on the table, breaking it.
      The agents are shocked.

                    The explosion was so great they had 
                    to identify the Master Mind using 
                    DNA - they never even found the 
                    body of the Crime Minister. I was 
                    the only one to get out of that 
                      building alive!

                      happened to the rest of the MI9

      FRANK wipes away a tear as he tries in vain to put the iPad
      type thing back together.

                      I lost a lot of friends that day. 
                    If KORPS weren t totally destroyed - 
                    then my teamdied for nothing! 

      DAN and ANEISHA exchange a look, they think he s wrong but 
      they understand him better now. TOM is working at his 
      computer. He jumps up, concerned. 

                                  TOM
                    No no no- this is all wrong. The

                    in Vault Twelveiswith internal 
                    MI9 access.

                    about MrsHummcame from inside MI9 
                    too. I assumed it was a mistake. 

                                    FRANK
                    Could a traitor inside MI9 be 
                      behind all this? Who d know enough 
                    about KORPS to pull it off? Apart 
                    from Stella and me of course. Still 
                    it does make sense.

      DAN and ZOE manipulate the WORLD LEADER sarmsto fight back - 
      like a Kung Fudoll. ZOE surprisingly uses one of the 
        LEADER slegs to kick and knock out a FAKE AGENT. ZOE leaves 
      DAN to hold up the LEADER and engages the remaining LEAD 
      HENCHMAN. She fights like a martial arts wizard and is 
      forcing the LEAD HENCHMAN back. 

      It looks like it s all over... when the LEAD HENCHMAN manages 
      to grab JENNY LANE. Now faced with a hostage,ZOE has to move 
      carefully. 

                                    JENNY LANE
                    Argh! I guess this is a bad time to 
                    ask for an interview.




                                                                                  19              TROJAN KORPS by Ben Ward  Shooting Script  06/06/12


      The LEAD HENCHMAN pulls out a large metal ring and slips it 
      over her head. As he pulls it out, unseen by him, his 
        communicator comes out too and falls on the floor. 

                                    LEAD HENCHMAN
                      Electrical Feedback Torc. Ten 
                      thousand volts in twenty seconds 
                    time. Save her life or chase me. 
                    Your choice.

      The LEAD HENCHMANpushes JENNY towards them. She falls on the 
      floor.  He runsaway. ZOE starts going after him.There is a 
      electrical throbbing sound coming from the torcwith 
      increasing menace. 

                                  DAN
                      Zoe!He s right. We need at least 
                    four people touching the Torcto 
                      safely soak up the charge! 

      ZOE s frustrated and still wants to go. JENNY looks up.  

                                    JENNY LANE
                      Please! Help me.

      ZOE rushes back. Between them they dragthe two unconscious 
      men into position so they are touchingthe Torc- then they 
      touchit themselves. 

                                  DAN
                    Hang on. 

      There s a massive electrical flash and all fiveare thrown 
      apart. When the flash(and throbbing sound)subsides - they 
      are all groaning and alive. DAN quickly checks ZOE is OK - 
      but she s already getting to her feet. He turns to JENNY, who 
      manages a few words. 

                                    JENNY LANE
                    Thank you - I owe you my life. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      The aftermath of the attack. A steaming STELLA is tearing 
      strips out of AGENTS in the background. DAN and ANEISHA are 
      watching. 

                                    STELLA
                          (in background)
                    You had nine years of training and 
                    you forgot to count the agents!

                                  DAN
                    She s making a lot of noise - but I 
                    can t help feeling sheshould have 
                      noticed the extra bodies. 


                                                                                  20              TROJAN KORPS by Ben Ward  Shooting Script  06/06/12


                                    ANEISHA
                    You really think she could be 
                      behind this. 

      DAN shrugs. JENNY LANE approaches with ZOE. 

                                    JENNY LANE
                    I m sorry, I have to report all 
                    this on the news but... maybe 
                      this llhelp. That oafdropped it.

      She hands ZOEa KORPS communicator, then steps in front of 
      her camera crew.

                                    ANEISHA
                      I still don t like her. 

                                    JENNY LANE
                      Another day, another embarrassment 
                    for MI9. How much longer before the 
                      Government shuts down this 
                      struggling security service?

      STELLA is watching, seething.ZOE is looking at the 
        communicator with surprise.

                                  ZOE
                    He dropped it?

                                                                              CUT TO:


      TOM is wiring the found device into STELLA s desk top, 
      watched by DAN, ZOE, ANEISHA, STELLAand TWO MI9 AGENTS. 

                                  TOM
                      Nearly done. Just got to reverse 
                    the sub-highway connectorsand I ll 
                    be able to trace where their orders 
                    came from.

                                  DAN
                            (pointedly looking at 
                            STELLA)
                    This could be interesting.

      ZOE is looking uneasy.

                                  ZOE
                    It doesn t worry any of you that it 
                    was all a bit easy?

                                    ANEISHA
                    Easy? Youcould have been killed!




                                                                                  21              TROJAN KORPS by Ben Ward  Shooting Script  06/06/12


                                  ZOE
                    Yeah, but MI9 disguises? Someone 
                    was bound to spot there were too 
                    many agents. It s amazing no one 
                      spotted it earlier. 

      STELLA looks daggers at her.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    I m sorry but it is. And what sort 
                    of Agent  drops  their 
                        communicator?I don t like it. 

      FRANK enters.

                                    FRANK
                    Sorry I m late, I was... What s 
                    going on?

                                  DAN
                    Tom s wired up the communicator
                    Jenny found. He s going to trace it 
                    back to the source.

                                    FRANK
                      You re wasting your time,they ll 
                    have covered their tracksby now...

                                  TOM
                    Nope. Got it! It s asecurity 
                      service signature - the orders 
                      definitely came from inside MI9. 

                                  DAN
                    We ve got him... or her.

      He looks at STELLA. 

                                  TOM
                    If I just run it through the 
                      database... Here we go. The traitor 
                    is...

      He turns to look at STELLA s big screen which changes to a 
      MI9 service ID and a photo of FRANK. 

                                  DAN
                      Frank! But...

                                  TOM
                      I must have done it wrong.

      TOM starts checking his calculations - STELLA joins him. 

                                    STELLA
                      Frank,the message came from your
                      secure login.Who has access?



                                                                                  22              TROJAN KORPS by Ben Ward  Shooting Script  06/06/12


                                    FRANK
                    No one. And it s iris, DNA and 
                      fingerprint locked. No one could 
                    have hacked it. 

                                    STELLA
                    Give me something. This is looking 
                      really bad. 

                                    ANEISHA
                      Stella! You can t think Frank s 
                      behindthis. I mean - it s Frank!

                                  ZOE
                    The only one to survive the final 
                      battle with the Master Mind and the 
                    Crime Minister when KORPS was 
                      beaten!

                                    STELLA
                      That s true,and as a result we 
                    only have his word for what 
                      happened. 

                                    FRANK
                    Maybe if I spoke to the kidnappers?

                                    STELLA
                    Like you spoke to the men we 
                      captured inVault Twelve? They 
                        haven tcommunicated with us since! 
                    I m sorry Frank, I have to place 
                    you under arrestwhile we look into 
                    this. Tom,seal his MI9 login so he 
                    can t access the mainframe. 

                                  TOM
                    You know what you can do with that 
                      order! You can-

                                    FRANK
                      - Tom! Stella s right. She has to 
                      follow protocol. Do it.

                                  TOM
                    But-

                                    FRANK
                      - Now!

      TOM starts typing, fighting back the tears. FRANK hands over 
      his MI9 ID. TWO MI9 AGENTS place him in handcuffs.

                                    STELLA
                      Agents, go back to St Heart's.
                      Consider yourselves stood down
                    until we get to the bottom of this.

      STELLA, FRANK and the TWO AGENTS leave the room. Our SPIES 
      are shell-shocked and speechless. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

                                    ANEISHA
                      I don t believe this. Even Byron s 
                      having a go.

      ZOE approaches,being pestered by MELISSA

                                  ZOE
                    No! No! No!

                    OK, we lltalk about it tomorrow.

      MELISSA exits.

                    What was it thistime?

                                  ZOE
                    She wants actors for a school play

                      I can t take much more of this.

                                  DAN
                    You know... we d be bad agents if 
                    we didn t at least look at the 
                      possibility- 

                                    ANEISHA
                    What? That Frank s a traitor? I 
                    don t believe it. 

                                  DAN
                      I don t like it either, but he did 
                      suggest we leave Vault Twelve 
                      without investigating that heat 
                      reading.

                    He didn t want us to back Stella up 
                    at the conference either. Or trace 
                    the communicator signal.

                                  DAN
                    Are we really sure about him? We ve 
                    not known him long. 

                                    ANEISHA
                      I agree his behaviour s been a bit 
                      strange but I won t believe he s a 
                      traitor until I see proof!  

      TOM joins them, sitting down - he s ashen-faced.

                                  TOM
                    They just found some information on 
                      Frank ssecure login that led them 
                    to the stolen Global Vaporiser.

                          (Losing confidence)
                    It could be mind control?

                                  DAN
                      Neisha, sooner or later we ve got

                            (nodding)
                    Why do we think he s innocent?

      They all look depressed. Finally ANEISHA speaks.

                                    ANEISHA
                      I know how it looks but one of the

      MINISTER speaking to a screen covered with moving numbers and 
        statistics. 

                                    CRIME MINISTER
                    Agent Odysseus,you are detected. 
                      Assemble and destroy them. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      The AGENTS look in horror as the metallic junk startsmoving 
      together piece by piece,like a transformer forming into a 
      vicious looking android, like a cybermanmade of scrap. Two 
      red lights appear on a metal box, which becomes the head.

                                    ANEISHA
                    Wow. KORPS planted a robot ten
                    years ago to set Frank up and bring 
                    MI9 down today. They really think 
                      ahead. 

                                  DAN
                    Tom, keep trying to disarm the 
                      countdown. We ll hold the robot. 

      DAN and ANEISHArun forward and grab an arm each- while ZOE 
      approaches warily. 

                                    ANEISHA
                    We ve got it! 

      The armsdetach themselves, then turn on DAN and ANEISHA.
      They have to wrestle themlike big snakes. As the no-armed 
      robot walks towards ZOE,new bits of junk attach themselves 
      to it, creating new arms. It engages ZOE, who retreats, 
        desperately fighting. ANEISHA is on the ground wrestling with 
      anarm. 

                                    ANEISHA (CONT D)

                                  ZOE
                    Sorry busy.

      ZOE is still in retreat - she hurls things from desks at 
        Odysseuslike keyboards and mugs, but they all just bounce 
      off. The fight continues.

                                  DAN
                    Don t worry, Neesh, I m coming!

      DAN manages to throw his robot arm onto the ground. He turns 
      to go and help ANEISHA, but the robot arm grabs his ankle.  
      He stumbles against the wall grabbing a cable for support - 
      it comes out of the socket and falls on the floor, sparking. 

      DANtries to detach the arm as it starts climbing its way up 
      his leg.The countdown is at 30 seconds. 

                                    DAN(CONT D)
                    Tom, shut down the robot frequency!

      TOM looks up from where he s been striving to hack the 
      computer. He sees the desperate fight andstarts typing.

                                  TOM
                    I ve got it! You ve got three 
                      seconds before the robot comes back 
                      online! 

      TOM hits a button. There s an electronic whining sound and 
      all the bits of Odysseusstop working. His red eyes go off. 
      DAN dives across the room - grabs the fizzing cable and jams 
      it in the metal wall. There s a metallic hum. Odysseus red 
      eyes come back on. He tries to step towards ZOE, but can t. 
      He starts shaking, then is whipped back out of shot. Lots of 
      crashing sounds as he and all the other loose bits of metal 
      from the room slam into the metallic wall. 

                                  ZOE
                      Genius Dan - the current turnedthe 
                    wall into a giant magnet!

      FRANK and STELLA burst in.

                                    STELLA
                      What s going on!

                                    ANEISHA
                    We ll explain later - Frank s got 
                    ten seconds to enter his old 
                      passwordand stop the countdown.

      FRANK and STELLA run to the computer. FRANK moves to type 
      then hesitates. 

                                    STELLA
                    What are you waiting for?

      FRANK steels himself then types. The letters come up on the 
      screen.  L.0.V.3.L.Y.5.T.3.L.L.A The countdown stops. 

                                    ANEISHA
                       Lovely Stella?  Seriously?

                                    FRANK
                      Ahem... well, it was ten years ago. 

      He looks at the ground. Even STELLA is trying not to laugh. 
      FRANK changes the subject by approaching the stuck robot. 

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                    Of course. Not a circle at all, but

                      There s only one organisation that 
                    could control an Odysseusand

      The CRIME MINISTER s voice comes through the robot

                    It s been a long time, Frank. 

                                    FRANK
                    The Crime Minister?I saw you die.

                    What did you really see, Frank?

                                    FRANK
                    The explosion...

                                    CRIME MINISTER (THROUGH ODYSSEUS)
                    All part of my escape plan. And I 
                      wasn t the only one to escape. 
                      You ll be meeting lots of old 
                      friends in the days and weeks and 
                    years of pain to come. KORPS is 
                      rising. 

      FRANK stands shell-shocked looking at the robot - our AGENTS 
      appear beside him, flanking him for support. 

                                  DAN
                    We ll get them, Frank. 

                                    ANEISHA
                    And when we do,they re never 
                      coming back again. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      FRANK is talking to someone out of shot.

                                    FRANK
                      I can t believe I brought that 
                    thing inside MI9 like a Trojan 
                      Horse. You wouldn t have made a 
                      mistake like that, would you?

      Reveal FRANK is talking to FLOPSY while feeding him a carrot. 

                                  DAN
                    You know talking to a rabbitis the 
                    first sign of being a Grandmaster.

                                    FRANK
                            (laughs)
                    It s embarrassing really. I always 
                      thought I knew all about KORPS, but 
                    they knew me better. They knew I d 
                    be intrigued by those Omicron 
                      symbols and take the stuff back to 
                    MI9. 

      ANEISHA is sat near TOM staring into space. 

                                  TOM
                      What s up?

                                    ANEISHA
                    Ah it s probably nothing. 

                                  TOM
                    If we ve learned anything from this  
                    it s that we should trust our 
                      instincts. Yours are the best we ve 
                    got. 

                                    ANEISHA
                    Have you got any facial alteration 
                      software?

      TOM pulls up a screen on his computer.

                                  TOM
                    What do you think? Who are we 
                      looking at?

                                    ANEISHA
                    Pull up the Crime Minister. 

      The Crime Minister s photo from the bunker wall pops up. 
      FRANK, DAN and ZOE gravitate towards them, sensing something 
      important is happening.  

                                      ANEISHA(CONT D)

                    big glasses.

      TOM does. And there she ison the screen... it s Jenny Lane.

                    the whole thing from right in front 
                    of us. 

        ZOE runs for the door.

                    Don t bother Zoe. She ll be long

      They appear in the classroom doorway and find ZOE sat in the

                    could do my lessons now. I m happy 
                    to come to school in the evening 
                    and weekends.

      The twoteachers exchange a look. MR FLATLEY bangs his head 
      on the wall. He looks back at ZOE.
