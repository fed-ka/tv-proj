The titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old
typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings,
announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...
THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER
Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city.
Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a
child in the back of a station wagon.
We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us
wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then
we enter...
The Tunnel.
We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden,
alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of
the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway.
We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a
window, and into...

Charlie walks up the path to his house.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
If my parents ask me about it, I probably
won't tell them the truth because I don't
want them to worry that I might get bad
again.
14
24
Friday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke
and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone,
trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students.
When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears...
PATRICK
Come on Devils! Woooooo!
Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off.
TWIN
SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting.
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS
Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.
PATRICK
Suck it, virginity pledges!
Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving
himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches.
CHARLIE
Hey... Patrick.
12.
PATRICK
Hey! You're in my shop class, right?
How's your clock coming?
CHARLIE
My dad's building it.
PATRICK
Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.
(off Charlie's awkward silence)
You want to sit over here, or are you
waiting for your friends?
CHARLIE
No.
I'll sit if that's okay.
Patrick motions for Charlie to sit.
Charlie sits.
Elated.
PATRICK
Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by
the way. It's an endless nightmare. And
these assholes actually think they're
being original.
Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field.
Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5
second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to
say. Anything.
CHARLIE
So, uh... you like football?
PATRICK
Love it.
CHARLIE
Then, maybe you know my broth--
PATRICK
Hey, Sam.
Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's
ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every
father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class
flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter.
SAM
Question. Could the bathrooms here be
more disgusting?
PATRICK
Yes, they call it the men's room.
13.
Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick.
Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy.
SAM
Well, I finally got hold of Bob.
PATRICK
Party tonight?
SAM
No. He's still trying to shag that
waitress from the Olive Garden.
PATRICK
He's never tossing that salad.
Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field. The
kids clap. Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.
SAM
(about Charlie)
Patrick... who's this?
PATRICK
This is...
CHARLIE
Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis.
PATRICK
Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates
Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?
CHARLIE
Is that what they call him?
SAM
Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone.
You
put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.
PATRICK
I try, Sam. I try.
SAM
It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.
Sam extends her hand to Charlie. Every nail a different
color. They shake. Then, Sam grabs a nacho. Zoinks!
PATRICK
So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go
to Mary Elizabeth's house?
14.
SAM
Can't. She got caught watering down her
parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's
just go to Kings.
PATRICK
(turns to Charlie)
Hey... we're going to Kings after the
game if you want to come.
Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass.
The
fans go crazy. Especially Patrick. Charlie smiles.
25
26
Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck.
The music blares.
PATRICK
Thanks for paying, Charlie.
CHARLIE
(so eager)
No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey...
maybe I'll see you around in school?
SAM
(distracted - to Patrick)
God, would you turn that down? You're
going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.
PATRICK
Bye, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Okay.
Bye.
Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face.
The happiness from one night of company.
27
34
The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town.
Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing.
SAM
God, it's freezing.
PATRICK
But you wore that toasty costume. It's
not like you're trying too hard to be
original.
SAM
Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
CHARLIE
Are you sure it's okay that I come?
SAM
Of course. Just remember, Charlie...
Bob's not paranoid.
PATRICK
"He's sensitive."
Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the
cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so
often that people can't tell the difference anymore.
BOB
Sam... that waitress from the Olive
Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?
SAM
Only if I have Patrick's blessing.
BOB
Patrick?
PATRICK
You're a hopeless stoner who attends the
culinary institute. So, I'm going to
have to say "no" on that one, but nice
try. Charlie?
Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam.
BOB
Touch.
35
40
The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel
Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our
prototype for tone.
SAM
My God.
What is this song!?
PATRICK
Right?
I have no idea.
SAM
(to Charlie)
Have you heard it before?
CHARLIE
Never.
SAM
(light bulb)
Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
PATRICK
Sam, it's freezing.
SAM
Patrick, it's the perfect song!
PATRICK
No.
Mama Patrick says no.
SAM
Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to
you, I'm begging you to drive me--
28.
PATRICK
(laughing)
Alright! I concede!
Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed.
She grips the
flood lights to steady herself as she stands.
CHARLIE
What is she doing?
PATRICK
Don't worry. She does it all the time.
SAM
Turn it up!
PATRICK
You got it, your highness.
Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel,
just as the truck flies into...
THE TUNNEL
We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the
air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from
Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her
right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the
camera. Right at us. For we are now...
Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit.
So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets
this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
What?
CHARLIE
I feel infinite.
The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge.
Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms. Free and
young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.
CUT TO:
41
45
Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the
field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later,
Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.
CHARLIE
When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I
guess it was hard, too, because Brad had
to get drunk every time they fooled
around.
46
50
The marquee announces it's time for the...
51
63
The song continues as Patrick holds up the grade. C minus!
Charlie and Sam cheer as Patrick screams at the top of his
lungs...
PATRICK
Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!
SAM
Below average!
Patrick screams at the city in the distance.
Below average!
64
67
The porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now.
We see the girls wave to each other and hug Sam.
GANG
"Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your
dad's!" "See you at New Year's!"
Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway.
CHARLIE
Have a good time at your mom's.
PATRICK
Thanks. And Charlie... since you were
born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't
get a lot of birthday presents. So, I
thought you should have my clock. From
the heart.
45.
CHARLIE
Thank you, Patrick.
Sam gives Charlie one last hug.
Patrick and Sam watch their
friends leave.
PATRICK
I love you guys!
68
68
We fly as high as Charlie feels.
Above the city on Christmas
Eve.
69
71
The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags.
The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except...
Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with
sand and a candle.
He lights the candle, making the bag glow
like a beautiful
lantern. He looks down his street, where
families are out
with their kids, doing the same luminaria
ritual.
MATCH CUT TO:
72
72
The same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen
and the kids finish their luminaria bags. Aunt Helen lights
up the candles. They glow.
AUNT HELEN
Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria
is a landing strip for Santa Claus.
The image goes wide. All of these bags glowing.
Beautiful.
Aunt Helen rattles her keys. Whispers.
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D)
Keep an eye out for him with your brother
and sister. I'll be right back.
She bends down and whispers into his ear.
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D)
I'm going to get your birthday present.
She musses his hair and gets in the car.
END FLASHBACK
73
73
Charlie hovers over the glowing luminaria.
Something is
bothering him. He shakes it off.
47.
74
77
About 45 minutes. The sound is muted thick. Slight echoes.
Charlie shovels the snow. Crunch. Fascinated by his breath
making fog. Sam comes outside. She's worried about him.
SAM
Shoveling snow, huh?
CHARLIE
I have to get this driveway clean. Then,
I have to congratulate you for being
happy because you deserve it.
SAM
You said that an hour ago.
CHARLIE
Was that tonight? God. I was looking at
this tree, but it was a dragon, and then
49.
SAM
Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just
give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up.
She points.
Charlie looks up.
Sees the stars.
SAM (CONT'D)
Isn't it quiet?
CHARLIE
Sam, you ever think that if people knew
how crazy you really were, no one would
ever talk to you?
SAM
All the time. So, you want to put on
these glasses? They'll protect you.
Sam puts her arm around his shoulder. Protecting him.
Charlie looks through the glasses. The sky bends like a
globe. When he breathes, the sky ripples.
78
79
In a QUICK FLASH, we see 7 year old Charlie with Aunt Helen
on Christmas Eve. She bends to whisper in his ear.
AUNT HELEN
It'll be our little secret, all right?
80
81
Charlie walks down the road under a streetlight. Silhouette.
The road is icy. Charlie lays down and starts moving his
arms in the snow. The memories begin to haunt him.
82
82
7 year old Charlie waves goodbye to Aunt Helen as she drives
away through the landing strip for Santa Claus.
83
83
16 year old Charlie blinks.
The memories come faster.
84
86
16 year old Charlie lays on the snow, shivering, as the image
goes high above to reveal he's made a snow angel.
87
88
The tires squish the grey slush puddle as the busses pull
into the dreary parking lot. School is back in session.
89
91
The Rocky Horror faithful enter the theater.
52.
SAM (O.S.)
I called him 30 times.
92
95
The wind whips. That bracing February cold. Charlie helps
Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car.
CHARLIE
Maybe I could join the cast as an
alternate or something?
MARY ELIZABETH
We're filled up now, but they'll need
people after we leave for college. I
could put in a good word for you.
CHARLIE
That'd be great. Thanks.
They put the box in her trunk. Snap it closed. We can't
help but notice the "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" bumper
sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt.
54.
MARY ELIZABETH
Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie
Hawkins dance?
CHARLIE
The one where the girl asks the guy.
MARY ELIZABETH
Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely
stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey,
thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd
just blow it off because school dances
suck torture. But, you know, it's my
last year, and... would you maybe want to
go with me?
CHARLIE
You want to go with me?
MARY ELIZABETH
I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked
really cute in your costume. So, what do
you say?
Charlie thinks and thinks and...
96
103
Mary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house.
Charlie gets out. Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend.
Not knowing how. Mary Elizabeth smiles. Smitten.
MARY ELIZABETH
See you Monday.
With that, she backs out of the driveway. We see him from
the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller. His
stomach already filling with acid.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't
written for awhile, but things are a
total disaster.
59.
104
105
Ash Wednesday. Charlie gets out of the school bus to
immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him. She sees
the cross of ashes on his forehead. She thinks his ashes are
a smudge. She cleans it.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice
person underneath the part of her that
hates everyone. And since I heard that
having a girlfriend makes you happy, I
tried hard to love her like I love Sam.
MARY ELIZABETH
Can you believe it's almost our two week
anniversary?
CHARLIE
I know.
106
106
A double date. Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the
silent classic, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
So, I took her on double dates.
MARY ELIZABETH
(proud)
Your first foreign film.
CHARLIE
60.
MARY ELIZABETH
Vegans don't eat butter.
Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
And I tried not to mind that she loves to
hold hands even when her hands are
sweaty.
107
113
They move to the driveway.
Charlie feels awful.
Panicky.
CHARLIE
64.
PATRICK
Trust me.
You don't want to go back
there.
CHARLIE
But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to
do anything.
PATRICK
I know you didn't, but look... I hate to
be the one to break this, but there's
history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
Other guys. Things that have nothing to
do with you. But... it's best if you
stay away for awhile.
CHARLIE
(crushed)
Oh. Okay. How long do you think?
Silence. Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave
expression. It's going to be a long time. We hear the sound
of the typewriter.
114
128
Charlie exits the building. Kids stare at him. Then, look
away. Charlie feels very lost until he sees... Sam. She
smiles. It brings him back instantly. And then, gently...
SAM
How you doing, Charlie?
CHARLIE
I don't know. I keep trying, but... I
can't really remember what I did.
Sam can see he's afraid of himself.
She nods, sympathetic.
71.
SAM
Do you want me to tell you?
CHARLIE
(scared)
Yeah.
SAM
You saved my brother.
That's what you
did.
CHARLIE
So, you're not scared of me?
SAM
No.
CHARLIE
And can we be friends again?
SAM
Of course.
The minute she hugs him, the numb goes away. She kisses the
top of his head and puts her arm around his shoulder. They
begin walking away.
SAM (CONT'D)
Come on.
Let's go be psychos together.
129
130
Patrick drives Sam's truck up the hill to the overlook.
PATRICK (V.O.)
I'll tell you something, Charlie. I feel
good. You know what I mean? Maybe
tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke
place downtown. And this club off the
strip. They don't card. And the
Schenley Park scene. You gotta see the
"fruit loop" at least one time.
131
131
Charlie and Patrick walk the lighted path, howling at the
moon. Patrick holds a thermos, filled with who knows what.
PATRICK
Oh, my God. My life is officially an
after school special. Son of a bitch!
CHARLIE
(laughing)
It kind of is. It so is.
More laughter.
They arrive at the lookout.
They drink.
PATRICK
So, you ever hear the one about Lily
Miller?
CHARLIE
I don't know.
73.
PATRICK
Really? I thought your brother would
have told you. It's a classic.
CHARLIE
Maybe.
PATRICK
So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker.
And this was going to be the night they
were going to lose their virginity. So,
she did it really proper. She packed a
picnic. Stole a bottle of wine.
Everything was perfect, and they're just
about to 'do it' when they realize they
forgot the condoms. So, what do you
think happened?
CHARLIE
I don't know.
PATRICK
They did it with one of the sandwich
bags.
They start laughing and screaming.
CHARLIE
Ew!
That's disgusting!
PATRICK
Yes! It is! Let's keep the train
rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!
Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks...
CHARLIE
Uh. Well... there was this girl named
Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the
4th grade--
PATRICK
Mosquito bites. Promising.
Go.
CHARLIE
And she let some of the boys feel them.
PATRICK
That's your suburban legend?
Did you at
least cop a feel?
CHARLIE
No.
74.
PATRICK
Of course not. You went home, listened
to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self-
esteem--
CHARLIE
Fine!
Okay. Your turn.
Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie.
PATRICK
Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this
one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill.
Guy's father didn't know about his son.
So, he comes down into the basement one
night when he's supposed to be out of
town. Catches his son with another boy.
So, he starts beating him. But not like
the slap kind. Like the real kind. And
the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're
killing him." And the son just yells
"Get out." And eventually the boyfriend
just did.
Patrick stops.
Gripped by sad.
He can't shake.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Why can't you save anybody?
CHARLIE
I don't know.
PATRICK
Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could
meet the love of my life any second now.
Things will be different now, and that's
good. I just need to meet a good guy.
CHARLIE
Yeah.
Patrick looks at him. Charlie has never seen him so
vulnerable. After a beat... Patrick kisses Charlie on the
mouth. Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen. His
eyes open the whole time. A moment, then Patrick looks at
Charlie. He collapses into his chest.
PATRICK
I'm sorry.
CHARLIE
It's alright.
75.
Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry. And we
leave them, the city lights small in the distance.
132
132
We see the truck glide down the highway.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I've been spending a lot of time with
Patrick. He begins every night really
excited.
133
133
Patrick and Charlie are parked at the entrance of Schenley
Park. Patrick speaks, very animated, until...
CHARLIE (V.O.)
He always says he feels free, and tonight
is his destiny. But after awhile, he
runs out of things to keep himself numb.
... the words leave him, and we can see how sad he really is.
134
142
A brilliant sunset. We see the gang. In silhouette.
Running up the bleachers after the sun.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about
us running. There was this beautiful
sunset. And just a few hours before,
everyone I love had their last day of
high school ever. And I was happy
because they were happy, even though I
counted, and I have 1,095 days to go.
143
144
Prom night continues. The antique limo is so garish, it's
great. Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's
dad. Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter. Alice
stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
And then there was Sam...
The image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges.
She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's. Radiant.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I've looked at her pictures since that
night. I like to see how happy she was
before she knew.
Sam joins Craig. They kiss for the cameras, then run with
the rest of the gang to the limosine.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
They were in a hotel suite after prom
when the truth came out...
The gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam
the whole time. When I heard that, I
kept thinking about the happy girl in
these pictures. Because she doesn't have
1,095 days to go.
145
145
Graduation Day. The place is packed with graduating seniors
and families. Charlie's mom and dad fawn over Candace with
the video camera. Charlie finally finds... Sam.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
She made it. This is her time. And no
one should be able to take that away.
They approach each other and hug.
80.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Congratulations.
PATRICK
Oh, Charlie's here! Guys, group photo!
We should all take a group photo. Get
against the railing and try to look
suave!
The kids line up for the picture they will always remember.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Yeah, this is the one. That's going to
be a great angle.
Patrick bows to reveal the top of his cap reads, "Nothing
Hates You." The parents line up cameras. "Cheese!" Snap.
SMASH CUT TO:
146
149
It's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and
Mary Elizabeth goodbye. But Charlie is somewhere else.
SAM
I'll call all the time.
MARY ELIZABETH
Promise.
SAM
And we'll all see each other in New York.
SAM'S MOM
Come on, Sam.
Charlie can't take it. He moves to the side of the truck and
puts in the last suitcase. He looks over at Sam.
SMASH CUT TO:
150
151
Charlie snaps himself out of it. He turns back as Mary
Elizabeth and Alice part ways. Charlie locks eyes with Sam.
They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She
kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry.
After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her
truck with Patrick riding shotgun. Charlie looks dazed.
SMASH CUT TO:
152
153
Sam starts the truck. Charlie wants to scream for her to
stop. But he's frozen. She drives away. He watches her go.
The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the
stop sign. And disappears. Charlie stands there, alone.
SMASH CUT TO:
154
155
The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye.
Charlie sees his friends are crying. He's not. He's numb.
156
156
Charlie walks down the street. His eyes far away. The
images and memories are short, violent bursts. If you've
never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels.
157
157
QUICK FLASH. It's Christmas Eve.
Aunt Helen smiles to
Little Charlie.
AUNT HELEN
It'll be our little secret, okay?
Little Charlie nods.
158
158
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk.
We see him through a long lens. His image fractures. We see
him in different planes of the image. He's beginning to
break apart. One image. Two images.
85.
159
160
BACK TO PRESENT. We see Charlie fracturing. The pieces
scattered. Out of focus. Lost. He's all over the frame.
161
171
We see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's
backyard pool. Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless.
CANDACE'S FRIEND
Candace... your brother's on the phone.
Candace casually picks up the phone.
87.
CANDACE
Hello.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Hey, Candace.
CANDACE
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just
can't stop thinking something.
CANDACE
What?
CHARLIE
Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?
She died getting my birthday present, so
I guess I killed her, right? I've tried
to stop thinking that, but I can't. She
keeps driving away and dying over and
over.
Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her
brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone.
CANDACE
Call the police and send them to my
house.
CHARLIE
And I can't stop her.
I'm crazy again.
CANDACE
No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad
are going to be home with Chris any
second.
CHARLIE
I was just thinking... what if I wanted
her to die, Candace?
CANDACE
What?
Charlie... Charlie!
Dial tone.
172
183
The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck.
Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I don't know if I will have the time to
write any more letters because I might be
too busy trying to participate. So, if
this does end up being the last letter, I
just want you to know that I was in a bad
place before I started high school. And
you helped me.
184
185
Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down,
looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Because I know there are people who say
all of these things don't happen. And
there are people who forget what it's
like to be 16 when they turn 17.
We see Charlie in profile.
The night sky behind him until...
186
