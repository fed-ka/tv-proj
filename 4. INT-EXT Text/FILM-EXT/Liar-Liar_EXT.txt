Fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow LAWYER,
LAWYER
How's it going, Fletcher?
FLETCHER
(he' s won)
Another gratifying day serving
Justice.
Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.
CLIENT
Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I
wish there was some way I
could show my appreciation.
FLETCHER
Stay out of my neighborhood
after dark.
A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.
PUBLICIST
Mr. Reid, do you have a 
moment-?
FLETCHER
No, I'm late picking up my
son.
PUBLICIST
-Because a couple of reporters
want to interview you about
your big win today.
Fletcher instantly shifts directions.
FLETCHER
..
How's my hair?
And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.
A sad Max and his mother, AUDREY, wait silently on the
steps.
MAX
What time is it?
AUDREY
(checks her
WATCH)
I ' m sure he just got tied up
in court again.
Finally, Fletcher's BMW pulls up. Max races to him,
delighted.
MAX
Dad!
FLETCHER
Maximillian!
(calls out a
COMMAND)
TRANSFORMERS!! .
Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the
TRANSFORMER TOY making ROBOTIC MOVEMENTS and SOUNDS. Max
knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . ...
Until --
.
FLETCHER
Malfunction in vector 3 ! !
Malfunction in vector 3!!
(pretends to lose
control of a
'robotic' arm)
Look out! It's on tickle
mode!!
Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes CLAW-LIKE, TICKLING MAX
like crazy! Max loves it.
Audrey watches these two kids, smiles.
FLETCHER
(re: Audrey)
And who is this lovely lady?
Max, could you introduce me?
MAX
That's no lady, that's mom!
AUDREY. 
Thanks, Max.

FLETCHER
Mom? !
(under his
BREATH)
Himnm. . . I don't remember her
looking that good,
(becomes the
robot again)
Malfunction in Vector 4!
Malfunction in Vector 4!
Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes
after Audrey.
AUDREY
(PLAYFULLY)
Keep Vector 4 away from me.
Unless you want Vector 4
chopped off.
FLETCHER
You know, you were much easier
when we were married...
(re: her luggage)
So where are you off too?
AUDREY
Stanford. I'm delivering a
paper.
FLETCHER
O h really? Where I live, we
use a boy on a bike.
MAX
Hey mom, dad's taking me to
see wrestling!
AUD REY
(MILDLY
PROTESTING)
Oh, Fletcher!
FLETCHER
(PLAYFULLY
mimicking her)
Oh, Audrey!
AUDREY
Do you have to take him to
tho se things? They're so
violent.
Fleccher IMITATES the familiar wise, old INDIAN CHIEF DAN
GEORGE.
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE
The boy must learn the way of
the war rior . An d wh o be tter
to teach him than Rowdy Rod- .
Piper and Big John Stud?
Audrey can't help but LAUGH.
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE
He must be schooled in the way
of the face-claw, the sleeper-
hold, and the purple nuxple.
For only then--
AUDREY
(PLAYFULLY)
Shut up!!
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE
(to Max)
The squaw will never
understand us.
A HORN HONKS. It's the good-natured, affable JERRY. Max
runs up to him.
JERRY
Max, my man!
Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips.
JERRY
Fletcher, good to see you?
FLETCHER
What? No kiss for me?
JERRY
(re: luggage)
What do you say, Max? Give me
a hand?
Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback
ride to get the luggage.
FLETCHER
(to Audrey)
I didn't know the boyfriend
was going.
AUDREY
Jerry. His name is Jerry and
yes, he's going.
Audrey heads inside.
'

'
Audrey locks up.
FLETCHER
Well, great... I'm so happy
for you two. I am just Mister
H appy man. Happy, happy,
happy.
AUDREY
Relax, Fletcher. It looks
like Jerry's taking that job
offer in Boston.
Fletcher turns sincere.
FLETCHER
Aud, I am so sorry...
Behind her back, he FLAILS in celebration.
She glances
back... He stops, whistles innocently.
JERRY
(calling to
AUDREY)
Ready?
Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max.
They get in his
Explorer.
FLETCHER
(to Audrey)
Yo u gonna be okay? Because if
not, we could leave Max with
your sister and I could go out
with you two, does that appeal
to you at all?
They drive off.
FLETCHER
Wave to the soon-to-be ex-
boyfriend, Max.
(flipping Max the
KEYS)
You drive.
Establishing the headquarters of ALLAN, STEWART &
KONIGSBERG.
As they head inside, Fletcher and Max pass a BEGGAR.
BEGGAR
'Scuse me, sir. Do you have
any change?
FLETCHER
(patting his
POCKETS)
'Fraid not. Sorry.
Early morning outside Fletcher's building.
Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of
airline tickets.
AUDR EY
(re: tickets)
Jerry, these are for tomorrow.
JERRY
The company wants me to get
started right away.
AUDREY
I can't just pick up and move
to Boston with two days
notice.
JERRY
Ju st come check it out. You
a nd Max, see the town. Let's
. pick out a place together.
Then, if you want to turn me
down and scar me for life,
fine.
AUDREY
It's just not that simple...
What about my job? I've been
at UCLA three years.
JERRY
It's New England. They're
lousy with colleges. You
can't swing a bat back there
without hitting a college.
You'd get a job there in a
second.
AUDREY
There are other factors
involved.
(POINTS)
T here they are now.
.
They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher
and Max are waiting. Fletcher's still reviewing a file.
As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over.
AUDREY
Did you have fun? How were
the wrestling matches?
FLETCHER
Big fun. Manly fun. Am I
right, Maxie?
MAX
(HALF-HEARTEDLY)
It was fun..

FLETCHER
(re: Audrey)
So how were the wrestling
matches ? Did you have fun?
JERRY
Max , my man! My happy
birthday man!
Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.
Jerry gives Max
a light punch on the arm.
JERRY
One-two-three-four-five... and
one for good luck.
FLETCHER
Did you see that? He struck
the child!
MAX
Look what dad got me!
(shows the glove)
JERRY
Whoa! Great! I have my glove
in the car. We'll stop in the
park on the way home and play
c atch. Then tonight we'll oil
it, wrap a rubber band around
it. . . It'll be great.
(to Fletcher)
Great birthday present, dad!
Fletcher hates him.
Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.
FLETCHER
.
(makes a fist)
When is it his birthday?
AUDREY
Some thing's come up. We need
to talk.
MAX
Mom, let's go. I want to
play.
AUDREY
(to Fletcher)
We'll talk tonight.

FLETCHER
Tonight?
AUDREY
Max's birthday?
FLETCHER'
Oh , yeah, right. Seven. I
knew that. I did. I blocked
it out weeks ago. The
se ven tee nt h of May. Max's
birthday.
AUDREY
It's the eighteenth.
FLETCHER
The seventeenth of May is the
day I .remind myself that the
eighteenth is Max's birthday.
See you tonight.
They drive away.
A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
is accosted by a BEGGAR.
BEGGAR
Any change, Mister?
.FLETCHER
Absolutely.
But he continues walking.
BEGGAR
Could you spare some?
FLETCHER
Unquestionably.
Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.
BEGGAR
Will you?
FLETCHER
No.
BEGGAR
How come?
FLETCHER
Because I resent your
p re sen ce. You fill me with an
unpleasant mixture of disgust
and guilt. Further, I don't
believe you'll use the money
for food, but I believe you'll
use it for, at worst, drugs,
or, at best, whiskey, or
. cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.
As Fletcher heads up the stairs...
BEGGAR
Jerkoff.
Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his
pocket.
FLETCHER
Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.
He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
almost hits an OLD MAN.
FLETCHER
The color of the pen is --
re d !
.
But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a
truck. The DRIVER screams:
DRIVER
What's your problem, schmuck?!
FLETCHER
(the truth)
I ' m an inconsiderate prick!
Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.
FLETCHER (CON "ID)
C'mon, you can do this! The
color of the pen is -- RED!
This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.
FLETC HER
S hi t !!
Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you know why I stopped you?
FLETCHER
Depends on how long you were
following me.
POLICE OFFICER
Why don't we take it from the
top.
FLETCHER

(in agony)
Here goes -- I didn't fasten
my seatbelt, I didn't glance
in my rearview mirror, I
didn't signal when I pulled
away from the curb, I sped, I
followed too closely, I ran a
stop sign, I almost hit :a
Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a
ge ezer, I sped some more, I
failed to yield at a
crosswalk, I changed lanes in
the intersection, I changed
lanes without signalling, and
I changed lanes in the
INTERSECTION-WITHOUT
signalling while running a red
light and speeding.
A long moment.
POLICE OFFICER
May I see your driver's
license?
FLETCHER
No.
POLICE OFFICER
And why is that?
FLETCHER
It's in my other pants.
POLICE OFFICER
I see. And where are your 
other pants?
FLETCHER
Hanging from my boss's
credenza.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you expect me to believe
that?
FLETCHER
No.
POLICE OFFICER
Do you think I'm an idiot?
FLETCHER
Yes -- but that's beside the
point! My license actually is
in my other pants, and they
actually were hanging from a
credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to
you! I mean, I would if I
could, but I can't!
POLICE OFFICER
I see. So you ..have no reason
to try and hide your license
from me?
FLETCHER
I didn't say that. I have
other reasons. Seventeen
reasons, to be precise.
(begrudgingly,
off the
officer's look)
Unpaid parking tickets.
(BESEECHINGLY)
Be gentle.
A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is
headed to her car.
FLETCHER
Audrey, wait!
AUDREY
Wait? You know, I just had an
insight into myself. I ' m
crazy. You call me up and .
tell me to wait here because
you'll be right over and --
here's the crazy part -- I
actually wait.
FLETCHER
I can explain--
AUDREY
I missed a department meeting.
I. . . Did you come in a cab?
FLETCHER
Yes.
AUDREY
Where's your car?
EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING
Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins
Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.
FLETCHER
Thank you. . I can't tell you
how much this means to me.
AUDREY
I can. One thousand, six
hundred, and fifty-four
dollars and eleven cents.
FLETCHER
Ow.
At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and.
parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
You scratched my car!
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
Where?
.
FLETCHER
Right there!
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
Oh that? That was already
there.
FLETCHER
(OUTRAGED)
Why, you -- you liar! Do you
know what I ' m going to do
about this?
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
What?
FLETCHER
(angrier and
ANGRIER)
...Nothing! Because if I take
you to small-claims court, it
will just drain eight hours
out of my life, and you
probably won't show up, and if
I finally got the judgment
you'd just stiff me anyway, so
what I'm gonna do is piss and
moan like an impotent jerk and
. then bend over and take it up
the tail pipe!
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
You've been here before,
haven't you?
He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.
AUDREY
Well I can't remember when
I've had more fun, now if
you'll excuse me, I have a
class.
She starts out.
FLETCHER
Audrey, wait. I want to talk
to you about this Boston
situation.
. AUDREY
What do you want to say?
FLETCHER
You can't go. It's not fair.
Taking Max three thousand
miles away is not fair.
AUDREY
Let' s define "fair." Last
 night a five-year old boy was
crushed because his father
lied to him about coming to
his birthday party. Fair?
FLETCHER
Last night--
AUDREY
-- Was none of my business.
When it happened two years ago
it was my business, but now I
don't have to care anymore.
See, that's the magic of
div orce . But it does matter
to Max. Everything you do
matters to him... and
everything you don't do.
FLETCHER
All right-- now let me tell
you something...you're
absolutely right. I'm guilty
of all charges. I'm throwing
myself on the mercy of your
-court.
Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very
sincere, but she can't trust him.
FLETCHER {CONT'D)
I have an idea. I'll come
over tonight, right after
court lets out and play with
M ax. Have him invite some
fri ends over. We'll have a
game and everything. Then,
you and I can sit down and
talk.
AUDREY
We're suppose to be on a plane
TONIGHT--
FLETCHER
No, Audrey. Just talk to me
abou t this first. Please.
Au drey, I've lost you. Don't
make me lose Max, too.
AUDREY
You're really coming?
FLETCHER
This is iron-clad. This is
the mother of all promises.
What time?
AUDREY
...Six?
FLETCHER
Ten-to-six.
AU DR EY
(UNSURE)
All right... only if I tell
Max you're coming and you
don't show up and I have to
see that look on Max's face --
that heartbreaking look-- it's
Boston, Fletcher.
FLETCHER.
I will be there.
As Audrey gets in her car -- .
AUDREY
I hope so. Do you know what
your son was doing at nine-
fif teen las t ni ght? He was
making a wish on his birthday
c ake. He was wishing that,
for just one day, his dad
couldn't tell a lie.
She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
when a new thought strikes him.
FLETCHER
Oh my God! That-'s it! An
innocent kid - - a heartfelt
plea-- a birthday wish! Sure,
it' s impossible --but it
'makes sense!..! If he can wish
it, he can unwish it!
They're in the playground just outside the classroom.
FLETCHER
Monster-Max.
MAX
Dadzilla. You came to play
catch?
FLETCHER
No. I ' d like to, but I can't
right now.
Max is disappointed again.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
I ' m sorry I missed your party
la st night. How was your
Uncle Glen?
MAX
Stupid. His big nose and
stupid orange hair...
FLETCHER
That's why he should have worn
make-up.
Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
Max doesn't laugh.
'
MAX .
I want to play kickball with
my friends.-
FLETCHER
Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother
told me about... the wish you
made last night. It came
true.
Max is amazed.
MAX
Really? You mean you have to
tell the truth?
FLETCHER
Yes.
MAX
No matter what?
FLETCHER
No matter what.
Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.
MAX
Is wrestling real?
FLETCHER
In the Olympics, yes.
On
.
Channel 23, no.
MAX
Will sitting close to the TV
set make me go blind?
FLETCHER
Not in a million years.
MAX
If I keep making this face--
(makes a horrible
FACE)
will it get stuck that way?
FLETCHER
Uh-uh.
MAX
.If I go in the water right
after lunch, will I drown?
FLETCHER
Only if you can't 'swim.
MAX
Why do I have to eat squash?
FLETCHER
Because your mom buys it.
MAX
How come you're always too
busy to play with me?
The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels
awful.
FLETCHER
I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey,
you know I'm coming over
to nig ht. We're gonna play
together.
MAX
Baseball?
FLETCHER
. Yes! This is absolutely an
A-number one promise. You and
I -- tonight -- baseball.
Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.
FLETCHER
Now, listen, Max, I need a
favor from you. I ' m in a
little trouble today. I need
you to take that wish back.
MAX
So you can lie?
FLETCHER
Not to you.
MAX
To who?
FLETCHER
Max, sometimes grownups...
need to lie. It's hard to
explain, but i f . . . Look,
here's an example. When Mommy
was pregnant with you, she
gained a little weight.
Se venty pounds. I thought she
was gonna give birth to a car.
But she'd say to me "How do I
lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh,
honey, you're beautiful,
you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I
would've hurt Mommy's
fee ling s. Understand?
Max nods.
MAX
You didn't think she was
beautiful.
FLETCHER
Right. No... Max, I don't
know how to get along in the
grown-up world if I have to
stick to the truth. I could
lose my case, I could lose my
promotion, I could even lose,
my job... Do you understand?
Max shakes his head "no."
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Will you help me anyway?
A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
That's my boy!
Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He
takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on
himself.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Now, do whatever you did last
night... only this time, make
an un-wish.
Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He
takes a breath-- and blows them out.
MAX
I did it. ^
FLETCHER
Great! Great! Now to test --

Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher
hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she
SLAPS HIM.
Fletcher returns to his son.
MAX
Did it work?
FLETCHER
.
.
(rubbing his sore
CHEEK)
Not like I ' d hoped. Did you
really unwish it?
Max nods.
MAX
Only...
FLETCHER
Only what?
MAX
Yesterday, when I wished it, I
r ea lly meant it. This time
when I unwished it I only did
it 'cause you told me to.
FLETCHER
(losing patience)
Well, then do it again.
Only
this time, mean it.
MAX
I can't.
FLETCHER
Why not?!
MAX
Because I don't want you to
lie.
FLETCHER
I explained this to you! I
have to lie. Everybody lies!
Mommy lies, even the wonderful
Jerry lies--
'
MAX
But you're the only one who
makes me feel bad.
.
'
.


Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.
MS. BERRY
(CALLING)
Max, recess 'is over, come on
in.
MAX
I have to go.
FLETCHER
I am coming over, tonight,
Max. You believe me, don't
you?
Max hesitates, then nods.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
I'll see you tonight, buddy...
That's a promise.
Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks
at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.
A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his
office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.
MACHO ATTORNEY
Yo, Fletcher! How's it
hanging?
FLETCHER
Short and shrivelled.
Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He
shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him
anyway.
PHILIP
Fletcher! I'm still waiting
for your call. I guess you
must've lost my card --
FLETCHER
No --
PHILIP
Or my phone was busy --
FLETCHER
No --

PHILIP
Or you just forgot --
FLETCHER
No --
PHILIP
(cannot be
DISCOURAGED)
Or something. So anyway,' why
don't you swing by my place
around seven-thirty!
Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him
resolutely.
FLETCHER
Philip... I don't want to come
over to your house!
A long moment, then --
PHILIP
Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's
this new karaoke bar I've been
dying to try. I'll pick you
up at your office! Seven-
thirty! !
And he runs off.
Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.
Fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable. PHONE
RINGS.
FLETCHER
Hello.
INTERCUT WITH MAX AT HOME. AUDREY IS THERE.
MAX
Dad...
FLETCHER
(summoning up
ENTHUSIASM)
Maxi-pad. How's it going?
MAX
Great. You know Paul and
Emanuel from across the
street?
FLETCHER
The twins.
MAX .
(EXCITEDLY)
Well, they never want to play
baseball with me, but I told
them I was gonna play tonight
with my Dad, so now they want
to play with us. Is it okay?
FLETCHER
Sure.
MAX
Oh boy. We're setting up a
whole field in the yard.
Where we buried Petey the
hamster is second base.
(Fletcher sighs)
You're still coming right?'
FLETCHER
(sees Virginia
APPROACHING)
I'11 be there. I gotta go
now, Max. I'll see you in two
hours.
Max hangs up.
MAX
(to Audrey)
He's really coming.
She smiles, but she's worried. .
COURTHOUSE STEPS

Virginia approaches with her handsome lover, LAURENCE FALK.
VIRGINIA
Mr. Reid, you remember
Laurence Falk, the man from
the tape.
FALK
How are you?
FLETCHER
I've slipped into the seventh
circle of Hell, thank you, and
you?
Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.
VIRGINIA
Shouldn't we go over our
testimony?
FLETCHER
Well, basically the plan is I
walk you through the tape step
by step, I ask you questions--
VIRGINIA
And we give the explanation
you came up with.
FLETCHER
Exactly.
FALK
So all we have to do is lie.
Sounds simple enough.
FLETCHER
Do esn't it? And I'll finish
up with a dramatic series of
questions, something like...
"Mr. Falk, isn't it true that
you and Mrs. Cole have never
made lo--"
But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.
The
others look concerned, but he waves them off.
FLETHCER (CONT'D)
Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk,
isn't it true that you and
Mrs. Cole have never made lo--
IO-.H
To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.
FLETCHER
(to himself)
Oh my God! I can't do it! I
can't finish the question if I
know the answer is a lie!
At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.
MR. ALLAN
Don't let me interrupt,
Fletcher. I just want you to
know I'll be observing this
a fternoon. Miranda insisted I
see you in action.
Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.
MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
I'm looking forward to it. Go
get 'em!
Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving
Fletcher more desperate than before.
FLETCHER
C'mon! Gotta rephrase the
question!
FLETCHER
Respondent calls... Lawrence
Falk.
Fletcher's clears his throat.
Here goes...
FLETCHER
Mr. Falk, do you know my
client, Virginia Cole?
FALK
Yes.
FLETCHER
Isn't it true that your
relationship with my client is
entirely platonic, not?
The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.
It takes everyone by surprise.
FALK
Excuse me?
FLETCHER
If I might rephrase your
Honor.
(trying again)
Is your relationship with my
client entirely patonic, not?
X\
Is your relationship with my
client not entirely platonic?
Is not your relationship with
my client entirely platonic?
(thinks he's got
it, beams with
CONFIDENCE)
Mr. Falk, is not your
relationship with my client
entirely platonic?
FALK
(CONFUSED)
No.
I mean, yes.
I think.
FLETCHER
Yes, is your relationship with
my client not entirely
platonic, or yes, is not your
relationship with my client
entirely platonic?
FALK
What?
FLETCHER
How 'bout just answering the
question you think I'm asking?
'
DANA
Your Honor, he's badgering the
wintness!
JUDGE STEVENS
It's hig witness!
FLETCHER
Did you ever not make lo--
Did you not ever make lo--
(losing it)
YOU HAD SEX WITH HER EVERYTIME
YOU MET, DIDN'T YOU? DIDN'T
YOU?!!
Falk looks shaken as Fletcher barrels on, unable to stop
FLETCHER
(screaming at
HIM)
ADMIT IT! YOU .SLAMMED HER!!
YOU STOKED THE FUR FIRE! YOU
-DID THE YAM DANCE! !
FALK
(breaking down)
YES, YES,-- IT'S TRUE! I
HUMPED HER. BRAINS OUT! !
A GASP from the audience. All eyes are on Fletcher.
FLETCHER
(WEAKLY)
No further questions.
DANA
Uh...no questions.
JUDGE STEVENS
(to Fletcher)
Call your next witness.
FLETCHER
I have no further witnesses,
your Honor.
A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.
JUDGE STEVENS
You have no further
witnesses?!
Fletcher meekly shakes his head, no.
VIRGINIA
(whispers, to
FLETCHER)
What are you doing? Call me.
FLETCHER
(to Virginia)
I can't.
JUDGE STEVENS
Mr. Reid?
VIRGINIA
Call me, damn it!
FLETCHER
You don't understand. I can't
lie . Until nine-sixteen
tonight, I can't even.ask a
question that calls for a lie!
Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.
VIRG INIA
L is ten , you bastard. I want
m y money. I am not gonna wind
up a 31 year old divorce on
welfare because my scum bag
attorney had a sudden attack
of conscience!
Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia
said.
FLETCHER
(to himself)
Thirty-one?
JUDGE STEVENS
Mr. Reid, we're not getting
any younger...
Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup
and her passport.
JUDGE STEVENS
(he's had it)
Mr. Reid you have presented
virtually nothing in the way
of evidence and as such I have
no choice but to rule in favor
of --
FLETCHER
WAIT!
Silence.
FLETCHER
.
(DRAMATICALLY)
Your Honor, I call Virginia
Cole to the stand.
Stunned, Virginia nervously makes her way up,
MR. ALLAN
(in the gallery)
What the hell is he doing?
MIRANDA
Kissing his career goodbye.
The Baliff stands before the witness.
BALIFP
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help
-you God?
VIRGINIA
I do.
Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.
FLETCHER
Mrs. Cole -- may I call you
Virginia?
VIRGINIA
Yes.
FLETCHER
But that would be a lie,
wouldn't it?
VIRGINIA
What do you mean?
FLETCHER
Isn't your true name...
(BRANDISHING
PASSPORT)
Carlotta?!
VIRGINIA
Well, yes. But it wasn't me
so I started using Virginia.
Is there anything wrong with
that?
FLETCHER
.
Not really. It's just the
first and smallest in the
tissue of lies that is the
Kleenex of your life. Let's
take one simple document as a
sample of your veracity, shall
we, Carlotta?
He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,
F LETCHER
Your driver's license. What
color are your eyes?
VIRGINIA
Blue.
FLETCHER
Tru e blue? What if I asked
you to remove your contact
l enses? What color would they
be then?
VIRGINIA
(RELUCTANTLY)
Brown.
FLETCHER
And here it says you're a
b l on de . Are you?
(off her silence)
C'mon, Carlotta, there's a
very easy way for us to check.
If you don't remember, perhaps
Mr. Falk will.
VIRGINIA
Brunette.
FLETCH ER
More like a dirty brown, isn't
it?
(she nods)
Let's see - . - " Weight: one-o-
five"? Please...
VIRGINIA .
One-eighteen.
(off his look)
One-twenty-six. I swear!
FLETCHER
So on this single document,
you basically lied at every
opportunity. I'm sure a woman
as vain as you would also lie
about her age. It says you
were born in 1964. What's the
truth? 1962? '60? How young
did you try to make yourself?
VIRGINIA
(JOYFULLY)
Wrong! I didn't lie to make
myself younger. I made myself
older. I was born in 1965!"
FLETCHER
(FEIGNING
SURPRISE)
What? You're trying to tell
us you lied to make yourself
older?
VIRGINIA
Yes! "
lied so I could get
married! So .there Mister 'I
GOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I-
went-to-law-school'!
JUDGE STEVENS
Mr. Reid, does this have a
point?
FLETCHER
Oh, you bet it does, your
Honor!
(on a roll)
My client lied about her age
because she was only 17 when
s he got married. Which makes
h er a minor. And in the great
state of California, NO MINOR
CAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL
CONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL
CONSENT INCLUDING--
DANA
(defeated, to
HERSELF)
Prenuptual agreements.
FLETCHER
(knows he has
THEM)
PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK
YOU VERY LITTLE! This
contract is void!!! The fact
that my client gets nailed 
more often than a two-by-four
is irrelevant. Standard
community property applies and
this woman is entitled to half
of the marital assets or
thirty-seven point three-nine-
five million dollars!!
(to Dana)
Yo . . . . a e . . . . T A T T T ! !
u
r
OSTT!
(DRAMATICALLY)
Nothing further, your Honor!
A MURMUR OVERTAKES THE ROOM!
/
JUDGE STEVENS
(banging his
GAVEL)
Q uie t! Let me see-the license
and birth certificate.
All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents. Then:
JUDGE STEVENS
In light of this new evidence,
the court must rule in favor
o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is
hereby awarded half of the
marital assets -or thirtyrseven
million three hundred and
ninety-five thousand dollars.
The courtroom ERUPTS.
FLETCHER'S WON!
Dana, Mr. Cole are
devastated.
'
MR. ALLAN
That son of bitch pulled it
off!
Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously,
Miranda gives him the finger.
JUDGE STEVENS
O r d e r ! Order!! Now i
understand both parties have
agreed to joint custody. Is
that correct?
FLETCHER AND DANA
YES--
VIRGINIA
No!
I'm contesting custody.
Fletcher freezes.
FLETCHER
What?
VIRGINIA
(re: her husband)
Payback. For him trying to
prevent me from collecting my
thirty-seven million.
FLETCHER
He was entitled to prevent
you. You committed adultery.'
You only won because you're a
liar, remember? .
VIRGINIA
No. You pointed out that my
husband took advantage of a
poor underage girl. I was the
vic tim here. And now I'm
going to hit him where it
hurts.
FLETCHER
But -- but -- you said he was
a good father.
JUDGE STEVENS
M r. Reid? Do we have an
agreement on custody or not?
Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.
FLETCHER
No.
.
JUDGE STEVENS
In that case, there will be a
custody hearing tomorrow
mor ning at nine. Court is
adj ourned!
He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's
attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her
kids.
VIRGINIA
Stop that! We're leaving now!
CHILD
I want to go with Daddy.
V,'
,-
.-
Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away
from their tearful father.
MR. COLE
Don't worry. I'll see you no
matter what. I promise.
Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.
MR. ALLAN
(re: the
COMMOTION)
I love kids. They give you so
much leverage in a case like
this.
(pats Fletcher on
BACK)
Congratulations, partner. how
does it feel?
And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole
and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a
sledgehammer!
FLETCHER '
Excuse me. Just a second.
(to the Judge)
Y our Honor? Your Honor?
Wait!
JUDGE STEVENS
We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.
FLETCHER
Screw that!! She lies and she
wins ?! What are we, nuts?
Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
T his woman --my client --
goes down with the frequency
of a nuclear submarine and we
just gave her thirty seven
million dollars because she's
a liar! And now as an extra
added little bonus, we're
going to let her steal, the
kids, too?
JUDGE STEVENS
Mr. Reid, you are out of
order!
FLETCHER
(SCREAMING)
 SO'S THE HAND DRYER IN THE
MEN'S ROOM!! Do you ever stop
to ask yourself, why do people
hate us? Could it be because
what we did here today sucks?!
We don't care about the truth!
We don't want to find the
t r u th ! We want to win! We
want to win at all costs...and
you know what the worst thing
about wanting to win so badly
i s ? WINNING! Winning and
finding out you're left with
nothing!
JUDGE STEVENS
That's enough, Mr. Reid --
FLETCHER
-Let' s see what I' ve done
today. I've helped a gold
digging slut get richer. I'm
taking this guy's kids away.
(to Mr. Allan)
I don't like you in the least,
now I'm one of your partners!
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE MR. ALLAN? IT FEELS LIKE
SHIT! BUT TO TELL YOU IT
FEELS LIKE SHIT, FEELS FUCKING
GREAT 1 I
Fletcher does feel strangely fantastic. Free,
JUDGE STEVENS
That's it, Mr..Reid.
I find
you in contempt!
FLETCHER
GOOD! I'M CONTEMPTIBLE! MY
WHOLE GODDAMN LIFE IS JUST ONE
BIG FAT FIB! YOU LIKE MY
HAIR? --
(mussing hair)
MOUSSED! SHOULDERS --
(ripping out
PADS)
PADDED! SHOES --
(kicking them
OFF)
LIFTED! TEETH --
(pulling out
CAPS)
CAP PED! FIV E-NIN ETY A
CHICKLET!!
COMMOTION in the court.
The judge BANGS HIS GAVEL!!!
JUDGE STEVENS
Bailiff! Remove Mr. Reid from
the courtroom!
FLETCHER
Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh
yeah, let's let it rain... The
truth is is that I've traded
my life...a beautiful wife, an
incredible son for THIS PISS
POT OF BIG DOUBLE O'S!
The bailiff grabs Fletcher, forces him out...
FLETCHER
GO AHEAD, YOUR HONOR, BANG
YOUR GAVEL .-- KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF YOU'RE A BIG SHOT! DO
I SENSE A CASE OF GAVEL ENVY!!
WHAT'S THAT UNDER YOUR ROBE --
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE?!!
(the judge is
turning beet
RED)
. I TOUCHED A NERVE DIDN'T I?
WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT
ARTISTS!! IS THAT THE TRUTH
IN YOUR PANTS OR ARE YOU JUST
HAPPY TO SEE ME??
Fletcher is pushed passed Mr. Allan.
MR. ALLAN
You just killed your career.
I hope you're happy.
FLETCHER
I'M BEYOND HAPPY MY BUTT FACED
FRIEND--- I'M EUPHORIC!
A sad Max is seated on the steps. TWO other BOYS are there
with baseball equipment.
PAUL
We're going home.
EMMANUEL
Yeah, thanks for the great
game, Max.
Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from
the door. She goes and sits by her son.
AUDREY
Max, honey. Your dad had a
very big case today. It
probably just--
MAX
I don't want to talk about it.
AUDREY
Okay.
MAX
(SUDDENLY)
I hate dad! I hate him!
AUDREY
Honey, don^t say that.
Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The
look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a
decision.
AUDREY
Max, there's something I-want
to talk to you about. . .
Fletcher's driving like a madman...
FLETCHER
(on his phone)
Answeransweransweranswer...
We HEAR a RECORDED VOICE:

VOICE
The subscriber you called is
either unavailable or outside
the calling area.
FLE TCHER
Shit!!
'
Fletcher frantically tries to hail a...
FLE TCHER
T axi!
Taxi!!
No luck. He spots
A PAYPHONE
digs through the Yellow Pages. Finds "Ten Minute Taxi".
Yes ! He fishes for change. Shit! He doesn't have any!!
FLETCHER
(looking
.
HEAVENWARD)
Noooo!!!
He spots a man walking by.
FLETCHER
'Scuse me, sir. Do you have
any - -
The man turns. It's the same BEGGAR Fletcher was rude to
outside the courthouse.
BEGGAR
Change? Absolutely.
He continues walking.
FLETCHER
Could you spare some?
BEGGAR
Unquestionably.
The beggar continues on.
'
FLETCHER
Alright, I get your point.
But this is a crisis! Look,
I'll give you ten bucks.
The beggar pulls out a quarter and holds it up.
BEGGAR
(ADMIRING
QUARTER)
It's so shiny and new.
FLETCHER
Tw ent y.
.
BEGGAR
Minted in Denver.
Imagine
that.
FLETCHER
Thirty-four. That's all I
have.
A moment as the beggar thinks, then:
BEGGAR
It's worth twice that to screw
you.
He walks off, grinning.
FLETCHER
JERKOFF!
BEGGAR
LAWYER!
Fletcher turns, spots a familiar building in the distance.
FLE TCH ER
M y office!!
Philip's car skids to a stop.
Fletcher jumps out.
He scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane
which is moving away.
No way he'll catch it.
Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT
(These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets
an insane idea. . .
The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER
in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.
WORKER
Hey!!
Hey!!!!
But Fletcher's gone.
Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the
plane. GROUND WORKERS react.
Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.
Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low
to see in the plane.
He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on
the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS
THE STEPS!
The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.
Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane
POINT, STARE in amazement.
Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO
THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.
At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS.
He surfs under the wing...
...
and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side.
Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally
spots. . .
MAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD
Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him.
Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his
seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER.
Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO
NOISY.
Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!
FLETCHER'S POV
The RUNWAY is ENDING!.
Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now
trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.
AUDREY
(checks under his
SEAT)
It's right here, honey.
M AX
Mom!
Mom!!
'
AUDREY
Just a second, Max.
MAX
Mom, it's dad!
AU DREY
W hat? What about dad?
Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...
AUDREY
Fletcher?!
AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN!
BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading 
right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE
CART. . -
And BAM!
FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!
Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A
MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE!
CLOSE ON FLETCHER
With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's
in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.
CUT TO:
Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a
shoe, and still holding the compress.
FLETCHER
(WEAKLY)
Greta? Is that you?
He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY
waiting for him just outside the door.
Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY.
He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.
FLETCHER
(to Audrey and
Jerry, trying to
seem chipper)
Sorry I made you miss your
flight, not really.
(no response)
You're obviously a little
. upset, not that I blame you...
although I'll bet you'll still
get the bonus miles. . .
AUDREY
Fletcher, are you crazy?
What were you doing?
FLETC HER
That's two questions. A; Yes,
but I think the legal term is
temporarily insane. And B; I
was trying to finally have
that talk with you about
Boston.
Audrey's patience are growing thin...
FLETCHER
Okay, okay... The whole truth
and nothing but the truth,
(with difficulty,
SINCERELY)
I tried to stop the plane
because it was taking off with
my life... you and Max.
This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher
said, but the way he said it.
FLETCHER
I know you've met somebody...
somebody pretty great... and
the truth is I wish you didn't
but you did and... All I ' m
asking i s . . . Please don't move
to Boston. Please don't take
Max away.
She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.
AUDREY
You can come visit anytime.
It's only a four hour flight.
FLETCHER
I don't want to visit him.
That's what I've been doing--
visiting him, dropping by,
stopping in. I want to be in
his life. I don't want to be
some jerk that sees him at
Easter. I want to be his
father.
Fletcher turns to Jerry.
FLETCHER
I know I have no right to ask,
but can I talk you out of
taki ng that job? I can get
you a better job here in L.A.
I've got all kinds of
connect ions... what do you do
again?
JERRY
I design security systems.
FLETCHER
How symbolic. Okay great.
You know Pac-Tec?
JERRY
The biggest.
FLETCHER
One of their systems shorted
out and burned down a
supermarket. I got them off.
Another proud day for justice.
If I ask them they'll beat
your Boston offer in two
s ec on ds .
..
AUDREY
Don't put Jerry in the middle.
JERRY
It's okay.
(to Fletcher)
Boston means this
(snaps his
FINGERS)
to me. All I want is for this
lady and Max to be happy.
Preferably, with me. Whatever
they want, I'll go along with.
They both look to Audrey.
AUDREY
All I want is for Max to be
happy.
Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
stairs. He's still upset.
AUDREY
You better know your jury.
You're hot exactly Max's hero
today.
FLETCHER
Just let me present my case.
Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,
TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.
FLETCHER/TERMINATOR
I have been sent from the
future to destroy you. . .
Argghhh!
(no response, a
BEAT)
You mad at me?
Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:
FLETCHER
You wanted me to stop lying.
But lying isn't the problem. ..
Why we lie ~ that's the
problem. Sometimes we lie to
make someone else feel better.
But sometimes we lie because
the truth gets in our way...
(touches him)
But being an adult means you
sacrifice some things for more
important things. Much more
important things. I was so
stupid, Max.
(pointing to his
own head)
Malfunction in vector one.
All this time you've been here
and I could see you anytime I
felt like it. And I...
didn't. Please don't go to
Boston. Max, I love you more
than anything else in the
world and you know it's true.
I couldn't say it if it
weren't true. Not today.
A moment as Max studies his father, then:
MAX
(to Audrey)
He's telling the truth, Mom.
He's not allowed to lie. I
made a wish and anything Dad
says has to be the truth.
(to Fletcher) ..
Right?
But Fletcher's looking at his watch...
FLETCHER
Max. .. it's 9:22.
AUDREY
What?
FLETCHER
Max, you made the wish at
9:15. I've been able to lie
for the last seven minutes.
Max steps away from Fletcher.
MAX
So then, you were...
FLETCHER
No! It wasn't a lie. I just
wanted to be honest with you
and tell you -- there was no
wish to guarantee it anymore.
You just have to believe me.
Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.
MAX
(to Audrey)
Mommy... do we have to go to
Boston?
Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.
AUDR EY
No.
We don't have to.
Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
never let you go."
MAX
(to Fletcher)
Can we play catch tomorrow?
Fletcher smiles. . .
A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...
M AX
Dad! !
FLETCH ER
Ma x i mu m ! !
Fletcher picks Max up.
MAX
Transformer!!! .
Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...
FLETCHER
Malfunction in vector seven.
I have lost control of my
affection reflex...
Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
sees Audrey.
FLETCHER
Procreate!
Procreate!
AUDREY
(PLAYFULLY)
Fletcher... You're gonna lose
a limb--
MAX
Come on, dad, let's play
catch!!
FLETCHER
Sr. . .
UE
(starts to toss
MAX)
Here you go, mom.
(Max screams)
Oh, you mean with a ball...
He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.
FLETCHER
I take back every dirty,
dishonest thing I ever said
about you, wrote about you,
faxed about you, E-mailed
about you.
JERRY
Appreciated.
Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.
FLETCHER
So, you up for a little
friendly competition?
JERRY
No, you go play with your son.
FLETCHER
I wasn't talking about
basesball.
A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the
ball to Max.
FLETCHER
(to Max)
Alright, it's time to show you
the old Fletcher Reid change up.
Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then
instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP.
Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.
There may be better things in life... but at this moment,
it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.
