      Like a pack of hyenas taking down a bull elephant, the three 
      Caddies work in perfect coordination to try and bring down 
      the Armored Truck.  

      In unison, the Caddies each glide up to a separate truck 
      wheel, lower their windows -- and open up on the tires with 
      AK-47s.  BRRRAAAPPP!  In the blink of an eye, the rubber 
      tires are chewed up and the Truck is hobbled, grinding down 
      the road in a shower of sparks.

      And just as we think Ryan and Cassius are going to join the 
      pack and help them stop the truck --

      Ryan glides up on the rearmost Caddy, cranks the wheel and -- 
      WHAM! -- sends it violently spinning out of the chase with a 
      skillful PIT MANEUVER.

      As Caddy #1 spins out, Ryan punches the gas, pops the curb 
      and speeds down the sidewalk to pull up alongside Caddy #2, 
      positioning Cassius to -- BOOM!  BOOM! -- send two slugs into 
      the engine block, instantly disabling the vehicle.  But just 
      then --


      ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRUCK

      Caddy #3 has a nice little surprise...and tosses a Chinese 
      TYPE 72 LANDMINE under the Armored Truck s right front wheel.  
      And when the truck runs over it --

      KA-BOOOOM!  The Truck s right side ERUPTS VIOLENTLY off the 
      ground, flipping over toward --


      RYAN AND CASSIUS

      -- who see the behemoth truck about to crush them.

                                    CASSIUS
                    BRAKE! BRAKE! BRAKE!

      But instead Ryan does the opposite and PUNCHES THE GAS --

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    NO NO NO NO!!

      -- but the move is the right one and lets them zoom clear as 
      the Truck DETONATES into the ground an inch behind them. 

      Ryan turns and smiles.

                                  RYAN
                    Gotta stop doubting me, dude.

      With razor-sharp reflexes, Ryan yanks the wheel and skids 
      around to face the final Caddy, dead ahead.                                                                                        3.


      But Caddy #3 is ready.  Turns their guns on Ryan s Hemi and 
      OPENS FIRE --

      Bullets punch through the car, shatter the windshield, but 
      Ryan hammers the gas and shrieks through the deadly 7.62 
      caliber hailstorm to --

      WHAAAAM!!  Ryan s Hemi T-bones the Caddy and sends it 
      tumbling wildly down the road.  After four or five 
        revolutions, the Caddy finally crunches to a stop.  Dazed, 
      the tatted Skinhead gangsters stumble from the car -- only to 
      find Ryan and Cassius striding up, shotguns leveled.  Badges 
      around their neck.

                                  SKINHEAD DRIVER
                    You don t look like cops.

                                    CASSIUS
                    We re not.

                                  RYAN
                    Gang Task Force.  You re under 
                    arrest.

      Just then, a ton of San Francisco black and whites swoop in 
      and take custody of the gang members.  

      Cassius looks at Ryan, proud.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Look at you.  A month ago, you re 
                    riding patrol, handing out parking 
                    tickets.  And now you ve made your 
                    first bust with the GTF.

                                  RYAN
                          (grins)
                    Was it good for you?

                                    CASSIUS
                    Man, now you re making it weird.

      Just then, O.S.:

                                  VOICE (OS)
                    Sure there s nothing else you want 
                    to destroy while you re at it?

      They turn as one of the patrol officers - JOHN TANNER -- 
      strides up.  

                                  RYAN
                    Nah, I m good.

                                  TANNER
                    You sure?  I mean, there s a 
                    building still standing over there--                                                                                      4.


                                  RYAN
                    You keep running that jaw, I m sure 
                    I ll think of something to shatter.

      Tanner walks right up to Ryan.  But just when it looks like 
      they're about to square off...they both bust up laughing.

                                  TANNER
                    Drinks after shift are on me.

      Tanner grins and claps him on the shoulder.

                                  TANNER (CONT D)
                    Proud of you, partner.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Former partner.

                                  RYAN
                          (smiles at Cassius)
                    Now you re making it weird.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A man-made island halfway between San Francisco and Oakland.  
      Originally constructed for the World s Fair in  36, then 
        commandeered by the Navy during WWII, the buildings are an 
      odd mix of Art Deco flourish and military spartanism.

      Among these, FIND a small naval prison, now turned Gang Task 
      Force Headquarters -- known affectionately as  The Brig .



      Ryan and Tanner stumble out of the bar.  Tanner fumbles in 
      his pocket for something.

                                  RYAN
                    What are you doing?

      By way of an answer, Tanner holds up his KEYS.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    No.                                                                                    10.


                                  TANNER
                    I m fine!  Give me a Field Sobriety 
                    test!

                                  RYAN
                    Okay, here you go --

      And Ryan snatches the keys away.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Failed.

                                  TANNER
                    Hey!  Hey!!
                          (then suddenly serious)
                    What did the policeman say to his 
                    belly button?
                          (beat)
                    You re under a vest.

      Ryan stares at Tanner as he cracks himself up.

                                  RYAN
                      Definitely getting you a cab.

      Ryan pulls out his cellphone and starts to dial, when --

                                  TANNER
                    Hey, yo, check it!

      Ryan turns to see Tanner pointing out into the dark.  Across 
      an empty field, they see a FIGURE tagging an abandoned 
      warehouse -- a young Korean street punk with a bad FAUX HAWK, 
      a distinctive RED JACKET.  

                                  TANNER (CONT D)
                    Tagger.

      Instantly, Tanner starts to move off in the direction of the 
      warehouse.

                                  RYAN
                    Wait, whoa.  

                                  TANNER
                    Come on.  We ll scare the piss out 
                    of him --

                                  RYAN
                    Nah, man.  It s late.  We ll call 
                    it in.

                                  TANNER
                    He ll be gone by then and you know 
                    it.  Come on.  It ll be fun!  Like 
                    old times!
                          (then)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  TANNER (CONT'D)
                    What, you too high and mighty now 
                    to do a little community service, 
                      detective?
                          (then grins)
                    Come on, brother.

      And Ryan relents.  



      There's a sense of fun as the two sneak up on the warehouse, 
      set to surprise what they think are kids.  But when they 
      spring from around the corner --

                                  TANNER
                    What do you kids think you re--?

      -- everything changes.  

      Four CORPSES litter the ground.  Bound and butchered.  
      Members of the OAKLAND LORDS by the look of them.  

      Instantly sober, Ryan and Tanner draw their guns and begin 
      sweeping the shadows.  Suddenly --

      SFX:  A NOISE from O.S.

      Wordlessly, Ryan and Tanner signal each other and move in 
      opposite directions to check it out.  

      TRACK WITH Ryan as he slips through the dark.  The tension is 
      palpable.  Someone could be hiding anywhere.  Then --

      SFX:  SHUFFLING.  FROM UP AHEAD. 

      Coming from an open door leading into blackness at the end of 
      the hall... 

      Wary, Ryan steps closer.  Closer...  Pauses at the threshold 
      to steel his nerves.  Then steps in just as --

      A FERAL DOG comes leaping from the darkness, snarling and 
      snapping!  

      Ryan slams the door an inch ahead of the rabid bitch, who 
      claws and growls to get at him.

      But as Ryan backs away, trying to shake out the jitters --

      SFX:  BANG-BANG-BANG! 

      And Ryan is MOVING!  Homing in on the sound of the gunshots.  
      Races through the darkened building and rounds a corner...

      ...to find Tanner standing there, staring right at Ryan with 
      the most curious expression on his face.                                                                                    12.


                                  RYAN
                    Tanner..?

      Then -- BANG! -- one final shot rings out and Tanner 
      crumples, his body falling away... to REVEAL A FIGURE 
      standing behind him, his upper-torso obscured in shadow, the 
      barrel of his DISTINCTIVE STAINLESS STEEL GUN still smoking.

      And Ryan has the sonofabitch dead to rights.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    DROP YOUR WEAPON!!

      Calmly, the Figure lowers his gun.  There's a beat...then the 
      Figure takes a step forward.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    STAY WHERE YOU ARE!  DON T MOVE!

      Ryan's finger tightens on the trigger as the Figure takes one 
      more step.  Into the light.  And now we SEE the killer's 
      face.  

      But what's more is we see that the killer and Ryan recognize 
      each other.  

      A smile crosses the killer's face (who we'll call TORRES from 
      this point out).  And Ryan does the last thing we expect a 
      cop to do when facing a cop killer...

      He lowers his gun.

      Then Ryan nods, knowing what has to happen next.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Do it.

      And off his command, Torres raises his gun and -- BANG! -- 
      shoots Ryan, who collapses like a heartshot deer.  

      Laughing, Torres walks away as Ryan, laying on the ground, 
      staring at his dead friend, just lets him go...


                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    13.


                                            ACT TWO



      Ryan lays in a bed, a tube sticking out of his chest.  The 
      DOCTOR is examining him.  Chapel sits in the corner watching 
      everything, his concern almost paternal.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Shot went in just beneath the 
                    shoulder, caused a pneumothorax.  
                    Air filled your chest cavity and 
                    squeezed your lungs.  That s why 
                    you blacked out.  We put the tube 
                    in, got rid of the air in there.
                          (examines the tube)
                    Take a deep breath.  Hold it.

      When Ryan does, the Doc YANKS OUT THE TUBE.  Ryan roars in 
      pain.  Chapel reacts.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Jesus, Doc.  How about some 
                    warning?!

                                  DOCTOR
                            (nonchalant)
                    It s worse when they tense up, 
                    believe me.

      The Doctor slaps an Asherman seal on the wound.

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    You need to follow up with an x-ray 
                    in a couple of days.  No flying for 
                    six weeks.  No rigorous activity.  
                    I ll prescribe meds for pain.

                                  CHAPEL
                    How long should he stay home for?

                                  DOCTOR
                    That s up to him.  The bullet 
                    didn t touch his lungs, arteries, 
                    internal organs...
                          (to Ryan)
                    You re one lucky guy.

      Ryan glares at him, thinking of his dead friend.  The Doctor 
      instantly realizes his mistake.

                                  DOCTOR (CONT D)
                    Look, I m sorry --

      But Chapel intervenes.                                                                                    14.


                                  CHAPEL
                    Can you give me a minute with him?

                                  DOCTOR
                    Sure.  I-- I ll go see about 
                    getting him discharged.

      And the Doctor beats a hasty retreat.  When he s gone, Chapel 
      sits beside Ryan, who s lost in a sea of guilt threatening to 
      break him.

                                  CHAPEL
                    Look, kid...  I know how close you 
                    and Tanner were.

                                  RYAN
                    It s my fault --

                                  CHAPEL
                    No, it s not.  You did everything 
                    you could.

      The words twist in Ryan s gut like a knife.

      Just then, a COP opens the door and signals Chapel.  Whispers 
      something into his ear.  When the Cop is gone, Chapel turns 
      to Ryan.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Listen.  I.A. is outside.  They 
                    want to talk to you.

                                  RYAN
                    I just want to go home.

                                  CHAPEL
                    I ll see what I can do.

      Chapel moves to open the door, but pauses at the threshold.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    We re gonna find who did this.  And 
                    we ll see justice done for Tanner.  
                    That s a promise.



      Tae and Vee walk the crime scene from the night before.  A 
      bunch of forensics guys are taking photos, doing their thing.    

                                  VEE
                    Shooter was here.  In the dark.
                          (beat)
                    They never had a chance.

                                  TAE
                    Did Lopez get a description?

                                  VEE
                    No.
                          (indicates)
                    Tanner s body was here.

      Tae looks at the pin flags outlining where Tanner s body was.  
      Also notes the FOUR SHELL CASINGS ejected from the shooter s 
      gun. 

      Tae scans the area.  Points to a empty patch of ground.

                                  TAE
                    And that s where they found Lopez?

                                  VEE
                    Yeah.

      Tae walks over.  Looks around.  By the look on his face, Vee 
      can tell something s not quite right.

                                  VEE (CONT D)
                    See something?

                                  TAE
                    No...
                          (turns)
                    That s the problem.

      And as Tae walks off, keeping his thoughts to himself --

                                                                            CUT TO:



      -- where a neighborhood barbecue is going on.  The house is 
      sophisticated and well-appointed.  There's music, kids, fun.  
      A real community vibe -- not at all what we expect of the 
      home of a capitan of the Familia Sud.  



      A beautiful hillside cemetery with panoramic views of the 
      Bay.

      A full, military-style police funeral for Tanner is underway.  
      The entire Department has turned out to honor the fallen.  
      It's a somber ceremony; a moment for every cop to reflect.

      In an emotional scene, Ryan presents the flag to Tanner's 
      WIDOW.  As he does so, PAN ACROSS the faces of the Gang Task 
      Force.  Chapel.  Vee.  Cassius.  The sadness in everyone's 
      eyes is palpable. 

      Except for Tae, who stares intently at Ryan with something 
      more akin to suspicion...

      PRELAP:  PARTY MUSIC and --

                                                                          SMASH TO:



      San Francisco s  Korean business district.  A city council 
      sign proudly proclaims: 

                      KOREATOWN.  THE SOUTH BAY S GOT SEOUL!



      Cassius and Ryan walk the street.  As they near, people 
      disappear into buildings, wanting nothing to do with the 
      cops.  SPOTTERS start shouting up the street.

                                  SPOTTERS
                    Two-five!  Two-five!

      Ryan turns to Cassius.

                                  RYAN
                    Guess we ve been announced.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Yeah.

                                  RYAN
                    What s two-five?

                                    CASSIUS
                    Half of 5-0.  Half a cop.  They re 
                    just messin  with you.

                                  RYAN
                    How do you know they re not just 
                    messing with you?

      Just then, Cassius spies the informant he's looking for -- a 
      300 lb. blob of a man named PEE WEE.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    That s Pee Wee?

      When Pee Wee sees them coming, he looks like he's going to 
      run.  Cassius breaks out laughing.                                                                                      33.


                                    CASSIUS
                    Aw, c mon, man.  Now that s just 
                    sad.  Even you know you don t got a 
                    block in you.  

                                  PEE WEE
                    I can run!

                                    CASSIUS
                    You run, you re gonna set off every 
                    car alarm in the neighborhood.
                    Look at you.  Even your clothes 
                    have stretch marks.  Now just come 
                    over here and talk to us.  Don t 
                    make me harpoon your ass.

      Pee Wee hesitates...but ultimately he turns and waddles over.

                                  PEE WEE
                    Why you gotta be so mean, yo?

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:



      A colorful family restaurant/Acosta shell corporation in the 
      Latin Quarter...



      Ryan pulls up to a maelstrom of activity.  The entire Task 
      Force is clad in tactical gear and racing into a SWAT VAN.                                                                                    42.


                                    CASSIUS (OS)
                    Hey --

      Ryan turns as Cassius runs up, tosses him a Kevlar vest.  
      Grabs him.  Guides him to the van.

                                  RYAN
                    What s going on?

      Just then, Chapel steps up.

                                  CHAPEL
                    We got the name of our shooter.  
                    Miguel Torres.  Works with the 
                    Familia and he s a Two Striker.  I 
                    want that gun he shot Tanner with --
                          (looks at all his guys)
                    -- but I ll settle for anything.  
                    Whatever gets this guy off the 
                    street.

      Nearby, Vee takes particular note of this statement.

                                  CHAPEL (CONT D)
                    Let s go take him down.

      And as the van door slams closed on Ryan s shocked face, CUT 
      TO:



      The SWAT VAN arrives and disgorges its occupants.  

      The Task Force moves through the apartment complex, zeroing 
      in on Torres's unit. 

      When everyone s stacked up outside his apartment, Chapel nods 
      and Tae quietly slips an envelope under the door, whispering:

                                  TAE
                      ...warrant...

      Then -- BOOOM!!!  They shatter the door with a RAM and storm 
      in.

      With practiced precision, the team splits off into two-man 
      teams, each taking a room.


      TRACK WITH RYAN AND CASSIUS

      as they move toward the rear of the apartment, kick open the 
      master bedroom door -- and spy Torres s just as he slips out 
      the open window!                                                                                    44.


                                    CASSIUS
                    FREEZE, MOTHERFU--!

      But Torres is gone.  

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                          (calling to the team)
                    HE S RUNNING!

                                  RYAN
                    Cassius --

      But Cassius bolts out the window after him.



      Torres has dropped to a lower roofline and is booking across 
      the rooftop.  Cassius drops after him, in hot pursuit, and 
      Ryan a heartbeat later.

      TORRES hauls ass across the rooftop, leaping vents and 
      ducking pipes, finally sprinting over a 2x10  PLANK laid from 
      ledge of this building to the next.

      When he s across, Torres turns and shoves the plank, sending 
      it toppling four stories to the asphalt below a heartbeat 
      before Cassius and Ryan pull up short at the ledge.

      Cassius is furious.  Ryan is secretly happy Torres is getting 
      away.  He puts a hand on Cassius s shoulder and starts to 
      lead him away --

                                  RYAN
                    Come on, we ll get him next time.

      -- when Cassius is overcome with rage.  And before Ryan can 
      stop him, Cassius books for the edge -- and LEAPS ACROSS to 
      continue the chase.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Goddamn it...

      Now Ryan is forced to follow in hopes of helping Torres slip 
      free.  Swallowing his fear, Ryan runs and makes the jump as 
      well.



      Ryan and Cassius blast through a maze of alleyways, pursuing 
      Torres in a CRAZY FOOT CHASE FOR THE AGES.  

      Torres pulls out all the stops, racing through traffic and 
      vaulting across moving cars in a suicidal bid to escape.  

      When they reach a fork in the path, Ryan tries to point 
      Cassius in the wrong direction --                                                                                    45.


                                  RYAN
                    This way!

      -- but Cassius s instincts are solid and chooses the right 
      path.

                                    CASSIUS
                    No, here!

      Eventually they come to a SERIES OF ALLEYS where they need  
      to -- 

                                    CASSIUS (CONT D)
                    SPLIT UP!

      Ryan chooses the right direction and sees Torres ahead, 
      racing right into --

      -- a DEAD END ALLEY.

      Ryan pours on the steam, running after Torres.  When he 
      reaches him, he turns to get him the hell out of there --

                                  RYAN
                    Come on!  HURRY!!

      -- when Cassius rounds the corner a block away.  

      Instantly, Torres tries to run -- but Ryan grabs him and 
      TACKLES him to the ground.  Hard.

      As the two impact the ground --


      ECU - RYAN S VEST

      as his burner SIM CARD pops from his pocket and falls 
      unnoticed to the alley floor... 


      BACK TO SHOT

      Torres is enraged.  

                                  TORRES
                    Are you crazy?!  What are you 
                    doing?  You gotta let me go!!

      But seeing Cassius running closer, Ryan roughly cuffs Torres, 
      whispering in his ear:

                                  RYAN
                    It s too late.  We got two seconds.  
                    What s in the apartment?  What can 
                    they find on you?

                                  TORRES
                    Nothin !                                                                                    46.


                                  RYAN
                    Drugs?  Money?

                                  TORRES
                    No.  I m totally clean --

      Ryan s relieved.  Until:

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    -- except for the gun.

      Torres looks Ryan dead in the eye.

                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    And if they find it and I go 
                      down...I m taking your sleeper ass 
                    with me.
                          (malicious little grin)
                    You got some decisions to make, 
                    moco.

      And as Ryan s world spins, Cassius arrives.

                                    CASSIUS
                    Good catch, brother.
                          (into his radio)
                    10-95.  Suspect in custody.

      And as Cassius yanks Torres to his feet, CUT TO:



      -- to where Torres is sitting in the squad car.

                                  RYAN
                    You re clean.

                                  TORRES
                    Then I guess your secrets are safe 
                    a little longer.

      But just then, Vee steps out of the apartment --

                                  VEE
                    Look what I found.

      -- and she holds up the HUGE BAG OF ECSTACY we saw in the 
      karaoke bar.  Vee shoots a vengeful little smile at Torres.

                                  VEE (CONT D)
                    May not be a murder charge...but 
                    Third Strike s a bitch.

      And as Vee heads back in, Torres glares menacingly at Ryan.

                                  TORRES
                    Guess I spoke too soon.


                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                    49.





                                          ACT FIVE



      -- to his car.  Throws open the glove box, reaches behind and 
      opens a SECRET COMPARTMENT that holds several BURNER SIM 
      CARDS.  Tears one out, slams it into his phone and dials.

      As the phone rings, MATCH CUT TO --


      DANTE - IN A GARAGE

      -- where he and ten other soldados are gearing up for war.  
      Dante is breaking heavy shotguns and full-auto street 
      sweepers out of lockers when his cellphone begins BUZZING.  
      He checks the number and picks up.                                                                                    50.

                                  RYAN
                    I lost the other.  Burn it.  

                                  DANTE
                    Not good, brother. 

                                  RYAN
                    Forget it, we ve got bigger 
                    problems.

                                  DANTE
                    I know, I ve been trying to reach 
                    you.  We got a hit on the wire.  
                    The Lords and the Colombians are 
                    doing the Fishscale trade down at 
                    the old Transit Terminal on Mission 
                    an hour from now.  We ve scrambled 
                    a crew of hitters and we re going 
                    to break it up.  I need you to keep 
                    the cops in the dark as long as you 
                    can.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, well I kinda got my hands 
                    full.  Torres is in custody.

                          (then)
                    You gotta get him out of there --

                                  RYAN
                    I can t.

                                  DANTE
                    If he talks --

                                  RYAN
                    I know.

                                  DANTE
                    It ain t good enough to know.  You 
                    gotta do something about it.  
                    Whatever it takes.

      And Dante hangs up.  Ryan s world is quickly becoming a 
      whirlpool of shit.  Everything s spinning out of control.



      As Torres's LAWYER arrives.  

                                  VEE
                    Mr. Rhymes?

      Tae and Vee greet him, and as they escort him through the 
      building toward Torres's cell, SMASH BACK TO:


      TORRES S CELL

      With time running out, Ryan turns to Torres.

                                  RYAN
                    What if I gave you something else?

                                  TORRES
                          (shrugs)
                    Doubt it will be good enough.                                                                                    53.



        A long-abandoned terminal for transbay buses...

      Now PULL BACK TO REVEAL Ryan and the rest of the Gang Task 
      Force setting up outside the structure, while --



      With backup from the S.F.P.D., the Gang Task Force readies to 
      move in on the handoff.

                                  CHAPEL
                    I want two stinger squads, six men 
                    apiece.  Simultaneous breech, front 
                    and back.  I ll lead Alpha through 
                    the front.

      And just then, Ryan remembers Dante s warning.  Speaks up.                                                                                    56.


                                  RYAN
                    Not the front.
                          (off Chapel s look)
                    Lords have been sending some of 
                    their guys through the military.  
                    They know to heavy-stack their 
                    softest entry points.  You ll be 
                    walking into a hailstorm.

      Chapel considers, then nods, trusting Ryan s instincts.

                                  CHAPEL
                    We ll breech from the side.  We 
                    move in five, strike in 30.  Go.

      And the teams move out.


      SERIES OF SHOTS - THE RAID - CONTINUOUS

      In perfect coordination, the Task Force moves in from the 
      side, and on cue -- KA-BOOOOM! -- effects entry.  Sweeps 
      through the building in a pincer formation, getting the drop 
      on the drug trade.

                                  TASK FORCE OFFICERS
                    POLICE DEPARTMENT!  GET DOWN!! 

      The Lords know enough to instantly give up, the Colombians 
      try to shoot their way out in a BRIEF BUT INTENSE GUNFIGHT.

      Cassius, Tae and Vee exchange fire with the enemy, each 
      taking out targets in individual hero moments...

      But the fight only comes to an end when Ryan makes a bold 
      move, dashing across a no man s land of gunfire to slide 
      under some construction equipment and take down the 
      Colombians  leader.  With Ryan's gun to the Kingpin s head --

                                  RYAN
                    It s over!

      -- the rest of the Colombians give up.

                                                              SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


      Cassius and Ryan walk to their cars together.  More a team 
      now than ever before.  They say their goodbyes and as they 
      drive away, CUT TO:

      door.  A moment later, Jess opens it.  Ryan isn't two steps 
      inside before they begin to kiss.  And as Ryan scoops her up 
      and carries her to the bedroom, DISSOLVE TO...

      forgotten SIM CARD laying on the ground.  Then, a moment 
      later, a MYSTERIOUS HAND reaches in and picks it up.  And as 
      we're left wondering just who the hell found it, CUT TO:

      and stumbles drunkenly to his car.  He fumbles with the keys 
      and gets in.  But as he goes to put the key into the 
      ignition, he NOTICES something sitting on his dashboard:  THE 
      DISTINCTIVE GUN TORRES KILLED TANNER WITH.

                                  TORRES
                    How the hell..?

      As he stares as the piece, unbeknownst to him, we NOTICE Pee 
      Wee and a half-dozen Lords materialize from the dark and 
      surround the car.

      After a moment, Torres looks up and sees that he s 
      surrounded.  And then in unison, the Lords sweep their 
      jackets open and draw an array of AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY.                                                                                    59.


                                  TORRES (CONT D)
                    Oh God no NO --

      Torres cries out in fear, but the Lords unload and -- 
        BRRRRAAAAAPPPPPPPP! -- the gunshots cut him off.  The 
      vengeful fusillade goes on and on, Torres s car and body 
      being obliterated by a thousand bullets.

      In the end, when all their magazines have been emptied, 
      Torres slumps dead.  And as the Lords melt back into the 
      shadows, PULL BACK across the street...

      ...to where Ryan sits in his car, having had a front row seat 
      to the whole show.  With the death of his friend avenged, he 
      starts up his car to head for home, and as the MUSIC 
        CRESCENDOES, and we --

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
