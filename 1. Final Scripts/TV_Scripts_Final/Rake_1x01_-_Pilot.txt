  INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT11

  We re inside a fairly nondescript apartment.  We see the faces 
  of 2 people whom we presume to be lovers:  

  KEEGAN DEANE, 46, a man with no end of boyish good looks and 
  MIKKI, 29, pretty with a beautiful, welcoming smile.

                              MIKKI
                Key, I don t know.  I don t think I 
                can do this.

                                KEEGAN
                Come on.  There s a first time for 
                  everything.  

                              MIKKI
                Yes, there is.  I ve never done this 
                before.  What if I hurt you?

                                KEEGAN
                You?  Hurt me?  Not in a million 
                years.  Just get in there, get a good 
                grip on it and pull.

  They share a look and she raises a pair of PLIERS into shot.  

                              MIKKI
                Will you please just go to a 
                dentist.

                                KEEGAN
                      (shakes his head)
                Last time I went to a dentist it 
                cost me seven grand and my favorite 
                  bicuspid.  So will you please climb 
                on and get busy.

  She straddles him.

                              MIKKI
                Which one is it?

                                KEEGAN
                Molar - lower left - farthest one 
                back.  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   2.

    CONTINUED:11

                              MIKKI
                      (still hesitant)
                You re sure you want this?

                                KEEGAN
                Mikki, I m in a cloud of blinding, 
                  throbbing pain!

  She slowly leans forward, wincing, and moves the pliers towards 
  his mouth.  He lets out a yelp, forcing her back.

                              MIKKI
                They weren t even in your mouth!

                                KEEGAN
                I know!  You re sitting on my keys.

                              MIKKI
                That s what you get for keeping 
                your pants on.  

  She adjusts herself, takes a deep breath and sticks the 
  pliers into his mouth.  They make contact with the tooth.  

                              MIKKI (CONT D)
                Okay?

                                KEEGAN
                        (scared)
                Uh-huh.

                              MIKKI
                I m gonna start pulling now.

                                KEEGAN
                      (a little more scared)
                Uh-huh.

  She moves to pull - and he quickly yanks her hand away.

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                You know what?  All better.  Weird.  
                Maybe you knocked something back into 
                place.  

  Mikki smiles, genuinely amused by his bullshit.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                I mean - here we are - you looking so 
                great.  Why waste this on a dental 
                  emergency?

  He pulls her close and kisses her with real passion.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   3.

    CONTINUED: (2)11

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Would you still adore me if I was 
                  toothless?  

                              MIKKI
                 Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth 
                that cannot spit. 

                                KEEGAN
                That s either Frost, Auden or Wu Tang 
                Clan.  

                              MIKKI
                So close.  T.S. Eliot.

                                KEEGAN
                Oh, yes - The Waste Land.  Always good 
                for a laugh, old T.S., isn t he?

  He pulls her close again.  She responds with a serious kiss, as 
  their hands start running over each other - but then her phone 
  buzzes.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                You re kidding.  No way that was an 
                hour.

  Mikki smiles, kisses his neck and pops up off the bed.  She 
  starts putting her pants back on.

                              MIKKI
                Sorry, Key.  It s not my fault you 
                opted for a game of backgammon and a 
                sermon on gum disease.  

                                KEEGAN
                Hold on.  I ll pay for another hour.  

                              MIKKI
                Key, I ve got another client.

  Oh - she s not his girlfriend.  She s a prostitute.

                                KEEGAN
                Right now?  

                              MIKKI
                Ten minutes.  You see a dentist, okay?

  She exits into the bathroom to tidy up her hair and make-up.  
  Keegan falls back on the bed, defeated.                                                    4.


  EXT.  MIKKI'S BUILDING - NIGHT22

  Keegan heads out of the building rubbing his aching jaw.  As 
  he walks away, he passed a well-dressed man heading for 
  Mikki s building.  Keegan has a sense that this is Mikki s 
  next customer.  He turns and watches the man head inside.  
  His face goes dark - he considers confronting the man - but 
  what would that achieve?  He turns and walks away.  


  EXT.  WU S CAFE -- DAYA3A3

    Establishing shot.  


  INT.  WU S CAFE - THE NEXT DAY33

  MR. AND MRS. WU, a Chinese couple in their fifties, are the 
  proprietors of this small cafe in Echo Park.  A wall-mounted 
    television chatters away in Mandarin.  Mr. Wu watches as he sets 
  tables.  Mrs. Wu checks her watch - there s a task she s almost 
    forgotten.  She picks up a broom and raps it against the ceiling 
  repeatedly.  Her husband sees this and his face registers 
    annoyance.


  INT.  KEEGAN'S APARTMENT - AT THE SAME TIME44

  Keegan half sleeps in his small, very undistinguished studio 
    apartment, still in considerable jaw pain.  He snorts awake at 
  the sound of the rapping from below.  He stares at the ceiling 
  as he considers what might befall him today.


  EXT.  WU S CAFE - MINUTES LATER55

  Keegan exits onto the sidewalk from the stairs that lead to the 
    apartments above the cafe.  He s unshaven, his hair is askew, 
  and he s decked out in a maroon robe and brogues.  A passerby 
  turns and watches as he steals a newspaper before ambling into 
  the cafe.


  INT.  WU S CAFE - MINUTES LATER66

  Keegan sits at his usual table.  He drinks tea and tries not to 
  wince as the heat comes in contact with his aching molar.  Mrs. 
  Wu is at his side.  She finds Keegan quite charming. 

                                KEEGAN
                        (Cantonese)

  Keegan sees Mr. Wu throwing him a hostile stare.

                      (English)
                Good morning.

  Mr. Wu says something to his wife in Chinese.  She fires 
  something right back.  They engage in a short, but intensely 
    unpleasant volley of angry Cantonese which will not be sub-
  titled.  

                              MR. WU
                        (Cantonese)
                When are you going to wise up to

                I enjoy talking with him!  Whatever 
                I talk about with him is none of 
                your business!

                        (Cantonese)
                Do you want to give me a green hat?

  EXT.  STREET - WU S VAN - DAYA7A7

  The Wu s van drives by.  


  INT.  WU S VAN - LATER77

  Mr. Wu drives, Keegan is his passenger, checking something on 
  his phone.  Mr. Wu stares at the road, his mouth in a grimace.  
  A silent beat.  Keegan reads something that provokes a smile.  

                                KEEGAN
                You like football, Mr Wu?  

  No response.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                  I figured as much.

  Keegan searches for better reception.

                Key?




















                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   6.

                              ROY (V/O)
                You re already underwater half a 
                mile, you stupid bastard -

  EXT.  CHURCH - LATER88

  We descend from the heavens through the face of a church to 
  discover 3 MOURNERS who are amongst many people with money and 
  power draped in black.  They are distracted by the sound of a 
  roaring engine.  

  The Wu van screeches up to the curb and shudders to a halt in 
  front of a LIMO.  (The van features large, aspirational Maoist 
  portraits of the younger Mr. and Mrs. Wu.)  

  Keegan get out of the van:

                                KEEGAN
                      (into phone)
                Am I down?  Roy, am I down?!  Roy 
                can you hear me?!  Am I down you 
                  bastard?!!

                              ROY (V.O.)
                Yes, you re down!  

  Only then does Keegan notice the 3 Mourners staring at him.  

                                KEEGAN
                I was just saying how down I feel 
                today.  So, so ... down.  God bless

                Thanks, sorry for the incon -   

  Mr Wu peels the van away.  

  The Mourners look away and Keegan notices MARCUS BARZMANN, 
  50, the Mayor of Los Angeles who resolutely ignores Keegan as 
  he approaches the Church

  He is approached a SMALL GROUP OF REPORTERS who are asking 
    incomprehensible questions about someone called MURRAY. 

                                MARCUS
                      (trying to contain anger)
                Now is not the time.  I have no 
                comment.

  INT.  CHURCH - LATER1111

  Ben Leon, 45 and Keegan s best friend, delivers the eulogy - 
  or attempts to anyway.  Gripped by a terror of public 
  speaking, he stumbles, fumbles and sweats.  

  His beautiful wife SCARLET, 42, an assistant District 
  Attorney for the city of Los Angeles and also an old friend; 
  watches, anxious for her husband.

  Their three fine young children are also there; and - oh, yes 
  - the matriarch of the clan - the widow of the moment and 
  bitch on wheels, FRANCES LEON, 68.

                              BEN
                My father was many things.  He was - 
                uh - a man s man - and a - uh - 
                lawyer s lawyer.  He was a man and - 
                uh - a lawyer.  A lawyer who could 
                turn a jury on its head - or who could 
                turn a case on its head - for a jury 
                ...

  ANGLE ON

  Key, seated in a pew next to a little girl.  He nods, taking in 
  Ben s words - seemingly fully focused.  But as the camera moves 
  closer, we see that Key is wearing an earpiece.  He s listening 
  to the Packers game on his phone.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   7aA.

  A small sympathy laugh from some members of the congregation.  

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                He very rarely lost ... He was a 
                straight shooter, never afraid to 
                say what he was thinking.  I 
                admired that about him ... I m sure 
                we ... all did ... 

  Suddenly Key loses sound.  He taps the earpiece - then pulls out 
  the phone and semi-discreetly tries to position it for better 
  cell reception.  Unfortunately, he reaches a little too far - 
  and the ear piece is pulled out.  

  The sound comes back. Now the game is being broadcast to 
  everyone.  Keegan struggles to silence the phone, but in his 
  haste, drops it, and it skids under the pew and bounces a few 
  rows ahead.

  Scarlet turns to glare at the offender.  Keegan immediately 
  affects an air of innocence - as the phone announces a Minnesota 
    touchdown.  A male mourner nearby hears this and reflexively 
  lets out a cheer.  Scarlet looks back at Keegan.  He shakes his 
  head in disgust - the nerve of some people.  But as he s doing 
  this, we hear the phone start to ring.  His phone picks up.  His 
  recorded message blares around the church.  Whilst the message 
  itself is proper and business-like, it s apparent that he s 
  recorded it late night in a very noisy, crowded bar.   

                                KEEGAN
                      (phone)

  Mourners, including Keegan, arrive at Frances  comfortable home.  


  INT.  FRANCES  HOUSE - DAY1313

  Keegan is at the bar.  He spots Frances across the room and 
  shoots her a smile - she doesn t respond.  He mouths a  Sorry  
  and shrugs.  She gives him a cold shoulder that defies global 
  warming.  Scarlet appears at his side.

                              SCARLET
                It drives you crazy, doesn t it? 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   9.

                                KEEGAN
                What?  

                              SCARLET
                The fact that you haven t been able to 
                charm her; that there s one woman on 
                the planet who can see right through 
                you.    

                                KEEGAN
                You can see through me, Scarlet.  In 
                fact, I can feel you undressing me 
                with your eyes right now.  Take a look 
                - boxers or briefs?  

                              SCARLET
                Key, knowing your relationship with 
                clean laundry, I ll say neither.

                                KEEGAN
                You know, black really suits you.

                              SCARLET
                That s why I prefer funerals to 
                  weddings.  

                                KEEGAN
                I prefer funerals too.  At least 
                there s a sense of finality.  Weddings 
                are so inconclusive.  

                              SCARLET
                How much did you lose on the game?  

                                KEEGAN
                I broke even.

  She stares at him blankly, not buying this.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Okay. 8 grand.  But don t worry 
                it s all on credit.  I d never 
                gamble money I actually had.  
                That s when you know you ve got a 
                problem ... How s our boy doing?

  She gives him a look that says not good.  

  He thinks about this for a moment, then leans over the bar 
  and grabs a bottle of scotch.

  Ben sits alone in the dark room, staring up at a portrait of 
  his father, a handsome, powerful-looking man.  Keegan 
    approaches with a bottle of scotch and two glasses.  He takes 
  in the scene and registers the depth of his friend s funk; 
  this isn t going to be easy.

  Nothing from Ben.  Keegan puts the glasses on the table and 
  pours.

                You know, you really shouldn t be

                Come on.  Let s raise a glass to 
                the old man.

  Ben, for the first time, turns his eyes to Keegan.  The look 
  says  Don t you fucking dare,  but Keegan forges ahead.

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)

                Ben s the greatest, sweetest guy I 
                know - and frankly, Arthur, I don t 
                know how he turned out that way, 
                because you were such a 
                  relentlessly miserable sonofabitch.

                Then you should have charged 
                  admission.  

  Ben leaps up, grabs Keegan by the shoulders and pushes him 
  against the wall.

  Ben stares forward.  He takes a deep breath.  He stares 
  forward for the entire next speech.

                              BEN
                Remember our first mock trial at 
                school?

  Keegan nods.

                              BEN (CONT D)
                He showed up to watch - which was, 
                like - he never showed up for 
                  anything.  Afterwards - he said he 
                wanted me to see his new car.  We 
                walked outside - in dead silence, 
                as usual - and there it was - a 
                silver Mercedes convertible.  
                  Beautiful car.  I leaned down to 
                look inside - and he hit me.

  Keegan reacts.

                              BEN (CONT D)
                He hit me on the side of the head.  
                Hard.  He said I d humiliated him.  
                That - based on my performance in 
                the trial - I couldn t be his son.

  Keegan nods and Ben stares forward again.

                              BEN
                I hated you.

  And now we see that the portrait is down on the floor - and

                                ANCHOR (V.O.)
                City Hall so far remains in a state of 
                stunned silence after the arrest of 
                the Mayor s top economic advisor, 
                Graham Murray, for both murdering and 
                eating the remains of a young 
                  accountant, Paul Wilson.  Murray, seen 
                here with the Mayor on election night 
                three years ago, was not only said to 
                be the chief architect of the city s 
                  financial rescue plan, he s also an 
                  extremely close confidant to Mayor 
                  Barzmann.  A memorial service was held 
                for Paul Wilson this morning in 
                Pasadena - 

  (FOOTAGE of Paul Wilson s funeral - including the arrival of his 
  parents and his sister.)

                Any advice?

                              ROY
                Wear long sleeves.  They say he s 
                  brilliant at picking the stock market.  
                Maybe you should ask him for a couple 
                of tips.  

                                KEEGAN

                              ROY
                No time.  Come on.

  Roy pushes away from the bar and walks through a back room, into 
  an alleyway.  Keegan nods grimly and follows:

                              ROY (CONT D)

                              ROY
                He likes those fancy English TV shows. 
                I was thinking the Downtown Abbey box 
                set maybe.

                                KEEGAN
                Downton.

                              ROY
                Huh?

                                KEEGAN
                It s Downton Abbey.  Not Downtown.

  They re in the alley now.  Roy turns to face Keegan.

                              ROY
                Funny, I didn t realize that ... 
                You re sixty-seven thousand in the 
                hole, Key.  Victor says he s gonna 
                need half by the end of the month.  

  This is bad news - but before Keegan can react - Roy punches him 
  hard in the gut.  Keegan doubles over.  He reaches out, gasping - 
  trying to convey an urgent thought before Roy strikes anew.  

                                KEEGAN
                Roy - big favor - there s a chance I 
                may need root canal, so if you could 
                stay away from this side of my -      

  Roy smashes Keegan in the jaw - on that side.  The pain arcs 
  like lightning through Keegan's body and he falls to the ground.  

                              ROY
                See you Thursday night.  You need a 
                ride?  

  Keegan nods and Roy strolls away.  Keegan stays on the ground, 
  blood trickling out of his mouth.  He coughs and spits out a 
  tooth.  He picks it up and looks at it.  Then he feels his jaw.  
  It s fine.  No more pain.  He smiles.  Finally - a break.  

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

  Keegan gets off a bus and joins the city s masses as they pour 
  into office buildings.  


  INT.  OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER1919

  Keegan walks into an office that s unexpectedly impressive.  He 
  discovers LEANNE ZANDER, 28, his extremely put-upon yet no-
  nonsense assistant, packing boxes and on her cell.

  He throws a bag on the floor and a newspaper on a stack of 
  newspapers.

                gone four days.  He said I could use 
                the office for a month.  What happened

                Margaret doesn t scare me.

  Keegan ponders this then starts digging through the boxes and 
  collects assorted papers.

  An older JUDGE sits on the bench.  He doesn t like Keegan.  

  We presume Keegan is there, representing a client but ... 

                              JUDGE
                Yes, Mr Potter.

                Your Honor, the Government asks yet 
                again that the defefendant comply with  *
                our subpoena or be held in contempt.  
                The IRS has been more than patient.  

                              JUDGE
                I agree, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Deane?

  David sits.  Keegan stands.  

                                KEEGAN
                Your Honor, may I once again object to 
                this witch hunt?  

                              JUDGE
                You may not.

                This is what heppens to decent *
                  Americans when a massive, petty *
                  bureaucracy is able to stifle their *

                against me. The IRS has already *

                Mr. Deane, do you have anything 
                further to add before I hold you in 
                  contempt?  

                                KEEGAN
                I have three affidavits here, Your *
                Honor, supporting my claim that my *
                  financial records were rain damaged. *
                One from the President of the moving 
                company involved, and two from the 
                relevant staff members.  

  Keegan hands copies of the affidavits to David and the judge. 

                              JUDGE
                Mr. Deane, these would appear to be in 
                Spanish.  

                                KEEGAN
                Yes.  Unfortunately, as Your Honor can 
                see, they were signed only yesterday.  
                  I haven t had time to have them 
                  translated.  So in order to facilitate 
                said translation, I would like to ask 
                your Honor for a continuance.   

  David drops the documents onto the table, exasperated.  The 
  Judge can only nod his head in odd admiration.                                                   21.

                Movers and rain damaged boxes.  How 
                long do you really think you can 
                keep this going, Keegan?  

                                KEEGAN
                Harry, there s nothing I d like 
                more than to have those boxes back.  
                They would exonerate me in an 
                instant.  

                              DAVID
                Yeah, right.  And will you lay off 
                the Harry crap.  It s starting to 
                get around.

                Oh come on.  David Potter s nice 
                but a little boring.  Harry Potter

                last time I just don t roll that 
                way.  You ll have to keep your

  David seethes as the doors shut.  


  EXT.  DOWNTOWN BOOK SHOP - LATER2222

  Keegan passes by a second hand book shop and sees a heavily 
  loved edition of the T.S. ELIOT OMNIBUS in the window.  He 
  smiles and enters the shop.                                                     22.

  The STORE CLERK is wrapping up Keegan s purchase.  His cell 
  rings and he answers it.

                Lazarus, back from the dead yet again.  
                You re not gonna believe this, Key.  I 
                checked everywhere.  Cannibalism - it 
                turns out - is not a crime.

  The Store Clerk indicates that Keegan s credit card has been 
  declined.  Not really a surprise, Keegan starts dragging cash 
  out of his pockets.  

                                KEEGAN
                You re kidding.

                                LEANNE
                Nope.  Nothing on the books - state or 
                federal.  

                                KEEGAN
                      (his mind spinning)
                So the actual charge in these cases 
                must be murder, right?  

                                LEANNE
                Right.  

  By now Keegan is handing cash to the STORE CLERK.

  Keegan is bewildered.  He pulls out his phone and speed dials 
  someone (presumably Mikki).  No answer.  The line is dead.  Even 
  more bewildered, he presses the buzzer for the penthouse.

  Keegan paces angrily in the company of Mikki s employer, her 
  madam - if that s the word - JULES, 40 - an overweight African-
  American man in a voluminous caftan.  The penthouse is lavishly 
  and tastefully decorated.  TWO DOGS sit on dog beds along one 
  wall.

  Jules is cooking up a storm throughout the following:

                Key, I swear to you, I m just as 
                upset as you are.  These girls are

                Retires?  What are you talking about?

                The smart ones, they set a financial 
                goal.  Once they reach it, they re 
                gone.

                Speaking of finances, you owe me 
                for your last five sessions. Jules 
                needs some green, Mr. Deane.

                                KEEGAN
                She would have said something to me 
                about this.  She wouldn t just leave.

                I need her number.  Please, Jules.

                              JULES
                Don t work that way.  She has your 
                number.  If she wants to talk, she ll 
                use it.  Now unless you re thinking 
                about a new girl, I suggest you run 
                along.

  A wave of sadness overcomes Keegan.  It s a wave he doesn t 
  understand.  He turns for the door and slowly makes his way out.

  Jules starts dishing out the food into three elaborate bowls - 
  which we now realize are  personalized  dog plates   

                              JULES (CONT D)
                Oh Key honey.  

  He turns back, hopeful ...

                Be smart for a change. Forget about 
                her 

  FADE OUT.

                The city employed Dr Murray because of 
                his considerable business skills.  It 
                was a decision you all applauded at 
                the time.  When you remember the dire 
                  financial circumstances I inherited 
                from the previous administration, the 
                economic turnaround we have achieved 
                in this city is nothing short of a 
                miracle!

                So, you are aware the charge is

                I d been led me to believe that you 
                were tenacious; that you were 
                prepared to vigorously defend what 
                many may consider indefensible.  
                But that seems not to be the case 
                because I m betting the next words 
                out of your mouth will suggest a 
                plea of  not guilty by reason of 
                  insanity .  

  No response from Keegan.

                Okay ... We met in an online chat 
                room.  I posted a question: Is there 
                anyone out there who wants to be 
                eaten?  Paul was one of the yes s.   

                                KEEGAN
                One of the yes s? 

                                GRAHAM
                He was an accountant.  Turned out he 
                was a bit of a fan, actually.  He d 
                followed my career with interest.  We 
                  discussed the market for a while - 

                                KEEGAN
                The market?  I see.  You didn t 
                happen to give him any stock tips 
                by any chance?  

                                GRAHAM
                What would he want with stock tips?  
                I mean, given the circumstances -

                All right.  We ll put a pin in that

                That s interesting, Dr. Murray, but 
                because you ingested the victim, 
                there s no way of proving it.

                                GRAHAM
                Oh, I can prove it.  Paul Wilson 
                can tell you himself.  He made a 
                video confession.  The lenses on 
                these new phones are really quite 
                amazing.

  It s a grand house.   The street has been invaded by media.  A

  INT.  CITY HALL - MAYOR S OFFICE - AT THE SAME TIME3232

  ON THE TELEVISION IN THE OFFICE, MAYOR BARZMANN WATCHES Keegan 
  make his way through the press ... 

  His eyes widen with rage and fear.  He turns off the TV, 
  picks up his phone and calmly puts buds in his ears.

  Scarlet, entering Marcus  office to find him vigorously 
    conducting an invisible orchestra outside his window - the 
  city of LA.  Whatever the music is, she can t hear it.  It s 
  all in his head.  

  When Marcus notices her, he pulls the buds out of his ears 
  and looks to her.

                He needed some time.  He s still 
                dealing with his father s death.

                right now than you think, Scarlet.  
                And the sharks are starting to smell 
                blood.  The question is whose?  


  INT.  MURRAY HOUSE - LATER3333

  ANNIE MURRAY (48) exhausted, looks out at the throng of news 
  vans and press before she draws the curtains.  

                              ANNIE
                There has to be something better 
                they could be doing with their 
                time, don t you think? 

  She turns and sits down.  

                              ANNIE (CONT D)
                You think you know someone.  

                                KEEGAN
                I beg your pardon.  

                              ANNIE
                After 14 years of marriage, you 
                think you know someone.  And now 
                ... 

                                KEEGAN
                I m sorry.  

                              ANNIE
                Yes well, what can I do for you, Mr 
                Deane?  

                                KEEGAN
                Your husband told me about something 
                in his desk.

                              ANNIE
                The phone, you mean.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   33.

                                KEEGAN
                        (surprized, this is a 
                        break)
                Yes, he did.  You found it?  

                              ANNIE
                Yes.  

                                KEEGAN
                May I see it?  

                              ANNIE
                No.  

                                KEEGAN
                May I ask why?  

                              ANNIE
                Because I destroyed it.

  Keegan nods, trying not to show his panic.

                                KEEGAN
                Did you see the video?  

                              ANNIE
                      (a beat, then starting to 
                        crumble)
                It was just so tragic and so awful.  I 
                couldn t bear the thought of anyone 
                else seeing it ... I need this 
                  nightmare to be over.  

                                KEEGAN
                  I understand, but your husband is 
                facing a murder charge.  Did Paul 
                Wilson overdose?  

  Annie nods.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Why haven t you told the police?

                              ANNIE
                What difference would it make?  It 
                would just drag things out.  My 
                husband is insane.  He s going to 
                spend the rest of his life locked away 
                anyway.  
                      (a sudden look of horror)
                You re not - thinking of mounting a 
                defense, are you?  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   34.

                                KEEGAN
                The charge is murder.  If your husband 
                didn t kill anyone -

                              ANNIE
                You requested 10 minutes of my time 
                and you ve had them.  Please don t 
                contact me again.  I will not testify 
                for Graham under any circumstances.  
                And if asked - I ll deny everything I 
                just told you.  

  She gets up and walks out of the room.  Keegan is absolutely 
    thunderstruck - and left without a plan of attack.

  FADE OUT.

  FADE IN:


  INT.  BEN AND SCARLET S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT3434

  Ben and Scarlet are having a quiet dinner to celebrate his 
  aunt s birthday.  Frances is in attendance, along with her 
  sister, the birthday girl, and a FEW other MEN and WOMEN of a 
  similar age.  It s all very civilized.  

  The doorbell rings.

                              BEN
                I ll get it.  

  Ben proceeds through the living room and answers the front door, 
  which is visible from the dining room.  He opens the door and 
  finds Keegan standing with a kid of about twenty wearing a pizza 
  delivery hat and shirt.

                                KEEGAN
                Hey, Ben.  Am I interrupting anything?

                              BEN
                If I said yes, would that have any 
                impact on you at all?

                                KEEGAN
                Not really.

                              BEN
                Then come in.  My mother s here, as 
                well as some other people who won t 
                like you.

                                KEEGAN
                This is Mike - 

                              PIZZA KID
                Mark.

                                KEEGAN
                Mark - he gave me a lift here.  Do you 
                have a spare twenty on you?

  Ben stares for a beat, then reaches for his wallet.


  INT.  BEN AND SCARLET S - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER3535

  Keegan, Ben and Scarlet have a heated dispute in the kitchen.  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   36.

                              SCARLET
                      (sotto)
                You are unbelievable.  You burst in 
                here and expect me to drop 
                  everything, including a murder 
                charge because the killer s wife 
                  remembers some convenient evidence.  

                                KEEGAN
                She is not lying.  Believe me!  

                              BEN
                Are you back on coke?  

                                KEEGAN
                I m here as a professional courtesy.  
                There was no murder.  This changes 
                things.  

                              BEN
                What does?!  The video confession that 
                you haven t seen, which was recorded 
                on a phone that no longer exists?!  
                Give me a break! 

                              SCARLET
                We have statements from all his family 
                members and a list of friends and 
                business colleagues half a mile long.  
                Paul Wilson had no reason to commit 
                suicide!  

                              BEN
                He was about to be made a partner in 
                his firm.  He just bought a mountain 
                bike -  

                                KEEGAN
                  A mountain bike? - that s a sign the 
                guy wasn t suicidal?  Maybe he was 
                planning to ride it off a cliff!

                              SCARLET
                He was telling his friends about a 
                trip to Greece next summer.  

                                KEEGAN
                Oh did he tell those same friends 
                about the cannibal themed website 
                he went on where he said he wanted 
                to be eaten?!  

  Frances pipes up from the dining area.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   37.

                Enough!  We re trying to enjoy our 
                meal!

  Keegan yells back into the other room.    

                                KEEGAN
                I am sorry, Frances!  I didn t want to 
                  interrupt your plate of chicken; I m 
                just trying to save a man s life!  

  Ben and Scarlet roll their eyes.  Frances stands and approaches.  

                              FRANCES
                SAVE a man s life?!  Don t make me 
                laugh.  This case is one more example 
                of your love of self-promotion, self 
                interest and quick cash!

                                KEEGAN
                Am I out of my mind here?!  Or is this 
                some sort of legal Twilight Zone?  The 
                charge is murder yet my client didn t 
                kill anyone.  Call me old fashioned 
                but I thought I might be doing my job 
                if I defended that charge.  Is there a 
                lawyer in the house?!

                              FRANCES
                If there is, Keegan, it can t be you.  
                You say you re wanting to save your 
                client s life?  Everyone knows the 
                longer you wait to mount an insanity 
                plea - the more likely it is your 
                client will wind up facing the death 
                penalty.  My youngest grandson knows 
                that!

                              BEN
                Are you two having fun?  

                              FRANCES
                You will be dis-barred if your client 
                gets death in these circumstances ... 

                                KEEGAN
                You d love that Frances, wouldn t you?  

                              FRANCES
                It s what s keeping me alive. 

                              BEN
                Maybe it s time, Key?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   38.

                You want to know what s scary, 
                Cruella?  I m half a year behind in 
                alimony.  My bookie sends a nice 
                man to beat the tar out of me every 
                couple of weeks.  There s this 
                woman who almost stabbed me to 
                death; I m told she s back in town 
                and house hunting.  And I ve got 
                the IRS so far up my ass, it may 
                only be a matter of time before I 
                end up in jail.  And with this face 
                  girlfriend, my dance card s gonna 
                be awfully full ... Whatever else 
                Graham Murray has done is 
                  irrelevant according to the law, he 
                is charged with a crime he didn t 
                commit which is why I m gonna win 
                this case even if it means keeping 
                you alive ... 

  He turns to go, then turns back with a smile.

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Oh, and by the way.  It s true.  We do 
                taste like chicken.  

  One of the old ladies drops her fork.  The birthday girl covers 
  her mouth with her napkin.  Keegan exits - his work here done.

  Keegan lies in bed, unable to sleep.  He turns on a light and 
  picks up the book of Eliot, then opens it.  After a moment, 
  his phone beeps.  There s a message from an unidentified

  INT.  MADDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY3737

  Looking like he didn t sleep a wink, Keegan sits on the couch 
  opposite MADDY, 41, very attractive and nurturing.

                Four years.  Four years together  and

                Like I was no different than all the

                Falling in love with a prostitute.  
                You thought you d finally found a 
                  relationship you could control -

  A long look between them.

  FINN, 15, tall and handsome with a fine mop of hair, enters.  
  Keegan sits up to greet him.

                Nah.  Just catching up.  

  They hug.  

  And now we realize - Maddy is Key s ex-wife, not his shrink.

                              MADDY

  INTERCUT:


  I/E.  KEEGAN S NEW OFFICE - DAY39A39A

  Leanne is setting up their stuff in a distinctly differently 
  themed office.  

                                LEANNE
                I ve been through all Wilson s phone 
                records.  He didn t make any calls, 
                send any texts or emails using his 
                phone during the hour before he died.

                                KEEGAN
                Well, isn t that helpful?

                                LEANNE
                You never know.  Maybe he uploaded his 
                suicide video somewhere.  Cannibal s 
                  Monthly.com perhaps.  Gourmet Cannibal

                expert?  It s after 3.  His 
                  expertise clearly isn t

                I will.  And when I do -

  He does so and finds, to his unending frustration, that he 
  was wrong.  Just before he is about to shower the campus with 
    expletives - 

  - his eye is caught by a crowd of passing students.  Can it be - 
  yes - it s Mikki!  He jumps up and starts after her.

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Mikki!  Mikki!

  She sees him, turns and accelerates her pace.  Keegan gives 
  chase.


  INT.  LECTURE HALL - MINUTES LATER4141

  Keegan enters.  He spots Mikki taking a seat in the back of the 
  room.  This isn t a good place for a confrontation.  He crosses 
  to the lectern and clicks on the microphone.  

                                KEEGAN
                Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  
                My name is Keegan Deane and I ve been 
                asked to fill in for your usual 
                  instructor who is temporarily 
                  indisposed.  So what are we discussing

                the course of a professional 
                  transaction, the party whose

                certain warranties - are you not as 
                  a purchaser entitled to rely on 
                those warranties?  If this 
                  professional were to say something 
                to me like  I ll see you next 
                  Wednesday, Keegan  am I not 
                entitled to rely on the fact I can 
                see this professional next 
                  Wednesday?     

  Mikki bolts out of the room.  Keegan starts after her. 

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                      (to the students)
                Think about what I just told you.  Pop

  He hurries out.


  EXT.  CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER4242

  Keegan and Mikki walk together.  Her face is stone.  

                                KEEGAN
                You re studying law?  I suppose I 
                should be flattered.  

                              MIKKI
                It has nothing to do with you.  My 
                father was a lawyer before he joined 
                the State Department.  Look, I have to 
                get back -   

                                KEEGAN
                What the hell, Mikki?  I mean - no 
                goodbye?  Maybe a text -  So long, 
                sucker?   Given what we had -  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   44.

                              MIKKI
                We had a business relationship.

                                KEEGAN
                No, it started that way, but -  

                              MIKKI
                It started that way and that s how it 
                ended.  I mean - I really can t 
                believe you of all people are this 
                naive.

                                KEEGAN
                Okay, stop.  Can you just be you - be 
                who you are and talk to me.

                              MIKKI
                This is who I am.  Before this - I
                was who you wanted me to be.  Some 
                guys wanted me to be a nurse, a school 
                girl, a dominatrix.  You wanted me to 
                be your friend, so I was.  That was 
                the gig.  You can choose to believe 
                whatever you want.  

                                KEEGAN
                I m not choosing to believe anything.  
                It s an objective fact.

                What is?  

                                KEEGAN
                You and I.  Us.  Our connection was 
                real, Mikki.  You can t just write it 
                off as part of some exit strategy. 
                      (a beat, not easy)
                You can t just cut me out of your 
                life.  Not me.

  She stares at him for a beat.  Has he won her over?  

                              MIKKI
                If we happen to bump into each other 
                in the future, I assume I can rely on 
                your discretion?  

  Keegan reels at the coldness of these words.  

                              MIKKI (CONT D)
                Goodbye, Mr. Keegan.

  Mikki walks away - leaving Keegan utterly lost.

  Post dinner, Scarlet cleans up while Keegan sits with two of the 
  Leon children, MAX (6) and ZOE (8) (both in pyjamas) climbing 
  all over him.  He tries to summon some enthusiasm for the game 
  but is failing miserably.

  Ben exits.  Keegan thinks for a moment, picks up his empty 
  wine glass and proceeds into the kitchen where he finds 
  Scarlet tidying.  He fills his wine glass.

                        (indicating a file on a 
                        bench)
                  I printed out our amended witness 
                list for you.  

  Keegan opens the file, reads and sighs.  

                                KEEGAN
                Come on - Red.  Really?  Do we have to 
                endure another blubbering mother 
                  sideshow?  

                              SCARLET
                      (an anticipated victory)
                There are four mothers on the jury, 
                Key.  That gives me four guilty 
                verdicts right there.  I d really 
                think about changing the plea, if I 
                were you.  

  They share a look.  

                              SCARLET (CONT D)
                You don t look good, sweetheart.  As 
                in worse than usual.

                                KEEGAN
                I just bumped into Mikki.  

                              SCARLET
                Oh.  Ben told me she flew the coop.  

                                KEEGAN
                Yeah, she flew, all right.  She s a 
                  veritable phoenix.  Burned down her 
                old life, emerged from the ashes, 
                spread her wings and started anew.  I 
                  should ve asked her how you do that.  
                  Reinvention could really come in handy 
                right about now.      

  Scarlet looks to Keegan and smiles sadly.  Then her face falls 
  and she fights back tears.  She seems on the verge of 
    hyperventilating.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   48.

  She hurries out of the house into the back garden.  Keegan 
  follows her, catches up with her and stops her.  

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                Red, what is it?!

                                KEEGAN
                Do what? 

                              SCARLET
                The Marriage.  The whole - thing.  Our 
                life together.  I don t want it.  I 
                think I don t.   

  Pause.  

                                KEEGAN
                You re kidding me.  Does he know?

                              SCARLET
                Of course not.  I barely know.   

                                KEEGAN
                Okay he did something.  What did he 
                do?  Look, Ben s the sweetest guy in 
                the world, if there s something he s

                He didn t do anything!  That s the 
                problem.  

  Then Keegan sees Ben re-enter the kitchen.  

                              BEN

  Scarlet wipes her tears away.  A beat.

                We don t have the video.  So,

                We all have our idiosyncracies.  You

                  Caressing it.  Kissing it.  There are

                whether you drank his blood - how you 
                disposed of his head.  And the jury

                She ll do to you legally what you did 
                to him physically.  And then, I have

  EXT.  COURT - DAY4545

  The reporters come to life as Paul Wilson s family arrives for 
  the trial.  They seem respectable and tight-knit.  The mother 
  and daughter hold hands as they head inside.


  INT.  COURT - DAY4646

  Paul s mother, LORRAINE, 58, is on the stand, already in a state 
  of distress.

                              SCARLET
                Mrs. Wilson, you will have no doubt 
                heard the defense trumpeting a claim 
                that your son committed suicide.  Tell 
                me - were you at all concerned about 
                his mental health?  

  Lorraine starts to cry.  Keegan rolls his eyes.  He looks into 
  the gallery and spots Lorraine s weeping daughter.  

                              LORRAINE
                No.  He loved his job.  His firm was 
                about to make him a partner.  He had 
                  everything to live for - until that 
                monster drugged him and murdered him - 

  Keegan stands, objecting. 

                                KEEGAN
                Your Honor?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                   51.

                The jury will disregard that last 
                remark. 

  Keegan sits. 

                              SCARLET
                You were a close family.  

                              LORRAINE
                Oh - yes.  My husband and I adored 
                Paul.  My daughter worshipped him.  
                Paul and Dena were as close as two 
                siblings could possibly be -  

  She breaks down. 

                              JUDGE #2
                Take a moment Mrs Wilson.

  As Lorraine calms herself, she looks to her daughter, DENA, who 
  smiles supportively.  Keegan then looks back to Dena.  She locks 
  eyes with Keegan, then looks away.  A thought occurs to him.  He 
  turns to Leanne.   

                                KEEGAN
                Give me Wilson s phone records.    

  She hands them to him.  He looks at them.  He sees one number 
  appear many times.  Maybe a third of all the calls.  

                                LEANNE
                What are you thinking?  

  Keegan gets out his phone and starts typing a text.

                                KEEGAN
                Long shot.    

  ON THE PHONE SCREEN

  We see the text being finished.  It reads Do you still have the 
  video Paul sent you?  

  Keegan pushes send.  He watches Dena out of the corner of his 
  eye, and sure enough - she leans down to check her bag.  Dena 
  takes out her phone, sees the text - and the blood drains from 
  her face.  She turns and looks at Keegan, her eyes wide.  Keegan 
  turns away and nods to himself.  

                              JUDGE #2
                Are you ready to continue, Mrs 
                Wilson?                                                   52.


  INT.  COURT - LATER4747

  Keegan cross-examines an already weakened Lorraine.  

                                KEEGAN
                Mrs. Wilson, did you know your son 
                visited websites relating to 
                  cannibalism?  

                              LORRAINE
                I did not.  

  Keegan holds up a file.  

                                KEEGAN
                You didn t really know your son at

                I beg your pardon?  

                                KEEGAN
                He didn t confide in you.  

  Keegan places the file in front of her. 

                                KEEGAN (CONT D)
                This is your son s cell phone usage 
                for the last three months.  This 
                number here is the one he called most.  
                Is that your number?  

                              LORRAINE
                That s my daughter s number.   

                                KEEGAN
                How about this number.  Is that yours?   

                              LORRAINE
                No.  

                                KEEGAN
                Okay.  Mrs. Wilson, can you point out 
                your number anywhere here? 

  Lorraine is rattled.  She scans the pages quickly - and points 
  out her number only twice.  

                              LORRAINE
                Here - and here.

                Only twice in three months.  That s 
                  interesting.  And these were calls 
                from you, not to you.  Can you see 
                your husband s number anywhere? Take a 
                moment.  

  Keegan turns and looks directly at Dena.  She knows what s 
  coming and she s terrified. 

                              LORRAINE
                No.  

                                KEEGAN
                No what? 

                              LORRAINE
                I don t see his number here.

                                KEEGAN
                So zero communication between a son 
                and his father for three months.  
                You re right, Mrs. Wilson.  That is a 
                close family.

  Scarlet stands.

                Mrs. Wilson, I can t imagine the pain 
                you ve had to endure.  But the simple 
                truth is that it s easier to cope with 
                the thought that your son was beguiled 
                and ensnared - that he was a victim of 
                some hideous, depraved plot - it s 
                easier to cope with that thought than 
                the idea that he took his own life and 
                chose to have his physical remains 
                disposed of in such a manner.  That 
                choice doesn t appear out of thin air, 
                does it?  

                              LORRAINE
                It wasn t his choice!  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                 2nd White (04/03/2013)                  54.

                Yes, I can.  I can and I will, Mrs. 
                Wilson, because Graham Murray is not 
                the monster you want him to be.  He *
                is, no doubt about it, a man of *
                strange passions but he s simply not a *
                  murderer.*

                He was a participant in an agreed-upon 
                  arrangement with your son to dispose *
                of his remains!   *

                                LORRAINE*

                Your son reached out to him, Mrs *
                Wilson.  It would seem your son was *
                prepared to reach out to anyone, *
                except you or your husband ... *
                You ve seen the video, haven t you *

                The video your son sent to you in *
                which he confessed his desire to be *
                eaten by Dr Murray!  The video you *
                have hidden from the police!  The *

                I have what you want.


  INT.  COURT - LATER4848

  Dena s phone is hooked up to a computer - which is connected to 
  a large screen.  Everyone watches Paul Wilson leaving his final 
  message to his sister and the world.  Graham can be sees in the 
    background making preparations.  

                              PAUL (V.O.)
                      (on the screen)
                Hey, Dena.  This is going to sound a 
                little formal, because it has to be 
                right for the record.  My name is Paul 
                Matthew Wilson, my address is 27 
                Holroyd Road, Laural Canyon.  I am an 
                  accountant currently employed by the 
                firm of Russell and Garland.

                I am about to commit suicide.  I have 
                here sleeping pills purchased by 
                myself which I shall take in order to 
                induce my death.  I repeat - I am 
                  committing suicide, and I wish for my 
                remains to be consumed by Dr. Graham 
                Murray.
                      (a beat)
                I m sorry, Dena - hard to explain.  
                But tell Dad - just tell him he s 
                always been right.  He said I was crap 
                - and now I will be.
                      (a beat)
                Love you.

  He starts downing the pills.  Paul s father sits very still, his 
  face void of emotion.  The screen cuts to black.  Everyone in 
  the courtroom is shocked into silence.  Keegan puts a hand on 
  Graham s arm. 

                              JUDGE #2
                Ms. Engels?

  Scarlet stands.

                              SCARLET
                Yes.  Your Honor - irrespective of 
                this new evidence, it is our 
                  contention that the defendant lured a 
                  vulnerable and mentally ill young man 
                to end his own life.  

  Keegan is on his feet.

                                KEEGAN
                Your Honor, the state has spent its 
                entire case telling us how mentally 
                healthy the deceased was.  As we now 
                know, my client did not murder Mr. 
                Wilson - and as the charge here is 
                murder, I believe he has been entirely 
                  vindicated. 
                      (to Scarlet)
                Unless we need to watch the video 
                again?

  The Judge looks to Scarlet again.

                              SCARLET
                        (reluctantly)
                Your Honor, the state moves to dismiss 
                the murder charge.

                Very well.  The charge of murder is 
                  dismissed.  Dr. Murray will remain in 
                  involuntary commitment pending further 
                  psychiatric assessment.  Court is

  A car s headlights find Keegan - and boy, they re getting

  The car mounts the curb and clips him, sending him flying into
