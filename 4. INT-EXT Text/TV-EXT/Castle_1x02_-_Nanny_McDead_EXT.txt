      Manhattan traffic, 86th and CPW, snarled.  (The traffic s 
      sound design places the viewer  in the thick of it. )

                                                                    TRANSITION TO:


      Elevator doors open on the 12th Floor, revealing Castle 
      leaning against the wall, seemingly waiting for Beckett.

                                  CASTLE
                    Thought you ditched me back at the 
                    precinct, didn t you?

      Beckett shakes her head, starts walking down the hallway.  
      Castle follows.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    6.


                                  CASTLE
                    C mon, Nanny McDead s found on spin 
                    dry and you didn t think your 
                    Captain would let me in on that 
                    story?

                                    BECKETT
                    You re right. My bad... So, exactly 
                    how long can I expect you to be 
                    shadowing me on my cases like this?

                                  CASTLE
                    Hard to say.  You know when I m 
                    writing a new character, there s no 
                    telling how long it ll take for 
                      inspiration to strike. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Thought I was your inspiration, 
                    Castle.

                                  CASTLE
                    Oh you are, Detective, and in so 
                    many ways.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Well, then your  inspiration  might 
                    strike you sooner than you think.

      Beckett shoots a warning look at Castle as she stops in front 
      of 12-F; she presses the door buzzer. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Nanny s name was Sara Manning and 
                    she worked for the Petersons about 
                    two years.
                          (off her new look)
                    The doorman s a huge fan of my 
                    work. 

      Beckett shakes her head, just as CLAUDIA PETERSON, 38, pencil 
      skirt, silk blouse; professional appearance - minus the heels 
      now that she s home with the kid - answers the door.

                                    BECKETT
                    Mrs. Peterson? Kate Beckett. NYPD.  
                    I was hoping I could ask you a few 
                    questions about Sara Manning.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Yes. Of course. Please come in. 

      Claudia opens the door, Beckett enters, Castle follows.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    7.


                                  CASTLE
                    Hi. Richard Castle. Just... N-Y.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      CASTLE TITLE CARD


      The playground: ground zero for the Manhattan nanny.  KIDS on 
      swings, sandboxes, etc.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Doorman told Esposito this is the 
                      playground most of the nannies in 
                    the building go to, so this girl 
                    Chloe should be here. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Kinda takes me back a bit.

                                    BECKETT
                          (takes a playful shot)
                    A bit?  I m thinkin  it s gotta be 
                    a little more than that, Castle.

                                  CASTLE
                    I wasn t talking about when I was a 
                    kid.  I was referring to taking my 
                    daughter to the park.

                                    BECKETT
                    You took your daughter to the park?      Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    25.


                                  CASTLE
                    Spring, summer and fall, we were 
                    here almost everyday.  Alexis s 
                    mother was on the road a lot - 
                    community theater - so I had 
                    custody.
                          (off her look)
                    What? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Just never figured you for Mr. Mom.

                                    BECKETT
                    That s actually nice.

                                  CASTLE
                    Tell me about it.  Do you know how 
                    many lonely single mothers there 
                    are on a Manhattan playground? And 
                    there I was: in between marriages.

                                    BECKETT
                    Exactly how many times have you 
                    been married, Castle?

                                  CASTLE
                    Twice. 

                                    BECKETT
                    That s it?  

                                  CASTLE
                    Isn t that enough?  How  bout you?  

                                    BECKETT
                    Me.  Nope.  Never been.  

                                  CASTLE
                    You d be good at it. You re 
                      controlling and disapproving. You 
                    should really try it.

                                    BECKETT
                    I m not an  if at first you don t 
                    succeed  sort of girl, Castle. When

                          (but then)
                    Doorman said she had a red vest on.   
                    That could be her over there.

      Beckett heads over to young woman, CHLOE RICHARDSON, 20s, 
      with a little girl, BECCA, 5, not far off.

                                    BECKETT
                    Chloe?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yes?

                                    BECKETT
                    Detective Beckett. I d like to ask 
                    you some questions about Sara 
                    Manning?

                                  CHLOE
                    Right now?

      Chloe looks over at Becca playing a short distance away.

                                    BECKETT
                    It won t take long.  

                                  CHLOE
                    Hey Maggie?

      Another nanny, MAGGIE, late 20s, turns around.

                                  CHLOE
                    Could you watch Becca for a minute?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Chloe, Beckett and Castle sit on a park bench.  

                                    BECKETT
                    Sara s boyfriend told us you were 
                    the one who got Sara her job.

                                  CHLOE
                    You talked to Brent?
                          (off Beckett s nod)
                    When we got out of school, Sara 
                    couldn t find a job.  She was 
                    temping all over town.  I nannie 
                    for a family in the same building 
                    and heard the Petersons were 
                    looking for someone.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    27.


                                  CASTLE
                    So, when was the last time you saw 
                    Sara?

      Chloe turns and looks away.

                                    BECKETT
                      I understand how it feels to lose 
                    someone, Chloe... But we need to 
                    ask you these questions. 

                                  CHLOE
                    We d meet before work sometimes.  
                    Get some coffee on Columbus, then 
                    walk over to work together.

                                    BECKETT
                    Did you have coffee with her that 
                    day?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah.

                                  CASTLE
                    And, did Sara say anything to you?  
                    Did she seem upset?

                                  CHLOE
                    Upset?  Upset about what?

                                    BECKETT
                    We got the impression from Brent 
                    that Sara was seeing someone else. 

      Chloe looks away again.  

                                  CASTLE
                    You know who he was, don t you.

      Chloe turns and looks at Castle.   This is hard for her.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sara stayed late sometimes.

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you mean?  At the 
                      Petersons?

      Castle mouths to Beckett, behind Chloe s back:  Told you. 

                                  CHLOE
                    We got off work around the same 
                    time, so we d take the train 
                    together.

                                  CHLOE (cont'd)
                    I live with a roommate a couple of 
                    blocks from Sara... But the last 
                    few months she started staying 
                    late... Mr. And Mrs. Peterson kinda 
                    take turns coming home for dinner, 
                    you know?

                                    BECKETT
                    Yes. Mrs. Peterson told us.

                                  CHLOE
                    God, I don t wanna say something 
                    and then-- I mean, he s married.

                                    BECKETT
                    Sara told you about him then?

                                  CHLOE
                    No.  Not exactly.  It s just... the 
                    nights Mrs. Peterson didn t come 
                    home for dinner? Those were the 
                    only nights Sara stayed late. 

      Off Beckett, Castle,

      Beckett, Castle and Howard Peterson walk and talk.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    30.


                                    BECKETT
                    So when was the last time you saw, 
                    Sara, Mr. Peterson?

                                  HOWARD 
                    The night before she was killed.  I 
                    already told you.

                                  CASTLE
                    Which was your night to be home for 
                    dinner, right? 

                                  HOWARD 
                    Yes.  Why are you asking?

      Castle s about to answer.  Beckett jumps in--

                                    BECKETT
                    Eh. Eh. Eh.
                          (then, to Peterson)
                    I have information that Sara 
                    Manning was having a relationship.

                                  HOWARD 
                    Right.  She had a boyfriend.  

      Castle scrunches his face: You re guessing wrong.

                                    BECKETT
                    Someone else.  

                                  HOWARD 
                    Someone else?  Who?

      Castle looks at Peterson, sheepishly points to him.  

                                  HOWARD 
                    Me?  You think I was having an 
                    affair with Sara?

                                  HOWARD 
                    But that s, that s... crazy. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Is it?  We know she stayed late on 
                    some nights.  

                                  HOWARD

                    Us?  What we heard is that she only 
                    helped on the nights your wife 
                    wasn t home.

      Howard Peterson looks trapped a bit.

                                  HOWARD 
                    ... It s not what you think.

                                  CASTLE
                    When is it ever?

                                  HOWARD    
                    Look, it wasn t my fault Wall 
                    Street tanked. Took the real estate 
                    market with it. Only try telling 
                    her that. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Try telling who that, Mr. Peterson?

                                  HOWARD 
                    My wife. And you re right. I was 
                    having an affair. 

                                    BECKETT
                    So, what happened?

                                  HOWARD
                    What do you mean, what happened?  I 
                    cheated. I strayed. Whatever you 
                    wanna call it.

                                    BECKETT
                    I meant, in that laundry room.

                                  HOWARD 
                    What?

                                    BECKETT
                    You just said that--

                                  HOWARD 
                    I was having an affair. But it 
                    wasn t with Sara, for godsake. It 
                    was with a woman in my office.
                          (off them)
                    Look, on the nights I was supposed 
                    to be home for dinner? I wasn t. 
                    Check the land line at the 
                      apartment.  I always called Sara to 
                    make sure things were okay.

                    There s gotta be records from my 
                    cell phone, right? 

      Off Beckett, a little deflated. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Don t leave town?

      Off Howard, 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Beckett arrives with Castle.  Lights flashing.  Ryan and 
      Esposito are already there; they approach.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    No answer in the apartment when the 
                    doorman called upstairs.

                                  RYAN
                    But he s sure Chloe s there.  Says 
                    Ian Harris is up there, too.  He 
                    came home about an hour ago. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Which means Chloe would have been 
                    there waiting for him.

                                    BECKETT
                    Alright, look, there s no time to 
                    wait for emergency services.  We re 
                    gonna have to go in ourselves.

                                  ESPOSITO
                          (re: Castle)
                    What about him? 

                                    BECKETT
                    He stays here. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Oh, c mon. I already signed away my 
                    life.  What more do you want? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Okay.  But it s accompany and 
                    observe, Castle.  Not participate 
                    and annoy.  Got it? 

                                  CASTLE
                    But participate and annoy is a lot 
                    more fun. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Stay behind us in the hallway.  
                    Don t move unless I tell you. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Hope to die.  Well, you know what I 
                    mean.

      Beckett turns, heads into the building, the team behind her.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    52.



      Chloe, handcuffed, a bandage around her leg, is placed in a 
      police car.  Ian Harris, conscious, on a GURNEY being loaded 
      into an AMBULANCE.  Diana stands a discreet distance away.    Castle - Ep 103  "Nanny McDead"  Yellow Draft 11-16-08    57.


                                  CASTLE
                    Looks like I managed to make it 
                    through the case without getting 
                    injured, shot or killed.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow.

                                  CASTLE
                    By the way, really loved that whole 
                      sisterhood thing you ran back 
                    there. 

                                    BECKETT
                    I wasn t running anything, Castle. 
                    What this guy did has consequences.  
                    Only he ll get to just walk away.

                                  CASTLE
                    Not scot-free, he won t. I m 
                    sensing a pretty big divorce 
                      settlement in his future. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Whatever it is, it won t be enough.

      Off Castle, as Beckett gets in her car.
