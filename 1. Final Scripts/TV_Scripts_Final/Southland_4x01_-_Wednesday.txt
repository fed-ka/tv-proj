                                        ACT ONE

    We HEAR a piercing SCREECH OF TIRES and SMASH OPEN ON: 

      INT. BEN & SAMMY S PATROL CAR - (MOVING/STOPPED) - DAY11

    BEN and SAMMY (Sammy driving) braced against their seat belts 
    as they skid to a sudden stop. OUT THE WINDSHIELD -- a black 
      GANGSTER is beating up a half-naked TEENAGE GIRL, who CRIES 
    and SCREAMS for help. Ben and Sammy pop their doors. 

      EXT. WATTS HOUSE - STREETS/ALLEY - CONTINUOUS22

      The asshole throws the girl down like a rag doll and rabbits. 
      They go after him. He cuts down a NARROW PATH along some 
      public housing units and plows straight through a CHAIN-LINK 
      FENCE, knowing just where to hit it. Ben and Sammy do the 
      same but get scratched to shit. They come out in an ALLEY and 
    see him sprinting for an OPEN GARAGE at the rear of a house --  

                                  SAMMY
                    I got the front!

      Sammy hops a low fence and runs toward the front of the house 
    to cut him off. Ben pursues the guy into the garage.   

      INT. WATTS HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS33

      Trash cans, bikes, all CRASH DOWN as they run through. Ben 
      sees the guy clutch his waistband and bang through a door 
      into the house. Ben draws his gun and bangs in after. 

      INT. WATTS HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS44

      They stumble through a LAUNDRY ROOM and into a messy KITCHEN, 
      knocking shit everywhere. The guy bolts out a SCREEN DOOR 
      nearly taking it off its hinges, Ben closing in, and then --

55EXT. WATTS HOUSE - SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS 

      After banging into a table toppling food and plastic lawn 
      chairs, Ben suddenly stops. He s facing 20 GANGSTERS having a 
      BBQ, as the asshole he was chasing leaps a fence and 
      disappears. MUSIC THUMPS. They ve all been drinking. CAMERA 
      FINDS a couple of gangsters  hands hovering near their hidden 
      guns, the tension unbearable, the whole pack  415-ing  Ben:       

                                  GANGSTERS
                    What the fuck, man? We ain t done 
                    shit!

                                  BEN
                          (leveling gun)
                    Get the fuck back! 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                2.

        CONTINUED:55

      Nobody does. As Ben s heart rate races higher, we FREEZE, and 
      HEAR OVER:

                                  ANONYMOUS VOICE (V.O.)
                    Cops wake up every morning 
                    different from the rest of us. Our 
                    worst nightmare is just their 
                      Wednesday.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. LYDIA S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN66

      LYDIA wakes up to an urgent POUNDING on her front door. She 
      checks the alarm clock -- it s 5:57 a.m. WTF? She grabs her 
      gun from her night stand drawer and goes out into the hall...    

      INT./EXT. LYDIA S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER77

      Lydia looks through the peephole, Christ... She opens up to 
      find DENELLE PRICE, looking desperate and scared. Denelle, 
      once pretty, is Lydia s age but looks older. 

                                    DENELLE
                    I know, I m sorry, me bein  here, 
                    but I needed someplace safe.  

                                  LYDIA
                          (pissed off)
                    How d you get my address, Denelle? 

                                    DENELLE
                    Pastor Higgins at our church.  

                                  LYDIA
                     Our church?  Only time you were 
                    there, you were wrapped in a 
                    blanket eating soup. 

                                    DENELLE
                    You gonna let me in?  

                                  LYDIA
                    No. What the hell are you doing 
                    back in the neighborhood? 

                                    DENELLE
                    It s my brother s birthday.  

                                  LYDIA
                          (exasperated)
                    Your brother is in Pelican Bay.

                                    DENELLE
                    Yeah, but I still gotta mark it 
                    with my  play  brother, Darren.

                    But then Darren s boy J-Mac, 
                    y know, says those Treys I snitched 
                    on found out I was back. Now 
                    they re out lookin  to kill me. 

                                  LYDIA
                    What d you think was gonna happen? 

                                  DENELLE
                    I dunno --  

                                  LYDIA
                    Denelle, listen to me: we moved you 
                    after the trial for your safety. 
                    You wanna stay safe, you gotta go 
                    back to Lancaster and stop sneaking 
                    back to your old  hood. 
                          (as Denelle s eyes well up)
                    What? 

                                  DENELLE
                    Things ain t exactly worked out for 
                    me in Lancaster, neither... 

                                  LYDIA
                    You re using again?

      Lydia grabs her hand, sees her fingertips are somewhat burnt. 

                                  DENELLE
                    Nuh-uh, I swear... Now c mon, can I 
                    come in? 
                          (off Lydia, feeling played)
                    Please, I got nowhere else. 

                                  LYDIA
                    Couple hours, that s it, till I can 
                    figure out what to do with you. 

      Lydia reluctantly lets her in, wincing at the smell of her. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

88INT. GYM - DAWN 

    A fit, buffed-out JOHN, SWEAT POURING down his face, lets the 
    270 lbs. he just bench-pressed CLANG the rack above his head. 
    He feels like a new man, and it shows in his every movement. 

    He swigs some Powerade and grabs a jump rope. As he jumps, 
      getting faster... starting to do some fancy footwork... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. SAMMY S CAR (MOVING/STOPPED) - MORNING99

      SAMMY drives with coffee talking to TAMMI on his Bluetooth, 
      while handing back a rattle to his 6-MONTH-OLD SON, NATE.    


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                4.

        CONTINUED:99

                                  SAMMY
                    Yeah, he slept good, and then took 
                    the whole bottle.  

                                  TAMMI (V.O.)
                    Did you change him? 

                                  SAMMY
                    No, I like to just let him sit in 
                    it. 

    A beat-up FORD with a tatted-up DRIVER pulls alongside him. 
      Sammy speeds up, keeping an eye on his side-view MIRROR...

                                  TAMMI (V.O.)
                    I m just asking, Sammy. I know 
                    sometimes you re rushed -- 

                                  SAMMY
                    I m taking Nate for his shots on 
                    Friday, right? 

                                  TAMMI (V.O.)
                    No, I still don t know. River says 
                    that the mercury -- 

                                  SAMMY
                    Yeah, I know what  River  says. I 
                    don t think your Pilates teacher s 
                    opinion should get more weight than 
                    the Surgeon General. All the crap I 
                    get exposed to on the street, we 
                    can t risk it... 

    He stops at a RED LIGHT, and yeah, something is hinky. The 
      Driver is REVVING HIS ENGINE and really eye-fucking him now.

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    Listen, um, I ll call you back in a 
                    bit -- bye. 

      Sammy glances in his MIRROR: Nate just GURGLING happily...

                    Whattsa matter? You don t remember

      Sammy meets the guy s gaze, his hand moving to his gun...

                    Why, there a reason I should? 

    A long, tense beat. But then the Driver breaks into a grin.

      INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - LOCKER ROOM - MORNING1010

      John suits up at the mirror (a crisp, dry-cleaned uniform), 
    and we see the still pink SCAR on his lower back. There s an 
      intense self-awareness to him as he secures his Sam Brown and 
      gun...  

    He stares into the mirror. In his eyes, mostly confidence, 
    but then just the hint of doubt: Now that he s off the 
      pills... does he still have the nerve to be out there?   

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The BARRISTA knows him and starts making his  usual ...

                    When I was on patrol, I wasn t 
                    making enough money, so I jump 
                    through the hoops to become a 
                    Detective Trainee. Now she 
                    complains I m making shit money and 
                    I m never home.

                                  LYDIA
                    She s right about the never home 
                    part. Detective hours.

                    I m tempted to go back to 
                      Afghanistan, do another tour, but

                    just to get the signing bonus.

      INT. JOHN & TANG S PATROL CAR (MOVING) - DAY1616

      Tang drives as John rides shotgun, trying to adjust to it.  

                                  TANG
                    I m driving, so obviously I m 
                    contact. I carry a Glock .40, 
                    extended magazines are in my war 
                    bag. My back-up s on my right 
                    ankle, it s a 5-shot .38. You?  

                                  JOHN
                    Smith and Wesson .9. 
                          (Tang looks at him, and?)
                    I stopped carrying a second gun 
                    when my back got bad. Used to press 
                    against a nerve every time I sat 
                    down. 

                                  TANG
                    I d feel better if you carried one. 
                    How long have you been out of 
                    rehab?   

                                  JOHN

                     Rehab?  

                                  TANG

      CONTINUED:1616

      John eyes her... wondering just how much she knows, and what 
      that was exactly. After a beat -- 

                                  TANG
                    You ll start carrying a back-up 
                    then? 

                                  JOHN
                    I ll think about it, yeah.   

    She nods. Great. A beat of driving, and then:

                                  TANG
                    So, what nickname you gonna use? 
                     Hollywood,   Joy Luck,   Pu Tang?  
                    I ve pretty much heard  em all. 

                                  JOHN
                    How about just  Jessica?  

                                  TANG
                          (eyes him)
                    You see it?

                                  JOHN
                    What? 

                                  TANG
                    The video of me? 

                                  JOHN
                    Haven t had a chance. 

                                  TANG
                    Ah, so you re the one... 

      As they both see, in front of them, a GREY CUTLASS fail to 
      stop for a PEDESTRIAN in a crosswalk, nearly hitting her.  

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    Light him up. 

      EXT. MINI-MALL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS1717

      John and Tang, LIGHTS FLASHING, pull the Cutlass over. Tang 
      gets out and goes to the DRIVER as John presses on the trunk 
      (to make sure it s not open) and takes up position as 
       cover. 

                                  TANG
                    License and registration please, 
                    sir. 

      The Driver, a young sinewy black guy, is hostile right off --

                    Why you harassin  me? I didn t do

                    And if I just don t give it to you? 

      Tang s eyes flick to John. Potential situation here --   

                                  TANG
                    Sir, are you refusing to give me 
                    your license and registration?  

                                  CUTLASS DRIVER
                    Damn fuckin  right I am.  

                                  TANG
                    Get out of the car, sir. 
                          (a beat, he just eye-fucks 
                          her)
                    Get out of your car, now. 

                                  CUTLASS DRIVER
                    You get me out, bitch. 

      Tang s every cell tenses, pure focus, about to do just that --

                                  JOHN
                    Hey, asshole! You wanna go home 
                    with a traffic ticket or to jail 
                    after we make it hurt?

    As suddenly, from out of nowhere -- A BLACK SUV with tinted 
      windows SKIDS UP in front of the Cutlass forming a  T.  

                                  TANG
                    Cooper! 

      Tang draws her gun and backs up, taking cover at the rear of 
    the Cutlass. John finds cover behind a parked car and draws 
      down too. Some PASSERS-BY SCREAM and run inside a store, as -- 

    An IMPOSING WOMAN exits the SUV and storms up to the Cutlass. 

                                  IMPOSING WOMAN
                    Reginald, what the hell you do?

      John has pretty much relaxed by now, but Tang s at the SUV, 
      making sure there are no other occupants...

      Momma moves aside, but in b.g. her RANT CONTINUES, just

      I./E. BEN & SAM S CAR (MOVING)/PRESCHOOL - ST./ALLEY - DAY1818

      Ben and Sammy (Sammy driving) are hauling ass, Code 3, trying 
      to pin-point the location of MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS we re hearing. 
      They ZOOM past a side-street, an alley, SCANNING, and then...   * 

                                  BEN
                    Back, back up! The alley! Put your *
                    glasses on, man!   *

      Sammy SLAMS the breaks, BURNS RUBBER in reverse. DOWN THE 
      ALLEY we see a GANGSTER and his RIVAL shooting at each other 
      with handguns. Sammy SCREECHES off into the alley, just as --    

      They see the Rival s head take a bullet and practically fly 
      apart. The Gangster runs off. Sammy GUNS IT, throwing on his *
      glasses, and they chase him... past cowering CITIZENS, till  *
      they get to the front of a PRESCHOOL. As they SKID UP, they  *
      watch the Gangster run inside.             SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                15.


      EXT. PRESCHOOL - FRONT DOOR - DAY1919

    Ben and Sammy jump out, Ben grabbing the shotgun. Freaked-out 
      BYSTANDERS are SHOUTING and pointing inside. 

      Dewey and his PARTNER skid up now too, as suddenly, TEACHERS 
    and SMALL CHILDREN pour down the steps SCREAMING in terror. 

    Our cops run through them, to the steps, and see a TRAIL OF 
      BLOOD leading up to the front door.

                    There s kids in there. 

      Sammy, Ben, and Dewey move up the stairs till they get to the 
      FRONT DOOR, half ajar and swaying ominously. They all meet 
      eyes, and then --

      FADE IN:

      INT. PRESCHOOL - CLASSROOM/HALL/BATHROOM - DAY2020

      Sammy, Ben, and Dewey move through, clearing a CLASSROOM, 
      past TEACHERS clutching KIDS all desperate to stay hidden. 
    One 4 YEAR OLD under a desk points down a HALL. Sammy motions 
    and they head there, seeing BLOOD on the floor, more streaked 
    on the walls... They get to a BATHROOM DOOR, kids  paintings 
    all over it. On Sammy s signal, they bust in, TO FIND --   

    Our Gangster shot in the neck, alive, slumped against some 
      KIDDIE TOILETS. He s soaked in his own blood and literally 
      drowning in it, sucking air with a horrible RASPING sound. 

      Seeing cops, he tries to get up and grab for his gun, which 
      lies on the tiles just a few feet out of his reach. But it s 
      pathetic. Sammy kicks the gun away, as our cops stand over 
      him catching their breath...    

                                  BEN
                          (into radio)
                    Adam-36, I need an R/A at my 
                    location, suspect down with a 
                    gunshot wound to the neck...  

      Sammy moves closer to the guy.    

                                  SAMMY
                          (to Gangster, re: wound)
                    Man, that is one big hole in a very  *
                    important spot. 
                          (to Ben and Dewey)
                    Wouldn t you guys agree? 
                          (to Gangster)
                    You are definitely not gonna make 
                    it.   

                                  DEWEY
                    Just walk toward the light, man. 
                    Oh, wait, there is none where 
                    you re going.  

                                  SAMMY
                    Any last words? Maybe ask for 
                    forgiveness? 

    The Gangster, violent to the end, makes an awful GURGLING 
      noise that sounds a lot like  fuck you.  Then his eyes go 
      glassy. He dies with his head in one of the toilets. Long 
      beat, then --    

                                  DEWEY
                      Appropriate resting place at least.

      EXT. LITTLE COFFEE SHOP - STREET - DAY2121

      John and Tang get coffees and head to their car. Tang s nose 
    is buried in her phone checking the  net... John stopping as 
    she lags behind.   

                                  JOHN
                    Guy next to me in the hospital,

                    like that. Flipped over a fire 
                    hydrant --

                                  TANG
                    I requested you.

                    Got tired of getting hit on, and 
                    knew you wouldn t be a problem.

      John eyes her, and again, she just looks back with innocence. 
      Does she know he s gay, or was that really a kind of 
      compliment? As they pop their doors, about to climb in -- 

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    I have an issue with your tactics 
                    at that last stop.  
                          (off John, oh really?)
                    You let your guard down after that 
                    woman exited the SUV.   

                                  JOHN
                    I saw her through the windshield 
                    and determined the threat was low. 

                                  TANG
                    The side windows were tinted, there 
                    could ve been other occupants. You 
                    should ve alerted to that. 

    A weird beat; John knows she s right. She s out-John-ing John. 

                                  JOHN
                    Okay. Point taken. 

      Tang nods, cool, as BACK AT THE COFFEE SHOP -- A COMMOTION. 
      An ANGRY CUSTOMER, something a bit  off  about him, is making 
    a scene about his bagel, as the WAITRESS tries to deal.

                                  ANGRY CUSTOMER
                    Go ahead, bite it -- this thing is 
                    like a rock. The sign says fresh 
                    baked goods.

                    Sir, calm down, or I m gonna call 
                    over those cops.

    The man looks over, LOCKING EYES with John and Tang. Long 
      beat. He backs down. He SLAPS some money down on the table 
    and goes to his nearby parked CAR. Jumps in and drives off... 

                                  TANG
                    Someone had too much coffee.

      Sammy, Ben, and Dewey walk toward the body of the GANGSTER S 
      RIVAL, his head canoed from a bullet at close range. No 
      yellow tape yet, no Coroner s van. TWO 8 YEAR OLDS with 
      sticks LAUGH nervously and poke at the guy s brains, SMOKE 
      STILL RISING.   

    ON BEN -- seeing Ferguson... just standing there blankly 
      watching, wad of tobacco in his cheek. Ferguson spits.

                    What? What are you talking about? 

    Ben moves off toward Ferguson, as Sammy and Dewey trade 
      looks. Then Sammy follows Ben, keeping an eye on him...

                    Hey, take it down a notch. There s 
                    10,000 of us, and it takes all 
                    kinds. He s a pretty great cop in

                                  BEN
                    Right... 

                                  SAMMY
                     Bout a year ago we served a 
                    warrant, bunch of assholes in 
                    custody, when this baby gangster, 
                    little punk, gets all in my face. I  *
                    wasn t in the mood, so y know, I 
                    was seriously about to pop him. 
                    Ferguson just shook his head. 
                    Uncuffed one of the O.G. s and let 
                    the O.G. shut him up instead.     

                                  BEN
                    And you re okay with that? 

                                  SAMMY
                    Better than me gettin  in a scrape, 
                    or a complaint put in my package. 

    Ben takes this in, as they cruise THE PROJECTS... They pass a 
    FAT WOMAN pulling a 4 YEAR OLD GIRL by the hand. The girl 
      waves to Ben. Ben waves back... as the Fat Woman SLAPS her 
      hard upside the head for being friendly to the cops. 

    Ben shakes his head slightly, watching them whiz by, as the 
      RADIO CRACKLES and we hear JOHN S VOICE buying a call -- 

                                  RADIO (O.S. JOHN)

                    Lot 12.     

    Ben reacts to hearing his old T.O., throws Sammy a look --

                    Cooper s back?

      I./E. JOHN & TANG S PATROL CAR/DODGERS PARKING LOT - DAY2525

      John and Tang roll up to a big CIRCULAR CROWD dwarfed by the 
      vastness of this huge deserted parking lot. We see the lonely 
      cement pilasters and cones separating the various parking 
      areas, the effect quite surreal. In the center of the crowd, 
    a beat-up BUICK appears to be recklessly  doing donuts.  

                                  JOHN
                    Knuckleheads... 

                                  TANG
                    It s only funny till someone s road 
                    kill.

      They hop out and move to the inner perimeter around the 
      Buick, tires WHINING as it banks around. Tang cautiously 
      approaches the driver s side, having to break into a jog, but 
      then sees --  

    NO ONE S DRIVING. It s a prank. A bungy cord holds the wheel 
    in an endless  right turn  position.  

                                  JOHN
                          (to crowd)
                    Hey, fun s over! 

                                  TANG
                    Who did this? Anyone know? 

      The crowd s not talking; at least half take phone videos. The 
      Buick s wheels SQUEAL and start to smell of burnt rubber... 

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    Shoot the tires, T.J. Hooker? 

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah, and have to deal with FID? 
                    All that paperwork? 
                          (a beat)
                    Here, hold this. Don t wanna get 
                    caught on anything. 

      John takes off his side-handle Monadnock baton and hands it 
      to her, along with his sunglasses, starts stretching his back 
    a little -- 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (re: back)
                    Let s hope the pins hold.

      CONTINUED:2525

    He starts running alongside the car, holding on to the frame 
    of the OPEN WINDOW. At just the right moment, John dives in 
      head-first, eventually getting his legs in. We catch glimpses 
      of awkward movements, and then -- the car stops.  

      HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd, as John emerges with the 
      CONCRETE BLOCK that had been put on the gas pedal. Tang 
      shakes her head, pretty ballsy, as John throws her a smile.

                                                                            CUT TO:

    The asshole throws the girl down like a rag doll and rabbits. 
      Sammy and Ben go after him. He cuts down a NARROW PATH along 
      some public housing units and plows straight through a CHAIN-
      LINK FENCE, knowing just where to hit it. They do the same 
      but get scratched to shit. They come out in an ALLEY and see

                    Fuck you doin  in my yard? Go 
                    around, muthafucka!  

      The other gangsters CHORUS and start closing in around Ben. 
      Ben has to think fast, and knows he can t seem weak --

                    Yeah. Broke into his room and did 
                    it in front of his little sister. 
                    That suddenly okay in this 
                      neighborhood? 

    The gangsters are still pissed, but fuck that shit...

      With a nod from the O.G., the mob parts and they let Ben 
      through. Ben unlatches a back gate, and we see the look on *
    his face -- shit, that was close. Ben takes off running...     *

      EXT. WATTS AVENUE - DAY3333

      Sammy chases the asshole, really flying, gaining on him. UP 
      AHEAD -- 2 COP CARS, lights and SIRENS, come fish-tailing 
      around a corner to cut him off. Desperate, the asshole runs 
      out into the street, cars HONKING, swerving. He barely avoids  
      speeding cars, even manages to scramble up over the hood and 
      roof of one while it s moving, without getting hurt, but then 
      -- he gets creamed by an ONCOMING TRUCK and thrown 20 feet. 

      Sammy catches up to him, his broken body on the ground. Still 
      alive but wrecked. As Sammy stands over him, sucking air... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Tang and John drive, Tang glancing impatiently at her phone.

                    minutes, the line ll be around the

    A dented COROLLA whizzes past them in the other direction, 
      seemingly oblivious and way over the speed limit.  

                                  TANG (CONT D)
                    Ignore it.

      John hits the SIREN. With a hard look, Tang whips a U-ey --

      EXT. STREETS - DAY3535

      Tang and John have pulled over the Corolla, the DRIVER rock 
      still in a way that seems ominous. As usual, Tang cautiously  
      walks up to him... but then even she relaxes a bit as she 
      sees an exceedingly mellow WHITE RASTAFARIAN with heavy 
      eyelids at the wheel.  

                                  TANG
                    Sir, you been maybe doing a little 
                    partying this morning? 

                                  COROLLA DRIVER
                    Nuh-uh, nope. 

                                  TANG
                    No drugs or alcohol for you today? 

                                  COROLLA DRIVER
                    Nope.

      Tang glances at John, who by now is coming up next to her... 

                                  JOHN
                    Step out of the car for us, sir. 
                          (he does, rather shakily)
                    Can you walk a straight line -- 

    The Driver falls against the Corolla, stoned out of his mind. 
      They catch him and get him to stand up on his own...   

                                  TANG
                    Alright, sir, okay. You got any 
                    tampons on you today? 

      John stifles a laugh --

      Tang gestures behind his ear, and now we see -- a big FAT 
      DOOBIE as thick as your index finger. Tang plucks it out.

      EXT. WATTS AVENUE - DAY3636

      Ben, Ferguson, and OTHER COPS are attempting to secure the 
      scene around the asshole s broken body. An ANGRY CROWD has 
      formed. People have their phones out taking video. 

    In b.g. Sammy talks to the teary-eyed GIRL whom the asshole 
      was beating, her LIPS and NOSE BLOODY. She s wrapped in a 
      blanket and sitting in the back of a PATROL CAR. Sammy leaves 
    her with a FEMALE COP and hooks up with Ben and Ferguson.  

                                  SAMMY
                    She s 14, he s her mom s boyfriend. 
                    She stayed home sick from school 
                    while Mom went to work. He jumped 
                    her.  

                                  FERGUSON

                    She fought him off before he could 
                    rape her and ran into the street. 

                                  FERGUSON
                    Hurt his feelings, sure. Who 
                    wouldn t pound the hell out of her?  *

                    step right up.  

    Ben looks to Sammy: This guy is out of control. The other 
      cops start pushing the crowd back onto the sidewalk...

                    And your point is, Columbo? 

                                  BEN
                    I don t think we should let him do

                     Every life is precious.    

    Ben looks to Sammy, who doesn t give him much support. The 
      rage of the crowd increasing, getting scary -- 

                                  CROWD MEMBER (O.S) 
                    They just gonna kill him! It s

                                  BEN
                    I m getting the kit. 

      Defiant, Ben goes to the OPEN TRUNK of a PATROL CAR and 
      brings over a FIRST AID KIT. Again he meets eyes with Sammy: 
    I m really on my own here? A beat, then Sammy kneels down 
      with Ben next to the guy. They take out bandages and start 
      wrapping them around his legs, as he MOANS. 

                                  SAMMY
                          (sotto)
                    Not too tight, okay...

      Ben stares at him.

      Lydia and Ruben talk quietly with TWO NARCS, baggies of rock 
      laid out on the hood of their CROWN VIC. A DEALER and several 
      CRACKHEADS are cuffed and seated on the curb, being F/I d by 
      PATROL COPS. Denelle stands off to the side, looking like a 
      guilty child. Lydia goes to her, Ruben watching. A beat. 
      Lydia madder than we ve ever seen her.

      John and Tang get out of their car and walk to a whimsically

      Sammy, Ben, and Ferguson hook up with the PARAMEDICS as they 
      slide the guy into the AMBULANCE. The crowd is quieter now, 
      duped into believing that the cops at least did something.   

                                  SAMMY
                          (to Paramedic)
                    Any word on the victim s injuries? 

                                  PARAMEDIC #1
                    Broken nose, collar bone. Not great 
                    but she ll be okay.   

      They all share a look of relief. The Paramedic nods toward 
    the asshole and gives our cops a knowing, even amused look.   *

                    Don t quit your day jobs. Bandages 
                    on this guy were about as tight as 
                    an old lady s nighty. *

                    I gotta cuff him to the gurney. 

    But then the other PARAMEDIC leans his head out.

                          (good job)
                    Keep your cuffs clean, man. He s 
                    dead. 

      Ferguson spits. Shame. And even Sammy just nods; he ll sleep 
      just fine. OFF BEN, feeling like an island, but also not 
      quite sure what he s feeling...

      INT. NYTEX PANTY HOSE FACTORY - SHIPPING FLOOR - DAY4040

      John and Tang are staring up at STEPHEN MILSAP (white, late 
      40 s) who s standing atop a fully extended  GENIE LIFT  with 
    a rope of tied-together PANTY HOSE tied around his neck. The 
      other end of it is tied to the basket of the Genie Lift that 
      surrounds him. A 2ND  GENIE LIFT  is nearby, this one in the 
       down  position. With John and Tang is JERRY BICKS, the 
      shipping manager. Scattered around, at crappy desks, in 
      varying states of awe, confusion, and horror are EMPLOYEES. 
      Tang s on her cell off to the side, speaking in hushed tones.  

                                  JOHN

                                  MILSAP
                    No! Nobody leaves, or I ll jump! 

      Tang hangs up and comes over.

                    More dates, more dough, till she

                    Mr. Milsap, listen, I bet she does 
                    like you. You know women, they play 
                    games. But lemme tell ya: she s not 
                    gonna be impressed if you hang 
                    yourself with panty hose. Okay? So 
                    come on down... Mr. Milsap... okay?  

      Milsap s just closed his eyes and is now swaying back and 
      forth in the Genie Lift basket. John and Tang look to Bicks.  

                                  BICKS
                    Yeah. He just does that sometimes.   

      Tang s jaw goes tight; she glances at her phone.

                    I know her schedule, okay? What I 
                    asked you, is she coming?

      John and Tang trade eyes, ill-equipped, but not much choice.   

                                  TANG
                    Yeah, she s coming. Just gonna take 
                    her a bit in traffic. 

                                  MILSAP
                    Did she sound  sorry  on the phone? 

                                  JOHN
                          (cautious)
                    Is that... what you ve been waiting 
                    for? Her to apologize? 

                                  TANG
                    And then you ll come down? 

                                  MILSAP
                    Yeah. So was she sorry? 

      John and Tang exhale a bit; finally, a little sunshine. 

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah, absolutely. Very, very sorry. 

                                  MILSAP
                          (calmed by it)
                    She said that? 

                                  TANG
                    She did. 

      Milsap nods, even smiles. His eyes close, taking that in. But 
      then, his eyes pop open and he seems like a different person: 

                                  MILSAP
                    Sandra s always been a liar.  

      Milsap steps off the Genie Lift -- 

                                  JOHN / TANG 
                    Hey! No! *



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                41.

      CONTINUED: (2)4242

    -- and starts CHOKING to death, hanging, KICKING WILDLY, 
      making AWFUL NOISES. Bicks and the others SCREAM and run out 
    of the room, horrified and disgusted, as John and Tang climb 
    on the second  Genie Lift  and throw it into gear, the engine 
      WHIRRING, moving up... up... at an excruciatingly slow pace. 

                                  JOHN
                    Thing s slow... really slow... *

      Tang just shakes her head. Her cell DINGS, she checks it, as 
      Milsap goes limp and his BLADDER lets go. 

                                  TANG
                          (salt in the wound)
                    Truck just left downtown. Going to 
                    Rancho Cucamonga.  

      Off this bizarre tableau, Milsap dying, the lift slowly 
      rising, the empty factory floor below --

      INT. ALVARADO STATION - BULLPEN/LOBBY - DAY4545

      Ben and Sammy in their civvies, Ben now calmed down, walk 
      through toward the LOBBY after shift. They see Ferguson, 
      still in uniform, drinking a soda and filling out a late 
      report. As they ignore him --    

                                  SAMMY
                    Big party tonight in Castaic. Coker 
                    from Shootin  Newton. You should 
                    come check it out. 

                                  BEN
                    Mostly cops, right?

                                  SAMMY
                    And girls, that s the beauty.   

                                  BEN
                    Yeah, think I ll pass.

                                  SAMMY
                    Sure. Why get drunk, and laid, when 
                    you can hear a guy play the zither. 
                    Maybe get some Turkish coffee...   

      Ben gives him a look -- let the shit-giving continue. They 
      clock a MAN entering the station whom we vaguely recognize: 
      it s the Customer who argued with the Waitress and locked 
      eyes with John and Tang. We re processing that, as suddenly --  

                                  LOBBY DESK COP (O.S.)
                    Gun! 

      The guy whips a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE out from under his 
      jacket and starts BLASTING from the lobby, shooting to kill.

    A weird, suspended micro-beat. And then hell breaks loose:   

      Ben draws his off-duty gun, taking cover and RETURNING FIRE. 
      But there are PILLARS in his sight-line; he can t get a clear 
      shot. As he moves tactically toward the lobby --  

      Sammy fumbles in his bag, his back-up gun inside; MOVE WITH 
      HIM as he finds it, running and FIRING toward the lobby --   




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                43.

      CONTINUED:4545

    And now Ben, Sammy, and OTHER COPS are FIRING and it s chaos. 
    A close-range, ugly, awful ballet ensues, as the man leaps 
      over the LOBBY DESK, STILL FIRING. It s all caught on 
      SURVEILLANCE CAM, as STAFF and COPPERS (many caught off-guard 
    and not used to drawing their guns) throw files, trash cans, 
      anything they can find -- and some TAKE BULLETS. 

    We see one PANICKED COP SCREAMING and running away from the 
      man, desperate to get away. The man turns his rifle in this 
      cop s direction, about to shoot him in the back, when -- 

                                  FERGUSON
                    Hey -- asshole! 

    A SODA CAN thrown by Ferguson hits the edge of a pillar the 
      man s behind, splattering him in the eyes. The man points his 
      rifle at Ferguson instead and FIRES, as Ferguson comes right 
    at him, unloading, till Ferguson gets shot and goes down.   

    And then -- by whom it s not even clear -- the man s shot 
      dead and falls hard.   

      We hear MOANS... people shifting on the floor... the SOUNDS 
      of teeth-gritting pain undergirded by a weighty silence. Ben 
      and Sammy trade eyes. Both unhurt, if dazed. And as the SMOKE 
      LIFTS, we see... at least FOUR COPS are down, Ferguson among 
      them, and he s not too far from Ben. Ben hears his LABORED 
      BREATHING and goes over to check him out. Ben sees he s been *
      shot in the CHEEK, and taken a couple to his vest as well. *
    Ben bends over him, starting to render aid... And then --    *

      It s eerily silent. The shock of it all surreal, as we...  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - ROLL CALL - DAY4646

      John s in his civvies after shift, alone. He takes a DVD from 
    a manila envelope and sticks it in the machine, hits  play.      
    On a TV we see the LAPD LOGO... It s a POLICE TRAINING VIDEO.

      ON-SCREEN -- Tang, from a couple years ago, from the POV of a 
      DASH CAM. She approaches the driver s side and asks a BIG GUY 
    for his license. She s solo, no partner. He gives her lip, it 
      isn t clear, and then he makes a move for his glove box...  

      Concerned he might have a weapon, Tang makes the mistake of 
      leaning too far into his window. Suddenly, the guy pivots and 
      just PUNCHES her in the face, breaking her nose and laying 
    her flat-out on her ass.   

    And then this THUG, prison-big, gets out and beats her 
      brutally. It s very hard to watch. John has to force himself. 

    At last, the video freezes on the FINAL IMAGE -- just half of 
      Tang still IN FRAME, BLOODY, limp, the guy in mid-kick. The 
      SCREEN GOES BLUE. John senses a presence behind him...

      It s Tang. Long beat. 

                                  TANG
                    You really hadn t seen it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Guy was big, Jessica. 

                                  TANG
                    Yeah, and I was stupid. Should ve 
                    backed up. Kept him in my sight-
                    line.

                                  JOHN
                    I m gonna drive tomorrow. 

                                  TANG
                    No, not yet. 

                                  JOHN
                    You got nothing to prove to me. 

                                  TANG
                    It s not about you. 

    A beat, John understanding. No doubt he d be the same way...    

                                  JOHN
                    So, how d I do today?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                45.

                                  TANG
                    What do you mean?

                                  JOHN
                    C mon, I know they ve told you to 
                    tell  em if I m still fit to be out 
                    there. 
                          (Tang shrugs, won t lie)
                    Any conclusions so far? 

                                  TANG
                    We ll see how tomorrow goes. 
                          (John smiles... okay)
                    Hey,  Truck Norris  is back in the 
                    city now, over near Palms. You up 
                    for a late lunch? 

                                  JOHN
                    Nah, salmonella screws up my sleep. 
                    How  bout a drink instead?

                                  TANG
                    Thanks, some other time.

                                  JOHN
                    You really gonna drive to Palms to  *
                    eat off a freakin  roach coach, *
                    because it s Wednesday? *

      She nods. Hoping that he gets it. Her way of keeping a grip  *
      on things. A growing COMMOTION from outside -- COPS TALKING 
      LOUDLY and gathering around a TV showing NEWS FOOTAGE of the 
      shooting -- draws their attention through the glass... 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)*
                    What the hell... 

      As they start to the door -- 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. ALVARADO STATION - PARKING LOT - DUSK4747

      YELLOW TAPE and barriers surround the crime scene, as WE FIND 
      Ben and Sammy leaning on a PATROL CAR surrounded by other 
      BLACK & WHITES with LIGHTS SWIRLING; NEWS VANS and REPORTERS; 
      SUITS walking around with notebooks. This is a big deal.  

      After a beat, Sammy suddenly THROWS UP, holding the side-view 
      mirror as he retches. Ben next to him still looks as if his 
      every cell is vibrating.

                    Yeah? You sure of that? 

      Sammy fixes Ben with a look, Ben silently acknowledging  
      Sammy s right -- what Ferguson did can t be denied.

                    That FID guy said they re gonna 
                    want your guns. And a statement, 
                    you know.

                    Yeah, let me get right on that.  

                                  SAMMY
                    Any word on who the shooter was? 

                                  DEWEY
                    No. Just some guy. *

      As they all absorb that, still reeling from the adrenaline...  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. VENICE BEACH - DUSK4848

      The RUMBLE of an LAPD AIRSHIP overhead, as we find Lydia and 
      Ruben walking on the beach toward the ocean. They re met by a 
      PATROL COP, who gestures toward a very large, half taped up 
       Igloo  COOLER embedded in the sand like a sunken treasure. 

                                  PATROL COP
                          (off notes)
                    Some Narcs busting a crack pad 
                     round 114th, reported a woman 
                    getting shoved into a blinged-out 
                    Escalade. This one matches her 
                      description...  

      Lydia nods, and she and Ruben walk up to the COOLER riddled 
      with BULLET HOLES. DENELLE S BODY is inside full of bullets, 
      one leg hanging out. Lydia stares. People have a choice. To 
      rise above, or drown. Lydia s own words, and she meant them. 

    But it s hard.    

      Lydia looks out at the waves and sees a lone SHOE, one of 
      Denelle s, just now making its way to shore... 

      Silence. Just the WAVES CRASHING. 

                                  LYDIA
                    Guess she finally got to see the 
                    ocean.

      Then, with a last look at Denelle, and a nod to Ruben, Lydia 
      slips off her shoes. She starts to walk off down the beach. 
    She walks barefoot in the water as the sun sets over 
      Malibu...  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BEN S APT. - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT4949

    Ben kills a beer in the kitchen, sets down the bottle and 
      finds his keys. He s dressed to go out, cool leather jacket. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#401 - PINK - 10/26/11                48.

      CONTINUED:4949

    A TV in b.g. DRONES the local news... some mindless puff 
      piece, the renewed popularity of metal lunch boxes or some 
      shit.  

    Ben finds his boots and starts lacing them up, glancing 
      aimlessly at the TV. It s almost like nothing happened. He 
      could almost convince himself. But then... something catches 
    his eye, something white and a bit red that s lodged in the 
      tread of his boot. He takes it out. It s a HUMAN TOOTH. 

      He stares at it.*

      ON TV -- A WEATHER WOMAN in a tight dress, giving tomorrow s 
      forecast. Ben turns UP the volume. 

                                    WEATHER WOMAN
                    ... And for tomorrow, holy cow, 
                    just a perfect day here in the 
                    Southland, 70 s, sunshine, tons of 
                    blue skies...  

    Ben clicks the TV OFF. Stares again at the tooth. Then he 
      tosses it in a small dish on the counter. Goes to the door. 
      What else is he supposed to do? Tomorrow will be Thursday. 

    Ben walks out and SLAMS the door, as we -- 

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.
