A mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing
holographic map of L.A. fills one wall. Most of the control
personnel have left their work stations and gather around TV sets
all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport
sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of
Rotor City.
A tall, steel-faced officer sits at his desk. This is Firebase
Commander MAC "BIG DOG" MALLOY. Hard, battle weary features.
BRAZEN, a section Lieutenant, comes up.
BRAZEN
Commander Malloy. They're bringing him
out, sir.
Malloy rises from his chair, steps to a nearby TV set, watches the
scene from the Police Channel.
MALLOY
So we finally got him.
A glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch
Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation
Center.
POLICE ANCHOR
You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes,
Plissken. The murder of an Internal
Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank
president. Gun fighting for profit. The
list goes on and on...
Deeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the
deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the
Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the
dark, low concrete passageway.
POLICE ANCHOR
You used to respect the law. Served your
country like no man before you. Role model
to a generation.
The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's
face.
POLICE ANCHOR
What happened to you, war hero? You were
the best we had.
STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
Steel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees
here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his
entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded
message...
POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
You are sentenced to permanent expulsion
beyond the borders of the U.S. You now
have the option to repent of your sins and
be electrocuted on the premises. If you
elect this option, notify the Cleric
Sergeant in your Processing Area.
Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in
front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through
opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into
futuristic electric chairs.
POLICE ANCHOR
The whole world's watching. Every good and
decent person who works and hard and
follows the rules. What would say to them?
Plissken's expression is blank.
POLICE ANCHOR
What would you say to all of us who
believed in you, who looked up to you, who
thought you stood for right over wrong,
good over evil? Be my guest. What do you
have to say, Plissken?
PLISSKEN
(beat)
Call me Snake.
The guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel
doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders.
Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move
urgently along a corridor.
BRAZEN
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
database of 5 million sociopathic
personalities. He hit the bottom of the
curve.
MALLOY
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
pull it off - not an army, not a man.
BRAZEN
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
compassion. A highly developed
psychopathic instinct to survive.
3RD MAN
Let's get this over with.
The cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg
irons. He looks around.
In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light
above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks
up the watch, examines it.
The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the
room unarmed. The door closes.
Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd
Man stays back in the shadows by the door.
MALLOY
How you doin' Plissken?
(no reply)
You like the watch?
PLISSKEN
You assholes didn't bring me here to give
me this for 20 years of dedicated service.
What'ya want?
Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows...
3RD MAN
Get to it.
Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go
down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall...
From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge.
Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly
areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a
tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty,
virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered
dress.
MALLOY
At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
government officials began a tour of the
Livermore Defense Lab. The President's
daughter, Utopia, was among them.
Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall...
MALLOY
An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
Washington.
The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes...
From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the
main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a
black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on
top. In the other, a machine gun.
UTOPIA
(to the camcorder)
To the American people - it is time to
rise up and demand the surrender of the
President and his corrupt theocracy of
lies and terror.
MALLOY
At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy
presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads
out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation.
Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret
service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates
a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera.
She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.
UTOPIA
Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
days of the empire are finished.
(beat)
To the President - my father, you know
what this is.
She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it
at the camcorder.
UTOPIA
You know what it will do. Unless you
abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I
will use it - on you.
CONGRESSMAN
Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If
something should happen -
UTOPIA
It will be in my hands - and the hands of
my lover.
She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can
muster. The others are shocked.
UTOPIA
Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
I've ever known. I'm on my way to his
arms.
She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small
hatch in the floor, scrambles down...
WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again
standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in
front of him.
MALLOY
Somehow during the tour, she came into
possession of a prototype transmitting
device. We don't know how.
BRAZEN
Utopia became depressed after her mother's
suicide, began to withdraw into her
virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up
her own little world in cyberspace and
stay in it for days at a time.
(hits a button)
Somebody else was in there with her.
AN IMAGE APPEARS
In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and
sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of
Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American
terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a
gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around
him.
MALLOY
Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang
in L.A.
Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome,
charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to
embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's
on a loop. The image disappears.
The lights in the cell come up.
BRAZEN
Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
then tried to erase them. She missed this
fragment on the end of her last tape.
Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
master data bank - and then went prowling
around for innocent blood, someone
vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely,
looking for something to believe in.
PLISSKEN
Sad story. You got a cigarette?
MALLOY
Shut up, Plissken.
PLISSKEN
What's the little black box do?
MALLOY
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
PLISSKEN
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm
goin' to Hollywood.
MALLOY
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what
we want you're not coming back.
PLISSKEN
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
find the President's daughter, secure the
box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm
free?
MALLOY
That's the deal.
PLISSKEN
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll
like L.A.
After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and
Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers.
3RD MAN
If you bring out the prototype, you'll
receive a full pardon for every immoral
act you have ever committed in the United
States. Just like in '97. Remember New
York, Plissken?
PLISSKEN
(looks at him)
Who are you?
MALLOY
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
PRESIDENT
I give you my word. Put the prototype into
my hands, and you're a free man.
PLISSKEN
I can see you're real concerned about your
daughter.
PRESIDENT
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
PLISSKEN
Well, I'll think it over.
PRESIDENT
You're running out of time.
PLISSKEN
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as
well do it in L.A. Everybody else there
is.
MALLOY
Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
hours to live.
Malloy, Brazen, and the President turn to leave...
PLISSKEN
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
MALLOY
Having second thoughts?
PLISSKEN
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in
me this time.
MALLOY
You don't understand. It's already in you.
PLISSKEN'S FACE
As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes
suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
MALLOY
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
undercover cop. She injected you with
incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming
in your bloodstream. It'll start to take
effect in 9 hours.
BRAZEN
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
Genetically engineered. 100% pure death.
Complete nervous system shutdown. You
crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not
a pretty sight.
Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large
hypodermic.
MALLOY
Of course there's an anti-toxin.
Neutralizes the virus immediately upon
injection.
(beat)
We'll give it to you, but you have to do
us this little favor.
TWO BEATS...
...and then Plissken attacks the President, hurls himself across
the room, throwing the chain around the President's neck...
Plissken passes right through the President, causing his image to
waver slightly, then falls on his ass.
PRESIDENT
Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
The real Malloy, Brazen, and President stand in front of a laser
camera in a small room offering a view of the cell through a
transparent portion of the wall.
MALLOY
We're holographs.
INSIDE THE CELL
Plissken stares at the three images in front of him, then at the
camera lens on the wall...
PLISSKEN
Get this crap out of me.
MALLOY
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
with you, Plissken.
PLISSKEN
(beat)
Call me Snake.
Plissken checks through various tactical survival items and
weapons laid out on a table. Brazen watches as Malloy show shim a
high tech submachine gun.
BRAZEN
Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds.
(moves on)
Two 9mm handguns.
(holds up a silver pill)
Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in
your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
Malloy breaks open the silver pill. Inside is s small, lethal
looking dart.
BRAZEN
Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several
seconds.
Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass.
MALLOY
Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
in her arm. You can locate her with this.
Brazen hands Plissken a large black clip.
BRAZEN
This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades.
Blows through anything.
Plissken snaps the clip onto his pistol, then unsnaps it.
Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype.
PLISSKEN
I'll need to know more about this thing.
MALLOY
Only a handful of people are aware of its
existence. Let's just say it's the
ultimate defensive weapon.
PLISSKEN
Defense against what?
MALLOY
There's a war about to be declared, or
didn't you know?
Plissken shrugs.
MALLOY
Third World wants to live like we do - and
they plan on taking what they want. The
Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade
Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make
a run at the border, we got a full scale
attack on the United States.
PLISSKEN
So what does this thing do?
MALLOY
All you need to know is get it back here
by 5 a.m.
Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel.
Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor
stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness.
MALLOY
(points to the open hatch)
You're going over by submarine. One-man
submersible. Nuclear powered.
Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening.
PLISSKEN
Where do I put ashore?
MALLOY
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through
the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl.
You should be able to pick up Utopia's
tracer there.
(beat)
Once you go inside, you're on your own.
(beat)
You know what you have to do with the
girl, don't you?
(beat)
We have to spare this nation her trial -
for treason.
PLISSKEN
So you want me to take her out?
(Malloy nods)
Is that an order from the President?
MALLOY
Let's just say it's what's best for the
country.
PLISSKEN
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
MALLOY
A medical team will be standing by.
PLISSKEN
Not you?
MALLOY
No.
PLISSKEN
Good.
KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no
damage. Malloy laughs.
MALLOY
Thought you might try that. First clip is
filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken.
Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut.
Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below
him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped
like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs
inside.
Plissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his
stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and
buttons, powering up the cockpit.
Malloy and Brazen move to a surveillance-command post.
PLISSKEN (V.O. RADIO)
Com check.
Malloy picks up the microphone.
MALLOY
I'm here, Plissken.
Plissken looks at the wrist watch. It ticks down ominously. Eight
hours and counting down...
MALLOY (V.O.)
Stand by for launch. Ignitor.
(Plissken pushes a button)
Fuel rod injection.
Plissken pulls a lever, watches his dials. A deep humming sound
grows louder inside the sub.
PLISSKEN
She's in the green.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Lock fuel rods.
PLISSKEN
(hits a switch)
Locked.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Plissken turns a throttle-like control with his left hand.
Out of the rear tubes of Plissken's sub comes a roaring blue glow.
PLISSKEN
75% power.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Hands on switches and counting.
5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
The rear tubes roar. Suddenly the sub is shot forward through a
long, circular tunnel.
Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the
force.
Plissken is rocked with the impact. He guides the sub with hand
controls. In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of
the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley.
Malloy, Brazen and other cops follow Plissken's course on a
gigantic computer screen.
MALLOY
Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
obstructions down there.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Plissken...
Plissken ignores him, carefully maneuvering the sub with his
controls.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Plissken... do you copy?
They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the
freeway.
Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%.
The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a
hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the
Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads:
"SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past.
Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status.
BRAZEN
His reactor's starting to overheat.
MALLOY
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're
overloading the power plant.
Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green,
moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Plissken...?
Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One
the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right
toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls.
Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit
through tiny cracks in the hull.
Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide
backwards down toward the water.
Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The
sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear
exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the
sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the
antenna.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Plissken...?
PLISSKEN
I'm here.
MALLOY (V.O.)
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared
off our screens.
PLISSKEN
It's history. I gotta go.
Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the
hillside when...
WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying
something huge and rounded at the ends.
Plissken raises his submachine gun...
... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit.
Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder.
Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV.
PIPELINE
Too bad about your boat, man.
(Plissken doesn't move)
Supposed to be some swells out here
tonight. Big ones.
(beat)
You like to surf?
Realizing Pipeline is no danger, Plissken moves past him up the
hillside.
PIPELINE
You look kinda familiar.
(beat)
You hang out around here much?
But Plissken's moved off into the darkness.
Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
"CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
TASLIMA
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
these buildings.
PLISSKEN
The what?
Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
men.
PLISSKEN
(yelling)
Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
gun!
Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
PLISSKEN
How do we get out of here?
TASLIMA
Sewers. Come on.
She pushes open the door...
Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
back down the tunnel.
FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
TASLIMA
Snake - what is it?
PLISSKEN
How the hell am I supposed to know? This
is your damn city.
Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
blasting, ringing sound. Music!
It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
is hooked to his belt.
He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
holds the gun on them.
Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
PENDEJO BOB
What're you doing in here?
PLISSKEN
Looking to get out.
PENDEJO BOB
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
PLISSKEN
Which way?
With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
With it, he examines Plissken's face.
PENDEJO BOB
You're Snake Plissken.
TASLIMA
Yes. Isn't he cool?
There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
PENDEJO BOB
An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
Pendejo Bob.
Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
footfalls of the patients gets closer...
PENDEJO BOB
Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
better climb aboard.
Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
PENDEJO BOB
I use the eye and the music to scare em
off. They're so whacked out, man, it works
great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
off the edge there a few months ago.
He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
passage.
TASLIMA
(she peers over the side)
How far down does it go?
PENDEJO BOB
Don't know - never do hear em land.
Earthquake opened it up.
The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
INSIDE THE TUNNEL
Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
with dust and grime.
Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
everywhere.
The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
PENDEJO BOB
I own this whole place. Used to work here
in the old days. I was right in this room
when the big one hit. What a mess. We were
waist high in shit.
(turns proudly to them)
Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed
at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought
my whole family, my amigos, down here to
live with me.
TASLIMA
Gun runners.
PENDEJO BOB
Hey, it's a living, baby.
PLISSKEN
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
(looks at Taslima)
Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
TASLIMA
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
PENDEJO BOB
Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,
Snake. We got our problems, sure - but
this is paradise, man.
Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
Plissken.
PENDEJO BOB
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
Explosives? I can get you a crate of
hellfire grenades, no problem - five
hours.
PLISSKEN
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
PENDEJO BOB
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.
You have to go topside. Right up there.
He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
carrying crates of weapons.
PENDEJO BOB
Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.
Just follow the signs. Get off at the
Lincoln Exit, turn left.
Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the
ladder, followed by Taslima...
PENDEJO BOB
Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime
at all.
Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs
into the front seat.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost
burned your ass off!
Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is
almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks.
Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,
the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows
down to a cruise of 70.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Too many people know where you're going,
Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his
men were back there waiting for you.
PLISSKEN
Delgado?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough
hombre. You don't understand, Snake.
Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island.
We're on the move, man. Big time.
The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old
junked cars out of the way.
Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear.
PLISSKEN
Stop the damn car.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
No way.
PLISSKEN
I said pull over.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
All right. Anything for you, Snake.
(beat)
Although I was going to take you to Cuervo
Jones' place.
Plissken lowers the gun.
PLISSKEN
Where is it?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Right over there.
He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a
button on the steering wheel with his finger.
ON THE DASHBOARD
A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two-
inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds
rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
PLISSKEN
Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four
holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel
closes up over the barrel.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He
lets me use it sometimes.
(looks at Plissken)
Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot
with a fun-gun. You feel it?
Plissken gulps for air.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker.
Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you
down to one inch from death, that is
living, man.
PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG
Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated
streets of Venice.
Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
You should've talked to me first, Snake. I
could've set this whole thing up. I'm
actually Cuervo's agent, you know.
As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's
voice begins to fade...
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
And I'd love to represent you, too. We
could make a bundle together. I know I
could really help your career...I mean,
you're a legend and all - but the last
couple years, man, it's like you've fallen
off the face of the earth.
ON PLISSKEN'S FACE
As the world crashes to black!
FADE IN:
Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity
of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with
the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The
wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
BEHIND IT
Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former
Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading:
"MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL"
PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the
center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by
Mescalitos.
In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment.
Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered
around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards
from Carefree, Arizona.
Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie
scurries along at his side.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't
I? All I'm asking for is what you
promised.
CUERVO JONES
We'll see.
Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake.
Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
CUERVO JONES
Carrot juice?
(no response)
Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you.
No?
(no response)
Your health.
Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head,
grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air.
CUERVO JONES
You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts
real bad.
(beat)
That's good.
He kneels down next to Plissken.
CUERVO JONES
Dying isn't good enough for you. You need
pain. You'll never make it to where you
want to go without a little pain.
He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
CUERVO JONES
Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
typical of American idealism. The old
west, Snake.
Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's
beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
CUERVO JONES
Man against the sky. The individual.
Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much
in America, Snake. You remind them of what
they used to be.
Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard
filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
CUERVO JONES
Here is the real L.A., Snake.
Plissken lifts his head to see.
CUERVO JONES
The poor. The old. The lost. People
without hope.
He crosses back to Plissken...
CUERVO JONES
Do you know what they want? One word.
Liberation.
(beat)
They want a chance to live - before it's
all gone. They've been hated for too long
-
(smiles)
Now it's their turn.
He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully
unlocking him from the treadmill.
Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed
in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still
carries the prototype with her.
UTOPIA
Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
Actress.
Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds
on to it.
UTOPIA
You said I could hold it.
He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected.
Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.
UTOPIA
Who's that?
CUERVO JONES
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints.
UTOPIA
He doesn't look like his picture.
(frown)
I bet he's fake.
CUERVO JONES
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
UTOPIA
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia.
UTOPIA
Ooww!
CUERVO JONES
Go on now. Do as I say.
Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
CUERVO JONES
I'm going to show her what it means to be
a woman - for the first time in her
pathetic little life.
(smiles)
Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs
love.
He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
CUERVO JONES
You want to hook up with us? Join the
revolution? We're all getting out of here
tomorrow night.
(holds up the prototype)
We're gonna rule the world. Come with us,
Snake.
Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
CUERVO JONES
No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish
it later. So guess what? It's later.
He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away...
The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with
machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken
is hurled in. The door slams shut.
Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
DELGADO
You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
PLISSKEN
Shit.
Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
CLANG!
Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
machetes CLANKS to the floor...
Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,
opens it, steps out...
The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
hallway.
Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
He moves forward...
Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway.
The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
in the crowd, enjoying the game...
Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet-
proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
THE SHOT CLOCK
Ticks down: 5 - 4...
A BLACK MUSLIM
Dribbles the ball towards the basket.
THE SHOT CLOCK
Ticks down: 3 - 2...
A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim.
THE BLACK MUSLIM
Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It
sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the
24-second violation.
The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down.
Plissken watches...
CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court.
Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the
game on his silver portable radio...
THE REFEREE
Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon
dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off.
The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
THE SHOT CLOCK
Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
THE KOREAN DRAGON
Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24
second violation.
A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and
fire!
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on
the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body
and hurry off the court.
Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
(sound of effect of breaking
glass)
Shot clock!
The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A."
begins playing on the loudspeaker.
The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot
like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players,
JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
JAMAAL
Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand,
thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
JAMAAL
Welcome aboard, Snake.
But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the
court.
CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce
man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face.
Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has
a firm grip on the prototype.
CUERVO JONES
The time is now. We are the strongest. If
we go together, the others will come.
(beat)
We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go
together. What do you say?
Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
PLISSKEN
Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps
into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good,
cold eye.
PLISSKEN
Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking
it out in trade. I need a favor...
JAMAAL
Sure, Snake. Anything.
PLISSKEN
I need to get across the court now...
without drawing attention to myself.
JAMAAL
Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore
thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake.
Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's
kick some butt!
The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they
move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
JAMAAL
(whispers)
You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
JAMAAL
Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
man.
The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the
ball. The game is underway.
Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover.
They go into a set play.
The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use
slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full
combat.
The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him
flat. No foul.
Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
UTOPIA
It's that weird guy again.
Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when
suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
JAMAAL
Snake! Shot clock!
THE SHOT CLOCK
Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at
Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn
sounds just as it leaves his hand...
THE BASKET
Swish. Nothing but net.
The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles,
disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen
quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes
toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding
behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs
Map To The Stars Eddie.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The
Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him
by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the
leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the
driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to
swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the
seat and grabs it.
Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
BLAM!
The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly
everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face
with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
KAWHUMP!
The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the
Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X-
Ping flop under the monster wheels.
Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the
opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him
in total shock, but before he can speak...
Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the
back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side
door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab
Plissken...
But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia
under his arm, slides across the seat...
... and sails out of the Cadillac...
CUERVO JONES
No!
Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on
top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.
Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the
Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams
into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a
hot dog stand.
ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her,
and she fights him tooth and nail...
UTOPIA
Lemme go...!
INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb,
slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood...
and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop,
as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the
caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic
collision...
Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole
in the street, pries it up...
Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges
into the street, pointing at Plissken...
CUERVO JONES
Kill him, kill him...!
Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole
opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The
street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot
lead...
Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets
to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through
the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has
to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy
drain away from the main tunnel...
The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move
along, slow as they come to...
THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our
journey with Pendejo Bob.
Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop-
off, his eye burning into her...
Her feet reach the very edge.
Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror.
She gulps air in staccato bursts...
Beat. Beat.
Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one
of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
UTOPIA
My... father sent you... didn't he?
(beat)
He sent you to kill me...
Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
UTOPIA
Didn't he?
(begins to cry)
But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet
Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
PLISSKEN
Shit.
Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares
at her.
PLISSKEN
Get out of here.
Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
PLISSKEN
I said go!
Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away
down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at
the prototype in Plissken's hand...
UTOPIA
Don't take it back. Don't give it to him.
Please. Let me have it.
Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
PLISSKEN
What does this thing do?
UTOPIA
(her eyes grow wide)
No!
KABLAM!
Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh!
He spins, drops the prototype...
... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the
sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
KABLAM!
He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map
To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He
slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to
raise it...
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
So long, Snake.
Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
... down into the drop off...
PLISSKEN'S BODY
Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight
to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness
swallows him up...
Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo
Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
CUERVO JONES
Where is he?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
He jumped. Down there.
(beat)
He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed
Plissken.
Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below.
Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
CUERVO JONES
Give it to me.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
You said I could be Vice-President,
Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
CUERVO JONES
(extends his hand)
Give it.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it
all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your
girl back, I got it all. Just for you,
Cuervo. Just for you.
Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally
Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the
prototype...
... but slips on the wet floor...
... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
PROTOTYPE VOICE
(tiny, filtered)
I am now armed and ready for use. Use
extreme caution. The location of the
effected blast area can only be determined
by the orbital position of the SatStar
Ring.
Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo
Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a
smile...
CUERVO JONES
This is turning out to be my lucky day.
(stares coldly at Map To The
Stars Eddie)
Get this asshole outta here.
Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back
along the tunnel.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Cuervo, wait. Please...
Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the
drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously,
across the face.
Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.
UTOPIA
Cuervo...?
CUERVO JONES
You're my woman, you understand? You don't
let anybody take you away from me without
a fight.
UTOPIA
I tried...
CUERVO JONES
(in her face)
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you
give your life. You fight till you're
dead. Then I forgive you.
(screams)
Understand?
(shakes her)
Understand?
UTOPIA
Yes...
He shoves her down the tunnel...
CUERVO JONES
Let's go.
The others follow them...
Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into
Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert.
MALLOY
A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
Moving over the city to the southeast.
A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy...
COM OFFICER
Commander - massive vehicle and troop
movement on the ground. All major streets
leading to the southeast.
PRESIDENT
What're they doing?
Malloy looks at the President grimly.
MALLOY
Getting ready to invade.
PRESIDENT
(beat)
So where's Plissken?
DARKNESS
Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air...
A huge blue eye opens. Looks around.
DARKNESS
Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh...
DARKNESS
And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long
strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
Plissken's eye blinks.
THE DARKNESS
Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell.
Wind gushing.
And then a light stabs across the void...
CLOSE - PLISSKEN
... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob. He stands on a
small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit.
PENDEJO BOB
Hey, Snake. You okay?
(unhooks the lariat)
I heard gunfire down here...
(begins to swing the rope)
Never been down this far before...
(swings the rope in a huge
arc)
Grab this.
Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat. The noose flies across the pit, and
Plissken grabs it with his good hand.
PENDEJO BOB
Now hang on.
Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob
jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope
jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line
catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with
only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's
weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge
of the pit toward the cave above...
... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below
Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his
hand, and pulls himself in...
Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of
the pit.
PENDEJO BOB
Hey, Snake...where are you?
Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him.
Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak
legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand.
His leg on fire.
PLISSKEN
(yells)
I'm in another opening... Storm drain...
There may be another way up to you...
Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets
louder.
He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another
drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward
the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's
a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
SNAP!
Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks,
disintegrates...
And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled
suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
PENDEJO BOB
Stands silently above, listening...
PENDEJO BOB
Snake...
(no reply)
Snake!
Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake.
Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the
vibrating storm drain...
Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire.
Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map
To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
PLISSKEN
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
Somebody named Hershe.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Sure, Snake. No problem.
(groggy)
You gonna kill me?
PLISSKEN
Later.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot
you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God,
man.
PLISSKEN
Cease fire with the bullshit.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks
down, turn right.
CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera,
holds the prototype in his hands.
CUERVO JONES
Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have
the news media standing by for my
coronation. I'm arriving in style.
PULL BACK from the TV screen to reveal we are in...
Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and
Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens.
BRAZEN
He must be bouncing the signal from one of
our communications satellites.
PRESIDENT
That means CableNet has already picked it
up. This thing's going live all over the
country.
CUERVO JONES
(on the TV)
It's a brand new day comin' up this
morning, and I'm just so proud to be
leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static.
A grim silence.
MALLOY
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr.
President.
(the President nods grimly)
Shall I begin evacuation?
PRESIDENT
Does he know how to activate it?
MALLOY
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
button.
BRAZEN
What about Plissken? He could still be -
PRESIDENT
Forget him. He's dead.
MALLOY
That may not be true, Mr. President.
(beat)
He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead
so many times I can't count. But he never
stays down.
A long beat.
MALLOY
There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
for Plissken, or surrender. It's your
decision.
The President sighs heavily.
The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and
Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship.
They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their
glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable
dirt.
They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There
is light in the room beyond.
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas
jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool.
A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over
everything.
At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy
Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling
face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us.
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely
drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing
as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
SPINAL
(eyes brightening)
Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.
Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the
transvestite.
PLISSKEN
I need a favor.
HERSHE
What's in it for me?
Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face.
PLISSKEN
Wait a minute. I know that voice.
(beat)
You're Carjack Malone.
HERSHE
Not anymore.
SPINAL
You two know each other?
Plissken is seething. Hershe remains calm, glacial.
PLISSKEN
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything
back there in Cleveland.
SPINAL
(astounded)
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
PLISSKEN
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
HERSHE
I was called away on urgent business,
Snake.
PLISSKEN
Don't lie to me.
HERSHE
All right, so I made another deal.
PLISSKEN
I got a new deal for you.
Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right
between Hershe's eyes.
PLISSKEN
You help me, you live.
The others tense, hands on guns.
SPINAL
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
HERSHE
We have a little arrangement. Anything
happens to me, you're dead.
PLISSKEN
I'm already dead.
HERSHE
(long beat)
I see your point. What's the favor?
PLISSKEN
(looks at his watch)
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
Kingdom. I got one hour.
HERSHE
Dream on, blue eye.
PLISSKEN
Say goodnight, Carjack.
Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger...
HERSHE
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
SPINAL
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
armies. No one gets near him.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
And he's got the prototype. And the girl.
He holds all the cards.
HERSHE
Exactly what is this prototype? What does
it do?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
You push the button, it sends a signal to
a ring of space defense satellites.
They're orbiting bombs. Nukes. They
explode. Huge space burst.
(beat)
EMP. Electromagnetic Pulse. It happens
instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP
shuts down every power source below the
satellites - instantly. All electrical
devices, computers, cars, airplanes,
cities. It's the dark ages again.
HERSHE
So whoever has it runs the show.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
They were gonna use it on South America,
Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the
United States.
SPINAL
Only Cuervo's got it now.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
And that ring of satellites will be in
position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this
morning.
PLISSKEN
How do you know all this?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
I used to represent the guy who invented
it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
A long silence.
HERSHE
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
PLISSKEN
We get the girl and the prototype. And we
get out.
SPINAL
All of us?
PLISSKEN
Yeah.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Me too?
PLISSKEN
(stares at him hard)
We'll see.
HERSHE
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
gonna go? What's the payoff?
SPINAL
I'd like to get out but I don't have
enough money.
PLISSKEN
The President's promised to give whoever
helps me 1 million dollars.
SPINAL
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
them.
PLISSKEN
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
This gets everyone's attention.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
Aw, come on, Snake.
PLISSKEN
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear
to God.
HERSHE
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
PLISSKEN
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones
rules the world?
HERSHE
(grim)
No, that sucks.
(beat)
How are we getting out?
PLISSKEN
I don't know yet.
SPINAL
Shit.
HERSHE
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin'
things up as you go along. That's why I
cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a
bum like the rest of us.
Smoke has begun to drift into the pool area.
MOJO DELLASANDRO
(a soft voice)
Use the air.
They look at him.
MOJO DELLASANDRO
They're burning. Santa Anas. The night
wind.
SPINAL
What're you talking about, Mojo?
MOJO DELLASANDRO
Death from above...
Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
CUERVO JONES
They're simple people. They love a party.
(turns to Utopia)
We're gonna throw them one hell of a party
when we get to America. Right?
Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she
jumps, cowering.
CUERVO JONES
Put a smile on your face.
A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides
down the bulkhead and out the door.
Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and
Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The
others are in the back, firing back at the gangs. Plissken pulls
in power.
CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE
The needle's at 100% plus. Full power.
The ship shakes violently.
PLISSKEN
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
HERSHE
(screams from the rear
compartment)
Somebody get off!
SPINAL
(glares at him)
Who?
All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie...
KABLAM!
Bullets rip through the windscreen.
POV - AN ARMY OF GANGS
Is moving, through the smoke, charging the ship!
The ship trembles. Plissken moves his feet, jams in the left tail-
rotor pedal all the way.
A crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving
over a grid of L.A.
COM OFFICER
Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's
passed into restricted space, heading this
way.
Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances.
PRESIDENT
Is it Plissken?
Nobody knows.
COM OFFICER
Commander, I'm getting radio contact with
the aircraft.
MALLOY
Boost it.
The COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice
booming through HQ.
PLISSKEN (V.O.)
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
PRESIDENT
Thank God.
MALLOY
(grabs a radio mike)
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
prototype?
PLISSKEN
(into his radio)
Yeah, I got it.
Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in
his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie.
PLISSKE
(to Map To The Stars Eddie)
Now give me the real one.
Utopia stares into Plissken's eye.
Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't
have it.
Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and
pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken
UTOPIA
Now we're even, Snake.
Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks
him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment,
then he slumps in the seat.
Malloy set up in the staging area for landing.
COM OFFICER
Commander Malloy - he's got lots of
company.
Malloy and the others look at the computer screen. Plissken's
green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all
rapidly closing in on him...
MALLOY
Battle stations...
The room springs into action...
PLISSKEN
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We
may be lighter enough to hover. Just
barely.
HERSHE
Can you land?
PLISSKEN
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to
set it down she'll crash. I have to stay
in a hoverwhile you jump off.
(beat as Plissken looks at
Utopia)
Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give
her your dress.
HERSHE
(ice cold)
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
please get that through your fucking head?
SPINAL
Holy shit.
They look, as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is
filled with gang helicopters!
Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police
guards. The guards step back from Utopia. One of them walks over
to a huge switch on the wall.
Darkness. No power. Everyone looks around. Utopia smiles.
The Third World warriors free Utopia from the electric chair. She
joins them as they swarm through the halls...
