                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT.  THE SCHUYLKILL RIVER, PHILADELPHIA, PA. - MORNING

      Early morning light blazes across the water and heats up the 
      west side of the river.  We hear FOOTFALLS on gravel.  Heavy 
    but controlled BREATHING.  And then ANGELA SWANSON races by. 

    At age 36, she's attractive, fit and driven.  No mere jogger.  
    Six minute miles? No problem.  She sips from a bottle of *
      GATORADE as the gravel path she's running on angles towards 
      Strawberry Mansion Bridge.  

      EXT.  FAIRMONT PARK - MORNING

    On the hill overlooking the river A MAN LOITERS, white, mid 
      30's, wearing a hoodie, watching joggers run along the banks 
    of the river below.  We get the feeling he's on the lookout 
    for someone.  And then Angela appears in the distance.  He 
      starts for Strawberry Mansion Bridge.  

      EXT.  STRAWBERRY MANSION BRIDGE - MORNING

      Shadows gather under the bridge.  Angela kicks it into high 
      gear.  Into darkness she goes.  And suddenly --

      ANGELA'S POV - 

    The CAMERA VEERS WILDLY as we are suddenly sent careening off 
    the path and plunging into the river.  

    IN THE WATER

      BLOOD PLUMES AROUND ANGELA'S HEAD.  Her eyes roll.  She 
      struggles for breath, and chokes on the water pouring into 
    her mouth instead.  She's drowning.  She fights it.  But 
      slowly, inexorably, the river claims her....

      EXT.  STRAWBERRY MANSION BRIDGE - MORNING

    All is still and quiet as Angela's inert body floats out from 
      under the bridge and rides the current towards Center City 
    and the Delaware River beyond.  

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      INT.  UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL - MORNING

      CLOSE UP ON A WOMAN'S FACE.  Her eyes are closed, but not in 
      repose.  A thin red horizontal beam of light passes over her 
      face, accompanied by the mechanical sound of something moving 
      overhead.  The magnetic ring of a CT scanner, to be exact.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/102.


    We PULL BACK to take in a woman in her mid 30's, wearing a 
      hospital gown, lying on her back in the bed of the scanner.  
    She is DR. MEGAN HUNT.  Just old enough to be on her second 
      medical career, brilliant enough to have done both in half 
    the time.  We hear a BEEP.  Her eyes open.  And frown as a 
      cheery, sing-song female voice comes over a loudspeaker.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Okay dokey, Dr. Hunt, one more pass 
                    and we'll have you out of there in 
                    a jiffy.

                                  MEGAN
                          (miserable)
                    Super duper.

      INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE - MORNING

      Megan stands at a mirror reattaching an earring and otherwise 
      checking her appearance for flaws.  Of which there are none.  
    Her beauty, like everything else about her, is intimidating.  
    She wears the latest fashion and wears it well.  Her style, 
      clothes and accessories will always be a cut above everyone 
      else's.

                                  MEGAN
                    A whole hour listening to that ding 
                    dong technician.  Since when does a 
                    CT take that long?  

                                  MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    I told them to scan you twice.

      Megan turns to regard her neurologist, DR. SIMON BRUCE, age 
    43.  He studies two sets of pictures laid out on his desk.  
    He looks up to meet Megan's gaze.  

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    To save you from making me do it 
                    again when we didn't find anything.

      Megan walks over and takes a look for herself.  

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    No damage to the cervical 
                    vertebrae.  Just like last year.  

                                  MEGAN
                    What about another nerve conduction 
                    study?

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    No thanks.  You punched me during 
                    the last one.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/103.


    She gives a little 'Who me?' smile.  He takes her hands and 
      inspects them.

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    No change in symptoms?

                                  MEGAN
                    Occasional numbness.  Same as 
                    usual.

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    Well, your circulation's good, 
                    you're not diabetic or 
                      malnourished.  And every test we've 
                    done has come up negative.  It's 
                    been four years since your car 
                    accident yet there's been no 
                      improvement in your paresthesia.  
                    Even if you could get reinstated 
                    there's not an insurance company in 
                    the world that would cover you 
                    stepping into an OR again.  
                          (beat)
                    Your career as a neurosurgeon is 
                    over, Megan.  Maybe it's time you 
                    accepted that.  

    She gives him a look as she pulls her hands back.

                                  MEGAN
                    You think I'm trying to get back 
                    into the OR?

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    Well aren't you?

    A beat.  Is she?

                                  DR. BRUCE
                    You've got a whole new career -- 
                    most people would count their 
                    blessings.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm not most people.

      From inside Megan's Gucci handbag a cell phone starts to 
      ring.  She digs it out, checks the number, and answers --  

                                  MEGAN
                          (into phone)
                    Megan Hunt, Medical Examiner's 
                    Office.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/104.


      EXT.  THE SCHUYLKILL RIVER - BOAT HOUSE ROW - MORNING

      Philadelphia's iconic Boat House Row sits on the east side of 
    the river.  In the middle of the row is the U of Penn Boat 
      House with its big blue "P" painted on the landing dock.  
      Lying on that "P" is A BODY COVERED BY A SHEET.  

      Among the patrol cops and the Penn rowers being questioned we 
      pick out Medical Investigator PETER MAXWELL, age 36, an 
      employee of the Medical Examiner's Office.  He's tall with 
      rough good looks and still maintains the body of the 
      professional football player he once was.  He looks up from 
    his notes as Megan emerges from the Boat House.  They meet 
      over the body.

                                  PETER
                    Thought you had a doctor's 
                    appointment.

                                  MEGAN
                    Waste of time.  What do we have?*

      Peter consults his notes as Megan pulls the sheet off the 
      body and beholds --

                                  PETER
                    Angela Swanson, 36.  Bumped into 
                    the Penn Heavyweight Eight as they 
                    were pushing off the dock.  She's 
                    got trauma to the back of the head 
                    and traces of foam in her mouth.  
                    CSU is up river searching for where 
                    she went in.  Liver temp 93.2.

                                  MEGAN
                    Water temp?

                                  PETER
                    64.

    She makes a quick calculation in her head.

                                  MEGAN
                    Two hours.

    Two more new arrivals emerge from the Boat House, gold 
      shields clipped to their lapels.  Detectives BUD MORRIS, age 
    42, and SAMANTHA BAKER, age 37.  Morris is the senior of the 
    two and among the details we won't draw attention to until 
      later is a fresh shaving cut on his chin and an impression on 
    his ring finger where a wedding band used to be.  Samantha is 
      eager and bright but used to taking the back seat.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/105.


                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Hey, Pete.  

                                  PETER
                    Bud.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Who do you like on Sunday?

                                  PETER
                    Not the Eagles.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Traitor.  

      They're clearly familiar with Peter.  And not with Megan.

                                  PETER
                    Detective Morris, this is Dr. Megan 
                    Hunt.  I take it you haven't pulled 
                    her on a case before.

      Detectives Morris and Baker both react to the name.  Not in a 
      good way.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    It must be our lucky day.

      Megan just smiles.  *

                                  MEGAN
                    Look at that.  Already we agree on 
                    something.

      Det. Morris blinks like someone whose sarcasm has just 
      boomeranged on him --

                                  MEGAN
                    Our victim has blunt force trauma 
                    to the back of the head and 
                      preliminary indications of 
                    drowning.  No scrapes or abrasions 
                    that indicate she tried to break 
                    her fall.  She went into the river 
                    clean after being hit on the back 
                    of the head.  I'm calling it a 
                    presumed homicide.  Liver temp puts 
                    it about two hours ago.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    That's it?  You mean you haven't 
                    caught the murderer yet?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/106.


      There, Det. Morris thinks, that ought to ruffle her feathers.  
    But Megan just smiles again.*

                                  MEGAN
                    No, Detective, have you?By the *
                    way, you can tell CSU whoever 
                    attacked her did it on the west 
                    side of the river.

    A beat.  This is news even to Peter.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    How do you know that?

                                  MEGAN
                    She got some sun this morning.

      They all look at Angela's face.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So?

      Peter gets it.

                                  PETER
                    So two hours ago the east side of 
                    the river was in shadow.

    As Detectives Morris and Baker chew on this --

                                  MEGAN
                    Autopsy in two hours.  See you 
                    there, Detectives.

      Megan turns and starts back towards the boat house.  She 
      feels their eyes on her.  She stops and looks back at Det. 
      Morris.

                                  MEGAN
                    One more thing.  Don't believe 
                    everything you've heard about me.  
                    The truth is much worse.

      With what might be called a "mischievous smile" she resumes *
    her exit through the Boat House.

      INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE - MORNING

    The Medical Examiner's Office of a major metropolitan city is 
    a world unto itself, with departments and staff to handle the 
      hundreds of autopsies of homicides, suicides and John Does, 
    as well as the more mundane functions like issuing death 
      certificates and the many other matters involved in 
      processing the dead.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/107.


    The directory at the front desk lists Intake & Processing, 
    IT, Records, Storage, Examination Rooms and Laboratory, to 
      name a few, as well as the names and office numbers of the 
      Chief and Deputy MEs and a dozen other MEs and Assistant MEs.   

      This is the directory Megan blows right by as she returns to 
    the office.  Administrative staff hustle and bustle but at 
    the sight of Megan they part like the Red Sea.  Deferential 
      nods and mumbled "hello's" follow her down the hall towards 
    the Bullpen, a long row of ME offices....

      ....from out of which various MEs jump out and follow for a 
    few paces bending Megan's ear.  We get immediately that Megan 
    is their go-to diagnostician.

                                  ASSISTANT ME #1
                    Five year old boy choked to death 
                    during a seizure but had no 
                      hippocampal lesions.

                                  MEGAN
                    Check for Alexander disease.

      Assistant ME #1 peels off and is replaced by --

                                  ASSISTANT ME #2
                    Twenty three year old man, 
                    jaundiced, anemia and liver failure 
                    but no cirrhosis or history of 
                    Hepatitis B or C.

                                  MEGAN
                    What are his copper levels?

    A blank look.  Assistant ME #2 has no idea.  He peels off and 
    is replaced by --

    DR. ELLIOT GROSS, age 33.  He's boyish, geeky in an endearing *
      way, and utterly non-threatening.  Even Megan lightens up 
      around him, not in word so much as tone, like giving your 
      little brother a hard time.  They walk side by side until --*

                                  MEGAN
                    What do you want?

                                  ELLIOT
                    Nothing.

                                  MEGAN
                    Oh.

    A few more steps --          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/108.


                                  ELLIOT
                    But since you're asking, I got a 
                    female, age 32, died in a sauna of 
                    apparent heat stroke, but urine 
                    came back normal for hydration.  

                                  MEGAN
                    What are her electrolytes?

                                  ELLIOT
                    Um, they're these things in the 
                    body that contain free ions --

    Off her look --

                                  ELLIOT
                    Wait.  I know.  You're thinking *
                      hyponatremia?  

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm thinking you should go now.

    He does so.  She watches him go with mild amusement, then *
      walks into her office.*

      INT.  MEGAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

      Megan walks in and closes the door.  She drops her handbag, 
      sits down at her desk and takes a moment to decompress.  Or 
      rather, try to.  She holds her hands out in front of her, 
      inspecting them like they belonged to someone else, like they 
      were once trusted friends who have since betrayed her.  

    We take in the office.  Multiple degrees and certifications.  
      Photographs of Megan with various dignitaries.  These take a 
      back seat, however, to photographs of her daughter LACEY, age 
    12, as well as a photograph of Megan as a girl POSING WITH 
    HER FATHER IN FRONT OF A TOOL SHED IN THEIR BACKYARD.  

      When we return to Megan she is consulting Lacey's class 
      schedule.  It's pinned up on the wall with all the free 
      periods highlighted.  Megan checks her watch, picks up the 
      phone and dials.

      INT.  OFFICE OF MIKE FLEMING - MORNING

      MIKE FLEMING, age 42, stands at the window of his law office 
      dictating into a recorder when the pink, sequined cell phone 
    in his briefcase starts buzzing.  He grabs it, reads the 
      number and picks up the call.  We INTERCUT --

                                  MIKE
                    I thought I told you not to call 
                    Lacey at school.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/109.


                                  MEGAN
                    What are YOU doing at Lacey's 
                    school?

                                  MIKE
                    I'm not at her school, I'm at the 
                    office.  I had to confiscate her 
                    cell phone.

                                  MEGAN
                    Why?  

                                  MIKE
                    She's not supposed to be on the 
                    phone at school, that's why.

                                  MEGAN
                    Like I have any other option?  You*
                    screen my calls to the house.*

                                  MIKE
                    She's not a crutch for you to lean 
                    on whenever you want to feel 
                    better.

                                  MEGAN
                    That's not why I call and you know 
                    it.  

                                  MIKE
                    Megan, I have work to do.

                                  MEGAN
                    I want to come to Lacey's birthday 
                    party.

                                  MIKE
                    We've been over this.  You're not 
                    invited.

                                  MEGAN
                    Mike, please let me talk to her.

                                  MIKE
                    You know how many times she tried *
                    to call you and you palmed her off *
                    on some assistant?*

                                  MEGAN
                    I haven't had an assistant in four *
                    years.*          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1010.


                                  MIKE
                    And maybe she still hasn't gotten *
                    over it.  I'm sorry, Megan, but I *
                    have to go now.*

    He hangs up the phone.  On his face we glimpse an old wound 
      opened once again.  Briefly.  He picks up his recorder and 
      resumes his dictation.

      INT.  MEGAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

      Megan stares at her phone.  The wound is deeper on her face.  
    And it lingers.  She hangsup the phone and stares at a *
      picture of her daughter.

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #1 - LATER THAT MORNING*

      Angela Swanson's body lies on the examination table.  
      Detectives Morris and Baker stand off to one side, observing.  
      Megan and Peter are in scrubs and smocks, wearing latex 
      gloves.  A microphone hangs overhead recording everything.  

                                  MEGAN
                    This is Dr. Megan Hunt, Medical 
                    Examiner, assisted by Peter 
                    Maxwell, Medical Investigator, 
                    Philadelphia Medical Examiner's 
                    Office, performing an autopsy on 
                    Angela Swanson, age 36, Open 
                    Homicide Case File Number -- Peter, 
                    you'll fill in the number along 
                    with the date and time.  Observing 
                    are Detectives Morris and Baker.  
                    Say hello, Detectives.

      Detectives Morris and Baker mumble "hello's" as Megan begins 
    her visual inspection of Angela's body.

                                  MEGAN
                    You find her entry point into the 
                    river?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Strawberry Mansion Bridge.

    She waits for it --

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    West side.

    -- and smiles in inverse proportion to Det. Morris' frown.

                                  MEGAN
                    So what do we know about this girl?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1011.


                                  DET. BAKER
                    She's local.  Grew up in Fishtown.  
                    Central High, scholarship to Brown, 
                    senior associate at Whitney, Howell 
                    & Walker.  Apartment in Mount Airy, 
                    single no boyfriend.  Colleagues 
                    say she was a workaholic who pretty 
                    much lived at the office.  

      Det. Morris shoots a look at his partner.  Det. Baker shoots *
    a 'What's the big deal?' look back.*

                                  MEGAN
                    She's obviously in excellent 
                    physical condition.  Callouses on 
                    her feet, a few minor scars here 
                    and there, healed puncture marks on 
                    the left forearm both anterior and 
                    posterior, made by an animal's 
                    incisors, probably canine.  
                      Fingernails are trimmed short, 
                    chewed in places --

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Any DNA under them?

                                  MEGAN
                    All in good time, Detective.
                          (continuing to the head 
                          and mouth)
                    Looks like she ground her teeth.  
                    Another stress indicator.  Was she 
                    up for partner?

    The Detectives exchange another look.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    That's right.

      Like everything else, Megan files this away --

                                  MEGAN
                    Scarring on the skull above the 
                    hairline.  Peter, check for any 
                    prior head injuries in her medical 
                    files.  
                            (continuing)
                    Now this is interesting.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    What?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1012.


                                  MEGAN
                    A small growth at the base of her 
                    neck.  Some kind of nodule or 
                    neoplasm.  Peter, make sure you get 
                    a sample to the lab --

    An impatient sigh escapes Det. Morris' mouth.

                                  MEGAN
                    Yes, Detective Morris?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    She got her head bashed in.  Can we 
                    get to the murder weapon already?

      Megan pauses from her examination to look at him.

                                  MEGAN
                    There are over 100 trillion cells 
                    in the human body, 60,000 miles of 
                    arteries, veins and capillaries, 
                    208 bones, 40 plus organs and 
                    dozens of life sustaining systems 
                    from cardiovascular to respiratory 
                    and at any given moment anything 
                    can go wrong with any one of them.  
                    When the range of possibilities is 
                    infinite I abide by one rule and 
                    one rule only: the body is the 
                    evidence.  It will tell us 
                    everything we need to know, if we 
                    have the patience to look.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You could have told us that before 
                    you called us in here.

                                  MEGAN
                    If it's going to be good for you it 
                    has to be good for me too, okay 
                    Detective?

      Det. Morris' jaw drops.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You're something else.

                                  MEGAN
                    I know.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    I'm gonna get some coffee.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1013.


      Det. Morris heads for the door.  Megan turns Angela's head *
      around to inspect the wound.  As she speaks, Det. Morris *
      slows to a stop.*

                                  MEGAN
                    The skull has collapsed into the 
                    occipital lobe in a V-shaped 
                      depression.  Extensive tissue and 
                    hair loss and flecks of rust 
                      throughout.  The murder weapon was 
                    something heavy, maybe cast iron, 
                    and square with a dull edge, 
                    possibly a large plumber's wrench 
                    or some kind of mallet.  And 
                    Detective?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Yeah?

                                  MEGAN
                    I take mine with cream, no sugar.

    A beat.  Det. Morris shakes his head and pushes his way out 
    the door.  All of which Det. Baker has secretly enjoyed.No *
      one, we get the feeling, talks to her partner this way, *
      including her.  *

                                  DET. BAKER
                    I heard you were some big 
                    neurosurgeon a few years back.

      Megan heads to a work table and a tray of instruments.  She 
      picks up a scalpel.  For just a moment, she stares at it.  It 
      used to feel like an extension of her hand.  But no more.

                                  MEGAN
                    That's right.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    So why are you working here?

      Megan turns back to the examination table.  She positions the 
      scalpel at Angela's right shoulder, angled towards the base 
    of the sternum --

                                  MEGAN
                    You can't kill someone when they're 
                    already dead.

    -- and begins to cut.


                                  END OF ACT ONE          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1014.


                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

      INT.  MEGAN'S OFFICE - MORNING

      Megan leans against her desk staring at her computer screen 
    as she talks on the phone --

                                  MEGAN
                          (into phone)
                    This is Dr. Hunt.  Calling about 
                    the Crystal Ball.  Is it in yet?
                          (pause)
                    Great.  I'll be by later.

    She hangs up.  And finds Peter staring at her from the 
      doorway.  

                                  PETER
                    I always knew you were a witch.

      Unlike Elliot, Peter is a man's man.  On whom Megan must have 
    the upper hand, lest he have it on her.

                                  MEGAN
                    Then you should watch yourself, 
                    shouldn't you.

    He shrugs this off with a smile as he enters.  He peers at 
    her computer screen.

                                  MEGAN
                    It's a handbag.

                                  PETER
                    Does it come with a broom?

                                  MEGAN
                    Are you here just to annoy me?

                                  PETER
                    I put Angela's stomach contents in 
                    storage.  That liquid we found was 
                    Gatorade.  And the tissue sample 
                    from her neck is at the lab.

                                  MEGAN
                    So is her diaphragm, right?

                                  PETER
                    Yeah, that too.
                          (beat)
                    About that....          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1015.


                                  MEGAN
                    Yes?

                                  PETER
                    Why does a woman wear a diaphragm 
                    on her morning run?

                                  MEGAN
                    Either she had or was planning on 
                    having sex this morning, or...?

    She waits.  He has no idea.  

                                  MEGAN
                    The diaphragm was stained with old 
                    blood.  Some women use them as a 
                    menstrual barrier before getting 
                    their period.  

                                  PETER
                    I didn't know that.

                                  MEGAN
                    Clearly.  You find out about that 
                    scar above her hairline?

                                  PETER
                    I've got calls in to her primary 
                    physician and two specialists we 
                    know about, but it'll take time.

                                  MEGAN
                    Then let's find out for ourselves.

      Megan heads for the door.  Peter knows what this means.

                                  PETER
                    Brain dissection.  Cool.

      INT.  ME'S OFFICE - MORNING

    As Megan and Peter head down the hallway Megan is intercepted 
    by Deputy Chief Medical Examiner DR. SEMO SOLOMONA, age 41.  
      Semo is a Samoan man whose girth brings new meaning to 
      'throwing his weight around the office.'  

                                  SEMO
                    Dr. Hunt.

                                  MEGAN
                    Semo.

                                  SEMO
                    I'm a doctor too, you know.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1016.


                                  MEGAN
                    And yet no one calls you that.  
                    Strange.

    He bristles.

                                  SEMO
                    You ordered an ANA panel on a 
                    suicide?

                                  MEGAN
                    So?

                                  SEMO
                    So he blew his brains out.  What 
                    are you doing ordering a thousand 
                    dollar autoimmune test?  

                                  MEGAN
                    Do you know why he committed 
                    suicide?

                                  SEMO
                    No.

                                  MEGAN
                    Neither do I.  But now we both know 
                    it had nothing to do with his 
                    immune system.

                                  SEMO
                    Cause of death.  That's our job.  
                    The what, when and how, not the 
                    why.

                                  MEGAN
                    Semo, have you ever heard of "going 
                    the extra mile"?

    She throws a look at his waistline.  Apparently not.  Semo 
      bristles some more.

                                  SEMO
                    I'm the Deputy Chief Medical 
                    Examiner.  The entire budget of 
                    this office is on my shoulders.  
                    You keep pulling this crap I don't 
                    care how many friends you have.

                                  MEGAN
                    What makes you think I have 
                    friends?

      Peter pipes up.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1017.


                                  PETER
                    It's true.  She doesn't have any.

      Semo turns.  He glares at Peter, then marches back down the 
      hallway.  Peter smiles at Megan.  She gives him a look.

                                  PETER
                    What?  You do have friends?

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #2 - MORNING

      Elliot walks into Examination Room #2 with a LAB TECH 
      trailing behind him.  He flips through a lab file,searching*
    for a particular result --

                                  ELLIOT
                    Tox screen negative for drugs and 
                    alcohol.  And -- here we are -- her 
                    electrolytes are... 
                          (deflated)
                    ...within the normal range.  So 
                    much for hyponatremia.

    He walks to the examination table where A WOMAN'S BODY lies 
      covered by a sheet.  He pulls it down to reveal the face.  A 
      woman around Elliot's age.  They both stare at her.

                                  ELLIOT
                          (beat)
                    You know, I never stop expecting 
                    their eyes to pop open right about 
                    now.

    A beat.  They both wait for it.  

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #1 - MORNING

      Peter carries a cross-section of brain to a work table where 
    it joins a series of others laid out in a row.  Megan walks 
    the length of the table studying them with a magnifying 
      glass.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Mild depression and hemosiderin 
                    staining in the frontal lobe... 
                          (moving to the next cross-
                            section)
                    ...and the classic coup-contrecoup *
                    pattern of prior brain trauma...
                          (moving to the next cross-
                            section)
                    ...causing a unilateral lesion of 
                    the amygdala.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1018.


                                  PETER
                    What does all that mean?

                                  MEGAN
                    It means our girl's been hit on the 
                    head before.  And I have friends, 
                    thank you very much.  

                                  PETER
                    Yeah, like who?

    She ignores the question --

                                  MEGAN
                    The amygdala regulates emotional *
                    learning and fear conditioning and *
                    plays a significant role in sexual *
                    arousal.  A lesion like this would *
                    throw normal activity on its head.  *
                    I've seen at least one study *
                    showinga lesioned amygdala can *
                    result in loss of fear or 
                      hyperemotionality or even 
                      hypersexuality....  

    Her voice trails off as she processes what this might mean. *
      Peter meanwhile still thinks they're having a conversation.*

                                  PETER
                    Seriously, name one friend.

                                  MEGAN
                    Call the lab.  Tell them to rush 
                    those diaphragm results.  

    He looks at her.  She looks at him.  So much for *
      conversation.  He heads for the wall-mounted phone but before *
    he gets there it starts ringing.  *

                                  PETER
                          (answering)
                    Room 1, this is Maxwell...?

      INT.  CAR - MORNING

      Megan flips through various pages of a file stamped "Thomas 
      Jefferson Hospital" as Peter drives.

                                  MEGAN
                    She was admitted two years ago with 
                    severe head trauma and spent twelve 
                    days in a coma.  Thrown down a 
                    flight of stairs by her boyfriend.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1019.


                                  PETER
                    The guy's name is Tom Burris.  Det. 
                    Morris pulled his jacket.  He was 
                    paroled three weeks ago and lives 
                    in a halfway house in Overbrook.  
                    Morris says we can only come if we 
                    keep quiet.

                                  MEGAN
                    Like that's going to happen.

      INT.  HALFWAY HOUSE - MORNING

    TOM BURRIS sits on a cot facing Detectives Morris and Baker 
    as Megan and Peter hang back by the door.  Burris is white, 
    mid 30's, and we should recognize him.  He's the man in our 
      opening scene loitering by the river, wearing a hoodie.  

                                  BURRIS
                    I was picking up trash around City 
                    Hall this morning.  It's part of my 
                    work release.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    City Hall's a two minute cab ride 
                    from the Park.

                                  BURRIS
                    I've known Angela since high 
                    school, okay?  I didn't kill her, I 
                    loved her.  I would never hurt her.

                                  DET. BAKER*
                    What do you call throwing her down 
                    a flight of stairs?

                                  BURRIS
                    I didn't do that either.  We got 
                    into a fight.  The neighbors heard 
                    us yelling at each other but they 
                    didn't see her fall all by herself.  
                    I got screwed, man.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Then why didn't Angela back up your 
                    story?

                                  MEGAN
                    She couldn't.  Post coma memory 
                    loss.

                                  BURRIS
                    Yeah, that's right.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1020.


      Det. Morris stares at Megan.  She smiles helpfully.

                                  MEGAN
                    It's consistent with the autopsy.

      Then, to Burris --

                                  MEGAN
                    I don't suppose you two had sex 
                    this morning, did you?

      EXT.  HALFWAY HOUSE - MORNING

      Detectives Morris and Baker, Megan and Peter.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Here's how this is supposed to 
                    work.  We ask the questions, you 
                    tell us what you know, and WE catch 
                    the bad guy, okay?

                                  MEGAN
                    So this morning you weren't 
                    serious, you were just mocking me.

      Det. Morris takes another verbal jab to the chin.Once again *
    we catch Det. Baker admiring Megan's pluck.*

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Even if Angela fell down the stairs 
                      accidentally, that's all the more 
                    reason for Burris to hold a grudge 
                    against Angela when he got out of 
                    prison.

                                  MEGAN
                    Okay.  Let's say he did hold a 
                    grudge.  Angela was hit on the back 
                    of the head as she ran under the 
                    bridge.  If Burris killed her, 
                    don't you think he'd want her to 
                    see him, to know it was him paying 
                    her back for sending him to prison?  
                    But there were no defensive wounds 
                    on Angela.  She didn't put up a 
                    fight because she never saw it 
                    coming.  Burris didn't do it.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So what's your theory?  She calls 
                    him up for some ex-con sex?  Under 
                    a bridge on her morning run?  
                    Here's a real theory.  He bashed 
                    her over the head and killed her.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1021.


      Det. Morris turns his unhappy gaze to Peter.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Next time you want to come along, 
                    forget it.

      Detectives Morris headsfor the car.  Det. Baker trails *
      after.  Peter looks at Megan.  She is serenely unfazed.*

                                  MEGAN
                    We need to know more about Angela.

      EXT.  SWANSON HOUSE - DAY

      Fishtown.  The docklands at the eastern edge of the city.  
      Narrow row houses inhabited by white working class poor.  In 
      front of one row house a WHITE SEDAN with the Philadelphia ME 
      Office logo pulls up.  Peter and Megan emerge.  

      INT.  SWANSON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan stands at the mantle looking at photographs several 
      rows deep.  Everything from Angela's baby pictures to her law 
      school graduation.  Many of Angela on cross country teams.  
      Many of her posing with a black Labrador Retriever.

                                  MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    We've already spoken to the police.

      Megan turns.  Behind her stand MR. AND MRS. SWANSON, early 
      60's.  They're clearly in the midst of the worst day of their 
      lives.  Peter hangs by the door.  

                                  MEGAN
                    I know, and I know this is 
                    difficult for you but it helps me 
                    fill in the picture of your 
                    daughter.  So if it's okay, when 
                    did you last talk to her?

                                  MRS. SWANSON
                    About a week ago.  She'd just 
                    finished a trial.

                                  MEGAN
                    What did you talk about?

                                  MRS. SWANSON
                    Just a hello.  She was going to 
                    bed.  She had a sore throat.

      That's news to Megan.  She cocks an eyebrow at Peter.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1022.


                                  PETER
                    It was strep.  

                                  MEGAN
                    And you were planning on telling me 
                    when?

                                  PETER
                          (oops)
                    Now?

                                  MEGAN
                    What was she taking for it?

    A blank look.  He whips out his cell phone and steps out the 
      front door.  Megan returns to the photographs.

                                  MEGAN
                    Did Angela's dog ever bite her?

                                  MR. SWANSON
                    You mean the scars on her arm?  No.  
                    Buddy was killed by a pit bull.  
                    Angela tried to stop it.  

      Another piece of information filed away.

                                  MEGAN
                    I see a lot of pictures of Angela 
                    alone.  Did she have any friends?

                                  MR. SWANSON
                    Not many.  Angela was all about her 
                    grades in school, all about her 
                    career thereafter.

      Megan can relate.  The door opens again.  Peter returns with 
    the answer --

                                  PETER
                    She was taking Erythromycin.

      This too Megan files away.  She takes a final look at 
      Angela's photographs.  

                                  MEGAN
                    How did Tom Burris fit in?

                                  MR. SWANSON*
                    He didn't.  Angela didn't have time 
                    for a real relationship.  Tom's 
                    only virtue was she was in no 
                    danger of falling in love with him.    
                    We always knew he was no good.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1023.


                                  MEGAN
                    And there was no one else?  No one 
                    she was seeing recently?

                                  MR. SWANSON
                    No.  No one.

                                  MEGAN
                    One last question.  After the coma, 
                    did you notice any change in 
                    Angela's behavior?

    At this, Mrs. Swanson stifles a sob.  She exits the room, 
      leaving her husband to explain --

                                  MR. SWANSON
                    Understand we've always loved our 
                    daughter, but in her teens Angela 
                    became a hard, driven girl.  All 
                    she wanted was to get out of 
                    Fishtown, and when she did there 
                    were times we wouldn't hear from 
                    her for months.  After the coma, it 
                    was like she came back to us.  Our 
                    little girl.  She'd drop in once a 
                    week.  She'd call just to say 
                    hello.

    Mr. Swanson stifles a sob of his own.*

      EXT.  SWANSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER

      Peter leads Megan back to the car, shaking his head.

                                  PETER
                    I've heard of someone getting some 
                    sense knocked into them, but 
                    feelings?  That's a new one.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'd throw my ex down the stairs if 
                    I thought it'd get the same result.

      Peter gives her a look, but Megan is already on to her next 
      thought.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Let's swing by midtown on our way 
                    back.

                                  PETER
                    But midtown's in the opposite 
                    direction.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1024.


                                  MEGAN
                          (a look)
                    It was a figure of speech.

      INT.  HANDBAG SHOP - DAY

    A high end boutique.  Peter follows Megan inside.  The female 
      OWNER disappears into the back and returns with a box which 
    she sets before Megan on the counter.  

                                  OWNER
                    I haven't let anyone else see it, 
                    much less touch it.

    Off comes the top.  Megan beholds a handbag about the size 
    and shape of a flattened softball, covered in blue sequins.  

                                  OWNER
                    The Devi Kroell Crystal Disco Ball 
                    Handbag.  Isn't it stunning?

                                  PETER
                    It looks like a kindergarten 
                    project gone wrong.

      Megan and the Owner exchange a 'What a Neanderthal' look.  

                                  MEGAN
                    My daughter turns twelve tomorrow 
                    and I want to get her something 
                    nice, okay?

      Peter meanwhile moves on to the price tag.

                                  PETER
                    Yeah?  For eleven hundred dollars?

      Megan stares at him.  Then at the price tag.  Apparently this 
    is a problem.

                                  OWNER
                    You wanted the limited edition, 
                    didn't you?

                                  MEGAN
                    Yes, but... I don't want her to 
                    think I'm buying her affection.

                                  PETER
                    You don't want her to think you're 
                    insane.  Which is what anybody is 
                    who pays that much for a handbag.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1025.


                                  OWNER
                    You don't know much about handbags, 
                    do you.

      Peter takes Megan by the arm and steers her out of earshot of 
    the Owner.

                                  PETER
                    Getting your daughter that bag is a 
                    bad idea.

                                  MEGAN
                    And what could you possibly know 
                    about my daughter?

      That stops him cold.

                                  PETER
                    You know something?  You're 
                    absolutely right.  How could I know 
                    anything about your daughter?

    He heads for the door.  She watches him go.

      INT.  CAR - DAY

    All is quiet as they head back to the office.  Megan glances 
      over at Peter.  He stares straight ahead.  Finally --

                                  MEGAN
                    Lacey lives with her dad.  We 
                    divorced five years ago.  He got *
                    sole custody.*

      Peter glances over at her.*

                                  MEGAN*
                    He got it becausea woman who works *
                    18 hours a day is an absentee *
                    mother but a man who works the same *
                    hours is a provider.  Do you have *
                    any idea what it takes to be a 
                    practicing neurosurgeon at 28 and *
                    run your own department at 33?  *

                                  PETER
                    I spent my entire 20's in a weight *
                    room.*

    She stares at him.*

                                  MEGAN
                    Did you really just compare *
                    neurosurgery to football?*          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1026.


                                  PETER*
                    Um....*

                                  MEGAN*
                    I saved lives. And I was damn good *
                    at it.  And yes I missed play dates *
                    and phone calls and for that I'm *
                    sorry.  But I was under the bizarre *
                    impression my husband had my back.  *
                    Instead he was building a case *
                    against me.  I can still hear the *
                    judge.  "I find it in the best *
                    interests of the child...."  *

      Megan takes a moment to stare down at her hands.*

                                  MEGAN*
                    I lost my daughter to my career.  *
                    And then I lost my career.  All *
                    because of that god damn car *
                    accident.  My hands still go numb.  *

      Silence.*

                                  PETER*
                    I still don't get the handbag.*

                                  MEGAN*
                    What else am I supposed to do?  *
                    Hire a sky writer?  "Lacey, I'm *
                    sorry?"  I pay for summer camp and *
                    dance classes and everything else, *
                    but no matter what I do Mike tells *
                    her I'm just trying to make myself 
                    feel better.

                                  PETER
                    Which... you're not...?

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm trying to have a relationship *
                    with my daughter, okay?For all *
                    the good it's done.*

                                  PETER
                    Maybe you should just try having *
                    some fun with her.*

    She looks at him, then stares out the window.

                                  MEGAN
                    Forget we had this conversation.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1027.


      INT.  ME'S OFFICE - DAY

      Megan and Peter come through the entrance and sail past the 
      front desk.  The RECEPTIONIST does his best to flag Megan 
      down --

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Dr. Hunt, the Chief wants to see 
                    you.

      They disappear down the hallway.  The Receptionist stares 
      after her.  Did she hear him?  Does she give a damn?  

                                  PETER
                    That would be the Chief as in our 
                    boss.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm still not talking to you.

                                  PETER
                    Or the Chief, apparently.  A career 
                    strategy that always works for me.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'll handle the Chief.  You light a 
                    fire under somebody's ass.  I want 
                    those diaphragm results.

    He peels off and heads for the lab.  Megan turns down the 
      hall and practically bumps into Elliot.  They walk side by *
      side until --*

                                  MEGAN*
                    What do you want now?*

                                  ELLIOT*
                    Nothing.*

                                  MEGAN*
                    Elliot, I'm really not in the mood.*

                                  ELLIOT
                    You know that female heat stroke *
                    victim I mentioned?  Her 
                    electrolytes were normal.  Negative 
                    tox for drugs and alcohol too.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Any psychological problems?  
                      Depression, paranoia?

                                  ELLIOT
                    Um..., why?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1028.


    Off her look --*

                                  ELLIOT*
                    I'll find out.  But what do I do if *
                    there were?

                                  MEGAN
                    Order an ANA panel.

      Megan heads for the Examination Rooms.  Elliot stares after 
      her.

                                  ELLIOT
                    Isn't that the test that got you in 
                    trouble with Semo?

    She throws a look back with that same mischievous smile.*

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #1 - DAY TO NIGHT 

      Megan walks her magnifying glass over to Angela's body and *
      begins aCLOSEUPinspection.  AT SKIN LEVEL.  WE WATCH *
      VARIOUS CROSS FADES OVER TIME as Megan covers the entire body 
    and comes, at last, to a discovery.  At the side of Angela's 
      head, on her scalp hidden by hair and the edges of Angela's 
      head wound, a faint BRUISE IN THE SHAPE OF A FINGER.  

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT

      Megan has by now mapped the bruises on Angela's scalp onto a 
      piece of paper.  They are unmistakably the fingerprints of a *
      man's hand.  Megan now stands behind Angela combing out *
      strands of hair against a piece of white cardboard.  What she 
      sees among the other hairs are a few that appear clipped 
      short, standing out against the rest.  

      Megan cuts one off and walks it to the Examination Room's 
      microscope.  That's when she notices Peter standing inside *
    the door.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Do you want something or are you 
                    just skulking?

                                  PETER
                    I didn't know if you were talking 
                    to me again.

      Peter enters.  He notes the fingerprints mapped out on *
      Megan's piece of paper.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1029.


                                  MEGAN
                    Vascular density of the scalp is 
                    greater than any other part of the 
                    body by several orders of 
                    magnitude.  Add to that compression 
                    against the skull is almost 
                      instantaneous and all it takes is a 
                    passionate embrace to leave those.  
                    Finger marks that were obscured by 
                    her head wound.  

                                  PETER
                    Made by who?

                                  MEGAN
                    Someone Angela couldn't tell her 
                    parents about.

      Megan peers into her microscopeat the magnified tip of a *
      hair shaft.*

                                  MEGAN
                    I found damaged hair shafts in the 
                    same location.  If they were torn 
                    as a result of her head wound the 
                    edges would be rough and fractured.  
                    These are uniform and intact.  But 
                    they're also compressed.  So either 
                    this strand of hair was cut with a 
                    dull pair of scissors or it got 
                    caught in something and clipped.  A 
                    watchband, or bracelet, or maybe 
                    one of those interlocking wedding 
                    rings.  Have a look.

                                  PETER
                    Don't need to.

    She looks at him.  And she sees the folder in his hand --

                                  MEGAN
                    You got the diaphragm results?

                                  PETER
                    They found trace amounts of semen.  
                    DNA tests will take a while but one 
                    thing's for sure.  There were no 
                    spermatozoa.  The guy had a 
                    vasectomy.

    She grabs the results and studies them for herself.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1030.


                                  MEGAN
                    Do you know any bachelors who'd get 
                    their tubes snipped instead of 
                    using a condom?

                                  PETER
                    Not one.

      Megan looks back at Angela's body, now more sure than ever.

                                  MEGAN
                    She was sleeping with a married 
                    man.

      FADE IN:

      INT.  FOUR SEASONS HOTEL RESTAURANT - MORNING(DAY 2)*

      Megan sits across from DR. HOWARD KARASUNIS, age 52.  They 
      converse over coffee.  

                                  MEGAN
                    The police say she pretty much 
                    lived at the office.  If she was 
                    having an affair, then someone at 
                    Whitney, Howell & Walker would be a 
                    natural candidate.

                                  DR. KARASUNIS
                    So why ask me?

                                  MEGAN
                    He had a vasectomy.  And you're the 
                    number one ball cutter in all of 
                      Philadelphia.

                                  DR. KARASUNIS
                    I thought you held that title.

      They exchange thesmileof old colleagues.*

                                  DR. KARASUNIS
                    We go way back, Megan.  But now *
                    you're asking me to betray doctor-*
                    patient privilege, and you know I *
                    won't dothat.   *

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm not asking for me, I'm asking *
                    for a woman who was murdered. *

    He ponders this.  And his old colleague.*

                                  DR. KARASUNIS*
                    Tell me something.  This new you -- *
                    Megan Hunt, M.E. -- who raced *
                    through forensic pathology faster *
                    than she did a neurosurgery *
                    residency, and who seems to care *
                    more about dead people than she *
                    ever did about her patients -- is *
                    she for real, or just working off 
                    her guilt after killing a patient 
                    on the operating table?

      Megan stares at him for a beat.*          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1032.


                                  MEGAN
                    Both.

    He ponders this.  Then fishes out his Blackberry and enters a 
    few keystrokes.  

                                  DR. KARASUNIS
                    Have you seen the new Blackberry?  
                    I find it indispensable.

    He sets it on the table and rises to his feet.

                                  DR. KARASUNIS
                    If you'll excuse me, I need to use 
                    the rest room.

    He leaves the dining room.  As soon as he's gone Megan picks 
    up the Blackberry and looks at the screen.

      INSERT - BLACKBERRY SCREEN

    The work and home addresses for Raymond Whitney, Managing 
      Partner, Whitney, Howell & Walker.

      INT.  MEGAN'S OFFICE - MORNING(DAY 2)*

      Detectives Morris and Baker turn as Megan walks in.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You never heard of the phone?

                                  MEGAN
                    I missed your piquant blend of 
                    irritation and after shave.

      Det. Baker hides a smile.  But Det. Morris isn't flustered.*

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Burris was picking up garbage 
                      yesterdaymorning -- until he went *
                    AWOL for half an hour.  And you 
                    know what they use on the job?  A 
                    stick with a squared-off handle 
                    reinforced with cast iron L-
                    brackets.

                                  MEGAN
                    Attached with bolts?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    That's right.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1033.


                                  MEGAN
                    No bolt impressions on the head 
                    wound.  But I am curious.  When you 
                    spoke to Angela's colleagues, was 
                    one of them Raymond Whitney?

      Det. Morris is still adjusting to Megan's shut down of his L-
      bracket theory --

                                  DET. BAKER
                    The head of the firm?  No, why?

                                  MEGAN
                    Because Angela was having an affair 
                    with him.

      Det. Baker looksat Det. Morris.  Off their mutual surprise --*

      INT.  LAW FIRM - MORNING(DAY 2)*

      RAYMOND WHITNEY, age 54, the silver haired Managing Partner 
    of Whitney, Howell & Walker, greets his three visitors -- 
      Detectives Morris and Baker, and Megan.  

                                  WHITNEY
                    Raymond Whitney.  Please come in.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Detective Morris, my partner Det. 
                    Baker, and this is Dr. Hunt from 
                    the Medical Examiner's Office.

    As Whitney shakes their hands, Megan casually notes his TWO 
      RING INTERLOCKING WEDDING BAND.  From this she abruptly turns 
      away and starts inspecting Whitney's office as if she hasno *
      interest in the conversation that unfolds in the background.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Can you tell us where you were 
                    around 7 a.m. yesterday morning?

                                  WHITNEY
                    Why?

      Like Megan's own office there are the requisite plaques, 
      awards, certificates, etc. on the walls -- 

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Just accounting for everybody's 
                    whereabouts.

      There are also photos.  Whitney posing with his smiling wife.  
      Whitney's two pre-adolescent sons on various sports teams, 
      etc. --            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1034.


                                  WHITNEY
                    I was at home.  Working out in our 
                    gym. 

    And finally Megan studies a wall of photos taken at various 
      charity events.  The Philadelphia AIDS walk.  An inner city 
      vaccination drive sponsored by the boys' middle school.  We 
    see WHITNEY'S WIFE JILL in a school nurse's uniform 
      administering vaccinations to the city's great unwashed.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Can anyone back that up?

                                  WHITNEY
                    No.  My wife Jill takes our sons in 
                    early to school.  She's the school 
                    nurse.  

      Megan has finally satisfied her curiosity.  She turns back to 
    the conversation in progress --

                                  WHITNEY
                    Detective, I don't mean to tell you 
                    your business but it's preposterous 
                    that you would think --

                                  MEGAN
                    You're head of the Partnership 
                    Committee, aren't you?

      Det. Morris shoots Megan a look.  What is she doing?

                                  WHITNEY
                    Yes?

                                  MEGAN
                    Angela was a seventh year 
                    associate.  That's the cut off 
                    year.  If you don't make partner 
                    you never will.

                                  WHITNEY
                    So?

                                  MEGAN
                    So how long were you sleeping with 
                    her?

      Whitney, startled --  

                                  WHITNEY
                    What?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1035.


                                  MEGAN
                    She had sex yesterday morning with 
                    a man who had a vasectomy.  Despite 
                    the lack of spermatozoa we can 
                    still match for DNA.  Care to give 
                    me a swab?

    She holds up a Q-tip in a plastic tube.  Whitney recoils.

                                  MEGAN
                    Didn't think so.  That's okay, 
                    there's plenty of time for that 
                    later.  And it'll only tell me what 
                    I already know anyway.  She was 
                    sleeping with you to make partner --

                                  WHITNEY
                    No --

                                  MEGAN
                    -- or you were sexually harassing 
                    her.  Whichever it was, --

                                  WHITNEY
                    That's not true!

                                  MEGAN
                    -- she was in a position to end 
                    your marriage and sue your firm if 
                    she didn't get what she wanted.  
                    But you couldn't make her partner 
                    without violating your own ethics 
                    rules which would have really had 
                    you over a barrel, --

                                  WHITNEY
                    I refuse to listen to this --!

                                  MEGAN
                    -- so you followed her from your 
                    house, waited for her under 
                    Strawberry Mansion Bridge, bashed 
                    her over the head and threw her in 
                    the river!

      Megan watches him closely, something calculated behind her 
      heated accusations --

                                  WHITNEY
                    Get out of my office!

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Okay, that's it!  Megan, wait 
                    outside!            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1036.


      EXT.  STREET - MORNING(DAY 2)*

      Megan stands on the sidewalk outside the office building she 
      just exited.  If the previous scene affected her in any way 
    you wouldn't know it.  She looks bored.  She checks her 
      reflection in the front windows.  And notices a pair of 
      UNIFORMED SCHOOL GIRLS pass by behind her.  She takes out her 
      cell phone and dials a number.

                                  MEGAN
                          (into phone)
                    I just wanted to remind you it's 
                    Lacey's birthday today.  You're 
                    going to call her, right?

      INT.  PHILADELPHIA COMMON PLEAS COURT - CONTINUOUS(DAY 2)*

      JUDGE JEAN HUNT, age 62, sits at her desk scanning a document 
    for her signature as an Assistant District Attorney waits 
      impatiently.  We INTERCUT --  

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    I already did.  First thing this 
                    morning.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Oh.  Did she say anything?

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    You mean about you?

                                  MEGAN
                    Well?

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    No.  

      Megan's face falls.

                                  MEGAN
                    What did you get her?

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    The same thing I always get her.  A 
                    contribution to her college fund.  
                    What did you get her?

                                  MEGAN
                    I haven't decided.

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    That doesn't sound like you.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1037.


                                  MEGAN
                    No?  Why not?

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    My daughter Megan?  Who had her 
                    whole life planned out by the time 
                    she was ten?

                                  MEGAN
                    YOU had my whole life planned out 
                    by the time I was ten.

                                  JUDGE JEAN
                    And look how well you turned out.

      EXT.  STREET - MORNING(DAY 2)*

      Megan stares at her reflection in the window glass.  How well 
      indeed.  Detectives Morris and Baker exit the building.  She 
      shakes off the thought with a quick --

                                  MEGAN
                    Goodbye, Mother.

    -- as Detectives Morris and Baker walk up.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You want to tell me what the hell 
                    you were doing up there?

                                  MEGAN
                    A little good cop bad cop.  I riled 
                    him up, you calmed him down.  So 
                    what else did he tell you?

      Det. Morris can't believe it --

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You know what the problem with that 
                    is?  You're not a cop!  And you 
                    know what else?  You're off this 
                    case!  I know plenty of ME's and *
                    none of them are as big a pain in 
                    the ass as you are!*

                                  MEGAN
                    They're also not as good as I am.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You like to think that, don't you.

                                  MEGAN
                    How long ago did she kick you out, 
                    Detective?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1038.


      Morris stares at her.  

                                  MEGAN
                    You have an impression on your ring 
                    finger where a wedding band was 
                    recently removed.  And that cut on 
                    your chin?  It's from a double 
                    bladed razor, probably disposable.  
                    What happened?  When your wife 
                    kicked you out she didn't let you 
                    take your own razor?  

      Det. Morris' hand goes involuntarily to the cut on his chin.  
    He stares at Megan in astonishment.  So does Det. Baker.

                                  MEGAN
                    Every body tells a story.  Bring me 
                    in or don't.  But I want justice 
                    for Angela just as much as you do.

    A long beat as Det. Morris decides what to do.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Okay.  You want in?  Whitney denied 
                      everything.  The last time he saw 
                    Angela was at the firm's Annual 
                    Dinner Sunday night.  Angela was at 
                    his table but she didn't stay long.  
                    She had a sore throat.

                                  MEGAN
                    He's lying.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    About the sex, maybe.  But that 
                    doesn't make him a murderer.  And 
                    Burris had motive.

                                  MEGAN
                    So did Whitney if she was 
                    blackmailing him to make partner.

      Det. Morris just grins.  He lets his partner explain.  Det. *
      Baker is almost apologetic in doing so.*

                                  DET. BAKER
                    Angela didn't have to.  She already 
                    made partner.  She was at Whitney's 
                    table as a reward.  She won a big 
                    lawsuit last week.  It wasn't 
                    public yet but the Partnership 
                    Committee had already voted.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1039.


                                  DET. MORRIS
                    And there goes your theory.

      Det. Morris savors the sight of Megan having to swallow her 
      blown theory.  But Megan is nothing if not resilient.  

                                  MEGAN
                    What was the lawsuit about?

                                  DET. BAKER*
                    A boy mauled by a dog in Fairmont 
                    Park.  

      This rings a bell in Megan's head.  *

                                  MEGAN
                    Angela was mauled by a dog when she 
                    was a teenager.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So?

                                  MEGAN
                    So what's she doing defending a 
                    case like that?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                          (re:Det. Baker)*
                    Didn't you hear her?  She was 
                    making partner.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    The dog was owned by the Roberts 
                    family.  Old Philadelphia money.  
                    One of the firm's biggest clients.

      Megan takes out her cell phone and speed dials --*

                                  MEGAN
                          (into phone)
                    Peter, got a pen?  I want you to 
                    run down an address for me.

    As she waits, Det. Morris looms in front of her.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Where do you think you're going?

                                  MEGAN
                    Why?  You don't think I'll actually 
                    catch the killer, do you?


                                  END OF ACT THREE          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1040.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      EXT.  NORTH PHILADELPHIA - DAY(DAY 2)*

      Blocks of tattered apartment buildings, bulldozed lots, 
      graffitied walls and weeds growing chest high out of the 
      pavement.  They call this area the "Badlands."  

      EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY(DAY 2)*

      Peter leans against the hood of his car outside an apartment 
      building.  He watches as another car pulls up and Megan and 
      Detectives Morris and Baker emerge.  Peter hides a smile as 
      they approach.

                                  PETER
                    Hey, Bud.  How's it going?

      Det. Morris just scowls at him.  

      INT.  HALLWAY - DAY(DAY 2)*

      Det. Morris knocks.  The door opens on a chain.  Staring out 
    at them is CARL RIVERS, age 38.  Det. Morris shows his badge.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Carl Rivers, I'm Detective Morris.  
                    We need to talk to you, Sir.

      INT.  CARL RIVERS' APARTMENT - DAY(DAY2)*

      Rivers sits at the kitchen table with Detectives Morris and 
      Baker standing before him, Megan and Peter hanging by the 
      door.  Rivers' ADOLESCENT SON plays a video game on the tv in 
    the living room.  His back is to them.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You filed a lawsuit a year and a 
                    half ago after a dog attacked your 
                    son in Fairmont park.  

                                  RIVERS
                    So what?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You lost.  And Angela Swanson was 
                    murdered yesterday morning.

      Rivers stares at him, then notices Megan.  She's staring into 
    the living room at his son.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1041.


                                  RIVERS
                    He hasn't said a word since the 
                    trial.  Bad enough getting attacked 
                    by a dog.  But attacked by a human 
                    being?  That bitch put him on the 
                    stand and blamed him for 
                      everything.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    And how did that make you feel?

                                  RIVERS
                    Like killing her, how would it make 
                    you feel?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Where were you yesterday morning at 
                    7 a.m.?

                                  RIVERS
                    At work.  Alone.  I'm a janitor at 
                    Community College of Philadelphia.  

                                  DET. BAKER
                    Did anyone see you there?*

                                  RIVERS
                    I said I was alone, didn't I?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                          (beat)
                    Where was your son?

      Rivers' face darkens.  He rises to his feet.

                                  RIVERS
                    Get the hell out of my house.

      Before Det. Morris can respond, Megan interjects --

                                  MEGAN
                    Mr. Rivers, did you know Angela was 
                    attacked by a pit bull when she was 
                    a teenager?

      Rivers stares at her.  So do the others.  What does that 
      matter?

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm sure the trial was hard.  I'm 
                    sure you hated Angela for how she 
                    treated your son.  But what I don't 
                    understand is how she wound up on 
                    the other side of your lawsuit.

                                  MEGAN (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    Unless she wasn't on the other 
                    side.  

      More confused looks all around.  Except for Rivers and Megan.  
      They are locked in a stare.  Rivers breaks it off with a *
      nervous glance at the Detectives --

                                  MEGAN
                    Don't worry about them, they're 
                    Homicide.  They won't care.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Care about what?  What are you 
                    talking about?

      Rivers stares at Megan for another beat.  And his whole *
      demeanor changes.  Like she's broken through.  He heads to a 
      cabinet --  

                                  RIVERS
                    Angela came here the day after the 
                    trial.  She told me about her dog.  
                    Showed me her scars.  She said 
                    that's why she wanted on the case.  
                    Not to win it but to convince the 
                    Roberts family to settle out of 
                    court.  Only she was overruled.  If 
                    she wanted to make partner she had 
                    to win and that meant going after 
                    my kid.  That's why she came.  To *
                    apologize.  And to give me this.

    He removes an 8 x 12 envelope and hands it to Megan.  She 
      pulls out various documents.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    What are those?

                                  RIVERS
                    My grounds for appeal.  Information 
                    withheld by the firm.  The dog that 
                    mauled my son was an attack dog 
                    trained to do exactly that.

                                  MEGAN
                    Mr. Rivers, do you know who 
                    overruled Angela over settling out 
                    of court?

                                  RIVERS
                    The lead counsel.  Raymond Whitney.

      Megan throws a look at Det. Morris.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1043.


      EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER(DAY 2)*

      Megan, Peter and Detectives Morris and Baker huddle up 
      outside Rivers' building.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So you think Whitney found out she 
                    betrayed him?

      Megan looks at him.  A breakthrough.  He's taking her 
      seriously.  

                                  MEGAN
                    It's a theory.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    I don't get it.  She takes a case 
                    to settle it and when that 
                    backfires she hands over privileged 
                      information that will reverse the 
                    case she just won?    

                                  PETER
                    You're forgetting her unilaterally 
                    lesioned amygdala.  

      Blank looks from the Detectives.  And a rather amused one 
      from Megan.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    You want to tryEnglish,please?*

                                  MEGAN
                    He means Angela's old head injury.  *
                    After her coma shewent back to *
                    work and four things happened: she *
                    took a case for ulterior motives, *
                    she had an affair, she violated *
                    attorney-client privilege, and she *
                    started calling her mother just to 
                    say hello.  Four things I guarantee *
                    you pre-head injury she wouldn't 
                    have done.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Well, it looks like we'll be*
                    talking to Whitney again.  Without 
                    you, if you don't mind.

      Said to Megan not with his usual scorn, but rather with 
      deference.  Another breakthrough.

                                  MEGAN
                    I don't mind at all.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1044.


      INT.  ME'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Megan cruises past the front desk.  Once again the 
      RECEPTIONIST does his best to flag her down --

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Dr. Hunt, the Chief really needs to 
                    see you.

      Once again, Megan ignores him.  Until, that is, 
      Philadelphia's first female Chief Medical Examiner, DR. PADMA 
      KRISHNAMURTHY NOORI, age 47, cuts her off in the hallway.  
      Megan paints on a smile.

                                  MEGAN
                    Hello, Chief.

                                  PADMA
                    Let's have a talk, shall we?

      INT.  PADMA'S OFFICE - DAY(DAY2)*

      Elliot sits on the couch practically hidden from view by Semo 
      standing in front of him.  They both watch Megan follow Padma 
    in.  Padma closes the door and circles to her desk where all 
    the offending paperwork awaits.  She addresses Megan --

                                  PADMA
                    Elliot tells me he ordered an ANA 
                    panel on your recommendation.

      Elliot meekly mouths "Sorry" at Megan.  But Megan isn't mad *
    at him.  On the contrary, she invited this confrontation.*

                                  MEGAN
                    So?

                                  PADMA
                    So you've been rather profligate 
                    with our lab budget lately.  An ANA 
                    panel on a suicide.  And now an ANA 
                    panel on a heat stroke victim?  

                                  MEGAN
                    The suicide left no note.  And he *
                    had a family history of Lou 
                    Gehrig's disease.  If he thought he 
                    was symptomatic it would explain 
                    why he took his own life.

                                  PADMA
                    We're not interested in the why.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1045.


                                  MEGAN
                    Maybe you're not.  Maybe no one 
                    else around here is.  But I am, and 
                    if I'm going to understand what 
                    happened to my patients I need the *
                    latitude to order any test I deem 
                    necessary.If you don't like it, *
                    fire me.

    A stare down.  *

                                  PADMA
                    What about the heat stroke victim?

                                  MEGAN
                    She didn't die of heat stroke.

    A double take from Elliot.

                                  ELLIOT
                    What?

                                  MEGAN
                    She exhibited psychological 
                    symptoms like depression, paranoia?

                                  ELLIOT
                    Yeah.  Just like you said.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Then given normal hydration and 
                    electrolytes her ANA panel in all 
                    likelihood shows elevated 
                    anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G 
                    levels.

      Padma can't help herself.  She glances at the lab sheet.

                                  MEGAN
                    Which if it does, means she died of 
                    multiple microinfarcts that were 
                    mistaken for heat stroke but were 
                    in fact due to her being 
                    hypercoaguable.  Combine that with 
                    depression and paranoia and we have 
                    a diagnosis of what, Semo?

      Semo shifts uncomfortably.  He has no clue.  

                                  ELLIOT
                    Can I see that?

      Elliot approaches Padma's desk.  She hands over the lab 
      sheet.  He studies it for a beat.  And his eyes light up.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1046.


                                  ELLIOT
                    Lupus!

    He lowers the sheet to find Padma, Semo and Megan all staring 
    at him.  

                                  ELLIOT
                    I would've gotten that eventually.

      Megan gives him a droll look.

                                  MEGAN
                    Really?

                                  ELLIOT
                      Eventually.

      Elliot takes his cue from the room and leaves.  Megan looks *
      back at Padma.  

                                  MEGAN
                    If there's nothing else, I have my 
                    own case to attend to.

    A beat.  Padma nods for her to go.  Megan exits the office.  *
      Semo stares at the empty doorway.

                                  SEMO
                    That's it?  That's all you're going 
                    to do?

                                  PADMA
                    I'll deal with Dr. Hunt in my own *
                    way.  Anything else?*

                                  SEMO
                    Yeah.  You could tell people to *
                    start calling me "Doctor" around *
                    here.*

    She gives him a look --

                                  PADMA
                    That will be all, Semo.

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #1 - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Megan stands at the microscope.  We see what she sees.  A 
      purple-hued slide containing the tissue removed from the base 
    of Angela's neck.  One of several waiting to be examined.  
      Peter looks on from a few paces away.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1047.


                                  PETER
                    Detective Morris says Whitney was 
                    shocked.  Had no idea Angela went 
                    behind his back to Rivers.

      Megan's attention never wavers from her slides.

                                  MEGAN
                    Did you expect anything different?

                                  PETER
                    The point is Bud's zeroed in on 
                    Whitney now.  That's what you 
                    wanted, isn't it?

                                  MEGAN
                    What I want is to know what 
                    happened and why.  Like this slide.  
                    It's a Geisma stain of the tissue 
                    from Angela's neck.  The purple 
                    cells are mast cells.  They're 
                      degranulated.  Degranulation 
                    happens with physical trauma but 
                    this tissue didn't come from her 
                    head wound.  So why would the mast 
                    cells of a benign neoplasm be 
                      degranulated?   

    As she pauses to ponder her own question --

                                  PETER
                    How about a bicycle?

    A beat.  She looks at him.

                                  MEGAN
                    What?

                                  PETER
                    For your daughter.

                                  MEGAN
                    I don't think so.

                                  PETER
                    Nothing says fun like a bicycle.*

                                  MEGAN
                    Do you see me working here?

                                  PETER
                    I see you all right.  I see someone 
                    who reminds me an awful lot of 
                    Angela Swanson.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1048.


      That finally gets Megan's full attention.

                                  PETER
                      Workaholic.  No friends.  Just her 
                    career to keep her company.  But 
                    then a miracle happens.  She falls 
                    down a flight of stairs and 
                    discovers emotion.  And empathy.  
                    Enough to risk everything for a kid 
                    screwed out of a settlement she 
                    thought he deserved.  You had this 
                      high-flying life, and now you're *
                    here, and you're still pissed at 
                    the car accident that made it 
                    happen.  But maybe that car 
                    accident was your own fall down the 
                    stairs.  And you're just too scared 
                    to let the benefits kick in.  

                                  MEGAN
                    What the hell are you talking 
                    about?

                                  PETER
                    You talk about your daughter like *
                    you're stuck with only one card to *
                    play, but you're not stuck at all.  *
                    You're scared of being hurt.  But *
                    if you really want to connect with *
                    her you'll forget about handbags 
                    and give her something that comes 
                    from your heart.  Because nobody 
                    gives a shit about a handbag.

      Megan is, for once, at a loss for words.  Then the wall phone 
      goes off.  Peter walks over and grabs it.

                                  PETER
                          (answering)
                    Room 1, this is Maxwell...?

    He listens for a beat, then hangs up.  

                                  PETER
                    The police just made an arrest.

                                  MEGAN
                    Whitney?

                                  PETER
                    No.  Tom Burris.

      FADE IN:

      INT.  POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Detectives Morris and Baker give Burris the third degree.

                                  BURRIS
                    I already told you I had nothing to 
                    do with it!

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    We have the records from the pay 
                    phone in front of your halfway 
                    house.  You've been trying to call 
                    her since you got out.  And now we 
                    have a witness who puts you in the 
                    park at 6:45 a.m. heading for 
                    Strawberry Mansion Bridge!  

      INT.  OUTER CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Megan and Peter watch the interview through the two-way 
      mirror.

                                  BURRIS
                    Okay, yes, I was there.  That 
                    doesn't make me a murderer.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    It makes you a liar.  

                                  BURRIS
                    I did two years for something I 
                    didn't do, and she won't even 
                    answer my calls?  I went there to 
                    talk to her, not to kill her.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    Then what did happen?

                                  BURRIS
                    Nothing.  I swear.  By the time I 
                    got to the bridge she was gone.

    An answer that invites more verbal abuse from Det. Morris....

                                  PETER
                    You believe him?

                                  MEGAN
                    Yeah, I do.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1050.


      INT.  DETECTIVES SQUAD ROOM - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Detectives Morris and Baker emerge from their interview to 
      find Megan and Peter waiting.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Whatever it is, I don't want to 
                    hear it.  We got our guy.

                                  MEGAN
                    I thought you were zeroed in on 
                    Whitney.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Yeah.  Until we got our guy.

                                  MEGAN
                    I told you Burris didn't do it.

      Det. Morris gives Megan a long look.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    What is it with you?  You can't 
                    just be a regular ME, you have to 
                    be the Smocked Crusader?  Why don't 
                    you do us all a favor and go back 
                    to being whatever it was you were 
                    before.

                                  MEGAN
                    I can't.  I killed someone. 

      Megan turns and walks out the door.Detectives Morris and *
      Baker both stare after her.*

      INT.  CAR - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Another quiet ride as they head back to the ME's office.  
      This time it's Peter who breaks the silence.  

                                  PETER
                    Hasn't every surgeon lost a 
                    patient?

                                  MEGAN
                    Not every surgeon loses control of 
                    her hands in the middle of an 
                    operation.

                                  PETER
                    Would you go back if you could?

                                  MEGAN
                    What are you, my shrink now?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1051.


                                  PETER
                    You just told Morris you killed *
                    somebody but I don't get an answer?  

    A beat.  She stares at her hands.

                                  MEGAN
                    There was an autopsy as part of the 
                    inquest.  It was the first one I'd 
                    seen since med school.  All those 
                    hours I'd spent rehearsing the 
                    operation, studying the scans and 
                    reviewing my patient's medical 
                    history, and I never knew she had a 
                    broken heart tattoo on her ankle 
                    because of an old boyfriend, or 
                    that she fractured her arm 
                    horseback riding when she was a 
                    kid, or a dozen other things her 
                    body revealed in a way our consults 
                    never had.  

      Silence.

                                  PETER
                    That still doesn't answer my 
                    question.

    She looks over at him.

                                  MEGAN
                    Yes it does.

      INT.  ME'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

      Megan and Peter return to the office.  Approaching the 
      Bullpen they come upon the tail end of one of those impromptu 
      office birthday parties for one of the secretaries.  Peter 
    and Megan take note as they circle around --

                                  PETER
                    Don't you have a birthday party to 
                    go to?

                                  MEGAN
                    I still don't have a present.  And 
                    don't you dare say bicycle.

                                  PETER
                    I don't believe you.  Are you *
                    seriously telling me you can't *
                    think of one thing that was 
                    important to you as a kid that 
                    you'd want your daughter to have?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1052.


    She stops in her tracks.  She stares at him.  A look of 
      revelation on her face.

                                  PETER
                    Aha.  Finally.  So what is it?

      Meanwhile, a group of MEs and Assistant MEs pick over what's 
      left of a chocolate cake with crushed walnuts packed around 
    the base.  

                                  ASSISTANT ME #1
                    Hey Peter, want a piece?

    He glances over --

                                  PETER
                    No thanks.  

                                  MEGAN
                    When I was a kid -- Lacey's age, in 
                    fact -- my father had this tool *
                    shed --*

                                  ASSISTANT ME #2
                    Come on, it's going to waste.

                                  PETER
                    Sorry, nut allergy.One bite and --*

    He clutches his throat and MAKES A CHOKING SOUND.  His point *
      made, he looks back at Megan --*

                                  PETER
                    Yeah?  Your father had a tool *
                    shed...?*

      She's stopped talking, however.  Shestares at himwith eyes *
    as big as silver dollars.  *

                                  PETER*
                    What?*

                                  MEGAN
                    An allergic reaction.  Of course.*

    And she rushes down the hall.  *

      INT.  STORAGE ROOM - AFTERNOON(DAY 2)*

    A dozen storage refrigerators stand side by side.  Megan 
      pulls out a tray from one and retrieves a bag marked with 
      Angela's name, case number and the words "stomach contents."            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1053.


      Peter enters the room as Megan loads a syringe with the 
      liquid Peter previously identified as Gatorade.

                                  MEGAN
                    Get this to the lab and have them 
                    run a tox screen for prescription *
                    drugs.*

                                  PETER
                    That'll take a couple hours.

                                  MEGAN
                    Tell them they have one.

                                  PETER
                    Oh-kay.  Can I tell them why?

                                  MEGAN
                    The degranulation in her tissue 
                    sample.  It wasn't caused by 
                    trauma, it was caused by 
                    anaphylaxis.  

    And back out the door she goes.  He stares after her.

      EXT.  MIKE FLEMING'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING(DAY 2)*

      Megan comes up the walk approaching the front door.  She can 
    see and hear a birthday party going on inside.  She's about 
    to ring the bell, then catches a glimpse of her daughter 
      LACEY in the window.  

    ON MEGAN

    She circles around the back of the house, straddling bushes 
    and soiling her shoes as she does so, following Lacey through 
    the windows.  Finally Lacey is close enough to the kitchen 
      door for Megan to tap on the window.

    The door opens.  Lacey steps out.  Mother and daughter regard 
      each other.  Lacey presents as a twelve year old going on 
      twenty.  Mature, sophisticated, and just as emotionally on 
      guard as her mother.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Happy birthday.

                                  LACEY
                    Dad said you couldn't come.

                                  MEGAN
                    Dad says a lot of things.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1054.


                                  LACEY
                    You mean that aren't true?

      Megan has been here all of ten seconds and already she's in 
      dangerous territory.

                                  MEGAN
                    That maybe tell only his side of 
                    the story.  

                                  LACEY
                    What would be your side?

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm here, aren't I?

      Megan smiles, trying to diffuse the tension.

                                  MEGAN
                    How's the party?

                                  LACEY
                    It's okay.

                                  MEGAN
                    Did I miss the cake?

                                  LACEY
                    Like you'd ever eat cake.

                                  MEGAN
                    Try me sometime.

    A flicker of a smile on Lacey's face.  

                                  MEGAN
                    I got you a present.  I hope you *
                    like it.*

    She hands Lacey a blue Tiffany jewelry box.  Lacey opens it *
    and pulls out a key on a silver chain.  She stares at it, 
      then at Megan, curious.

                                  MEGAN
                    You remember that picture of me and 
                    grandpa in front of his tool shed?

                                  LACEY
                    Yeah?

                                  MEGAN
                    That shed was his sanctuary.  The *
                    one place he could hide from the *
                    world.  Nobody got in there.  
                                  (MORE)          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1055.

                                  MEGAN (CONT'D)
                    And I mean nobody.  For years and 
                    years I tried.  And then one day, 
                    when I was about your age, he gave 
                    me the key.  
                          (re: Lacey's present)
                    That's the key to my apartment.  
                    Where you'll always be welcome.  A 
                    sanctuary.  An escape whenever you 
                    need one.  Whatever you want it to 
                    be.  

      Megan smiles nervously.  This is new territory for her.  And *
    for Lacey too.  She looks at her mother, processing this*
      gesture, not sure she fully understands it --*

      INT.  ME'S OFFICE - EVENING(DAY 2)*

      Megan walks down the hallway and sees Peter coming from the 
      opposite direction, lab test in his hand.  

                                  PETER
                    There's something wrong here.  Your 
                    test came back positive for 
                    Amoxicillin.

      Megan scans the results herself.

                                  MEGAN
                    Why would you think something was 
                    wrong?

                                  PETER
                    Angela wasn't taking Amoxicillin, 
                    she was taking Erythromycin.

                                  MEGAN
                    Exactly.  Call Detective Morris.  
                    Tell him to get a search warrant 
                    for Whitney's house and meet us 
                    there as soon as he can.  

      EXT.  WHITNEY HOUSE - EVENING(DAY 2)*

      Megan and Peter stand on the doorstep.  Megan has already 
      rung the bell.  The door opens and Whitney looks out.  He's 
      none too happy to see Megan again.  

                                  WHITNEY
                    What do you want?

                                  MEGAN
                    Did you love Angela?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1056.


      Whitney has no time to react.  It's dinner time.  His wife 
      Jill calls out to him from inside the house.  

                                  JILL (O.S.)
                    Raymond, who is it?

                                  WHITNEY
                    In a minute!

                                  MEGAN
                    Did you love her?  Because if you 
                    did, then help me find her killer 
                    and tell me the truth.  She was 
                    here yesterday morning, wasn't she.

                                  WHITNEY
                    Yes, all right?  

                                  MEGAN
                    And you didn't know she slipped 
                    privileged information to Carl 
                    Rivers.

                                  WHITNEY
                    Like I told the Detectives, no.

                                  JILL (O.S.)
                    Raymond?  Who's out there?

                                  WHITNEY
                    Just a second!

    He closes the door behind him.

                                  WHITNEY
                    Look, I'll tell you everything you 
                    want to know.  But just don't let 
                    my wife find out, okay?

                                  MEGAN
                    Mr. Whitney, I owe you an apology.  
                    I thought you had more than one 
                    reason to kill Angela, but it turns 
                    out all you're guilty of is falling 
                    in love with her.

    The door opens and JILL WHITNEY, age 45, looks out at her 
      guests.

                                  JILL
                    What's going on?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1057.


                                  WHITNEY
                    This is Dr. Hunt from the Medical 
                    Examiner's Office.  She's looking 
                    into Angela's death.

                                  MEGAN
                    Mrs. Whitney, Sunday night at the 
                    firm's annual dinner, did Angela 
                    mention she had strep throat?

                                  JILL
                    Yes.

                                  MEGAN
                    And what she was taking for it?

      Jill goes cautiously silent.  

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm guessing she did.  In fact I'm 
                    positive she told you she was 
                    taking Erythromycin for an 
                    infection of Beta Streptococcus 
                    Group A.  

    Now Jill looks downright worried.  Megan turns to Whitney.

                                  MEGAN
                    Have your sons had strep throat 
                    recently?

                                  JILL
                    Don't answer that, Raymond.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'll consider that a yes.  The 
                      interesting thing about Beta Group 
                    A is that it's rare in adults 
                    UNLESS they contract it from their 
                    children.  You didn't know it, Mr. 
                    Whitney, but you got it from your 
                    sons and passed it on to Angela.  
                    And that's how your wife knew the 
                    two of you were having an affair.  

      Whitney cringes.  But his concerns about his affair being 
      revealed are trumped by the arrival of Detectives Morris and 
      Baker in a sedan, and two UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS in a 
      SQUAD CAR.  All four approach the house.  

                                  WHITNEY
                    What are they doing here?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1058.


      Det. Morris answers this question by producing a piece of 
      paper.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Mr. Whitney, this is a warrant to 
                    search your house.  Officers?

    The two Uniforms proceed inside as Whitney scans the 
      document.

                                  WHITNEY
                    You're looking for drugs?

                                  MEGAN
                    Amoxicillin, to be exact.

    At the word, Jill sags.  As if she knew the gig was up.

                                  MEGAN
                    Not only did your wife know you 
                    gave Angela strep throat, she also 
                    knew Erythromycin is prescribed for 
                    strep throat to people severely 
                    allergic to penicillin and its 
                    derivatives, the most common of 
                    which is Amoxicillin.  She dropped 
                    your sons off at school yesterday 
                    morning, then came back here and 
                    found you and Angela having sex.  *
                    Instead of confronting you she 
                    spiked Angela's Gatorade with, I'm 
                    willing to bet, the same 
                      Amoxicillin your sons were 
                    prescribed for their strep throat.  

                                                          CUT TO:

      EXT.  STRAWBERRY MANSION BRIDGE - MORNING - FLASHBACK

      We're back to Angela's morning run at the beginning of our 
      story.  She sips from a bottle of GATORADE as the gravel path 
      she's running on angles towards Strawberry Mansion Bridge.  

                                  MEGAN (V.O.)
                    Angela left your house around 6:45 
                    a.m. yesterday morning.  She made 
                    it all the way to the river before 
                    she went into anaphylactic shock -- 
                    a fatal allergic reaction affecting 
                    every system in her body.

      Angela kicks it into high gear as she goes under the bridge.  
    We HOLD ON ANGELA as, suddenly, she staggers to a stop AND *
      CLUTCHESHER THROAT CHOKING --*          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1059.


                                  MEGAN (V.O.)
                    She became dizzy.  Her airways 
                    stopped working due to 
                      bronchoconstriction.  And then she 
                    lost her balance.

      ANGELA FALLS INTO THE RIVER.  AND CRACKS HER HEAD ON AN IRON 
      BEAM -- HEAVY, METAL AND SQUARE WITH A DULL EDGE -- DUMPED IN 
    THE RIVER LONG AGO AND LYING JUST BELOW THE SURFACE.  

                                  MEGAN (V.O.)
                    Foam in the mouth is often seen in 
                    drowning cases but is also a 
                    product of anaphylaxis.  Angela 
                    wasn't hit by her killer on the 
                    back of the head.  The back of her 
                    head hit something when she fell 
                    into the water.

      Blood plumes around Angela's head.  Her eyes roll.  She 
      struggles for breath.  We watched it before, we watch it 
      again, as slowly, inexorably, the river claims her....

                                                            BACK TO:

      EXT.  WHITNEY HOUSE - EVENING(DAY 2)*

    The two Uniforms return.  One holds up a prescription bottle 
    in an evidence bag.  Megan takes it and shows the label to 
      Jill.  It reads all too clearly: "Liquid Amoxicillin."

                                  MEGAN
                    Liquid Amoxicillin.  When this *
                    matches the formulation we found in *
                    Angela's stomach, that will be all 
                    for you.  Anything you want to say?

      Whitney stares at his wife in horror.  She looks back at him, 
      then at Megan, Peter and Detectives Morris and Baker --

                                  JILL
                    I want a lawyer.

      Megan smiles with grim satisfaction as Det. Morris brings out 
    the cuffs.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Jill Whitney, you're under arrest 
                    for the murder of Angela Swanson.  
                    You have the right to remain 
                    silent....          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1060.


      EXT.  WHITNEY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER(DAY 2)*

      Jill sits in the back of the Detectives' car.  Det. Baker 
      shuts her in.  Det. Morris meanwhile is having trouble 
      finding words for Megan.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    I guess I'll see you at trial.

                                  MEGAN
                    Yes you will.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Well then, thanks.  Doctor.

                                  MEGAN
                    You're welcome.  Detective.

      Det. Morris returns to his car.  Det. Baker throws a *
      respectful nod at Megan before she too climbs in and the car *
      pulls away.  *

      Megan turns to find Peter regarding her with a smile.*

                                  MEGAN
                    What are you smiling at?

                                  PETER
                    It's not like you not to rub it in.*

                                  MEGAN
                    Get in the car.

      INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM #1 - NIGHT(DAY 2)*

      Megan stands at the examination table looking down at 
      Angela's bodycovered in a sheet up to her neck.  Megan*
      doesn't notice Padma slip through the door behind her.  
      Until, that is --

                                  PADMA*
                    Igot a lot of calls about you *
                    before I hired you.  She's *
                    brilliant and driven.  She throws *
                    elbows but gets results.  I didn't *
                    think it was possible they were *
                    underselling you but they were.  In *
                    one year you've managed to get even *
                    City Hall to noticeus.*

                                  MEGAN
                    You're welcome.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1061.


                                  PADMA
                    But the knives will come out the 
                    minute you screw up, and even I *
                    won't be able to help you.*

    As Megan ponders this --*

                                  PADMA*
                    I may never have a resume like *
                    yours but I do know something you *
                    don't.  You let this job get too *
                    personal and you'll burn yourself 
                    out.  

                                  MEGAN
                    You let me worry about that, okay?*

      Padma ponders her brilliant, driven, puzzle of a Medical *
      Examiner.

                                  PADMA
                    Do you have any friends?

                                  MEGAN
                    Why?

                                  PADMA
                    Get some.  You can't fight 
                    everybody, everywhere, all the 
                    time, alone.

    And with that, Padma leaves.  Megan looks at Angela for the 
      last time, and pulls the sheet up over her head.

      INT.  MEGAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Megan walks in.  Her expression is heavy, as if Padma's words 
    had somehow weighed her down.  She drops her keys, carries 
    her handbag into the kitchen and sets it on the kitchen 
      island.  And then she freezes.  

      There's something else waiting for her on the island.  A 
      PIECE OF BIRTHDAY CAKE.  And a note in her daughter's 
      handwriting.  "Happy My Birthday, Lacey."  

      Megan's whole demeanor lifts.  As if sun had broken through 
      clouds.  As if she weren't alone after all.  She reaches for 
    a fork and takes a bite as we....

                                                            FADE OUT.
