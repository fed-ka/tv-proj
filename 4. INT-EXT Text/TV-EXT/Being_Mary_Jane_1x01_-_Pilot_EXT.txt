      MORNING

      She pushes and kicks her half-dressed Handsome Man out of the 
      front door.  She even gets in a few good licks upside his 
      head.

                    Liar!  I let you kiss me with vomit

                    I meant what I said.  I love you.

      Then out of nowhere, a strong blast of water hits his face.  
      Our Black Woman continues to hose him down until he reaches 
      his car.

                    Are you crazy?!

        Neighborhood dogs start BARKING.  That makes her stop the 
      water torture.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                    Kiss my ass --

      She throws his keys at his head.

      Mary Jane dodges traffic and runs across the street to the 
      accident, fearing with each step that the words she uttered 
      came true.  But it s not her Handsome Black Man.  It s some 
      OTHER GUY with a similar car... and he s okay, just a broken, 
      bloody nose from the airbag.  As Mary Jane thaws out from

                    He s fine, was texting while

      Mary Jane finds her father on the front porch.  She sits in

      FADE IN:



      Mary Jane is mid-show.  She is talking about the African 
      women arrested for raping men in order to get their sperm for 
      an abundance ritual.  It s a quick peek into who she is on 
      air.  She s damn good and very personable.  Her take on the 
      story questions if the crime is RAPE or THEFT?    Single Black Female - Pilot38.


      And if it s the latter, she asks her guests,  How do you put 
    a value on sperm?   She gets a few fun comments from her 
      CRIMINAL ANALYSTS.  

      But her SPECIAL GUEST is a white woman with a memoir coming 
      out that outlines how she made stealing sperm from rich and 
      powerful men a business.  A lot was settled privately in 
      exchange for money, homes, cars, furniture, etc.  And with 
      some, she secured her future by having their babies.  Her 
      stance is that she stole the sperm, she never raped anyone to 
      get it.

      can see David at a table near the window.  She looks at him 
      for a beat, then:

                                  MARY JANE
                    Call Never Answer.

                    Dialing Never Answer.

      She watches him answer his cell phone.

                                  MARY JANE
                    I don t think there s enough 
                    chicken and waffles I could order 
                    to make this something it isn t.

                                  DAVID
                          (laughs)
                    Okay, Mary Jane.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Good night, David.

      She watches him hang up and shake his head and then wave the 
      waitress over to order.

      She drives off.

      We stay close on her to watch her go from self-assuredness, 
      to loneliness to pride.

      Music Cue:  FLY  by Nicki Minaj featuring Rihanna. 

      Eventually a victorious smile spreads over her face.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Music still driving us, Mary Jane heads into work the next 
      day, stepping on the elevator at the same time Kara does.  
      They have their morning salutations, then:

                                  MARY JANE
                    I want to play the race card.

                                  KARA
                          (sighs, doesn t agree)
                    You got it, boss.

                                  MARY JANE
                    All my ancestors who survived the 
                    middle passage just did the cabbage 
                    patch.

      Kara bursts out laughing.  Mary Jane joins her.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      As Mark gets up from the desk, he passes Mary Jane.  They 
      don t have words today, just winks for each other.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      She walks up to the car, where Patrick is parked.  He sees 
      it s her, but chooses to keep his focus on his cell phone 
      where he plays Solitaire.

                                  MARY JANE
                    You can come in.

                                    PATRICK
                    I ll wait.

      She hands him some money.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Here.

                                    PATRICK
                    I m good.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Just take it.

      Then Niecy breaks through the moment with her excitement.

                                  NIECY (O.S.)
                    Daddy, look what I got!

      Patrick and Mary Jane look up to see Niecy at the front door 
      with the black Bugaboo stroller that Mary Jane gave her.

                                    PATRICK
                    I don t need it anymore.

      The two siblings finally lock eyes.  Mary Jane feels bad that 
      she stole Patrick s moment -- because he couldn t give it to 
      his daughter.

                                  MARY JANE
                    Patrick, I m --

      Patrick gets out of the car and helps his daughter load the 
      stroller into the car.

                                                                            CUT TO:  Single Black Female - Pilot63.
