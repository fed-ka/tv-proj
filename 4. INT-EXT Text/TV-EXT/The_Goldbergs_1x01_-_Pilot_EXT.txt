  The family piles out to find a RED 1985 FIREBIRD.  At the 
  wheel is AL  POPS  SOLOMON.  He s 70 and a real wild man.

                                  POPS
                    I hear someone turned sixteen and 
                    could use a new car.

                                  BARRY
                    Holy crap!  For me? 

                                  POPS
                    I don t love you that much.  This 
                    baby s mine.  You get my old Caddy.

                                  BARRY
                    If it has four wheels and a tape 
                    deck, I ll take it!

                                  ERICA
                    What the hell?!  I didn t get a car 
                    when I turned sixteen!

                                  POPS
                    What do you need a car for?  With 
                    your looks, you can get a ride from 
                    any boy in town.  

  Adam smiles as he watches Pops stroll up the main path in his 
    burgundy smoking jacket, which awesomely matches his car.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    My grandpa.  The wild man of the 
                    family.  Yes, he wore burgundy 
                    suits and was uncomfortably sexist, 
                    but ol  Pops was still my hero.    How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      9.

  Pops throws a pair of Cadillac car keys to Barry.  A hand 
    intercepts.  BOOM.  It s Beverly.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Not happening.  You re not giving 
                    him your old car, Dad.

                                  POPS
                    I just did.  I upgraded to the 
                    Firebird.  I m gonna be moustache 
                    deep in an avalanche of horny sixty 
                    year-old widows.

  Pops reaches out and gives Adam a high five.

                                  ADAM
                    Nice!
                          (then)
                    Ew.

                                    BEVERLY
                    We already went over this, Dad.   
                    He s not getting his license.

                                  BARRY
                    I can and I will!  I m sixteen, I 
                    have rights!  It s the law!

                                    BEVERLY
                    I am the law.

                                  BARRY
                    Well, the law is mean and ugly.  
                          (to Murray)
                    Please.  It s not fair.

    Murray exhales deeply, clearly feeling for his son in this 
  real moment.  He puts a hand on Barry s shoulder.  A beat.

                                  MURRAY
                    Who the hell told you life was 
                    fair, you stupid moron?  

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    My dad s  colorful  way of speaking 
                    may seem a bit harsh.  It really 
                    wasn t.  You just had to learn how 
                    to speak  Murray .

  THREE VHS CUTS:

    -Barry rams Adam s head into a giant foam speaker as Murray 
  yells to them from his La-Z-Boy.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    I am this close to pulling a double 
                    homicide!  I have it in me!

    SUBTITLES: I find your behavior frustrating.

    -Murray holds up Adam s math test.  He got an A.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    Don t get cocky, you little 
                    bastard.

    SUBTITLES: Excellent work!


  FWIP!  Beverly tosses the car keys back to Pops. 

                                  ERICA
                    So Barry has a car and no license, 
                    and I have a license and no car.  
                    How does that makes sense?

                                    BEVERLY
                            (victorious)
                    Makes perfect sense to me.

                                  BARRY
                    I hate you all!  The only one who 
                      understands me is Morrissey!

  Barry races inside, doing that weird chest forward run with 
  his arms dangling at his side.  A beat.

                                  POPS
                    Well, this was fun.

                    hit the senior water aerobics class

  Pops and Adam head for the Firebird.  They spot Barry sitting 
    outside Wawa eating out of a garbage bag, bike next to him.

                                  ADAM
                    Barry?  What are you doing?

                                  BARRY
                    What s it look like?  Eating day-
                    old donuts out of a garbage bag.  
                    My friend Terrance leaves  em out 
                    back for me.

                                  ADAM
                    Why?

                                  BARRY
                    It s called eating your feelings, 
                    ass-bag.  Mom s gonna make me ride 
                    my banana seat Huffy for the rest 
                    of my miserable life.

                                  POPS
                    Not if I can help it.  Put down the 
                    garbage cruller,  cause I m gonna 
                    figure out a way to get you that 
                    license and my car.  

  Pops offers Barry a hand up.  He takes it with a small smile.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      13.

  The family is gathered, watching as a tow truck dumps the 
    TOTALED FIREBIRD in front of the house. 

                                  POPS
                    Don t worry, Beverly!  I ll clear 
                    this whole mess up at my hearing 
                    next week.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Forget your hearing.  It s been 
                    heard.  You re not driving. 

                                  POPS
                    Like hell I m not.  I told you, the 
                    accident wasn t my fault!

                                    BEVERLY
                    So the house just darted out into the 
                    street without looking both ways?

                                  POPS
                    The sun was in my eyes!  And the brakes 
                    failed!  And there was a... moose!

                                    BEVERLY
                    A moose.  In the middle of town.  
                    It s almost unbelievable.

                                  POPS
                    Imagine my shock.  

                                    BEVERLY
                    That s enough, Dad.  This is your 
                    second episode this month.

                                  POPS
                    Please, I took a few grapes from 
                    the grocery store.  That s hardly 
                    an episode.  Everyone does it!

                                    BEVERLY
                    It wasn t a grocery store!  You 
                    wandered into someone s house! 

    Beverly notices the NEIGHBORS, casually watching from their 
  porch as if this happens ALL the time.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      16.

                    Why don t you go get a camera, 
                    Gina?  It ll last longer!

  Adam sidles in next to Beverly, filming with pure joy.  

                                  ADAM
                    Got it covered.

  Erica suddenly appears from nowhere, pushing Adam aside.

                                  ERICA
                    If Pops isn t driving anymore, I 
                    totally have dibs on his new car!

                                  BARRY
                    It s my car!  He gave it to me!

                                  ERICA
                    I m going to college in ten months, 
                    eighteen days!  I need a car and I 
                    will fight you for it!

                                    BEVERLY
                    No one s fighting anyone or driving 
                    anything or going anywhere!  
                      Especially you, Dad.  I mean it.  
                    No more Firebird, no more driving 
                    and no more swim class with Adam.

    Adam s joy is instantly gone.  He turns off the camera.

                                  ADAM
                      Whoa-whoa!  Stop!  I have to go 
                    swimming with Pops.  I got... 
                    important business there.

                                    BEVERLY
                    You re eleven!  What business?

                                  ADAM
                    I m in love with their -- floaties!  
                    They re so buoyant and... tan. 

                                  POPS
                    Are we done here?   Cause I ve got 
                    a date with Shirley Nagel and 
                    tonight I m scoring some serious 
                    under the girdle action --

    Everyone breaks into FURIOUS AD LIB chatter.  Murray finally 
    reaches into the TOTALED FIREBIRD and LEANS ON THE HORN until 
  it sputters and dies.  He s calm.  For the moment.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      17. 
  2nd Rev. Network Draft 11.27.12                                                                       

                                  MURRAY
                    This goes without saying --
                          (then, yells)
                    WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

                                    BEVERLY
                    Here we go, he s yelling again. 
                    Murray, I got it handled --

                                  MURRAY
                    Do you?   Cause to me, it looks 
                    like you ve lost it with the rest 
                    of  em.  It s time I handle it.

  For once, Beverly is SILENT.  Shocked.  Murray brushes past 
  her and steps before Albert and Barry.  

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    Cut the crap, Albert.  This is all 
                    part of life.  You lose your keys, 
                    Barry gets his.  It s like -- the 
                    circle of driving. 

                                  BARRY
                    Sweet!  I m getting my license?

                                  MURRAY
                    No!  Maybe!  We ll talk about it 
                    later!

                                    BEVERLY
                    No!  Stop talking!  Go back to 
                    your La-Z-Boy and watch the game.  

                                  MURRAY
                    Oh, so that s how it s gonna be?

                                    BEVERLY
                    It s whatever I say it s gonna be.  
                    No one is driving!  Ever again.
                          (then, changes the subject)
                    Who wants bagel bites?


    Traffic has slowed to a crawl.  Barry is still locked in the 
    car... as a POLICE CAR rolls up next to Murray.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    It would come to be known as the 
                    great lockout of  85.  My brother 
                    sat stone-faced and silent in that 
                    station wagon with no food and no 
                    water.  Only stubborn teenage angst 
                    to sustain him.

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    There a problem here?

                                  MURRAY
                    Just out for a nice drive with my 
                    son, Officer.  You know how it is.  
                    You got kids?  Married?  What s 
                    your situation?

                    The situation is move the car or 
                    I ll impound it.

                                  MURRAY
                    No!  No impounding.  I m handling it.  
                          (breathes deep)
                    Like a Zen master.

    Murray walks calmly to the car and POUNDS on the window.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    I will DESTROY you and all you hold 
                    dear if you don t open the door!  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      23.

                    live here!  This is my home now!

    Murray wheels on Adam, eyes flashing fire.

                                  MURRAY
                        Erica-Beverly-what syourname!  Get 
                    me the crowbar! 

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    Sir.  I can t let you break a window. 

                                  MURRAY
                    Window?  I m gonna beat his ass 
                    with it.  

    EEEEEERTTT.  Pops  Cadillac pulls up.  A FUMING Beverly is at 
  the wheel, Pops rides shotgun and Erica is in the back.  
    Officer Puchinski and Murray GULP in fear.

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    It s the sandwich lady.  This is 
                    bad.

                                  MURRAY
                    How did she -- who called her?

                                  ADAM
                          (grinning)
                    Not me from that pay phone over 
                    there.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Yup, there were pay phones back then.

    Murray wheels on the car, madly KNOCKING on the window.

                                  MURRAY
                    Barry.  Get out of the car.  Please 
                    get out of the damn car!
                          (glances over at Beverly)
                    In!  Let me in!  We ll both live in 
                    there!  We ll make a wonderful life 
                    for ourselves!  Open up!

  No go.  Beverly is upon him.

                                    BEVERLY
                    So this is what happens when you re

                                  MURRAY
                    You can gloat later.  Just do your 
                    mothering thing and get him out of 
                    the car.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Oh no, Mr. Zen Master Man.  You 
                    clean up this mess.  I m going to 
                    the salon to get my hair poofed.  

                                  ADAM
                    Can you drop me and Pops off at 
                    swim class?  It s on the way --

                                  MURRAY
                    Wait!  Don t go.  Albert, help me 
                    out here.  Barry listens to you.  
                    Talk some sense into the boy.

  Pops gives an understanding nod, then screams to Barry:

                                  POPS
                    Fight the power, kiddo!  Don t let 
                    anyone say you can t drive!  It s a 
                    God given right!

  The station wagon suddenly RISES.  We REVEAL it s been hooked 
  up to a tow truck!  It drives off, Barry still inside the car.

                                  BARRY
                    I regret nothiiiiiiing!

    A beat.  Erica leans over to Beverly.

                                  ERICA
                    Since you re already mad -- I m on 
                    the pill.

                                      ACT THREE


  Adam sits outside Wawa, eating donuts out of a garbage bag.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    That night, Barry wasn t the only 
                    one who made history.

  Zoe suddenly steps before Adam.  He frantically tosses away 
  the bag of garbage donuts and madly licks his fingers.

                                  ZOE
                    Hey.

                                  ADAM
                          (as cool as he can)
                     Sup.

                                  ZOE
                    Are you okay?  I know... things got 
                    weird.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, I m really sorry about that.

                                  ZOE
                    Don t be.  Listen, your mom tells 
                    me you re gonna be a big director.

                                  ADAM
                    Uh, yeah.  Maybe.

                                  ZOE
                    Well, I m kind of a singer and 
                    wanted to shoot a video.  Would you 
                    be up for helping me?

  Adam is speechless.  All he can muster is a nod  yes .

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Cool.  Talk tomorrow, Adam.

  With that, Zoe walks off.  Adam finally catches his breath.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      31. 
  2nd Rev. Network Draft 11.27.12                                                                       

                                  ADAM
                    She said it.  She said my name.
                          (then, grins triumphantly)
                    Long con.


  The driveway is now a cheesy  80s music video set.  Zoe lip 
  syncs to a GOD AWFUL POP song as Adam films like THE MAN.

  We REVEAL BEVERLY proudly watching from the kitchen.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    I guess mom really did give 
                      everything to her family.  Even if 
                    it meant letting them go.

     KYRIE  CONTINUES OVER OUR ENDING MONTAGE:


  Barry pulls the station wagon up to the curb -- well, onto 
  the curb.  Pops and Adam happily hop out.

                                  POPS
                    They just opened this place, kiddo.  
                    I think you may like it.

  We REVEAL the giant sign outside the restaurant -- HOOTERS.  
    Adam s heart skips a beat.  He glances up at Pops with a look 
  that says  I LOVE YOU, GRANDPA.  


  The sun sets as Beverly sits on the children s rusty, unused 
  swing set -- alone.  She holds a BABY BLANKET in her hand.  
  After a moment, she gives it a deep sniff.  

                                  MURRAY (O.S.)
                    Whatcha doing?

    Beverly jumps, caught.  We REVEAL Murray behind her. 

                                    BEVERLY
                    Nothing.

                                  MURRAY
                    Relax.  I know when you re sad you 
                    come out here and sniff the kids  
                    old baby blankets.

    Murray sits on the swing next to her.  A beat.

                                    BEVERLY
                    What happened, Murray?  Seriously, 
                    where did it go?  I blinked... and 
                      everything s changed.

                                  MURRAY
                    Honey, you ve given everything to 
                    this family.  To the kids.  But if 
                    you can t let them go... you ll 
                    lose them for real.

    Beverly takes this in for a moment and nods.

                                    BEVERLY
                    You were right.  My world is caving 
                    in.  Guess I really can t stop it. 

                                  MURRAY
                    No.  But you still did the right 
                    thing.  After everything, you let 
                    that little bastard get his license. 

                                    BEVERLY
                    Baby steps.  

    Murray pulls out a baby blanket.  He offers it to her.

                                  MURRAY
                    Speaking of... can I take a hit?  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      33.

    Beverly smiles as the Mister Mister SONG crescendos.  They 
  sit there in silence, passing the blanket back and forth.  
  It's crazy and creepy, but... oddly touching.   

                                    BEVERLY
                    Ooooooh, that s the stuff.

                                  MURRAY
                    Oh yeah.  Smells like when they 
                    couldn t talk back.

  BAM!  Murray s swing SNAPS under him.  He CRASHES to the ground.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                      Goddammit! 

                                    BEVERLY
                    That s it, I m putting you on a 
                    diet!

  We PULL BACK TO REVEAL Adam video taping everything from his 
    window.  He smiles victoriously.

                                                                                SMASH TO:

    A short, 30 second montage of the real VHS footage of my 
    family arguing -- featuring lines from this very script.  

                                  MURRAY
                    You re aggravating me, you little 
                    bastard!

                                    BEVERLY
                    What are you pulling his hair for?  
                    Look, he needs it.  It s already 
                    thinning.  

                      BARRYADAM
      I told you to stop filming!  Stop pulling on it!

      Then -- silence -- as the audience takes it all in.  What 
      they saw was REAL.
