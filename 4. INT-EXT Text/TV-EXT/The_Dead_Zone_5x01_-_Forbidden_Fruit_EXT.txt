          A dark Mercedes sedan pulls to the curb.  The Driver gets
          out and opens the back door, as MIRANDA ELLIS emerges
          wearing dark sunglasses, looking very Jackie Kennedy. 
          She looks around, clearly feeling like she's being watched.



          Johnny follows Jeremy out of the building and up the
            sidewalk.

                        If I could just have a minute?

                                        JEREMY
                        I'd love to, but I've got a lot
                        to do before I go to jail.

                        So, you're not going to reveal
                        your source to the Grand Jury?

          Jeremy STOPS.

                        I know you.  You're...

                        I spent three months tryin' to
                        get an exclusive interview with
                        you.  You never returned my calls.

                        I've been busy.
                                (off Jeremy's look)
                        Okay, I'm a jerk.   

                                        JEREMY
                        What are you doing here?  Somebody
                        hire you to figure out the identity
                        of my source?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, I already know who it
                        is.

                                        JEREMY

                          Unfortunately, it doesn't do me
                        any good unless the name goes
                        public.
                                (off Jeremy's look)
                        It's a long story.

                                        JEREMY
                        People have a right to know the
                        truth, John.  And people have the
                        same right to their privacy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you'd rather go to jail?

                                        JEREMY
                        It's a complicated world. 

          Jeremy takes out a business card and writes something on
          the back of it.

                                        JEREMY
                        Here's my business card.  My home
                        number.  In case you change your
                        mind about that interview.

          He gives Johnny the card and is about to get in his car,

                        How about we do it right now?

          Jeremy hesitates, as...



          Jeremy's wife Karen is in the garden.  Jeremy appears...

                                        JEREMY
                          A little early for gardening,
                        isn't it? 

                                        KAREN
                        It's cooler before the sun gets
                        too high.  Go back to bed.

                                        JEREMY
                        I can't sleep.  I'm gonna walk up
                        to the bakery and get some bagels. 
                        If the phone rings, let it go,
                        it's just people wanting comments
                        on the hearing today.

          We HEAR the phone begin RINGING inside the house.

                                        JEREMY
                        See?

          He seems bothered,

                                        KAREN
                        What? 

                                        JEREMY
                        You ever have the feeling you
                        were doing the wrong thing for
                        all the right reasons?  

          Jeremy gives her a kiss as he pats her stomach and then
          walks away.  The PHONE CONTINUES TO RING inside the house.

          Karen continues working deeper into the garden.

          to Karen Tomlin before the snake bites her.



          Johnny steers the Rover towards a street corner, as he
            continues to try and contact Tomlin at home.

                                        JOHNNY

          He stops as he suddenly notices,

          Tomlin is walking down the sidewalk towards the bakery. 
          They BOTH make EYE CONTACT as Johnny squeals the car around

          towards the Tomlin house.

            Stillson, dressed in jogging attire, finishes his morning
          run.  He's bent over trying to catch his breath, as Janus
          appears.

                                        STILLSON
                                (breathing hard)
                        Mister Janus.  I missed you on
                        the road this morning.

                                        JANUS
                        I've never grasped the notion of
                        running until one's lungs explode
                        as an endorsement for healthy
                        living.

          Stillson smiles, then realizes this visit is all business.

                                        STILLSON
                        What's on your mind?

                          professional.

                                (firm)
                        If this is about Miranda, she and
                        I had a heart-to-heart last night. 
                        I can assure you she's not going
                        to be a problem.

                                        JANUS
                        That's excellent news.  I'm
                          curious, did this heart-to-heart
                        take place before or after she
                        went to Johnny Smith's house?

                        They spent several hours inside
                        the house.  She was back in the
                        house just before daylight.

          Stillson takes a few steps away to gather himself.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't understand, I told her...

                        suggest we talk about?  Johnny
                        Smith?  It seems to be the only
                        thing we have in common!

          He violently kicks a garbage can in anger.

                        on...

                        How would you suggest I handle
                        the situation?

          Stillson considers the question as we see a cold resolve
          wash over him.

                                        STILLSON
                                (cold)
                        I'll leave that decision to you. 

          He starts away, then hesitates, but never turns to look
          at Janus...

                                        STILLSON
                        This is a turning point for us,
                          Malcolm.  Don't disappoint me.

                          Congressman Stillson and I disagree
                        about how best to lead this State. 
                        But today is about family.  On
                        that subject I think we're in
                        agreement.  Excuse me.

          He moves on, greeting other guests.



          Guests are being seated for the ceremony, STRING MUSIC
          PLAYING.  Senator Ellis is standing at the rear greeting
          guests as they head for their seats, together with Reverend
          Purdy as Congressman Kelly and his wife step forward.

          A REPORTER and his camera crew rush up to Kelly.

                          Congressman Kelly, what's your
                          reaction to Jeremy Tomlin's
                          statement indicating your office
                        as the source of leaked information
                        concerning Homeland Security?

                                        KELLY
                        What are you talking about?

                                        REPORTER
                        Tomlin just finished a press
                        conference in which he claimed to
                        have documentation and recordings
                        of your top aide passing security
                        documents.

                                        KELLY

                                        KELLY (CONT'D)
                                (grabs his wife)
                        Let's go!

          As Kelly fights his way back towards the cars.

          Purdy turns to see Janus standing from across the lawn. 
          Their eyes meet, as Janus raises his glass of champagne,
          then walks away.  Purdy has a sinking feeling, as the
          STRING QUARTET strikes up the WEDDING MARCH...



          Everyone is now seated.  Stillson stands at the front
          near Purdy, who is to conduct the ceremony. 

          Senator Ellis waits to accompany Miranda, who is not there
          yet.

          The STRING QUARTET finishes the wedding march.  A hush of
            anticipation falls over the crowd.

          Stillson waits in silence, stony-faced.

          Purdy waits.

          Ellis waits.

          Stillson glances at Purdy.  Purdy smiles patiently.

          Stillson glances back at Senator Ellis.

          A child cries, breaking the silence.  Is shushed.

          SUDDENLY someone does appear.  But it's not Miranda. 
          It's Kathleen.

                                        KATHLEEN
                        It's Miranda!  She's not breathing!

          The frozen tableau suddenly bursts into motion and sound. 
          Senator Ellis bolts for the house.

          Stillson and Purdy exchange a knowing look, as Stillson
          heads quickly for the main house.

          Crowd chatter: "What's going on?"  "What happened?"  "Where
          is she?"  "I hope she's all right."          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - ACT FOUR - 9/10/05 - YELLOW  54.



                                        PARAMEDIC (O.C.)
                        Make way, make way!

          As an EMT CREW rolls out of the mansion with a GURNEY. 
          Miranda, one paramedic giving her artificial respiration.

          Johnny and Bruce fight through the crowd,

                                        JOHNNY
                          Miranda!?  Let me through!

          As she's rolled past him, surrounded by paramedics, Johnny
          can just see her face as she passes...

          SLO-MOTION

          As he sees she's unconscious, but just as beautiful as
          he'd imagined.  He notices the one diamond earring.

          As he watches her being taken away, he hesitates, then
          comes face to face with,

          STILLSON

          They stand a few feet apart.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What did you do to her?

                                        STILLSON
                                (to several Security
                                Men)
                        This man is trespassing!

                                        JOHNNY
                        You sonofabitch!

          Johnny tries to get to him, but he's wrestled away by the
          Security Men as Stillson climbs into the ambulance with
          Miranda.  As it screams away with lights flashing and
          siren wailing,

          JOHNNY

          Wrestles free from the Men's control.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's cool!  We're leaving, just
                        back off!

          The guys move away, leaving Johnny and Bruce in the sea
          of stunned guests.

                                        JOHNNY

                        I'm fine!  Just give me a second!

          Johnny steps a few feet away to gather himself, then almost
          intuitively glances up,

          JOHNNY'S POV - UPPER WINDOW

          Janus stands in the window looking down.  Their eyes meet
          for one second, then the curtain draws shut.

          AS we CRANE UP on the scene, Johnny standing in the middle
          of the chaos staring up at a window with no one there.
