      A NEWS BROADCAST: 


      INT.  CAMERON GREY UNCHECKED  STUDIO

      Star reporter CAMERON GREY - 30s, handsome, emotional - 
      addresses camera.

                                    CAMERON GREY
                    ...the FBI says after spending 
                    years posing as ordinary Americans, 
                    the members of the terrorist 
                    sleeper cell became too fat to 
                    carry out their attack.


      INT. PRISON ROOM

      Just a plain room in a prison. Cameron interviews a VERY FAT 
      TERRORIST in a prison jumpsuit.

                                  FAT TERRORIST
                    When the day of vengeance came, we 
                    could no longer fit into our 
                    suicide vests.

      PULL OUT from this to reveal it is playing on a monitor in 
      front of--


      EXT. ONION NEWS NETWORK HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

      The front facade of a modern, metal building. Large monitors 
      show a live feed of Onion News Network. 

      SCOTT WEST (20s, handsome but a little nerdy, eager) stands 
      stock still on the New York sidewalk, staring at the monitor.  
      He takes a deep breath, and adjusts his tie. He s nervous. 

                                  SCOTT WEST
                          (to himself:)
                    OK. OK. 

      As he walks into the building, we tilt up to see it is a 
      massive skyscraper. We fly up to the top, and end on a 
      massive ONN logo with the New York skyline behind. 


      INT. CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

      A bustling, high tech control room with countless screens 
      playing the Cameron interview.                                                                                        2.


      Programming Director ED MUSGROVE (40s, balding, perpetually 
      harried) runs the room. ABIGAIL, Helena s assistant (20s, 
      bubbly, Indian) enters.

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Cameron s out in 30, Tom, give me a 
                    15 on the 20. Get the B deck double-
                    decked in CDE, ready the squab.

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Mr. Musgrove -- 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Not now.
                          (to technicians)
                    Get a 67 bump on the swabber, deck 
                    it up -- and swab it. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Sorry, sir. She wants to see you.


      INT. HELENA S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      ONN CEO HELENA ZWEIBEL (50s, tall, imposing) is on the phone.

                                  HELENA
                    Yes, exclusive coverage when the 
                    mine collapses. Tuesday is fine. 

      As Helena hangs up Abigail enters with Musgrove and hands her 
      boss a green drink and a mouse in a small cage. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Ed Musgrove for you, Ms. Zweibel. 
                    And here s lunch for both of you.

      ANGLE reveals a falcon in a cage in a corner of the room.

                                  HELENA
                    Thank you Abigail. Ed, what the 
                    hell is this?

      She indicates the monitor, where Cameron is speaking to the 
      same prisoner.

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Are you upset that we showed 
                    Muslims? I know the policy but --

                                  HELENA
                    I m upset because the ratings 
                    report came out this morning -- 
                    even CNN is gaining on us.                                                                                      3.


      She clicks a remote. The monitor shows ratings charts for a 
      million demographics. 

                                  HELENA (CONT D)
                    Look at these numbers: White males 
                    18 to 25, down. Lesbian baristas, 
                    down. Lonesome ranch hands, down. 
                    Even our market share of Unemployed 
                      half-Black half-Asian dentists is 
                    down. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    But--

      She motions to a portrait of her grim father ZWEIBEL holding 
      a skull and a globe, sitting on a  chair  made from an 
      African American and a Chinese man on their hands and knees. 

                                  HELENA
                    Ed, my father didn t build The 
                    Onion into one of the world s most 
                    powerful media, lumber, computer 
                    and music stand manufacturing 
                      conglomerates by accepting second 
                    best. I won t either.

      Helena goes to the cage and puts the mouse into the Falcon s 
      cage. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    I m sorry, Helena it s just -- 

                                  HELENA
                    Don t give me excuses, I get enough 
                    of those from my handicapped son.

      As Helena exits, the falcon dives onto the mouse, spattering 
      blood. Musgrove glances at this, then hurries after her. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    We did get you a missing girl 
                    story. 

                                                                        CUTAWAY TO:


      EXT. PARK/PLAYGROUND - DAY

      11-year-old COURTNEY CARTER is playing in the park. An ONN 
      van with a big logo pulls up, two guys hop out, grab 
      Courtney, and throw her in the van. 

                                                                            BACK TO:                                                                                      4.


      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) - SAME AS BEFORE

      Musgrove and Helena do a Sorkin-style walk-and-talk down a 
      staircase into the newsroom bullpen - the network s large, 
      open main work area, always bustling with countless staffers.

                                  HELENA
                    She s chubby.  No one cares about a 
                    fat missing girl. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                          (getting desperate:)
                    Well, we also have that special on 
                    the secret sex life of Jesus ...

      They pass segment producer JILLIAN CHASE (late 20s, pretty, 
      smart, overworked) who is giving notes to a couple editors.  
      Their computer screen shows a buff Jesus surrounded by babes. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Go in closer on his abs...
                          (she spots Musgrove:)
                    Oh Ed!
                          (over her shoulder:)
                    And make sure you can see His cock 
                    bulge.

      Helena and Musgrove pass a long wall of photos of ONN s 
      finest moments from early newsreel days up to present.

                                  MUSGROVE
                    ...and we re projecting very good 
                    numbers for America s Most Shocking 
                    Shark Shootings.

                                  HELENA
                    Get us a hit or I ll make your our 
                    news director in Latvia. You know 
                    what the number one hobby in Latvia 
                    is, Ed? Sadness. 

      Helena walks out the door, Jillian walks up.

                                  MUSGROVE
                    I ll get it done! 
                          (quietly:)
                    But it hurts that you didn t 
                    remember it s the anniversary of 
                    our second wedding.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Did you say something --?                                                                                       5.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    I was just talking to myself 
                    quietly about my feelings. What do 
                    you need? 

      He takes out a pill bottle and dry swallows a couple pills. 

                                    JILLIAN
                          (handing him papers:)
                    I ve got the copy for that story 
                    about the mall shooter who was shot 
                    by a second mall shooter.
                          (off pills:)
                    You okay, boss?

                                  MUSGROVE
                    I ve got numb-liver, Greg s 
                    Disease, recurring bat rabies, and 
                    only one lung. So no.  

      West enters at the top of the stairs, and looks over the 
      whole newsroom. He spots Musgrove.

                                  WEST
                    Ed Musgrove? I m Scott West, from 
                    WONN-5.

                                  MUSGROVE
                          (not interested:)
                    Oh right, the new reporter. You re 
                    the one who broke that story about 
                    the boy scout troop that fell down 
                    a well. 

                                                                      CUT AWAY TO:


      EXT. WELL - DAY (LOCAL NEWS BROADCAST, GREENSCREEN)

                                  WEST
                    ...three Eagle Scouts and seventeen 
                      tenderfoots tripped and fell into 
                    the open well as you can see here. 

      Computer animation: Boy scouts marching in single file. The 
      first one falls into the well, followed by the second, etc.

                                                                            BACK TO:

                                    JILLIAN
                    That was you? That story went 
                    national.                                                                                       6.


                                  WEST
                          (noticing her, attracted:)
                    Hi. I mean, yes. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Well, you re gonna have to do 
                    better than a couple dozen dead 
                    boyscouts if you wanna make it 
                    here.  Jillian, show him his desk.

                                    JILLIAN
                    I would but -- 

                                  MUSGROVE
                          (coughs pathetically)
                    Sorry, my one lung is weak today.

      Jillian relents, nods. Musgrove starts to walk away. 

                                  MUSGROVE (CONT D)
                    Thanks. Kid, be nice to Jillian.  
                    She s the glue in our weird sad 
                    collage around here. Plus, maybe 
                    you ll have a romantic connection -- 
                    just keep in mind any children you 
                    two may have will be property of 
                    the network. They ll work in the 
                    baby news division. 

                                                                      CUT AWAY TO:

      Footage of a hurricane destroying homes comes up behind him.

                    time? 

                                  WEST
                    Yes, I took a class.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Come on then.                                                                                      7.

                          (looking around, awed)
                    This place is amazing. Is that a DR-
                    88 over there?

                                    JILLIAN
                    It s a DR-90. Two more gigs of D. 
                    Stopped using 88s around here years 
                    ago.


      INT. NEWSROOM (STUDIO) - CONTINUOUS

      DAVID EVERETT (ONN s oldest and most respected anchor) is 
      just throwing to break. A PRODUCER stands just off camera.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    When we come back, NRA members in 
                      Washington today called on congress 
                    to give fetuses the right to carry 
                    guns. Stay with us.  

                                  PRODUCER
                    Back in 5, everyone! 

      Jillian hands something to the producer, West and Jillian 
      walk away. 

                                  WEST
                    That s David Everett! Cronkite and 
                    him are my biggest news idols.  I 
                    even did my thesis on his report 
                    about the glory hole in the Berlin

                    He s a total ego-maniac. He makes 
                    us keep a little person under his 
                    desk to hand him green tea whenever 
                    he s off camera. 

      As they walk out, we land on David and see a little hand come 
      up from beneath the desk and hand him an elegant teacup.


      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) - MOMENTS LATER

      West and Jillian walk through another part of the bullpen.                                                                                      8.


                                  WEST
                    So you re a reporter?

                                    JILLIAN
                          (hiding bitterness)
                    No, I m just a segment producer. I 
                    always wanted to be a reporter, but 
                    I failed the facial symmetry test. 
                    Only scored 97%. You probably 
                    already noticed my right eye is 
                      three-tenths of a nano-millimeter 
                    lower than my left. 

      They stop by an empty desk. Jillian points to her eye. 

                                  WEST
                    Oh it s not that bad--

                                    JILLIAN
                    I know I m hideous.

                                  WEST
                    My dad was a local reporter like 
                    me, but he always wanted to be a  
                    national anchor. One day, he was 
                    covering the unveiling of the 
                    world s largest ball of twine. A 
                    freak wind storm kicked up, the 
                    twine broke it s moorings -- I can 
                    still hear the sound it made in my 
                    head, like --

      West makes a high pitched, mournful noise. He takes a framed 
      picture out of his briefcase -- it s his father, in front of 
      a sign that says  World s Largest Ball Of Twine.  

                                  WEST (CONT D)
                    My dad got crushed to death under 
                    that twineball. But I worked hard, 
                    and today here I am -- so close to 
                    realizing his dream, my dream. The 
                    moral is: beware of freak wind 
                    storms, and never give up. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Staff meeting in five, kid.

      West leans against the wall, watches her go. He likes her. 


      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) - MINUTES LATER

      Musgrove strides in, claps.                                                                                       9.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    All right, everyone gather round!

      Everyone does. West and Jillian stand next to each other at 
      the edge of the crowd. West takes out a notebook and gets 
      ready to take notes. Jillian glances over and smiles, shaking 
      her head -- this kid is so na ve it s cute.

                                  MUSGROVE (CONT D)
                    People, let me get right to the 
                    point: In the past month we ve only 
                    had one story get above a six-point 
                    share and that s because it was a 
                    cable news trifecta: Sex, violence, 
                    and animals. I m referring, of 
                    course, to the bear mauling at the 
                    porn star charity car wash. No 
                    surprise, that story came from 
                    Cameron Grey.

      Smattering of applause. Cameron nods proudly.

                                    CAMERON
                    Three porn stars and a bear named 
                    Harvey died that day. They re the 
                    real heroes. 

                                    JILLIAN
                          (whispers to West, bitter)
                    I found that story.

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Folks, we need a hit. A story so 
                      entrancing that when the most 
                    moronic, ape-like member of our 
                    loyal viewing public sees it, he 
                    will put down his microwaved 
                    burrito, stop beating his 
                      illegitimate kid for two and a half 
                    minutes, and pay attention to the 
                    news. Now get to work and do not 
                    let me down and DO NOT LET DOWN OUR 
                    MINDLESS VIEWERS!

      Everyone returns to work, a buzz of excitement in the air. 
      Musgrove, wheezing from the speech, takes a hit from an 
      inhaler. West turns to Jillian. 

                                  WEST
                    I m going to get that story.

      Jillian shakes her head as West hurries off. Musgrove 
      approaches Jillian.                                                                                    10.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    Jillian!  I need someone to watch 
                    the girl we kidnapped. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    But I m already working on that 
                    story about the recall of baby 
                    strollers with ejector seats and I-- 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    I know I work you as hard as a 
                    mule, but you re the only one I 
                    trust with something this menial. 

                                    JILLIAN
                          (reluctantly:)
                    Fine. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    That s my little mule. And here s 
                    something for you: sugar cubes. 

      He holds out his hand to Jillian, she reluctantly takes the 
      sugar cubes. 

                                  MUSGROVE (CONT D)
                    Courtney! 

      Musgrove points to little Courtney, who is tied to an office 
      chair. Jillian sighs and starts to roll her away. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Okay, come on honey, I m very busy--

                                  COURTNEY
                    Don t call me honey, dickbag.


      INT. NEWSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      As Musgrove injects himself with some insulin, West trots up 
      to him. 

                                  WEST
                    Mr. Musgrove? I d like to pitch an 
                    important story: corruption in the 
                    Senate. If I disguise myself as a 
                    butler, I can get into one of those 
                      back-rooms where lobbyists--                                                                                    11.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    No, you re going down to south 
                    Jersey to interview a man who just 
                    turned 100 but still goes fishing 
                    every day.

                                  WEST
                    A fluff story? But sir, shouldn t I 
                    focus on a more important -- 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    New reporters get the old people 
                    stories, that s the system. Now get 
                    out there.


      INT. GIMMEE AWARDS CEREMONY BALLROOM 

      Cameron Grey is on stage accepting a Gimmee Award: The statue 
      is a human hand wrapped around a normal looking award statue. 

                                    CAMERON
                    There are no words to describe how 
                    honored I am by this award. Only a 
                    movement.

      He begins to do a slow yoga-like movement. 


      INT. DAVID S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

      David is watching this clip on a monitor. He presses pause. 
      David s office is a museum devoted to himself: Photos of 
      David with informational plaques adorn the walls, his 
      original microphone is displayed in a glass case, headphones   
      for an audio-tour hang beside the door, etc. 

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    I ve interviewed fourteen 
                      Presidents, the Pope, even Osama 
                    Bin Laden back when we liked him. 
                    And now you re telling me this 
                      snivelling hippie broke my streak? 

      David looks at a trophy display case: It has 14 Gimmee Awards 
      and an empty space marked  15.  

                                  DAVID EVERETT (CONT D)
                    Fourteen straight Gimmee Awards. 
                    That fifteenth should have been 
                    mine. Order must be restored at 
                    this network.                                                                                      12.


      Reveal he is talking to Abigail.  Abigail s earlier pleasant 
      demeanor is gone: she s cold and ruthless as a shark.

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Let s cut to the chase. You want 
                    dirt on Cameron Grey. 

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    I want to bring him to his knees 
                    and pour wet hot dirt all over his 
                    face.
                          (Abigail is grossed out)
                    Now I know you re technically 
                    Helena Zweibel s assistant, but 
                    I ve heard you also have certain 
                    ethical lapses I might find useful. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    I do. But if I help you, you re 
                    going to owe me a favor. Anything I 
                    want, whenever I ask.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Anything? What if you ask me to 
                    punch someone?

                                    ABIGAIL
                    You d have to do it.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    What if you want me to dress up as 
                    a woman of distinction?

                                    ABIGAIL
                    You d... have to do that too.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    What if you want me to dress as a 
                    woman of distinction, take a young 
                    male lover -- a professional 
                    dancer, perhaps, or an Olympic 
                    swimmer -- and then marry him and 
                    be happy for the rest of my life?

                      ABIGAILDAVID EVERETT
      Uh--Would I have to do that too?

                                    ABIGAIL
                    I guess so.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Then I accept, my little Shiva. Go 
                    forth and destroy.                                                                                    13.


      EXT. JERSEY DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

      West looks around as CAMERAMAN unloads gear from an ONN van. 

                                  WEST
                    The old man is supposed to meet us 
                    here. Let s get this over with.

      A couple kids run by screaming. A fisherman sits shaking, his 
      eyes open wide. West approaches him. 

                                  WEST (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, sir? I m looking for a 
                    very old fisherman -- Kip O Rourke?

      Before he can respond, ancient O'Rourke comes sprinting down 
      the dock toward West.

                                  O'ROURKE
                          (rapidly)
                    Oh wow! That s me! I m him! I m 
                    O Rourke! I m a man, I m a happy 
                    man! I m as happy as a snail all 
                    curled up in his tiny shell! I feel 
                    like I m sweating but I m not!


      EXT. RIVER, FISHING PIER - 20 MINUTES LATER

      O Rourke chatters away, walking very fast down the long pier 
      to his fishing spot. West and the Camera Man chase after him, 
      filming the  interview. 

                                  O'ROURKE
                    ...the time I caught a fifty 
                    pounder in the Gulf of Mexico back 
                    in  74 is anyone else s heart 
                    racing? 

      West looks around: a frog jumps out of the water over and 
      over again, hitting himself against the peer. He frowns, 
      trying to figure out what is going on. 

      West takes a few steps away and looks out at the rest of the 
      river. The animal behavior is getting crazier: an otter is 
      hitting his head with a clam; a duck jumps onto the pier and 
      honks. West jumps in surprise.  

      West peers through binoculars, scanning the shores.  He spots 
      a factory with a huge pipe pumping yellow liquid into the 
      water. West sees a  Bulls Milk Energy Drink  logo on the 
      building.                                                                                    14.

                    I need to work, Courtney. 

                                  COURTNEY
                    I bet you re so lonely.  I bet when 
                    you go on a roller-coaster, you 
                    don t even have anyone to go with. 

      Jillian looks at picture on her desk -- it s of her on a 
      roller coaster, alone. She turns the picture over. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    I don t need a boyfriend. I lead a 
                    very fulfilled life.

                                  COURTNEY
                    Fulfilled with microwaved Thai food 
                    and Real Housewives marathons?

                                    JILLIAN
                    I AM A HAPPY, ADULT LADY -- that s 
                    it, I m finding someone else to 
                    deal with you.                                                                                     15.


      INT. CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Jillian enters pulling Courtney in her chair and approaches 
      one TECHNICIAN.

                                    JILLIAN
                    JJ I need you to watch this girl we 
                      kidnapped.

                                  TECHNICIAN
                    I m kinda busy -- 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Remember that time I covered for 
                    you when you were on heroin?

      The graphics guy notices something over Jillian s shoulder. 

                                    DAYTIME ANCHOR (ON MONITOR)
                    ...two Americans were killed in the 
                    genocide. 

      In the lower-third graphic, the anchor s name has been 
      replaced: POOP BUTTPOOPER. Courtney giggles as she pecks at a 
      computer with her tied hands. Jillian grabs her. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Courtney!

      Technician shakes his head: No way. Jillian sighs.


      INT. NEWSROOM (STUDIO) - MOMENTS LATER

      Jillian whispers to a CAMERAMAN as Daytime Anchor delivers a 
      news story in the background.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Remember that time I covered for 
                    you when you were on heroin? 

      Courtney goes whizzing by behind Anchor, rolling in her 
      chair. 

                                    DAYTIME ANCHOR
                    And a controversial new law defines 
                    rape as anything Gary does to a 
                    woman. For more... 

      Cameraman shakes his head. Jillian looks desperate.                                                                                     16.


      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) - LATER

      Abigail sneakily opens a door marked  Cameron Grey s office. 
      Do not disturb the energies.  


      INT. CAMERON GREY S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      The floor is covered in grass and the walls are painted with 
      a blue sky and rolling hills, with trees around the edge -- a 
      totally surreal scene in the midst of the busy newsroom. In 
      one corner is a gigantic half completed statue of a strange 
      looking imaginary animal. In another is a small desk, a 
      microwave, and a dressing room mirror. 

      Abigail raises an eyebrow at the bizarre animal, then opens 
      the desk drawer and sees inside a dreamcatcher, a picture of 
      Cameron s massaging the Dali Lama and a tube labelled  Pec 
      Oil.  Nothing incriminating.  Suddenly she is startled by 
      noise outside.

      Cameron enters; Abigail is gone. Cameron picks up a box of 
      microwaveable  Steamy Salad.   He stares at the instructions. 
      Abigail watches them from behind the massive sculpture. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Vivian, can you come here for a 
                    second?

      Cameron s curvaceous black ASSISTANT enters.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                          (handing her box, quietly)
                    Can you read this for me?

                                  ASSISTANT
                    Sure honey. It says  Microwave for 
                    three minutes on high, then enjoy 
                    your steaming hot salad.  Here, 
                    I ll do it for you, babycakes. 

      She puts it into the microwave. Abigail looks intrigued.


      INT. ONN CONTROL ROOM / EXT. DOCKS - LATER

      Musgrove stares at monitor playing a live feed of ONN.

                                    DAYTIME ANCHOR (ON MONITOR)
                    Late in the hour, could dinosaurs

                    We ll show you lots of pictures of 
                      dinosaurs, and explain why it s not

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Take a breath kid. 

      Push in on a control room monitor where we see the broadcast:

                    But first: What would you do if you 
                    were 100 years old but still not 
                    dead? Scott West has the story...

      West stands in front of the plant, O'Rourke does push ups 
      vigorously behind him. 

                                  WEST
                    Thanks Alicia. What keeps a man of 
                    100 from settling into retirement? 
                    How about 60 million gallons of 
                    taurine being poured into his water

                    dumping thousands of excess gallons 
                    of energy drink into the river. You 
                    can see the disturbing effects for

      INT. DAVID S OFFICE - LATER

      We pull out on Scott s piece playing MOS on a monitor. In the 
      office, David is speaking to an INTERN who looks very bored.                                                                                    18.


                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    ... and though he was dead, I felt 
                    the urge to kiss my father on the 
                    lips. And so I did.

      Abigail enters.

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Busy?

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Just talking to my Listening

                          (to Intern)
                    You can stop listening now.

      Intern puts on big sound-cancelling headphones.

                                  DAVID EVERETT (CONT D)
                    Well, what did you find?

                                    ABIGAIL
                    I think Cameron Grey is illiterate.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Aha. That explains why his 
                      teleprompter is just pictures. 

                                                                        CUTAWAY TO:

      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) - SAME TIME

      Jillian pulls Courtney in her chair through the newsroom.

                                  COURTNEY
                    You want to be a reporter right? 
                    But you can t because of your eye?

                                    JILLIAN
                    Shut up Courtney -- wait, how do 
                    you know that?

                                  COURTNEY
                    I found your diary in your desk. 
                    Then I burnt it. 

      She holds up her tied hands to show she s holding a burnt 
      husk of diary.

                                    JILLIAN
                    How did you even-- What is wrong 
                    with you?

                                  COURTNEY
                    I blame society. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    I am going to be a reporter! But 
                    first I m going to beat you 
                    senseless with a ...
                          (grabs first thing she 
                            sees:)
                    Picture of an ugly man s family!

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Hey!

      Jillian raises the picture. Abigail closes the door to 
      David s office and sees Jillian brandishing the photo over 
      Courtney. Her eyes light up. 

                                  COURTNEY
                    Go ahead, child abuse me! 

      Jillian swings the picture down.  At the last second Abigail 
      grabs her arm. Abigail is back to her smiling self. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Wait, Jillian! Can I take this 
                    little scamp off your hands? 

                                    JILLIAN
                      Byeeeeeeeeee!                                                                                     20.


      Jillian practically runs away. Abigail drops the smile. 

                                  COURTNEY
                          (after Jillian:)
                    Oh sure, leave it up to the brown 
                    lady to take care of the little 
                    white child. Real original. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Listen, you may use insults to 
                    cover up your triple-XL 
                      insecurities, but it s not going to 
                    work on me -- I won the National 
                    Bullying Championships in High 
                    School. Now I need you to do 
                    something for me, and if you don t 
                    cooperate you ll be found at the 
                    bottom of a lake and we ll get 
                    three days of psychologists 
                      speculating about the motivations 
                    of your killers. Got it? 

      Courtney nods, totally quiet.


      EXT. ONION NEWS NETWORK HQ - DAY

      Scott walks up the building. The Graphics Guy we met earlier 
      walks by him and waves. 

                                  GRAPHICS GUY
                    Hey kid, your story s all over the 
                    place! 

      He points to a wall of TVs in front of him, where many 
      different channels are all covering the story. 

                                  GRAPHICS GUY (CONT D)
                    That was pretty ballsy.

                    balls. 

      The graphics guy looks a little weirded out. West walks into 
      the building. 


      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) 

      Scott walks through the bullpen, no one s making eye contact 
      with him. He sees Jillian, she looks worried.                                                                                     21.

                    I told you to interview a very old

      He points, and West sees that there is an entire wall of the 
      newsroom filled with Bull s Milk paraphernalia including a 
      large Bull s Milk fridge.

                    But our job is to report the truth--

      Musgrove slams his fists down on the desk, which we pull out 
      to reveal is a large Bull s Milk can. West is surprised. 
      Musgrove is now sweating profusely.  

                                  MUSGROVE
                    This job isn t about informing 
                    people, it s about making them 
                    think they re informed while 
                    selling them mufflers and cereal. 

                                  WEST
                    But back in the old days, Cronkite--                                                                                     22.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    Jesus, kid, Cronkite only covered 
                    the Cuban missile crisis to help 
                    Sears market their Anti-Radiation 
                      Umbrellas.

                                  WEST
                    I-- I didn t know that. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    You re so naive! You re hired!

                                  WEST
                    Really?

                                  MUSGROVE
                      I misspoke, you re fired. Get out. 


      ACT III


      INT. BULLPEN, WEST S DESK - LATER

      West boxes up several framed photos of himself from his one 
      day at ONN, all from scenes we already saw. Then he picks up 
      the photos of his dad, looks at it sadly. Jillian comes over.

                                  WEST
                    My father would be rolling over in 
                    his grave, except he can t cause 
                    that giant twine ball just crushed 
                    him flat as a pancake. 

                      JILLIANWEST
      Hey. (not listening:)
                                                  You d have to flip him, maybe 
                                                  with a spatula--

                                    JILLIAN
                    Hey! What happened to  never give 
                    up  and freak windstorms? 

                                  WEST
                    I was wrong, I thought I was going 
                    to rocket straight to the moon, 
                    like Apollo 11. Turns out I was 
                    more like the Challenger.

      He makes an exploding noise. Jillian grimaces. 

                                  WEST (CONT D)
                    Yeah I guess I didn t need the 
                    sound effect there.                                                                                     23.


      Jillian grabs his hand. Moment of eye-contact. ATTRACTION!

                                    JILLIAN
                    Look, you made one mistake. You 
                    know who else made one mistake. My 
                    mom. You know what came from that 
                    mistake: you re looking at her. 
                    Remember, the news isn t about 
                    facts. It s about telling people 
                    what to think. 

                                  WEST
                    But how?

                                    JILLIAN
                          (holds up paper:)
                    I already wrote up some copy. 

                                  WEST
                    Why are you helping me? 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Your first day is like a roller 
                    coaster, and no one should have to 
                    ride a roller coaster alone. 


      INT. CAMERON GREY S OFFICE - DAY

      Cameron is doing yoga shirtless.  Abigail, now perky and 
      flirty, enters with Courtney, who is untied, wearing 
      sunglasses and holding a cane. 

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Cameron? Sorry to interrupt.  This 
                    is Sandy.  She s a big fan of yours 
                    but she s blind.

                                  COURTNEY
                    I totally can t see anything. 

                                    CAMERON
                    How tragic. To be so young, yet so 
                    blind.

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Her biggest wish has always been to 
                    have you read her favorite book to 
                    her. You d do that for her, 
                    wouldn t you?  

                                    CAMERON
                    Uh, I d love to! I love to read.                                                                                     24.


      Abigail hands Cameron a kids book, calling his bluff.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Oh, right now? Oh no, that s my 
                    phone. 
                          (answers it:)
                    Hello, Hillary Clinton? Sorry 
                    Abigail, I have to take this.  

                                    ABIGAIL
                    That s not a phone.

      She grabs his  phone,  it s just a small stapler. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Ah. No wonder it got such bad 
                      reception. Well then, sure I ll 
                    read to you, little blind girl. 

      He takes the book and starts  reading  but is clearly 
      guessing based on the pictures.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Uh. Okay. So once upon a time there 
                    was a dog... Who had a hat on? And 
                    walked. No, danced? To... a store.

      Abigail takes a camera out of her pocket, subtly places it in 
      a strange Bonsai tree, and steps out of the room.


      INT. ONN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

      Jillian is running the control room. 

                                  DAVID (ON MONITOR)
                    ... at just 4.99, many are calling 
                    the Mcdonalds Veal Meal Deal a real 
                    steal. Moving on ...

      Musgrove walks in to watch her. She doesn t see him. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Okay, double deck Z and David, get 
                    ready to throw to Scott West. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Are you out of your mind? I fired 
                    him. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    He s got a good story. I promise.                                                                                     25.


                                  MUSGROVE
                    All right, Jillian, but if this 
                    goes bad I have to kill you. Can t 
                    fire you. You know too much.

                                  DAVID(ON MONITOR)
                    ... go to Scott West for an update 
                    on the Bull s Milk dumping story we 
                    heard about earlier today. 

                                    JILLIAN
                          (to Tech Director)
                    Go to 3, swabber it.
                          (into headset mic)
                    All right Scott. Ready?

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      INT. NEWSROOM (STUDIO, STAND UP POSITION)

                                  WEST (ON MONITOR)
                    Ready. And Jillian? Thanks.

                                    JILLIAN
                          (glancing at Musgrove:)
                    Don t thank me yet. Going to you in 
                    three, two, aaand ... swabber.  

                                  WEST
                    Thanks, Cameron. New information 
                    indicates the Bull s Milk 
                      contamination I reported on earlier 
                    may actually have benefited the 
                      community. Individual productivity 
                    has increased by 50%. 

      Bar graph shows Individual Productivity comparing 2011 and 
      2012:  Polkas Danced,   Houses Demolished ,  Bricks Eaten,  
      etc. Are all up.

                                  WEST (CONT D)
                    And the Bull s Milk is already 
                    reducing childhood obesity.


      EXT. DOCKS - DAY 

      Three kids run by screaming. 

                                  KID 
                    I can t feel my face!!!!                                                                                    26.


      INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Jillian is intense. Musgrove s expression gives nothing away.

                                    JILLIAN
                          (into mic)
                    Don t forget skateboarding, Scott.

              WEST (ON MONITOR)JILLIAN
      And scientists say the Bull s And drink...
      Milk -infused drinking water 
      also makes you an awesome 
      skateboarder.


      INT. STUDIO B- CONTINOUS 

      West chugs a whole can of Bull s Milk in one go. 

                                  WEST
                    Tasty. Scott West, Onion News 
                    Network.

                                    JILLIAN
                    And we re out.  We did it!  

                                  WEST
                          (dazed from Bull s Milk)
                    My eyes are dancing. 

      Jillian looks up for Musgrove s reaction, but he s gone. 


      EXT. SHADY PART OF TOWN - EVENING

      Abigail and Courtney stand outside an ONN van in a weird 
      alley. Abigail has a big contract in her hand.   

                                    ABIGAIL
                    ... you agree to tell the police 
                    that you were taken by an African-
                    American or a Latino - your choice. 
                    And that s it, you can be  found.  

                                  COURTNEY
                    I want all the royalties from any 
                    book or movie deals I make relating 
                    to this  kidnapping .

                                    ABIGAIL
                            (impressed:)
                    Fine, we can make that happen.

      Courtney nods, and signs the contract.                                                                                     27.


                                    ABIGAIL (CONT D)
                    You did good today, Courtney. I 
                    think you might have the lack of 
                    morals you need to make it in the 
                    news business. When you get a 
                    little older, you should come back 
                    and intern for us. 

                                  COURTNEY
                    Be an intern? You think I m fucking 
                    stupid? 

      Courtney runs off. Abigail smiles after her. 


      INT. CAMERON S OFFICE

      Cameron is shirtless, standing in front of the sculpture 
      working on it. David enters. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Namaste David.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Sorry, I don t speak Gay.

                                    CAMERON
                    I m just finishing this sculpture 
                    of my spirit animal.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Well I m about to make your spirit 
                    animal very sad.

      He shows Cameron a video on his phone. 

                                    CAMERON (IN VIDEO)
                    So then the pig got in the car -- 
                    (turns pages) -- and then there s 
                    lots of letters ... Oh, there s 
                    that one that looks the sign Zorro 
                    makes. OK all done.  

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    What s this?

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    Do I have to spell it out for you? 
                    Wait, that wouldn t help.

                                    CAMERON
                          (can t fight it:)
                    Look... I connect with people.

                                    CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    You don t have to know how to read 
                    to know how to feel.

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                          (chuckles:)
                    So you admit it.  You won t even be 
                    able to  anchor  a workout video if 
                    I decide to release this tape.

                    Fine. What do I have to do? 

                                  DAVID EVERETT
                    To start with, gimmee your Gimmee 
                    award. It ll be a symbol of how 
                    from now on, I own your rock hard 
                    ass. 

      He slaps David on the ass, grabs the award and leaves. One 
      arm of Cameron s spirit animal falls off.  


      ACT IV


      INT. NEWSROOM (BULLPEN) - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

      On a  Live Feed  monitor, we see an anchor talking next to a 
       Missing Fat Girl Found  lower third banner and a photo of 
      Courtney. West walks up to Jillian. He s very nervous. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    Scott, where have you been? 

                                  WEST
                    I ve just been riding the elevator 
                    up and down. Someone gave me a tip. 

      He shows her a dollar. 

                                  MUSGROVE (O.C.)
                    West?!!

                                    JILLIAN
                          (to West:)
                    Well, you re about to learn your 
                    fate. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    I was just in Helena Zweibel s 
                    office. She s been on the phone 
                    with the Bull s Milk people.   
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  MUSGROVE (CONT'D)
                      Apparently since your story aired, 
                    the mayors of ten cities have 
                    requested to have Bull s Milk 
                    pumped into their water supplies. 
                    Bull s Milk was so happy they sent 
                    you a real live bull. It s in your 
                    office. 

                                  WEST
                    I don t have an office. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Well, then there s just a bull in 
                    someone s office. 

                                  WEST
                    So does this mean -- ?

                                  MUSGROVE
                    You aren t fired, kid. I m a pretty 
                    tough old newsbird, but what you 
                    did today gave my tiny newsbird 
                    heart it s wings back. Where d you 
                    get the idea to spin the story 
                    positive?   

                                  WEST
                    You know it was actually ... 

      JILLIAN perks up, ready to be praised.

                                  WEST (CONT'D)
                    It just came to me. Because I m 
                    such a good journalist.

                                  MUSGROVE
                    And that s why I m sending you to 
                    Indiana: A tornado just hit a 
                    bullet factory there, hundreds are 
                    dead! Pack your bags, kid!   

      Musgrove walks off. West turns and sees JILLIAN watching. 
      She s genuinely hurt. 

                                  WEST
                    Jillian. I --

                                    JILLIAN
                    You re just like the rest of them.

      She strides off. West stares after her, ashamed. Then he 
      walks away, passing the Daytime Anchor who s frozen outside 
      her office. We see a bull inside pawing the ground (VFX).                                                                                      30.


      INT. HELENA S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Musgrove enters holding a paper. He looks around. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Helena--?

      WHAM! An arrow slams into the wall beside his head. Musgrove, 
      startled, turns: Helena holds a crossbow.

                                  HELENA
                    Oh it s you.  I was expecting 
                      assassins. I m having a 
                      disagreement with the Russians. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    That Bull s Milk story bumped us up 
                    to a six point five share. 

                                  HELENA
                      Congratulations Ed. 

      She holds out her arm, and the falcon lands on it. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    Thanks. And by the way...

                                  HELENA
                    Happy anniversary of our second 
                    wedding. 

                                  MUSGROVE
                    I thought you forgot.

      Helena walks towards him, falcon on arm. Music swells.

                                  HELENA
                    I should be able to forget you. 
                    I ve had hundred of thousands of 
                    lovers. I ve slept with Henry 
                      Kissenger, the god Thor, even Greg 
                    Kinnear. But somehow the only one 
                    who ever meant anything to me was 
                    you, Ed. Maybe it s your balding 
                    head or your medical ailments, but 
                    something about you pierced my 
                    armor, you sweaty beanbag chair of 
                    a man. 

      She kisses him, then pulls away. 

                                  HELENA (CONT D)
                    And for that I can never forgive 
                    you.                                                                                     31.


      She slaps him, then kisses him again, then slaps him.   

                                  HELENA (CONT D)
                    I d keep going with this, but I 
                    have a meeting and the falcon has a 
                    massage.

      The falcon CAWS loudly. She walks away. Musgrove rubs his 
      cheek, but smiles.  


      INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT

      Helena walks up to a door, a security device scans her elbow.

                                  COMPUTER VOICE
                    Elbow print recognized. Please 
                    enter, Ms. Zweibel. 

      We hear a DING. SHOT OF: a high tech elevator wooshing up a 
      shaft (VFX). 


      INT. TOP SECRET MEETING ROOM

      In the high tech, dimly lit meeting room, Helena s brothers 
      ERNEST, ARCHIBALD, and LUTHER ZWIEBEL sit around a circular 
      table, in front of them is a sign with the division of The 
      Onion he runs: Lumber (Ernest), Computers (Archibald), Music 
      Stands (Luther). Helena takes the empty seat, marked  Media.  
      On the walls are high tech maps of the world.   

                                  HELENA
                    So, it s a family reunion.

                                  ARCHIBALD
                    Greetings sister.

                                  HELENA
                    This better be important, I m 
                    supposed to be getting a Brazilian 
                    wax with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 

                                  ERNEST
                    We thought you called this meeting.

                                  HELENA
                    Me?

                                    ANCIENT VOICE
                    I called it.                                                                                    32.


      Everyone is startled. Suddenly the middle of the table opens 
      up: out of it rises an extremely complex life-support machine 
      holding the impossibly-ancient ZWEIBEL.

                                   HELENA
                    Father!

                                    ZWIEBEL
                    Good evening, my wriggling spawn. 
                    The time has come to discuss which 
                    of you shall inherit my empire. 
                    Because I m finally dying, thank 
                    merciful Christ. 

      He coughs wretchedly. Helena glances at her brothers, who are 
      glancing at her. Everyone keeps glancing at each other. The 
      competition is on.
