-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.
But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on
the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old
Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.
She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a
nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)
Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as
possible without moving. Might there be someone in the
room with her, looming over her?
She turns, ready for anything.
She is alone.
Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp
besides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the
room to a dressing table, sits down.
She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches
into a space beneath it and removes --
The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not
lost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it
as she absently returns the draw to its place --
A BOOMING knock on the door;
Elizabeth jumps up, startled
knocking over her chair.
SWANN (O.S.)
Elizabeth? Is everything all
right? Are you decent?
ELIZABETH
Yes -- yes.
She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as
Swann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid,
ESTRELLA, follows.
SWANN
Still abed at this hour?
It's a
beautiful day!
Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:
Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL,
built on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of the
harbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with
cannon.
SWANN (CONT'D)
I have a gift for you.
He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet
dress. She lets out an admiring gasp.
ELIZABETH
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire
as to the occasion?
SWANN
Is an occasion necessary for a father
to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened-
off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.
SWANN (CONT'D)
Although...I did think you could
wear it to the ceremony today.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)
Ceremony?
SWANN
Captain Norrington's promotion
ceremony.
Elizabeth peeks around the screen.
ELIZABETH
I knew it.
SWANN
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a
fine gentleman, don't you think?
(no answer)
He fancies you, you know.
Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.
SWANN (CONT'D)
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?
ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and
the medallion (still
around her neck) out of the way as the
maid cinches her
into a corset over her slip. Estrella
has her foot in
Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces
tight.
ELIZABETH
Difficult ... to say.
SWANN (O.S.)
I'm told that dress is the very latest
fashion in London.
ELIZABETH
(holding her breath)
Women in London must have learned to
not breath.
Estrella is finished.
Elizabeth takes a breath -- and
winces.
A butler appears in the doorway of the room.
BUTLER
Governor? A caller is here for
you.
The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer,
looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long
presentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on
the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.
SWANN
Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see
you again!
The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a
watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.
WILL
Good day, sir.
(holds out the case)
I have your order.
Swann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a
beautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out
reverently.
WILL (CONT'D)
WILL (CONT'D)
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the
handle. If I may -
He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one
finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.
WILL (CONT'D)
Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade..
SWANN
Impressive. .. very impressive.
Commodore Norrington will be pleased,
I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to
your master.
Will's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is
proud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword
around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.
WILL
(bows slightly)
I shall. A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated --
He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann -
Elizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be
painful to wear, but holy smokes!
SWANN
Elizabeth! You look stunning!
Will tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to
himself, and simply nods emphatically.
ELIZABETH
Will! It's so good to see you!
Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion
is hidden in the bodice of her dress).
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I dreamt about you last night.
Will reacts with surprise:
"Really?
SWANN
Elizabeth, this is hardly
appropriate -
ELIZABETH
(ignores her father)
About the day we met. Do you
remember?
WILL
I could never forget it, Miss
Swann.
ELIZABETH
Will, how many times must I ask
you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
WILL
At least once more, Miss Swann. As
always.
Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his
response.
SWANN
Well said! There's a boy who
understands propriety. Now, we must be
going.
Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and
strides past Will.
ELIZABETH
Good day, Mr. Turner.
Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around:
No windows. The forge is dark, lit
by lanterns. Work-in-
progress is scattered about: wagon
wheels, wrought iron
gates, pipes -- even a cannon with
a crack in it. But every
tool is in place; the workbench is
tidy and neat.
Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a
blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a
bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,
turns away.
Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled
sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing
coke furnace in the middle of the room.
Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the
chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack
sweats, grimaces at the pain -
Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an
anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on
the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,
plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam
billows.
Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath
the manacle -- but his hands are free.
The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.
Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the
drunken Mister Brown in the corner.
WILL
Right where I left you.
Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The
sledge lying beside the anvil.
WILL (CONT'D)
(under his breath)
Not where I left you.
He moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it --
but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps
back.
Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up,
toward the door. Will glares at him.
WILL (CONT' D)
(voice low and tight)
You're the one they're hunting.
The pirate.
Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then
frowns, regards Will.
JACK
You look familiar ... Have I ever
threatened you before?
WILL
I've made a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.
JACK
Ah. Then it would be a shame to
put a black mark on your record.
So if you'll excuse me ...
Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in
the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it
in hand.
JACK (CONT'D)
Do you think this is wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?
WILL
You threatened Miss Swann.
JACK
Only a little.
In response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack
appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.
Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading
feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost
impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
You know what you're doing, I'll
give you that ... Excellent form
... But how's your footwork? If I
step here -
He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the
other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.
JACK (CONT'D)
Very good! And if I step again,
you step again. . .
(continuing to step
around the circle)
And so we circle, circle, like
dogs we circle. . .
They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.
JACK (CONT'D)
Ta!
Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.
Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious
overhand motion, he throws his sword -
-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the
latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls
on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the
way.
Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it
is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he
turns back to Will, he's smiling.
JACK (CONT' D)
That's a good trick. Except, once
again, you are between me and the
way out.
(points his sword at the
back door)
And now you have no weapon.
Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an
anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward.
Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly,
Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at
Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.
Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming
him.
Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware
that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords,
knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.
JACK (CONT'D)
Who makes all these?
WILL
I do. And I practice with them. At
least three hours a day.
JACK
You need to find yourself a girl.
(Will sets his jaw)
Or maybe the reason you practice
three hours a day is you've found
one -- but can't get her?
A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with
anger.
WILL
No. I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate ... I
can kill him.
He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his
hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the
air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.
Jack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps
around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard
through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -
So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the
ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and
dodging around the furnace -
Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS
into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up,
kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.
Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the
ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second,
hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls
down, gets up -
Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.
Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit.
Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.
WILL (CONT'D)
You cheated.
JACK
(smiles; what do you expect?)
Pirate.
Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the
door.
JACK (CONT'D)
Move away.
WILL
No.
JACK
Move!
WILL
No. I can not just step aside and
let you escape.
Jack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off
lasts for a long moment.
JACK
You're lucky, boy -- this shot's
not meant for you.
Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack
-
Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's
skull. Jack crumples to the ground.
The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the
room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.
NORRINGTON
Excellent work, Mister Brown.
You've aided in the capture of a
dangerous fugitive.
BROWN
Just doing my civic duty.
Jack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.
NORRINGTON
I believe you will always remember
this as the day Captain Jack
Sparrow almost escaped.
Norrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go.
Brown looks at his bottle -- broken.
BROWN
That ratter broke my bottle.
A maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it
between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed.
ELIZABETH
Nice and toasty. Thank you,
Estrellia.
The maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins
reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around
her neck.
The lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn
it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black.
Will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron
ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops.
His attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter
and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing,
he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it
down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.
CLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his
mouth.
Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their
cell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a
bone. The dog just sits and cocks its head.
PRISONER
Come here, boy... Want a nice,
juicy bone?
In an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw.
JACK
You can keep doing that forever,
that dog's never going to move.
PRISONER
Excuse us if we ain't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.
Jack sits up. There are more BOOMS -
JACK
I know those guns!
He peers out through the bars of the window. The other
prisoners crowd around their window as well.
JACK (CONT'D)
It's the Black Pearl.
PRISONER
(frightened)
The Black Pearl? I've heard
stories ... she's been preying on
ships and settlements for near ten
years ... and never leaves any
survivors.
JACK
There are a lot of stories about
the Black Pearl.
Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of
his back. He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a
third. He picks up a second axe and a sword.
Will slides back the doors of the forge --
A woman runs past, chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a
yellow bandeau. Will backhands the axe square into his
chest, a deadly blow. Will heads out, up the street --
Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even
through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn
in the harbor. Shouts and cries of pain. Cannon fire
ECHOES.
She notices movement directly below her window: two SHADOWY
FIGURES, approaching the house -- pirates. Elizabeth bolts
from her room--
She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries
out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there
is the BOOM of a gun, and the butler crumples.
Elizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the
balusters. The pirates scan the foyer, searching. The
leader is PINTEL, a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head.
Suddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth.
How could he know she was there?
PINTEL
Up there!
The pirates rush for the stairs. Elizabeth scrambles back
into the nearest room--
Elizabeth shuts the door, locks it, listens as the pirates
pound up the stairs --
ESTRELLA
Miss Elizabeth?
Elizabeth jumps. Estrella is right behind her, terrified.
They whisper:
ESTRELLA (CONT'D)
Are they come to kidnap you, miss?
The daughter of the governor would
be very valuable.
Elizabeth realizes she's right. There is the SLAM of a body
against the door.
ELIZABETH
Listen, Estrella -- they haven't
seen you. Hide, and first chance,
run for the fort .
Estrella nods. Another SLAM at the door -- it gives a bit -
-
Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner, between a tall
wardrobe and the wall. Dashes for the side door.
When the door smashes inward, it slams into the wardrobe,
and the maid cannot be seen. The pirates run in -- spot the
open side door, and run for it --
Pintel is the first through, and gets the pan of the bed
warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back,
holding his nose --
Estrella breaks cover, runs for the hall, unnoticed.
-- Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate,
but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth can't jerk it
free, so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down,
BANGING the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head,
sizzling.
Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs -
The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the
stairs, but the second pirate vaults the handrail --
Estrella registers the butler's body, but continues out the
still-open front door at a dead run. Elizabeth follows --
The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front
door. His face is BURNED, his hair SMOLDERS -- he reaches -
-
Elizabeth pulls up short, runs the other way --
Pintel, on the stairs, grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth
doesn't slow -- she spins, grabs Pintel's arm with both
hands and pulls him hard, belly-first, into the cap of the
newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps
going
Elizabeth slams the double doors shut, throws the bolts.
The interior shutters are closed over the windows. Above
the fireplace are two crossed swords.
Elizabeth climbs on the firebox; she grabs one of the
swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it won't come free.
Both swords are securely attached to the wall. Damn!
A SMASH from the doors -- the pirates are relentless -
On the table is a platter with fruit, cheese and bread.
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter -
Like any bread knife, it has a round point. Elizabeth jabs
it into her palm -- it's useless as a weapon. Double damn!
The blade of a boarding axe breaches the door -- the
pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around -
The doors give way; the pirates charge through -
Empty. Elizabeth nowhere to be seen. Pintel and Smoldering
Pirate search, under the table, behind draperies.
PINTEL
We know you're here, poppet. Come
out and we promise we won't hurt
you.
Smoldering pirate gives him look -- he wants to hurt her
plenty. Pintel shakes his head: 'Don't worry, I'm lying.'
PINTEL (CONT'D)
We will find you, poppet ...
You've got something of ours, and
it calls to us!
Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box, wrapped around the
double pulley ropes that go through the center.
PINTEL (O.S.)
The gold calls to us!
Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion,
rubs
the gold with her thumb. This is their objective. Light
spills into the- box through gaps in the top as the door
above is slid open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps -
Pintel leers down at her.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
Hello, poppet.
Elizabeth works the ropes to lower
the box. Pintel pulls
the other way; he's stronger, and
the box rises. Elizabeth
tries to stop it -- wraps her left
forearm through the rope
and lets it jam against the top of
the box.
Elizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops. She saws at
the rope with the bread knife.
Smoldering pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's
forearm. Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing -
The rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS -
From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH, and a
cloud of dust. The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers
out. Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can
barely stand. She leans over the table, trying to recover.
The sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ...
ELIZABETH
Please, no ...
Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a
desperate idea occurs to her.
The pirates burst through the door. Elizabeth backs away,
holds the bread knife out to ward them off. They come
around either side of the table, stalking her -
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(gasps it out)
Par. .. Parlay!
Pintel can't believe his ears.
PINTEL
What?
ELIZABETH
Parlay! I invoke the right of
parlay! According to" the Code of
the Brethren, set down by the
pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,
you must take me to your Captain!
PINTEL
I know the code.
ELIZABETH
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm until the
parlay is complete.
PINTEL
It would appear, so do you.
SMOLDERING PIRATE
To blazes with the code!
He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him.
PINTEL
She wants to be taken to the
Captain, and she'll go without a
fuss.
He looks to Elizabeth: 'right?' Elizabeth nods.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
We must honor the code.
Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. He
grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm -
The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself
out from under rubble. Moonlight spills in through the
gaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom.
But it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's
cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.
PRISIONER
Praise be!
He and the other two scramble through.
PRISONER (CONT'D)
(back to Jack)
My sympathies, friend - - you've
no manner of luck at all!
The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.
Jack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits
shaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key
ring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks
up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog
forward.
JACK
It's all right, doggie ... come
here,
boy. Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido?
To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.
Jack continues to coax him closer.
The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the
dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He
BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining.
JACK (CONT'D)
What's the matter, boy?
The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out
through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him.
The door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates
step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG.
TWIGG
This isn't the armory.
He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack.
KOEHLER
(Dutch accent)
Well, well... Look what we have
here, Twigg. It's. Captain
Sparrow.
TWIGG
Huh. Last time I saw you, you were
all alone on a God-forsaken
island, shrinking into the
distance. I'd heard you'd gotten
off, but I didn't believe it.
KOEHLER
Did you sprout little wings and
flyaway?
TWIGG
His fortunes aren't improved much.
The two laugh. Jack doesn't. He steps forward, close to the
bars. This puts him in a spill of moonlight. He is tight
with fury.
JACK
Worry about your own fortunes. The
lowest circle of hell is reserved
for betrayers ... and mutineers.
Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that. Koehler lashes
out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars. Jack
clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down -
Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands
are skeletal.
Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm.
JACK (CONT' D)
You are cursed.
Koehler sneers, shoves Jack backwards, hard. Now out of the
moonlight, his hand is normal. Jack stares, realizing -
JACK (CONT'D)
The stories are true.
Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door. Looks back.
KOEHLER
You know nothing of hell.
And then they're gone.
Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls
out:
WILL
Miss Swann! Elizabeth!
A terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned
chair, fallen bookshelf -
Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe.
WILL
They've taken her! They've taken
Elizabeth!
A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette
among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it
drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a
chair.
NORRINGTON
We're aware of the situation.
WILL
We have to hunt them down -- and
save her!
Swann's worry has made him short-tempered.
SWANN
Where do you propose we start? If
you have any information that
concerns my daughter, then share
it! If anyone does, tell me!
(Will is silent)
Leave, Mr. Turner.
Murtogg has remembered something. He ventures it warily:
MURTOGG
That Jack Sparrow... he talked
about the Black Pearl.
MULLROY
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
MURTOGG
Still --
WILL
We can ask him where it is --
maybe he can lead us to it!
SWANN
That pirate tried to kill my
daughter. We could never trust a
word he said!
WILL
We could strike a bargain -
NORRINGTON
No. The pirates who invaded
this
fort left Sparrow locked in
his
cell. Ergo, he is not their
ally,
and therefore of no value.
(through with Will)
We will determine their most
likely course, and launch a
search
mission that sails with the
tide.
Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.
WILL
That's not good enough. This is
Elizabeth's life!
Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across
Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.
NORRINGTON
Mr. Turner, this is not the time
for rash actions.
(low)
Do not make the mistake of
thinking you are the only man here
who loves Elizabeth.
(firm)
Now, go home.
He opens the door, and then turns away. Will watches him
walk back to the desk. Will's face sets in resolve, and he
leaves.
Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. Even with
the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. He hears
the sound of the door latch -
The door opens, and Will slips in. Looks around. Jack
lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and
unconcerned. Will marches straight up to the bars.
WILL
Are you familiar with that ship?
The Black Pearl?
JACK
Somewhat.
WILL
Where does it make berth?
JACK
Surely you've heard the stories? The
Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla
de Mureta... an island that cannot be
found -- except by those who already
know where it is.
WILL
The ship's real enough. So its
anchorage must be a real place. Where
is it?
JACK
Why ask me?
WILL
Because you're a pirate.
JACK
And you want to turn pirate
yourself?
WILL
Never.
(beat)
They took Miss Swann.
JACK
(he was right)
So it is that you found a girl. Well,
if you're intending to brave all and
hasten to her rescue and so win fair
lady's heart, you'll have to do it
alone. I see no profit in it for me.
Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration. Jack
is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ... makes a
decision.
WILL
I can get you out of here.
JACK
How? The key's run off.
WILL
(examines the cell)
I helped build these cells. Those are
hook-and-ring hinges. The proper
application of strength, the door'll
lift free. Just calls for the right
lever and fulcrum. . .
Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will
is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.
JACK
Your name is Turner.
Will gives him a puzzled look.
WILL
Yes. Will Turner.
Jack grins.
JACK
Will Turner...
(he stands)
I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've
changed my mind. You spring me from
this cell, and on pain of death, I'll
you to the Black Pearl.
(sticks out his hand)
Do we have an accord?
Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good.
Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it.
WILL
Agreed.
JACK
Agreed!
Will looks around, figures out
what he needs. He makes a
chair his fulcrum, and levers
the long bench under the
door. Pushes down -- it's hard
work -- but the cell door
rises, and then falls forward,
CRASHING down on the bench
and chair.
Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.
WILL
Someone will have heard that.
Hurry.
Will heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards.
JACK
Not without my effects.
WILL
We need to go!
Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on
the belt, checks the shot in his pistol.
WILL (CONT'D)
Why are you bothering with that?
JACK
My business, Will. As for your business
-one question, or there's no use going.
(joins Will at the door)
This girl -- what does she mean to you?
How far are you willing to go to save
her?
WILL
(no hesitation)
I'd die for her.
JACK
Good.
Norrington's smaller ship quickly comes alongside the
slowmoving Dauntless. Its decks appear empty. Grappling
hooks are thrown, and sailors draw the two ships together.
Norrington's men swarm across.
NORRINGTON
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges!
PULL BACK, away from the
Dauntless, and past the railing of
the Interceptor, where a
single SENTRY stands watch -- and
we find a soaked Jack and
Will as they climb up over the
side of the smaller ship,
unseen.
Jack tackles the Sentry from behind, covers hi1rmouth.
JACK
Can you swim?
(the man struggles)
Can. You. Swim?
Jack removes his hand.
SENTRY
Of course, sir. Like a fish. I
grew up summers living in Dover,
with my uncle -
JACK
Good.
Jack lifts the man up, throws him overboard. Quickly unties
the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan
bars, raising the foresail -
Elizabeth stalks the cabin. Pintel enters, carrying a black
silk dress.
PINTEL
You'll be dining with the Captain,
and he requests you wear this.
ELIZABETH
Tell the captain that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.
PINTEL
(happy)
He said you say that! He also said if
that be the case, you'll be dining with
the crew, and you'll be naked.
Angry, Elizabeth holds out her hand. Pintel's grin fades.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
(hands it over)
Fine.
He exits, pouting. Elizabeth examines the dress -
Barbossa enters, followed by PIRATES carrying trays of
food, wine, table setting, etc. Elizabeth stands at the
small table in the dress -- lovely.
BARBOSSA
Maid or not, it fits you.
ELIZABETH
Dare I ask the fate of its previous
owner?
BARBOSSA
Now, none of that. Please dig in.
The table is set. Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of
meat, eats it daintily.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
No need to stand on ceremony, and no
call to impress anyone. You must be
hungry.
Elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to
eat like it. Barbossa watches her intently.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Try the wine.
Elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread,
devours it.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
And the apples -- one of those next.
She starts to bite into the apple -- stops. She is suddenly
aware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating.
ELIZABETH
It's poisoned!
She shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to
palm her knife. Barbossa LAUGHS.
BARBOSSA
Oh, there would be no sense in killing
you, Miss Turner.
ELIZABETH
Then why aren't you eating?
BARBOSSA
Would that I could.
He produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Do you not know what this is,
then?
ELIZABETH
It's a pirate medallion.
BARBOSSA
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de
Muerta .
Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despite
herself.
BARBOSSA (CONT 'D)
Ah, so you don't know as much as you
pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a
great bloody swath through the New
World, a high priest gave. him all the
gold they had, with one condition: that
he spare the people's lives. Of course,
Cortes being Cortes, he didn't.
(nods)
He'd've made a great pirate, that one.
Barbossa stands, moves to a shelf. Puts a key to a medium-
sized polished wooden box -- the Captain's chest. Opens it.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
So the priest, with his dying breath,
called on the power of the blood of his
people, and put on the gold a curse. If
anyone took so much as a single piece,
as he was compelled by greed, by greed
he would be consumed.
Inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and a
few pages of a Mayan CODEX, pieces of tree bark inscribed
with Mayan glyphs. Barbossa removes them carefully, sets
them on the table. Pours over them.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Within a day of leaving port for Spain,
the treasure ship carrying the gold ...
something went wrong. The ship run
aground, every man aboard dead, save
one. He survived long enough to hide
the gold ashore.
(beat)
Over time, the dark magic of the curse
seeped into the place, making it a
cursed island. An island of death. Isla
de Muerta.
He looks up. Elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story
-but feigns a dismissive attitude.
ELIZABETH
That's all very interesting, but I
hardly believe in ghost stories
any more.
Barbossa is angry. He stands, sweeps the food off the
table.
BARBOSSA
You idiot girl! It's no make-
believe! My crew and I, we found
the gold, and we did more than
take one piece, we took it all.
Rich men we were and we spent it
and traded it and gave it away in
exchange
for drink and food and pleasant company. But we found out:
the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashes
in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease
our torment.
(regains his composure)
We are cursed men, Miss Turner,
condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed. Gold
calls to UB, always, and we are driven, always, to find
more, and add it to the treasure.
Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex. Crushes them in his
fist.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
There is but one way to remove the
curse. All of the scattered pieces
of the treasure must be restored
in full, and the blood repaid.
(he throws the pages
aside)
We've recovered every piece --
save for this.
(holds up the medallion)
And as for the blood ... that's
what we have you for.
(pleasant, finally
getting to his point)
And that's why there's no sense in
killing you. Yet.
Elizabeth stares at him, horrified. Using the toe of his
boot, Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it,
extends it to Elizabeth.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Apple?
Elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple -- and then comes up
out of her chair, trying to run around Barbossa_ They
struggle briefly, and then suddenly he shoves her away-
Elizabeth's stolen KNIFE is buried in Barbossa's chest, to
the hilt --
Barbossa is completely unaffected. He opens his shirt to
get a better look at the knife, pulls it out with little
effort. There is BLOOD on the blade, but none anywhere
else.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
I'm curious -- after killing me,
what is it you were planning to do
next?
Elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door -
Elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin,
terrified.
Will sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk
...
JACK
For a man whose made an industry
of avoiding boats, you're a quick
study.
WILL
I worked passage
from England as a
cabin boy.
(an attempt
at guile)
After my mother
passed, I came out
here ... looking
for my father.
JACK
Is that so?
WILL
My father. William Turner?
Jack says nothing. Will has lost the patience for guile.
WILL ( CONT ' D)
I'm not a simpleton. At the jail -
- it was only after you learned my
name that you agreed to help.
(a smile)
Since that's what I wanted, I
didn't press the matter. But now -
{an accusation}
You knew my father.
Jack considers his reply -- settles on 'truth.'
JACK
I knew him. Probably one of the
few who knew him as William
Turner. Most everyone just called
him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
WILL
'Bootstrap?'
JACK
Good man. Good pirate. And clever
-"- I never met anyone with as
clever a mind and hands as him.
When you were puzzling out that
cell door, it was like seeing his
twin.
WILL
(angry)
That's not true.
JACK
I swear, you look just like him.
WILL
It's not true that my father was a
pirate.
JACK
Figured you wouldn't want to hear
it.
WILL
He was a merchant marine! He was a
respectable man who obeyed the
law, and followed the rules--
JACK
(laughs)
You think your father is the only
man who ever lived the Glasgow
life, telling folk one thing, and
then going off to do another?
There's quite a few who come here,
hoping to amass enough swag to
ease the burdens of respectable
life. And they're all 'merchant
marines.'
WILL
My father did not think of my
mother -his family -- as a burden.
JACK
Sure -- because he could always go
pirating.
WILL
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Will's sword is out, levelled at Jack. Jack gives him a
disbelieving look, sighs.
JACK
Put it away, Will. It's not worth
getting beat again.
WILL
You didn't beat me. You ignored
the rules of engagement. In a fair
fight, I'd kill you.
JACK
Then that's not much incentive for
me to fight fair, is it?
He kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and
slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His
sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles above the water.
Jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the
course. Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it.
Will hand-over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the
boom.
JACK ( CONT ' D)
As long as you're just hanging
there, pay attention. Must,
Should, do, don't, shall, shall
not -- those are just suggestions.
There are only two absolute rules.
(ticks them off on his
fingers)
JACK (CONT'D)
What a man can do. And what a man
can I t do.
Will looks away, not interested.
JACK (CONT'D)
For instance: you can accept that
your father was a pirate and still
a good man... or you can't. Now
me, I can sail this ship to
Tortuga, by myself. . .
(Will looks alarmed)
But I can't just let you drown.
Jack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack
holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at
Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him
coolly.
Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down,
and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk
...
Jack breathes silent sigh of relief. Notices his hand is
shaking -- he takes the wheel.
WILL
Tortuga?
JACK
Oh -- did I forget to mention
that?
Jack closes the door on the woman, joins Will. They take in
the place -- it is populated with a slightly higher class
of scum. Jack spots a BARTENDER, smiles, moves forward -
--and is suddenly DECKED by a waitress. This is ANAMARIA,
tall, strong, tough; she didn't spill a drink off her tray.
ANAMARIA
You stole my boat.
JACK
AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I
need to put together -
She SLAPS him again. Will shakes his head, heads for the
bar. Jack gets up.
JACK (CONT'D)
Borrowed. Borrowed your boat.
(off her look)
Without permission.
AnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between
them. She chases him around the table, still carrying the
tray.
ANAMARIA
My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is
it?
JACK
Safe! At Port Royal. With the
Royal Navy.
ANAMARIA
That boat is my livelihood!
JACK
You'll get it back. Or one better.
ANAMARIA
(a threat)
I will.
Away from them, a PATRON calls for his food. AnaMaria
scowls at Jack, moves away -- comes back for. one more
SLAP!
WILL
Jack! Over here!
AT THE BAR, Will has spoken to the Bartender. Jack arrives,
rubbing his chin.
WILL (CONT'D)
He knows Gibbs.
The Bartender nods 'yes.' Then nods 'out back.' Then
produces a water bucket from behind the bar.
Jack and Will exchange a look,-and Jack takes the bucket.
Jack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single
candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices. Will is
away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look-
out.
A tankard is set down. Gibbs lifts it to take a swig -
JACK
Just the one.
Gibbs pauses. He takes a dainty sip.
GIBBS
Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the
nature of this venture of yours?
JACK
First -- have you found me a crew?
GIBBS
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack.
Most of the decent pirates in town
won't sail with you -- seem to
think you're a jinx.
JACK
Now where, I wonder, would they
have gotten that idea?
Gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip. Jack leans
forward. Gibbs leans forward.
JACK (CONT'D)
I'm going after the Black Pearl.
Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. He
reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it
back down. He leans forwards again. Jack has not moved.
GIBBS
Say again?
JACK
Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I
know where its going to be, and
I'm going to take it.
GIBBS
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've
heard the tales they tell about
the Pearl.
JACK
Aye, and that's why I know where it's
going to be, and that's why I know what
Barbossa is up to. All I need is a
crew.
GIBBS
(shakes his head)
A fool's errand.
JACK
Not if the fool has something
Barbossa wants. Something he
needs.
GIBBS
And you've got that, have you?
ANGLE ON: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his
eyes' -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor
away from the table.
JACK
Back there, guarding the door is
the son of old Bootstrap Bill
Turner.
Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers at
Will. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones.
GIBBS
Well, lookee there. I'll allow you
may be onto something, Jack.
(considers, nods)
There's bound to be sailors on
this rock crazy as you. I'll find
some men.
Gibbs downs the drink, SLAMS the tankard on the table.
Will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger,
kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who
moves.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
JACK
That he is.
A FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder. The canvas
of every sail is stretched taut. The ship rocks as it drops
into the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side.
On board, the new crew members scurry about their tasks,
pulling lines and trimming sails. Excellent sailors, it
takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat.
AnaMaria is at the helm. Gibbs staggers along the deck.
GIBBS
That fool will have us lose the
canvas, and the masts besides!
On Jack, a ROARING wind blowing back his hair, eyes intent
on their course. Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
Werd best drop canvas, sirl
JACK
She can hold a bit longer.
The wind picks up, howling. Jack smiles.
GIBBS
(shouts)
What's in your head to put you in such
a fine mood?
JACK
(shouts)
We're catching up!
Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself. Gibbs stares
at him like he's a crazy man.'
The sound of RAIN pounds down on the deck above - - then
suddenly stops. Elizabeth moves to the stern windows, looks
out at the rolling sea below -- no escape there.
She hears the sound of a VQICE calling, gazes up, wondering
-
CLOSE ON: Jack's compass, cradled in both hands. Jack leans
over and studies it -- almost like he's praying.
ON THE COMPASS -- the face shows old-fashioned rose petal
style direction markers below a quivering indicator that
settles on -- southeast.
JACK
Bear three points starboard.
AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. The ship leans
into the new direction. Jack looks down -
ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins, reverses,
settles on -- northeast.
JACK (CONT'D)
Six points port!
AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel
back, and the ship responds.
Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack
and AnaMaria, clearly not happy. Gibbs hobbles up.
GIBBS
Left handed-ropes are coiled against
the sun, or it's bad luck!
(twirls a finger)
Anty-clockwise.
Gibbs takes over the task. The ship shifts course again.
Will has had enough.
WILL
How do we expect to find an island no
one can find -- with a compass that
doesn't work?
GIBBS
Now, lad, just because it don't point
north don't mean it don't work.
(voice low)
That compass gives bearings to the Isla
de Muerta, wherever it may lie.
WILL
Really?
(moves closer)
So ... what's the story on the
pistol?
Gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener.
GIBBS
I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow
has an honest streak in him, and
that's where the whole problem
starts. This was when he was
Captain of the Black Pearl -
WILL
What? He never told me that.
GIBBS
Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things
more close to the vest. See, Jack was a
cartographer, back in Old England.
Somehow I he came by the money to
commission the Pearl. Hired himself a
crew, promised each man an equal share.
(lowers his voice)
So, they're forty days out, and the
First Mate says, everything's an equal
share, that should mean the location of
the island, too. So Jack gave up the
bearings.
(shakes his head)
That night, there was mutiny.
Gibbs voice is a whisper, now, so Will has to lean closer.
GIBBS (CONT'D)
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of
his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on
an island, left there to die.
WILL
How did he get off the island?
JACK
(loud)
I didn't!
Will and Gibbs jump. Jack is right there beside them.
JACK (CONT'D)
My body's still there, rotting
away, and I am but a ghost!
Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. Jack
laughs.
GIBBS
How did you get off the island?
JACK
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant
tale, best left untold.
He starts off.
WILL
Wait -- what about the pistol?
JACK
The pistol. When a pirate is marooned,
Will, he's given a pistol with a single
shot. No good for hunting, or
surviving, really. But after three
weeks of starvation and thirst -- the
option of that pistol begins to look
good.
Jack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it.
JACK (CONT'D)
But I survived. And I still have
that single shot. It's meant for
one man. My mutinous first mate -
WILL
Barbossa.
Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away.
CAVES
- NIGHT
The group keeps together under the firelight. The path
leads between boulders on a slope downhill. From the echoes
and shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge.
Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off
to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins.
Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness.
Twigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away from
the group. Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm.
BARBOSSA
Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd
die and miss Judgement Day -- for not
even the Lord himself'll come look for
you here.
Barbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twisting
and turning, but always down -
Cotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something. He
lifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along the
back.
COTTON'S PARROT
Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND
ho!
Indeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the
distance on the port side. Will stands, excited, jumps onto
the rigging for a better look.
But AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and the
parrot.
ANAMARIA
How does he do that?
JACK
They'll be anchored on the lee side.
Haul your wind, and keep to the weather
of the island -
Flickering torchlight. Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern
-
-- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de
Muerta: overflowing ,chests of coins, gold and silver
ingots, jewelry, objects d' art, jade and ivory, brightly
colored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors and
swords -anything and everything of value that might be
carried by ship, is here.
The pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze in
wonder.
ELIZABETH
The curse drove you to gather
this?
BARBOSSA (O.S.)
Aye. And not a bit of it any use
to us, only hoarded. But it will
drive us no longer.
Elizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted
mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates.
-- the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short
waterfall ... but then lands safely in a gorgeous
underwater lagoon, floats lazily toward a sandy shore.
JACK
Chalk one up for the stories.
Will leaps out into the water, pulls the boat ashore -
The pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of
mostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed -
-- and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, also
crammed with treasure, including several mountains of gold
coins that reach the ceiling. Treasure everywhere -
Except for one spot in the center. A hole in the ceiling
lets in a column of moonlight, which illumines:
A stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved Aztec
glyphs, filled with gold coins identical to Will's
medallion. A sharp stone knife lies on top.
In front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton -- and
this one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again,
judging by the sword in its back. A crab scurries away from
it as the group approaches.
BARBOSSA
Here we stand before the cursed
treasure of Cortez himself. Won by
blood, it demands blood in return.
All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth. Pintle takes the stone
knife from the chest, approaches her. Elizabeth shrinks
back, but is held by two other pirates.
Pintel grins. Grabs her by the wrist. She turns her head
away, shuts her eyes.
Pintle raises the knife ...
... and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharp
tip of the knife to just prick! Elizabeth's finger.
One tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto the
medallion.
Elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised.
PINTEL
What did you expect? We're all
gentlemen here, right and proper.
The pirates laugh. Barbossa takes the medallion, grins at
Elizabeth.
BARBOSSA
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?
(grins)
Eat a whole bushel of apples.
Barbossa approaches the chest, shining in the beam of
moonlight.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
What was begun by blood, let blood
now end!
He tosses the gold medallion onto the others.
The pirates tense, waiting, expectant. A long beat. They
all look at each other, look at themselves. Nothing
happens.
KOEHLER
Did it work?
DEADEYE
I don't feel no different.
JACOBY
How do we tell?
Barbossa frowns, draws his pistol, and SHOOTS the pirate
next to him -- Jacoby -- square in the chest. Jacoby reacts
in shock, grabs his chest ... but doesn't die.
KOEHLER
You're not dead.
JACOBY
No.
(realizes)
He shot me!
TWIGG
It didn't work! The curse is still
upon us!
Barbossa searches his mind for an answer ... turns to
Elizabeth.
BARBOSSA
You. Maid. Your father. What was
his name?!
(grabs her roughly)
Was your father William Turner?!
Elizabeth takes time to smile before answering:
ELIZABETH
No.
The pirates cry out in alarm. Barbossa gathers himself,
getting his rage under steely control.
BARBOSSA
Where's his child? The child that
sailed from England eight years
ago, the child who is the real
owner of that medallion, the child
in whose veins flows the blood of
William Turner?! Where?
Barbossa SLAPS her hard across the face, sending her
sprawling.
JACOBY
(to Pintel)
You brought us the wrong person!
PINTEL
She had the medallion! She's the
right age. She said her name was
Turner!
TWIGG
(to Barbossa)
You brought us here for nothing?
Barbossa whirls on him --
BARBOSSA
If you had sailed with Morgan for
ten years like I have, you'd know
not to question me!
Elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment
unnoticed. Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above
her.
Startled, Elizabeth looks up --
-- Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down
with his scabbard for her to grab onto.
Elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied
medallion from the pile. Reaches back, grabs the scabbard.
Will pulls her up -
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
If any coward here dare challenge
me, let him speak! Any more talk,
I'll chain ye to a cannon and send
ye to the watery depths!
A sound catches his attention -- coins falling. He looks
up, sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure
stack.
ATOP THE STACK, Will grabs a large shield, flings them
forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the
far side, slide through a small opening -
Behind them, loose coins from their slide come down in an
avalanche, sealing the entrance.
Elizabeth jumps up, silver platter in hand, ready to swing
-Jack catches her before she can do any damage. They
recognize each other.
ELIZABETH
You?!
JACK
Me!
ELIZABETH
You're in league with Barbossa!
JACK
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Elizabeth can't comprehend that one.
ELIZABETH
You?!
Will gains his footing in the rubble.
WILL
Miss Swann! We're here to rescue
you!
(sounds of pursuit,
approaching)
It's going badly!
JACK
This way!
They race off, toward a bit of moonlight -
At full sail, headed out to sea. Gibbs glances at Elizabeth
and Will, talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his
head.
GIBBS
Two women on board? A man don't have to
be superstitious to know that's
trouble.
Elizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale:
ELIZABETH
... you were in danger ... so I took
the medallion. And I've kept it ever
since. They thought I was you, that
they needed my blood. And it didn't
work.
She hands him the medallion.
WILL
Why would my father send this to me?
ELIZABETH
To keep it away from them? No pirate
would sail to London, for fear of
Execution Dock.
WILL
If I had known-
ELIZABETH
(anticipating him)
-- then we never would have met.
Will nods. They hold each other's gaze a moment. Will turns
away first, leans on the rail. Looks out to sea, back the
direction they came.
WILL
I can't believe he would make such
a sacrifice for us.
ELIZABETH
I guess you can never truly know
someone else's heart.
Will glances at her, and nods.
AT THE HELM, Gibbs peers forward, scanning the horizon.
There
is a tiny island in front of them.
GIBBS
Shift your heading, steer clear of that
island. Fifteen degrees starboard.
On the aft deck, Cotton concentrates on his work, securing
a halyard. Suddenly Cotton's parrot flaps its wings, takes
off, lands on the starboard bulwark, squawking -
COTTON'S PARROT
Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell
NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!
Cotton looks up - on the horizon, following: black sails.
Gibbs and AnaMaria appear, and see the ship.
ANAMARIA
Can we outrun them?
GIBBS
Not a chance. Make for the reef.
The Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and
the Interceptor is headed for the island.
GIBBS
Drop the forward anchor!
A SAILOR at the stern of the ship pulls a release, and the
ship's anchor races down into the water, the metal chain
jumping and twisting on deck.
The chain stops, and the Sailor locks it -
Jack sees what he can out the porthole. In the cell with
him is Twigg, acting as a guard.
JACK
Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill
the lying scoundrel -
(to Twigg)
I'm a little conflicted, here.
Twigg just stares.
Elizabeth watches
as the Black Pearl comes about -- and
then there is the
low, loud RUMBLE of two dozen cannons
firing as one. The
Interceptor is hit. A barrage of shots
follow; most find
their mark.
Sailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they
are overmatched.
Another round of fire; Barbossa shows no mercy.
ANAMARIA
Looks like they mean to send us under.
GIBBS
There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger,
upside down.
AnaMaria, Gibbs, Cotton, even Elizabeth -- all know what
this means. Will doesn't. He looks to Gibbs for an
explanation:
GIBBS (CONT 'D)
It's a signal. If we resist, it won't
just be death. There'll be torture as
well.
WILL
We're not going to just surrender!
GIBBS That we are.
The Black Pearl fires again, a double-ball shot with a
chain connecting the two. It hits the main mast dead ani a
CRACKING, SPLINTING sound as it breaks, falls to the deck.
Barbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board.
WILL
We can at least fight -- we might
be able to kill a few-
GIBBS
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for
Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Will stares -- and nods. But his expression is still
defiant.
The deck slants; the ship is sinking. pirates swarm across
on ropes, and take control of the Interceptor.
Pintel enters the cell. It appears empty -- but that's
because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove
up the ceiling planks with his legs.
PINTEL
That ain't going to work. That's the
gun deck above yea
Will drops lightly to the deck. Suddenly:
WILL
What happened to William Turner?
PINTEL
Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He
threw in with us after we relieved Jack
Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned
out, it never sat well with him-
particularly after we found Cortes'
treasure, and its peculiar condition.
He thought we deserved to be cursed,
for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we
did. That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure -- to you, as it were: so
it would never be recovered, and so
cursed we_ remain.
WILL
And then he ran. And he's hiding out
someplace where you haven't been able
to find him.
PINTEL
That's a nice thought, to be sure, and
I wager your da wishes he'd thought it
hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done,
_ didn't sit too well with Captain
Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to
his legs and dumped him over.
Will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate.
PINTEL (CONT'D)
Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill,
was his face looking up, as he
sank down to the crushing black
oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.
(sighs)
It was only after, we found out we
needed his blood to solve the curse.
That's what you call ironic.
Barbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several other
pirates. He regards Will for a moment, then:
BARBOSSA
Bring him.
The pirate group moves deeper into the caves. Will moves
along unwillingly.
PINTEL
No reason to fret. It's just a prick of
the finger and a few drops of blood.
BARBOSSA
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in
his veins.
(grins)
Best play it safe, and spill it all.
PINTEL
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Lit by torchlight. Will notices: a crack runs between the
floor and the wall of the cave, widening into a ravine.
BARBOSSA
Careful, now. You could fall in and
still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.
Will makes a decision. He intentionally stumbles. Pintel
shoves him forward -- Will continues forward, grabs the
pirate in front of him, swings him into the wall of the
cave. Catches the pirate's torch, and uses it to ward off
the others.
WILL
You deserve to be cursed -- and
remain cursed!
He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine. The wall
of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope; Will hits it,
and tumbles down, disappears into black.
BARBOSSA
Blast him! A pox on him, and his
father, and the whole damnable
line! Fan out! Find him!
Elizabeth looks out the Captain's small porthole -- sees
boats laden with Navy men headed for shore.
She turns away from the porthole, wishing there was
something she could do. Suddenly there is a flutter at the
window--
Cotton's parrot is there.
COTTON'S PARROT
Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me
hearties yo ho!
The bird flutters off; Elizabeth races to the porthole, and
then to the stern window to see it flyaway.
She looks down -- and there, fastened to the stern of the
ship, is a small rowboat.
Will races forward, turning this way and that. He sees a
light ahead, heads for it, turns a corner -
-- and runs straight into Jack.
JACK
Do you have any idea where you're
going?
WILL
Jack!
JACK
Don't talk. These caves magnify
sound. Just follow me.
Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops,
staring. Will is a few steps behind.
WILL
Are you certain this is the right way?
JACK
It's the right way.
Will join him -- and see what Jack is staring at:
Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly
endless. At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the
stone Aztec chest.
BARBOSSA
Thank you, Jack Sparrow.
The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked
by his men. The trio whirl to run - - more pirates emerge
from hiding. Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is
there.
The pirates grab Will and Jack. Will struggles, but Jack
does not fight at all.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
You couldn't have led him back
more directly if you knew exactly
where you were going.
He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest. The pirates
follow, dragging Will and Jack with them.
WILL
You did know where you were going!
You did lead us directly to them!
(Jack's silence confirms it)
Why?
Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest.
Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the
moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck.
He picks up the stone knife.
BARBOSSA
What was begun by blood, let blood now
end!
He raises the knife to Will's throat -
JACK
You don't want to be doing that.
Barbossa pretends to think about his words.
BARBOSSA
No, I really think I do.
JACK
(shrugs)
All right then.
That makes Barbossa pause. He steps out of the moonlight.
BARBOSSA
Why don't I want to do this?
JACK
Because, right about now, the H.M.S.
Dauntless is lying in wait in the
harbor.
WILL
Jack!
JACK
- - and its guns and crew will cut you
and your men to pieces the moment you
step outside these caves.
A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates.
PINTEL
Do you believe him?
BARBOSSA
No.
(indicates Will)
But him I believe. He is genuinely
angry.
JACK
You've no hope of surviving
Norrington's attack ... that is, if
you're mortal.
BARBOSSA
What're you suggesting?
Jack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward
Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins.
JACK
Simple. Don't kill the boy yet.
Wait for a more opportune moment.
Will glares, listening to every word he says. Jack scoops
up a handful of coins from the chest.
JACK (CONT'D)
(drops the coins one-by-
one back into the chest)
Like after you've killed... Every...
Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
BARBOSSA
I can't help wondering, Jack, why
you're being so helpful and all? Last
time you did that, it didn't end 80
well for you.
JACK
The situation has changed.
BARBOSSA
That so?
JACK
Aye. See, after you're done with the
Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a
problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There
you'll be, with two lovely ships on
your hands, and what to do? Of course
you'll decide you deserve the bigger
one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless
a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it,
you can rule the seas.
(beat)
But if you're Captain of the Dauntless,
who's left for the Black Pearl?
Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me.
JACK (CONT'D)
I sail for you as part of your fleet, I
give you fifteen percent of my plunder,
and you get to introduce yourself at
tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore
Barbossa.'
(sticks out his hand)
Do we have an accord?
Barbossa licks his lips. It's tempting ...
JACK (CONT'D)
Now, you can take care of the
Dauntless, right?
BARBOSSA
Men! Are you up for it?
The pirates yell to the affirmative.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Mr. Pintel, select five men to
stay here. Take the rest of the
men out ... not through the caves.
Jack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for.
JACK
There's ... another exit?
BARBOSSA
Aye, for us there is.
Will, guarded by pirates, glares at Jack.
WILL
You've been planning this from the
beginning. Since you learned my name.
Jack takes the opportunity to move toward him.
JACK
Oh, please -- do I really seem that
clever?
Before Will can answer, Jack smoothly slips the sword from
a Pirate's scabbard -- tosses it to Will, who catches it
despite his surprise.
JACK (CONT'D)
Use it well.
He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate. Barbossa
and the other pirates stare in shock -
BARBOSSA
Confound it, Jack -- I was
actually beginning to like you!
Swords are drawn, and the Pirates attack.
Jack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own
style: Will parries, glissades and disarms with lightning
fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists,
acrobatics and anything within reach to survive.
Only two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby. Jacoby rounds
on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack.
BARBOSSA
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't
think you're that clever. I think
you're a fool. A mortal fool.
JACK
Remarkable how often those two
traits coincide.
Jack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh.
BARBOSSA
You can't beat me, Jack.
To prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches
Jack's sword with both hands. Jack can't free it. Barbossa
twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it -
- - AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACK'S CHEST.
Will battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the
jaw, crumpling him
WILL
Jack!
Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He
takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when
he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOME SKELETAL.
JACK
Well, isn't that interesting.
Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls
something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins.
JACK (CONT' D)
They're so pretty, I just couldn't
resist stealing one. It's a curse,
I guess.
Barbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are
in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle.
BARBOSSA
So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we
to be two immortals, locked in
epic battle until the trumpets of
Judgment Day?
JACK
Or you could surrender.
He shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa
stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack.
BARBOSSA
Or I could chain you to a
cannonball and drop you in the
deepest part of the ocean, where
you can contemplate your folly
forever.
Barbossa charges -
A SHOT RINGS OUT -
Jack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again,
holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Hah. Ten years you carried that
pistol, and you end up wasting
your shot.
WILL
He didn't waste it.
Will stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword,
his left hand in a fist. He opens the fist -
-- the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand,
revealing the cut in his palm.
Barbossa stares, then looks down at his chest. Blood
blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreads
quickly.
Barbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for
the first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to the
ground, dead.
Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol...
tosses it away.
Will wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near the
chest.
WILL
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever
heard of.
(smiles)
You're a man who can be trusted, who
can be counted on, and who can It
betray his friends. What kind of pirate
is that?
JACK
(admits it)
The worst.
(beat)
On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who
can't pass up a chance for revenge
against the black-hearted bastard who
stole my ship and left me to die in the
middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and
who knows how to get what he wants. Now
that's a great pirate.
Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest
... and then hesitates.
Will looks at him...
Jack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside the
other bloody coin.
Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT.
Elizabeth stares at it.
WILL
Let's get out of here.
