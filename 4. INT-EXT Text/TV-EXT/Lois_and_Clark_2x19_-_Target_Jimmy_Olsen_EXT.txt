                   I gotta admit Clark, that was a

                   Our basketball arrived a little
                   early.  You find anything?

    He pulls out the slip of paper Perry had given Clark.

                   You know those two other people 
                   Doctor Frost tried to call?  Their 
                   files are missing, along with mine.

    all over the street.  As people SCREAM... Suddenly a WHOOSH 
    and Superman lands five feet in front of him.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Give me the rifle, Mister Mallow.

    Mallow slowly approaches.  His face now blank, he seems 
    almost harmless.  He gets to point blank range and it 
    appears he's about to hand Superman the rifle when instead 
    he OPENS FIRE, the BULLETS RICOCHETING OFF THE MAN OF 
    STEEL'S CHEST.

    Superman grabs the weapon from Mallow and BENDS IT IN HALF.
    Then, unexpectedly, Mallow passes out.

    Superman floats to the ground with Jimmy in his arms.  Jimmy
    starts coming out of his trance.  He looks around.

                                    JIMMY
                   Superman.  What happened?

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Well, for a minute there, Jimmy,
                   you thought you could fly.

                                    JIMMY
                   Really?  I can't imagine what got
                   into me.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   You'd be surprised.

    And off Superman's knowing smile...
