      He s not staying in.  Jason weaves through the various 
      denizens of his Brooklyn  hood: drunk hipsters, old Polish 
      women pushing carts, a geek-chic COUPLE on smart phones...

                                  WOMAN
                    Their burgers were so not organic.

                                  MAN
                    I m already posting about it.



      Jane and Jason lie in bed.  She props herself on her elbow.

                                  JANE
                    So, do you think I m a slut?

                                  JASON
                    Only in the best most positive way.   

      He rolls to face her.  She s so cute it hurts.                                                                                      8


                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    I had, like, a really great time 
                    last night. But I have a confession 
                    to make.  I lied, I don t drive 
                    stock cars.

                                  JANE
                    I lied too; I m not really a woman.

                                  JASON
                      Technically you are; I didn t see 
                    any boy parts and I double-checked.

      They kiss, softly.  Then, she sees the clock.  9:00 AM.

                                  JANE
                    Shit!  I m so late! 

      She hops out of bed and grabs Jason s pants off the floor.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Is it okay if I borrow these?  I 
                    hate when my doorman sees me in the 
                    same clothes from the day before. 

                                  JASON
                    That happens a lot, huh? 

      Jane shrugs, slips on the pants, and wiggles her butt.  

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    Can I get your number?  Or should I 
                    just stalk you?  I m sorta lazy, a 
                    number would work better.

      She writes it down on a scrap of paper and hands it to him.

                                  JANE
                    See you around, Jason.

      She exits.  He waits until her footsteps fade, then:

                                  JASON
                        Yessssssssssssssssssss!                                                                                        9



                                            ACT 1



      Work bag over his shoulder, Jason emerges from the subway and 
      passes a BUM who s panhandling...while on his cell. 

                                  BUM
                    (INTO PHONE)  Hang on.
                    (TO JASON)  Spare some change, sir?

      Jason holds up his cell, incredulous.

                                  JASON
                    Dude, we have the same phone.



      Jason finds LENCH, 25, hipster-playa-entrepreneur, at a table 
      outside.  He engages Jason in a bro-shake that ends in a snap. 

                                  LENCH
                    Jaybone, been a while.  

                                  JASON
                    Hey Lench, thanks for meeting me.

                                  LENCH
                    No worries, but I gotta be quick, I 
                    have to go set up.  

                                  JASON
                    For what?

                                  LENCH
                    For what?  Seriously, you need to 
                    follow my tweets.  I m having a 
                    banger tonight in honor of our 
                    first issue.  You should come rock 
                    it. (TEXTS) Boom -- you re evited.

                                  JASON
                    Thanks.  What exactly do you do, by 
                    the way?

                                  LENCH
                    I m helping launch a new magazine 
                    that focuses on environmental 
                      sustainability...                                                                                    19


                                  JASON
                    Wow.

                                  LENCH
                    And hot chicks.  We re calling it 
                     All Naturals.   Think models with 
                    70 s era grooming in hemp bikinis, 
                    teaching you how to compost. 

                                  JASON
                    Sounds... smelly.  I didn t know 
                    you loved the planet.

                                  LENCH
                    Sure, it s a fucking goldmine.  But 
                    you, Stacey said you needed some 
                    career advice?   

                                  JASON
                    OK, well, it s embarrassing, but... 
                    I m sort of like a receptionist.

                                  LENCH
                    (NOT EVEN HIDING IT) Wow.

                                  JASON
                    It s not cancer - but yeah, it s 
                    just a bullshit gig until I figure 
                    out what I want to do with my life. 
                    I was thinking music journalism?  
                    Remember my radio show at school, 
                    Strider s Mostly Phenomenal But 
                    Fully Enjoyable Power Hour?  

                                  LENCH
                    Emmm... no.

                                  JASON
                    Anyway, I don t even know how to 
                    start.  Everyone else seems to have 
                    a plan, or found some job, picked 
                    and sticked.  But I can t spend the 
                    rest of my life doing something I 
                    don t like just to get little bits 
                    of green paper.  Know what I mean?  

                                  LENCH
                    Fully, man.  But you ran out the 
                    clock there, Jaybone.  I gotta 
                    bounce.  Let me think on it, I may 
                    know someone to be your savior.

                                  JASON
                    Really?                                                                                    20


                                  LENCH
                    I m pretty popular right now, Jay: 
                    I m rolling with super fucking hot 
                    Locavore sluts and delicious raw 
                    milk cheeses -- people want to hang 
                    with Lench.  

      He starts to Blackberry as he edges toward the door.

                                  LENCH (CONT D)
                    You gonna bring anyone tonight, or 
                    you lone wolfing it?

                                  JASON
                    Uh, wolfing.  Tina will probably 
                    join, but we re just friends. 

                                  LENCH
                    Tina, mm.  Ever notice that she 
                    looks just the tiniest bit  downy?  

                                  JASON
                    No.

                                  LENCH
                    She does; it s hot. Tell her Lench 
                    said, The wheels on the bus go 
                    round and round. She ll understand.



      Jason flips through a street vendor s milk crate of vinyl. 
      INTERCUT.                                                                                    21


                                  JASON
                    Yo.  Your boy Lench says hi.  

                                  TINA
                      Spectacular jackass, isn t he? 

                                  JASON
                    Full metal douchebag.  But he s 
                    throwing a party tonight.  Wanna 
                    go?  I just need to pop out in the 
                    middle and reserve the tickets.

                                  TINA
                    Totally.  Sounds like the perfect 
                    spot for Operation Jay Lay.  

      The WAXER rips off a sheet.  Tina curses, then looks down.

                                  TINA (CONT D)
                    Great, now I look like the world s 
                    tallest baby.  See you later, Jay.



      Jason runs, work bag flopping, bad thumb elevated, good hand 
      buttoning his shirt, through slow walkers, shwarma vendors, 
      and hungover hipsters drinking coffee.
