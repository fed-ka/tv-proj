Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.
ROBIN
God willing, we may now be safe.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
approaching.
ROBIN
Come, Peter.
We must hurry.
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
PETER
It is mortal.
Leave me.
ROBIN
Hold on to my shoulder.
Peter shakes him off.
PETER
My mother... my little sister.
Tell them I love them. Tell them
I died a free Englishman.
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
SARACEN
His wound is by the heart.
We
cannot save him.
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
hand.
PETER
Take this to my sister. Swear you
will protect her for me... Swear
it, Robin!
ROBIN
(reluctantly)
I swear it.
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
PETER
For England.
He fells the first Arab.
The Saracen pulls Robin away.
SARACEN
Come now! Do not fail your friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.
7.
DESERTED ALLEY - LATER
Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
ROBIN
Farewell, friend. God speed you
on your way.
SARACEN
Our way is together. With the
speed of Allah.
He grins.
This strange man has a sense of humor.
ROBIN
I go to England.
SARACEN
Then I go to England.
ROBIN
England?
Why?
SARACEN
You saved my life. I must stay
with you until I save yours.
ROBIN
Go your own way. I relieve you of
your obligation.
SARACEN
Only Allah can do that.
ROBIN
And if I don't want you?
SARACEN
You have no choice... unless you
think you can kill me.
He grins broadly.
Offers his hand.
SARACEN
My name is Aslan.
Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
ROBIN
Robin of Locksley. You know a
short route to England, Aslan?
CUT TO:
8.
Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.
SUPERIMPOSE:
LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND
Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord
Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain
him.
DUNCAN
You cannot go alone, Master.
Let
me ride for help.
LOCKSLEY
That may be too late. Kenneth,
lead the way.
He kicks his horse into motion.
DUNCAN
Master, stay!
There is an evil
moon tonight.
LOCKSLEY
Good will overcome, Duncan.
Trust
in that.
Duncan looks up.
Crosses himself.
Dark clouds race
across the moon.
CUT TO:
Kenneth checks the ground.
Locksley waits.
KENNETH
They came this way, my Lord.
LOCKSLEY
Onward then.
What is this place?
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
KENNETH
Nearby the Gregor Caves.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.
LOCKSLEY
Steady, man. They are to dissuade
the faint of heart. Think of
Gwen.
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
KENNETH
Druids.
LOCKSLEY
I trusted we were rid of such evil
a century ago.
An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic.
KENNETH
(petrified)
Is it the devil?
LOCKSLEY
If it is, I have some Christian
steel that will test his hide.
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
head.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
LOCKSLEY
Gwen?
Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who
is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan
altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk
raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.
The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
DEMON
Come, my virgin flower.
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
DEMON
Kill him!
Kill him!
The followers throw themselves at
Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues
orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a
spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down
left and right.
Reaches the altar stone.
LOCKSLEY
Gwen!
Up, girl, up!
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
LOCKSLEY
In the name of God!
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition.
LOCKSLEY
Nottingham!
The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard,
cruel intensity in every feature.
NOTTINGHAM
You are an unwelcome surprise,
Locksley.
LOCKSLEY
The King shall hear of this,
Nottingham.
NOTTINGHAM
I think not.
Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their
faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.
LOCKSELY
God help us.
NOTTINGHAM
One day all England will worship
with us.
LOCKSLEY
Never.
The crone spits venom in his face.
DEMON
I am Mortianna. You will die with
my name on your lips.
Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill-
side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
masked figures block his way.
13.
A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.
A cross on
its sail.
A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.
ROBIN
Home.
Thank you, Lord.
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
hand.
ROBIN
My friend, you have escorted me
home. I beg you to free yourself
of your vow. Return with the
boat. I know how heavy your
heart must be, this far from your
family and native land...
ASLAN (SARACEN)
Because I love them so dearly,
I cannot dishonor them.
A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
ROBIN
I thought you'd say that.
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.
ASLAN
No man controls my destiny.
Especially not one who attacks
downwind and stinks of garlic.
Robin laughs.
The Saracen remains intense.
ASLAN
If our positions were reversed,
I would have done the same.
Only I would have succeeded.
He smiles broadly.
Robin claps him on the shoulder.
ROBIN
Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will
celebrate your honor when we dine
with my father.
14.
CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.
GISBORNE
You owe the sheriff three bushels
of flax.
FANNY
You starve us. First the drought,
now you take what food we have
left.
GISBORNE
For starving people, you look
fat enough.
SOLDIER
(emerging from
the hut)
He's not here, sir. None but the
woman and children.
GISBORNE
(to Fanny)
Where is your mate? The man
they call Little.
FANNY
He died last winter.
GISBORNE
Is that so? We hear he
is very
much alive. Hiding out
in the
forest. He probably ran
away
to escape your scolding
tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
FANNY
Norman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
Gisborne's throat.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
FANNY
No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
make it worse.
Wulf backs off.
Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
GISBORNE
Seize him!
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
GISBORNE
This is Lord Nottingham's deer.
Is this how you repay the Sheriff
for his protection?
WULF (BOY)
Like a wolf protects sheep.
FANNY
I killed it.
We needed the meat.
GISBORNE
Poachers hang. Either he dies or
you die.
WULF
My mother lies to protect me.
FANNY
No, Wulf!
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.
GISBORNE
You have deprived us of a hunt,
boy.
He cups his hand in the deer's blood.
Smears it on
Wulf's face.
GISBORNE
The hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
GISBORNE
Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us
some pleasure before you die.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
GISBORNE
Unleash them!
Nearing home, Robin is buoyant.
The Saracen, brooding,
walks two paces behind him.
ROBIN
Why must you walk in back of me?
ASLAN
In your land am I not the infidel?
The unbeliever, the instrument of
evil?
ROBIN
Our races have fought for a
hundred years to prove that point.
ASLAN
Then I trust it is safer to appear
as your slave than as your equal.
ROBIN
For an 'infidel' you have uncommon
clarity of thinking. Yet you
refuse to tell me about your home
and family.
ASLAN
Those are my burdens.
ROBIN
You speak my language. You have
the diplomacy and honor code of
a nobleman. I ask again, why
were you to be executed?
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
ROBIN
So, I must continue with my
guesswork. You are highborn?
Probably... You fell from favor...
Clearly... Why? You broke the
law? You were a rival for power?
... A woman?
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:
The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
ROBIN
By the Lord, that's it!
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
ROBIN
They say there are Arab women of
such beauty that they can possess
a man's mind, that he would be
willing to die for them. Is
that not so?
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.
Examines the darkening
sky.
ASLAN
It is close to sunset.
ROBIN
Your people must marry women
chosen for them by others, right?
No reply.
Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
ROBIN
Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?
... Another man's wife?... That's
it!
ASLAN
Endless clouds. Is there no sun
in your cursed country?
ROBIN
You dog! You painted old dog!
What is her name?
ASLAN
Which way is East?
ROBIN
Her name?
ASLAN
East?
ROBIN
Her name?
ASLAN
East?!!!
Robin folds his arms.
A standoff.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
ASLAN
Damn you!... Jasmina.
ROBIN
Ah, Jasmina!
Is she beautiful?
ASLAN
Which way is East?
ROBIN
That way.
Aslan throws his rug on the ground.
Kneels.
ASLAN
Are you sure?
ROBIN
I would know blindfolded. I'm
five miles from home... Was she
worth it?
ASLAN
Worth dying for.
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
branches. A hound savages his leg.
The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.
GISBORNE
You're not playing by
the rules,
boy. Deer don't climb
trees...
Perhaps he thinks he's
a game
bird. Shall we teach
him to fly?
Cut it down!
The soldiers hack at the trunk.
The tree quivers.
ROBIN
Hold!... I am curious as to what
manner of creature is so fearsome
that it takes six men to attack
it.
Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
GISBORNE
Stand back, stranger. This is no
affair of yours.
ROBIN
Have we treed the devil himself?
Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.
A truly dangerous animal.
GISBORNE
I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
This is the Sheriff's land.
ROBIN
Wrong. This is my land, and my
tree. Therefore, whatever is in
it also belongs to me.
GISBORNE
I grow dangerously tired of your
wit... Chop it down!
ROBIN
The man who strikes that tree
dies.
He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
GISBORNE
Chop down the hooded fool.
ROBIN
(backing up)
Perhaps we could discuss this.
The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds
through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
GISBORNE
Kill him!
ROBIN
Aslan!
It's time to redeem that
vow.
GISBORNE
Set the dogs on him!
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
Aslan ignores him, lost in his
prayers. Robin lifts the
other arm -- a second concealed
crossbow. WHUMPF! The
bolt flips the dog handler into
the vicious pack. Dead
or not, he soon will be. Robin
unsheathes his sword.
ROBIN
Aslan, get off your damn knees!
I have four of them cornered.
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
flashing steel.
ROBIN
I hope there's enough of me to
satisfy you all.
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.
Blood flows
from his arm. His sword falls.
ROBIN
Aslan!!
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.
Robin
freezes.
GISBORNE
Well, hooded stranger, allow me
to know your name before I run you
through.
A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
pilgrim's hood.
GISBORNE
Robin of Locksley!
ROBIN
On your knees, Gisborne.
Pray.
He obeys.
Robin raises his sword.
GISBORNE
Please, Locksley! No!
Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear.
The man
leaps.
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Now get off my land. And tell your
cousin the Sheriff what happens to
his scum when they pick on my
people.
Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his
rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab.
Keeps running.
ROBIN
(to Aslan,
furious)
You worthless savage! You travel
ten thousand miles to save my life,
then leave me to be butchered.
ASLAN
I will fulfill my vow when I
choose.
ROBIN
Which does not include prayer
times, meal times, or any time
I'm outnumbered six to one!!
ASLAN
You whine like a mule.
You are
still alive.
ROBIN
Barely.
Aslan examines Robin's wound.
Dismissive.
ASLAN
A flesh wound. Why did you let
their leader go?
ROBIN
After six years of the stench of
death, I have no stomach for
needless blood on my hands.
Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
ROBIN
Have no fear, boy.
The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering
a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
ASLAN
(laughing)
The conquering hero returns.
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Ha!
It was you he was scared of.
Aslan's humor is infectious.
Robin's anger relents.
ROBIN
Come, my strange friend. Beyond
that hill lies the prettiest
little castle in all Christendom.
Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
ASLAN
With feather pillows?
ROBIN
With feather pillows. Warm and
soft like Jasmina's embrace.
Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted.
Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck
dumb with horror.
The dark courtyard.
Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
debris.
ROBIN
Father!
Hello!
His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan
places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended
high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.
CLOSE - MEDALLION
round the corpse's neck.
The Locksley crest.
ROBIN
Noooooo!
A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture.
Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained,
Aslan looks on.
ROBIN
I should have been here.
Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they
hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A
hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
... Duncan.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
(shaking him)
Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you
cut him down?
DUNCAN
Master Robin, is it you? A
miracle. I thought God had
abandoned us.
ROBIN
You left my father to hang like
a common thief, carrion for the
crows.
ASLAN
Easy... Look at him.
Duncan steps into the moonlight.
His face crudely-
scarred.
ROBIN
What has happened?
DUNCAN
They say they captured him
worshipping with the Druids. He
signed a confession before the
Bishop of Hereford.
ROBIN
Did they have witnesses?
DUNCAN
Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall.
The Bishop decreed all the Locksley
lands forfeit.
ROBIN
Did you believe the charges?
DUNCAN
Not even when they took my eyes.
ROBIN
Who did this to you, Duncan?
DUNCAN
Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff
looking on.
Robin holds the old retainer to his chest.
Stares into
the night in silent rage.
24.
Marked contrast.
A forbidding fortress.
Cliff-like
battlements.
Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty
in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis-
tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she
covers up.
NOTTINGHAM
Who bade you cover up?
He smashes his fist into his chair.
She timidly
uncovers.
NOTTINGHAM
Cousin, I trust you justify your
intrusion with news of profound
value.
His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black-
ness.
GISBORNE
I met a hooded man today. He bade
me warn you not to harm his
people.
NOTTINGHAM
His name?
GISBORNE
Robin of Locksley.
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
NOTTINGHAM
Ha! The prodigal son returns. He
is a whelp. This girl could best
him.
GISBORNE
This whelp bested five of my men
in the blink of an eye.
NOTTINGHAM
Your men were probably drunk.
Yet
you survived, cousin?
Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a
child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud
CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW,
wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think
she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
agility. MORTIANNA.
GISBORNE
(stunned)
You brought her here?
NOTTINGHAM
Quiet!
The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a
writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes.
Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con-
tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone
dice -- Runes.
She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in
trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every
move. A connoisseur.
NOTTINGHAM
What do you see?
MORTIANNA
Change the seat of power.
NOTTINGHAM
London?
MORTIANNA
Change it.
NOTTINGHAM
Move the capitol to Nottingham?
Excellent. How?
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
MORTIANNA
Ally with royal blood.
NOTTINGHAM
Put someone on the throne and rule
through him? Who?
MORTIANNA
That is not revealed.
The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind.
Mounting
intensity.
NOTTINGHAM
Ally with royal blood. What else
do you see?
MORTIANNA
Armies.
NOTTINGHAM
Whose?
MORTIANNA
Yours. Men and weaponry in great
numgers.
NOTTINGHAM
And victory?
MORTIANNA
Much blood will be spilled.
NOTTINGHAM
Whose?
CLOSE SHOT
A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol.
Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands
again. Again the grinning skull.
BACK TO SCENE
The tray smashes to the ground.
The hag runs at
Gisborne.
MORTIANNA
Who have you seen?!
She shakes him.
Screams spittle in his face.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
GISBORNE
(freaked)
No one. I have seen no one.
MORTIANNA
You lie!
A man... A painted man.
NOTTINGHAM
What is wrong?
MORTIANNA
I have seen my death.
She whimpers.
Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.
MORTIANNA
The painted man. He haunts my
dreams.
GISBORNE
Locksley has a companion. A dark-
skinned foreigner. He had the
marked skin of Islam.
Mortianna trembles like an epileptic.
Eyes wide with
terror.
MORTIANNA
Kill them!
Kill them!
She throws herself at Nottingham for protection.
He
caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.
NOTTINGHAM
Cousin. Prove to Locksley that
your survival was his last mistake.
MORTIANNA
(frantic)
And the painted man! Kill him.
NOTTINGHAM
Kill them both.
He continues to stroke her.
Her trembling subsides.
NOTTINGHAM
You have done well, Mortianna.
Exceedingly well. No one shall
harm you, I swear it.
Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young
girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the
girl's hand.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down
viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.
NOTTINGHAM
Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses
will seem soft, like an angel's.
(to Mortianna)
Take her. You have earned her.
Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.
Drags her
away.
GISBORNE
It is madness bringing the hag
here.
NOTTINGHAM
Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For
in madness, there is great power.
Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees.
Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave.
Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
ROBIN
Our last words in this world were
spoken in anger. He called the
Crusades a foolish quest, said it
was vanity to force other men to
our religion. He was right.
(looks to Aslan,
then back to the
grave)
Please forgive me, Father.
DUNCAN
He loved you till the end, young
master. He never gave up hope of
your return.
ROBIN
I failed him. I should have been
here at his side.
DUNCAN
You must leave, head north to
safety. Gisborne will surely seek
revenge.
ROBIN
Leave me.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
DUNCAN
I know what you're thinking. But
one man can achieve nothing
against so many. You would need
an army.
ROBIN
Leave me.
ASLAN
Come, friend.
He leads the old man away.
CUT TO:
GRAVE SIDE - LATER
Pouring rain. Robin stands drenched at the grave side.
Aslan watches from the shelter of trees. Duncan heats a
stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.
DUNCAN
He still stands vigil?
ASLAN
Like a rock.
Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.
DUNCAN
A curse on the Saracens! Were it
not for their ungodly ways, he
would never have left. This would
never have happened.
ASLAN
It surprises me that one who
curses others so readily has lived
so long.
DUNCAN
I do not recognize the style of
your voice, friend. Are you
Irish? A Cornishman?
ASLAN
Er... no.
DUNCAN
What manner of name is Aslan then?
ASLAN
A fine Saracen name.

DUNCAN
Lord, no!
He chokes in shock.
Spitting bread.
ASLAN
Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I
take no offense.
(glances at Robin)
By the prophet! What is the man
doing?
Robin raises his dagger over his wrist.
Aslan runs to
him.
ASLAN
Wait!
Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm.
Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.
ROBIN
I swear by my own blood. I will
not rest until I have restored my
father's name.
(a whisper)
... Or until I am dead.
Ooze sucks at feet.
The three men stomp through mud and
rain.
ROBIN
We make a fine army, do we not,
Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and
a fool.
ASLAN
A fine, wet army. I have never
witnessed a storm of such duration.
When does summer come to this
land?
ROBIN
This is summer.
ASLAN
Then Allah truly is great.
ROBIN
Why, pray?
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
ASLAN
No food, no shelter,
and weather
that would curse the
end of the
earth. We
will all
quickly be
dead, and I shall be
rid of my
vow.
They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched
mansion.
ROBIN
You despair too soon, Aslan. We
shall find food and shelter here
among friends.
ASLAN
What is this place?
ROBIN
Peter's home. It is nearly seven
years since we left here together.
Robin pounds on the door.
A hatch opens.
An OLD WOMAN's
face.
OLD WOMAN
No beggars!
The hatch slams shut.
Robin pounds again.
ROBIN
Open up!
A pause.
The hatch slides back.
ROBIN
Tell the mistress of the house
that Robin of Locksley is at her
door.
OLD WOMAN
Her ladyship is not at home.
She slams the hatch again.
Robin jams in his hand.
ROBIN
Aagh!
He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Is the child Marian at home?
OLD WOMAN
Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't.
Remove that hand.
Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked
door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly
the hatch slams.
ASLAN
The hospitality here is as warm as
the weather.
They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack.
OLD WOMAN
Leave your weapons.
The three start forward.
Her bony finger points at
Robin.
OLD WOMAN
Just you.
Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through
clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in
her voice.
MARIAN
Why would he wish me to be
protected by the boy who burned
my hair when I was a child?
ROBIN
We were together five terrible
years in a Saracen prison.
MARIAN
How do I know you didn't abandon
him there to save your own skin.
Robin hands her Peter's ring.
She is shocked.
ROBIN
Marian, I'm sorry.
MARIAN
I will forward your condolences
to my mother.
She turns her back.
He searches for a way to reach her.
ROBIN
On my return, I found my father
dead. The Sheriff denounced him
as a Druid and took our lands.
MARIAN
The people fear the Druids so much
they'd believe anything.
Nottingham would have me burned at
the stake as a witch if he thought
he could possess my property.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Why do you not join your mother
in London? You would be safer
there.
MARIAN
I will not retreat.
Besides, I
have no interest in
life at court.
Gossip-mongering and
currying
favor. Here I am my
own person.
ROBIN
The you must allow me to be your
guardian.
MARIAN
I do not need a guardian.
She turns to face him.
Streaming tears.
MARIAN
My brother is dead. You cannot
take his place.
Robin grabs and holds her.
ROBIN
Marian, I don't want to replace
him.
MARIAN
What do you want?
Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin
moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.
MARIAN
This is wrong.
She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her.
Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
ASLAN
Robin! The old man hears horses.
Approaching fast.
He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
hillside.
ASLAN
Twenty or more. In battle armor.
MARIAN
Soldiers coming here?
Is this
your protection?
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
I killed some of the Sheriff's
men. I fear I have placed you in
danger.
MARIAN
I can take care of myself. There
are horses in the stable. Go!
Aslan runs into the stables.
ROBIN
I'm not leaving.
Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two
bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by
Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the
soldiers.
MARIAN
Stop them!
They're stealing my
horses!
ROBIN
Damn the girl! Aslan, can you
ride?
In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a
single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs
in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the
estate wall.
ROBIN
He can ride.
He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely
clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on.
Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
GISBORNE
You have been sheltering outlaws,
Lady Marian.
MARIAN
They're thieves, you imbecile.
Bring back my horses, or the
Sheriff will know of your
cowardice.
Gisborne knows she is lying.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
GISBORNE
You're lucky he didn't steal your
virtue too.
(to his men)
A crown to the man who brings me
Locksley's head.
He leads the pursuit.
A SOLDIER hangs back.
Grabs
Marian's hair.
SOLDIER
A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
MARIAN
Kiss this!
She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.
Jabs
the blade into his wrist.
MARIAN
Try me again, if you want to
leave a hand behind.
Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks
down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently.
CUT TO:
Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan
hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men.
Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the
steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the
drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It
backs away.
ROBIN
Damn you, animal!
Aslan shouts from the far bank.
ASLAN
Treat it like a woman.
Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing
in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of
BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or
die.
ASLAN
Have you never had a woman?
Gently, man. Soothe it!
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Of course I've had a woman!
Come on, pretty one.
He pats the horse soothingly.
The animal edges forward.
ASLAN
Softly.
With your knees.
ROBIN
I know!
I know!
The soldiers reload.
Robin urges the horse at the steep
drop.
ROBIN
Easy, easy.
Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the
frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch
down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin
enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
ROBIN
I love you!
The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.
Their
mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
GISBORNE
(yelling)
Robin of the Hood! Son of the
devil worshipper.
ROBIN
What is your pleasure, Gisborne?
GISBORNE
It was I who strung your father's
corpse to the castle gate. My
pleasure will be in doing the same
to you.
ROBIN
You survived one meeting.
Our next
will be your last.
GISBORNE
Your father died a coward, cursing
your name and squealing like a
stuck pig.
ROBIN
That's a lie!
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:
Incensed, he is losing his judgement.
ASLAN
(shouts)
Come, Robin! He is trying to
anger you into a trap.
A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in
fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne
split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters
them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to
follow.
Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub.
Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
ROBIN
We have lost them. I'll lame this
mare if I ask her to go any farther.
He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens
his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
it to his eye. A primitive telescope.
Robin watches, curious.
SCOPE POV
Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
them.
BACK TO SCENE
ASLAN
Here they come. Look.
Robin puts the device to his eye...
SCOPE POV
The soldiers are close!
BACK TO SCENE
He reacts in shock. Prepares to defend himself.
Then
realizes they are still in the distance.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Is this Arab magic?
ASLAN
No.
Arab science.
He replaces the tube in his pouch.
ASLAN
How did your uneducated
kind ever take Jerusalem?
ROBIN
God knows!
Aslan laughs.
Robin points towards an endless expanse of
trees.
ROBIN
We can lose them in the forest.
DUNCAN
Sherwood is haunted, Master.
ROBIN
Either we take our chances
with the ghosts, or become
ghosts ourselves.
He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men
thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering
around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin
looks back.
ROBIN
They're not following.
Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
GISBORNE
Come on, damn you! There are
only three of them.
SOLDIER
It's not the men we fear, sir.
Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones.
Aslan draws his
sword.
DUNCAN
Banshees. They say they fly in
your mouth and suck you dry of
blood before you can scream.
He wraps his scarf over his mouth.
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Be quiet!
Listen.
WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly
SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites
around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds,
striking only air.
ASLAN
Allah protect us from the evil
spirits.
Duncan clings to his back.
Robin points.
ROBIN
Behind you!
Aslan slashes out, futilely.
ROBIN
No, there!
And there!
Aslan flails.
Robin cracks up.
ASLAN
Cease your mad laughing.
I can
feel them.
Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
A low chilling MOAN.
ROBIN
Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A
child's toy put to good use. You
scare easily, my painted Saladin.
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
Catapults him to the ground.
The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-
century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL
SCARLET, leaps around Robin.
WILL SCARLET
(singing)
Ring around the rosie!
ROBIN
Aslan!
Aslan makes no move to intervene.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to
grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
WILL SCARLET
Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall
down. Beg for mercy, rich man.
ROBIN
I beg of no man. Which of you
scum has guts enough to face
me man to man?
VOICE (O.S.)
Yeah, bollocks, mate.
Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.
His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes
when he laughs, which is often.
JOHN LITTLE
What are ya, m'old cock?
ROBIN
Er... Robin...
He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
ROBIN
...Hood.
Robin Hood.
Who are
you?
JOHN LITTLE
John Little.
Bestman o' the
woods.
ROBIN
Bestman?
You lead this rabble?
WILL SCARLET
We waste time. Tax him.
ROBIN
Tax?
For what?
WILL SCARLET
For passage through Sherwood.
ROBIN
I will pay no tax. Besides, I
have nothing but my cloak and
my sword.
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
WILL SCARLET
A man who travels with two servants
and claims he's without money, is
either a fool or a liar.
Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something
CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily,
Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.
WILL SCARLET
And this one is a liar.
(he bites the metal)
Ahah! Gold!
The men cheer.
John snatches the medallion back from
Will.
ROBIN
That is sacred to me.
JOHN LITTLE
Sacred to us too, mush. This
here'll feed us for a bloomin'
month.
Robin draws his sword.
ROBIN
You will have to fight me for it.
JOHN LITTLE
I'd love to, mate.
He grins hugely.
A boy pushes his way through the throng.
WULF
Wait, father!
I know him.
ROBIN
This man is your father? Tell him
how I saved your hide from the
Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves
some gratitude, I believe.
He reaches for the medallion.
John pulls it away.
JOHN LITTLE
Naw ya don't, laddie.
WILL SCARLET
You must be Robin of Locksley.
The blackguard who abandoned us to
Nottingham's plundering.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
WULF
Be careful, Father. He fights
like a demon. He walloped six o'
Sheriff's men?
JOHN LITTLE
Is that so?
Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he
lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free.
Bends it into a pretzel.
ROBIN
Aslan!
Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with
one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's
stomach. Robin folds.
WILL SCARLET
Oh dear! The little rich boy is
lost for words. Thanks for the
taxes, Locksley.
JOHN LITTLE
And for the laughs.
The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into
the tree. Will administers one final kick before
leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously
at Aslan.
ROBIN
Son of an Arab whore! Once again
your assistance was invaluable.
ASLAN
You seemed more in danger of losing
your pride than your life.
DUNCAN
I recognized some of the voices.
Many were from your father's farms.
ASLAN
Your avenging army, my friend.
ROBIN
That rabble?
ASLAN
All they need is a leader.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
They have a leader.
A very large
one.
ASLAN
Defeat him and they will follow
you.
ROBIN
Allah has taken your brains.
DUNCAN
I hear the voice of a spoiled
child, Master Robin. I suggest
you cease your brave talk of
revenge and flee to the north.
ROBIN
You, too? You expect me to
fight that behemoth?
DUNCAN
Your father would expect you to
act like a man.
CUT TO:
A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The
ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge.
Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.
ROBIN
This is my bridge. No one crosses
without paying tax.
JOHN LITTLE
Just bugger off, mate, huh?
ROBIN
If you wish to cross, it will
cost you a gold medallion.
JOHN LITTLE
Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff
for one day?
WILL SCARLET
If he's in a hurry to end his
mortal misery, help him.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
You don't have the courage to
face me again, John Little? Or
should I call you 'Little John'?
John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.
Strides to the
bridge.
JOHN LITTLE
Alright, m'old cock. You wanna
nuther good wallopin'?
His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
connects a blow on John's foot.
The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
Enjoying the time of his life.
Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
Aslan watches impassively.
Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.
John waits,
grinning.
JOHN LITTLE
Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
WILL SCARLET
Don't fool with him. Get him!
John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
him time to right himself.
John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from
the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
JOHN LITTLE
Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters.
Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not
re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank.
No sign.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
JOHN LITTLE
Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave
'un.
Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp
onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might.
John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
JOHN LITTLE
Help!
Cain't bloody swim.
He submerges again.
Robin pulls his head above water.
ROBIN
Do you yield?
The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing
with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the
surface.
ROBIN
Do you yield?
JOHN LITTLE
Yes!
ROBIN
Good.
Now put your feet down.
John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water
only reaches his chest.
JOHN LITTLE
I'll be buggered.
ROBIN
Pay me the tax.
A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.
JOHN LITTLE
Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid
rock.
He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he
swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.
A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and
fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.
LITTLE JOHN
Mead.
Made it m'self.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
(drinks)
A fine brew, Little John.
He spits black objects from his mouth.
Dead bees.
John
grins.
LITTLE JOHN
Real honey.
He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over
the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to
Aslan.
ASLAN
With regrets, I decline.
LITTLE JOHN
An Englishman's mead not bleedin'
good enough for ya?
ASLAN
On the contrary. I thank you,
but my faith prevents me from
partaking in such enjoyments.
LITTLE JOHN
Your bloody loss, mate.
He swigs.
Passes the jug on to Duncan, who drinks
heartily.
Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.
LITTLE JOHN
What is it, boy? Speak up!
WULF
I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley.
I owes ya m'life.
ROBIN
You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am
glad I chanced by in time to help.
LITTLE JOHN
C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put
hair on your bloomin' chest.
Wulf tries the brew. The impact is instant.
He turns
green and runs. His father cracks up.
ROBIN
Tell me about your men, John.
John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree
trunk.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
LITTLE JOHN
This stumpy one 'ere's David o'
Doncaster. We calls 'im Bull.
ROBIN
How do you come by the name, Bull?
BULL
'Cuz o' my size, Sire.
ROBIN
Because you are short?
BULL
Nay.
'Cuz I be so long.
Proudly, he starts to pull down his pants.
ROBIN
No, Bull.
Save it for the ladies.
Drunken laughter.
Robin turns to the next man at the
fireside.
ROBIN
Your name, friend?
The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to
respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a
comprehensible word.
LITTLE JOHN
That be Hal Brownwell, but the
lads call i'm Hal Hiccup.
The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up
at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his
tormentors.
ROBIN
Hold! Hal, you have the face and
hands of a farmer. I wager you
are a strong and honest man, and
I'd be glad to have you at my side
in a fight. The next man who makes
light of you will have to answer
to me.
There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects
to try it.
ROBIN
How is it there are so many of
you in hiding?
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
LITTLE JOHN
We're outlaws. Got prices on our
'eads, every man jack. Blasted
Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes.
ROBIN
How do you fare?
LITTLE JOHN
We get by, I reckon.
ROBIN
While the Sheriff steals your
land and your families starve?
LITTLE JOHN
What in bloody blazes'd ya have
us do?
ROBIN
Your ghosts will only keep his
men at bay so long, my friend.
Soon the Sheriff will hunt you
down and hang you. You must
fight back.
LITTLE JOHN
We show as much as a toe outside
the forest, they'll slaughter us
like bleedin' sheep.
ROBIN
We must organize. Win by guile.
LITTLE JOHN
'We'? Ya lookin' to join us,
matie?
ROBIN
No.
To lead you.
WILL SCARLET
Ha! I would never be led by the
son of a Druid.
ROBIN
There are many here who knew my
father to be a kind and generous
man. I doubt that in their hearts
they believe him capable of such a
horror.
Murmurs of agreement from around the fire.
Robin turns
to Will.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
What is your name, friend?
WILL SCARLET
Count me not a friend, Locksley.
LITTLE JOHN
Stuff a flippin' cork in it, Will.
The man's our guest.
Will gets up.
Angrily pushes his way out of the group.
LITTLE JOHN
That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im
no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.
ROBIN
He is right to distrust me. I am
a rich man's son. I have done no
honest labor. But today I am as
poor as any of you. Nottingham
has stolen all that I own. And
when I killed Gisborne's men, I,
too, became an outlaw.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all,
mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish
agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army?
Ya must be bloody jokin'.
ROBIN
We can win.
And I believe we will.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood,
but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give
ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz
tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky!
Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack
that blasted noble head in two.
Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long
draught of mead.
A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose
of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around
him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with
rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess.
Robin sits, brooding.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
ASLAN
(gloomily)
I have led you wrong. This is no
army. These men live like dogs.
ROBIN
English dogs.
They can learn.
ASLAN
Learn what?
To build kennels?
He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan
is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side.
The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously
hung-over.
ROBIN
Too much mead, old friend.
What
day is it?
DUNCAN
Sunday, I believe.
ROBIN
Good. Do they still give alms
to the poor at the mass?
DUNCAN
They do. These days the need for
mercy is greater than ever.
ROBIN
Then I must ask you a favor.
Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body
stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is
the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham.
Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and
spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin,
dressed as Duncan.
Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing
stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.
GUARD
Hey, you!
Robin keeps going.
A hand clasps his shoulder.
Spins
him 'round.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
GUARD
Do I know you?
Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.
The Guard
sniffs his soiled hand.
GUARD
My God, you stink!
ROBIN
Pardon my blindness, sir.
I'm
always falling down.
GUARD
Yeech!
Get away from me.
He launches a kick in Robin's rear. Robin hobbles away,
hiding a smile. The Guard tries to wipe off his hand on
the wall.
Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's
horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides
through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks
him. A sure shot.
Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and
stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly
into the air.
MARIAN
(innocently)
Please excuse my clumsiness.
Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks
the guard who hasseled him into the wall.
Men gather around as Robin dismounts, admiring the horse.
ROBIN
A personal loan from the Sheriff.
ASLAN
(furious)
You should not have left without
me, Englishman.
ROBIN
How so? You have not raised a
finger to protect me.
ASLAN
Before I had a choice.
ROBIN
It was my choice to do this alone.
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
ASLAN
A foolish risk. If you had been
killed, I would be cursed for
eternity for failing to fulfil
my pledge.
ROBIN
Aslan, if I didn't know better,
I would swear you were worried
about me.
The Sheriff maniacally spits out orders to Gisborne.
NOTTINGHAM
Starve them out. Slaughter their
livestock. I want to see Locksley's
own people fighting each other to
bring him to us.
GISBORNE
I swear he will not live to see
the next full moon.
A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a wagon. SOLDIERS round
up the livestock. An old FARMER protests.
FARMER
Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the
sow. She's with young 'uns. The
next litter'll feed us through
the winter.
SOLDIER
You've heard of Robin Hood?
FARMER
Yes, sir.
The Soldier brutally kicks the old man to the ground.
SOLDIER
Then pray he is brought to us
before winter.
A trail of refugees. Women and children carry their
belongings into camp.

Wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings.
A contingent

WILL SCARLET
You brought this misery on us,
Locksley. We can barely feed
ourselves.
LITTLE JOHN
Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody
pot to piss in.
ROBIN
Then we shall take from him and
his rich friends.
This provokes a barrage of protests.
The men are angry.
WILL SCARLET
Brave talk, Locksley. I say we
take the rich boy in.
Murmurs of general agreement.
ROBIN
Will, do you think the Sheriff will
give everything back after I am
gone?
WILL SCARLET
He will give us the reward, and
our pardons.
ROBIN
Alright, Will. You can take me
in on one condition. You must
fight me. You may use the Sheriff's
horse and arm yourself as you
please. I will fight on foot.
Unarmed.
WILL SCARLET
Unarmed?
ROBIN
If you lose, you will accept me
as your leader. If you win, you
may take me in. Dead or alive.
WILL SCARLET
Dead, Locksley.
CUT TO:
62.
Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his
cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators.
Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to themselves,
while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan.
Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged
with scars.
ASLAN
This man has true purpose.
He
means to kill you.
DUNCAN
And you have given him the means.
WULF
Will is ruthless, Robin.
Guard
your back.
ROBIN
I am grateful for your concern,
friends, but I have to prove to
them it is possible to overcome
unequal odds.
(shouts)
I am ready, Will.
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
back to the attack.
His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.
Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
chest.
Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.
Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough.
Douses his face. Yells at Will.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Come on, you little piss pot.
Do your worst!
Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his
ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps.
ROBIN
The horse is smarter than you are,
Will.
Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks
and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges.
Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.
ROBIN
Here, Will!
You aim like a girl,
Will!
Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
wards off his mount.
Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
ROBIN
Thank the Lord you are not endowed
like Bull.
The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his
breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and
runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is
about to strike.
LITTLE JOHN
Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off,
eh?
Overpowered, Will relents.
With a defiant glance, he
skulks away.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya got us by the short and curlies,
Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya
got to bleedin' say.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
Robin scans the faces.
He has their attention.
ROBIN
Nottingham has taken from us
everything we own. Now we are
going to start taking from him.
LITTLE JOHN
'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna
do that?
ROBIN
We are going to tax him.
DISSOLVE TO:
Autumn. The forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange,
and red. A giant eye in a circle of glass. Aslan, his
telescope raised.
ASLAN
Here they come.
ROBIN
How many?
ASLAN
Two wagons.
Twenty escort.
ROBIN
Twenty?
They usually have five.
He grabs the telescope.
SCOPE POV
A phalanx of
mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with
barrels, and
a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with
crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne
commands the
escort.
BACK TO SCENE
ROBIN
This is no ordinary convoy.
Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods-
men lies nervously in ambush.
BULL
'ow many?
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Er, about ten.
(then, to Aslan)
Why scare them? They can't count
anyway.
ASLAN
And they call me the barbarian.
ROBIN
Let's go.
Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
The mounted soldiers charge them. The
woodsmen run into
the trees. As the horsemen close in,
the runners leap
into a trench. Lift up matted screens
of brush and
grass. It's as if they disappeared.
The soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.
The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. Momentum
carries many of them over the
cliff.
BACK ON ROADWAY
Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,
driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.
He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and
cursing.
Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.
Angry shouts
from inside.
ROBIN
Surrender your weapons. I give
you my word you shall go free.
In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near
his feet.
ROBIN
Ah, I feared as much.
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,
panic. Drowning rats.
The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead.
Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.
CUT TO:
COUNTRYSIDE
Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The
lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in
astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with
glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around.
Cheers of celebration.
LITTLE JOHN
(awestruck)
I'll be buggered.
ROBIN
This treasure had a purpose.
We
must find out what.
He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart.
The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
ROBIN
Get off him.
He's a man of the
cloth.
Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet.
Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
FRIAR
The Lord's blessing on you, kind
sir. These sinners were attempting
to steal these libations destined
for the monks of St. Catherine's.
He indicates his cargo of barrels.
ROBIN
It appears to me, Reverend Friar,
that many of the libations have
found their way into your own
esteemed person.
Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.
FRIAR
A thousand pardons, sir, but duty
beckons. I must hasten on.
ROBIN
(grabbing the bridle)
A moment, my reverend friend. You
travel with poor company when you
travel with Nottingham's soldiers.
BULL
Aye, tax him.
This sparks a chorus of comments.
ROBIN
My men are thirsty and have much
to celebrate.
FRIAR
Lord bless me, sir, are these your
men? I had mistook them for
common thieves. Kindly step
aside.
ROBIN
Surely the Lord has the charity to
spare a few barrels to good
Christian men.
The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
FRIAR
Well, sir, if you wish them to
share in the good Lord's brew...
Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club.
Smites Robin with it.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
FRIAR
... you must best me for it.
Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed,
Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal
full in the face.
FRIAR
Giddyup, nag!
The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs
after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the
cart.
ROBIN
You leave when I say.
Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.
FRIAR
Protect me, Lord.
He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under
him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!
FRIAR
Yield!
He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe.
The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
FRIAR
Confess that Friar Tuck is a
better, holier, and braver man
than thou art, knave.
ROBIN
Never!
Whoomf!
FRIAR
Yield, I say!
Yield to Friar
Tuck.
Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls.
Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes
the Friar's head with his drinking jug.
ROBIN
Yield yourself!
He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the
ground.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Yield to Robin Hood.
Tuck holds up a hand in surrender.
Robin eases off.
FRIAR
(feeling his head)
Thank you, Lord, for teaching me
humility.
ROBIN
Well, Friar Tuck. We have need
of an honest man of God, to
minister to these men and their
families. What do you say?
The Friar struggles to his feet. He reviews the motley
faces of his potential flock. His eyes light on the
grinning Saracen.
FRIAR
I'd rather roast in hell.
He punches Robin in the gut.
CUT TO:
FRIAR TUCK
strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. Sweating
profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly
follows.
ROBIN
Giddyup, Friar.
He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women
and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped
soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A
woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch
his robe in wonder.
ROBIN
What do you say now, Tuck?
Here
are the meek of the earth.
Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little
hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a
moment of prayer.
FRIAR
The Lord moves in mysterious
ways. I accept.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
You will not regret it.
FRIAR
Aye, but you may.
CUT TO:
A blazing fire. Deer carcasses roast. Tuck's barrels
supply the refreshment. Robin and Aslan pass out coins
to each family.
ROBIN
Buy yourself a new son, Stephen.
FARMER
Thankee, Robin.
Little John and Bull approach. John indicates the two
prisoners roped to a nearby tree.
LITTLE JOHN
Cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa
'em, Rob.
BULL
They'd be spittin' it out good
if they'd knowed anythin'.
LITTLE JOHN
Reckon the Cap'n knows summat, Rob,
but stubborn ol' cocker 'e is.
ASLAN
Perhaps it is time for some
heathen persuasion.
CUT TO:
CAPTAIN OF SOLDIERS
stares up at Robin defiantly.
CAPTAIN
Spare your breath. I know nothing.
ROBIN
(reasonable)
I believe you. But this Arab here,
he's got it into his barbarian
brain that you know a whole lot
more than nothing.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN (CONT'D)
And when he gets like this,
he's very hard to reason with.
With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan
leaps INTO VIEW.
Stripped to the waist, brandishing
his scimitar. The
Captain tries to back away. Robin
tries to restrain
Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,
drooling at the mouth,
Aslan explores the Captain's body
with his hands. A
butcher checking meat.
ROBIN
I strongly advise you to talk.
He hasn't eaten in weeks.
CAPTAIN
(rising terror)
What does he want?
ROBIN
You.
CAPTAIN
For Godsakes, get him off me!
ROBIN
(very deliberately)
No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan.
... How about this other one?...
Fatter, yes... more meat.
The other soldier, who definitely
has more flesh on the
bone, is struck dumb with horror,
as Aslan turns his
attention to him. With one swing
of his sword, Aslan
slices through the man's ropes.
Drags him to his feet.
Little John runs over.
LITTLE JOHN
(urgent)
No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin'
men.
ROBIN
I cannot stop him, John. Besides,
if they will not tell what they
know, then they must pay the price.
LITTLE JOHN
Kill 'em aye, but not like this.
'Tain't Christian.
Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan
has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then
silence.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his
lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end
of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm.
Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates
wildly at the Captain.
CAPTAIN
What does he say?
ROBIN
Well, roughly, he says that he
doesn't care for the way your
friend tastes, and he wants you.
CAPTAIN
No, God, no! I'll talk. Just
keep him away. Keep him away!
BEHIND WAGON
Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth
and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside them
lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed,
except that he's missing a glove.
A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax
wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal
pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the
villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed.
Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager.
FRIAR
God bless you, sir.
VILLAGER
An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar.
They says as 'ow none o' the
Sheriff's cronies dare go within
miles o' Sherwood for fear o'
havin' their pockets pinched.
FRIAR
Ah, the good Lord giveth and the
good Lord taketh away.
OLD WOMAN
Unless Robin Hood takes it first!
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
Laughter. The procession passes two of the Sheriff's
mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his
jug in greeting.
FRIAR
Good morrow, brothers.
Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives
in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS.
He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from
the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant
Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye.
Marian jumps down.
MARIAN
(to Robin)
How dare you!
ROBIN
Good morning, Lady Marian.
In response, she starts pelting him with stones.
MARIAN
You send men to drag me from my
home in the middle of the night,
like some slave girl? Is this
the way the famous Robin Hood
treats a lady?
ROBIN
Ah well... er, let me finish this
bath you wished me to take. Then
I'll explain.
MARIAN
I demand an explanation right now!
ROBIN
If you will be patient, I could
spare your propriety by...
MARIAN
I will decide when my propriety
is compromised.
ROBIN
As you wish.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
He wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her.
She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.
MARIAN
How dare you expose yourself to
me?!
She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water.
Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own
black eye.
BULL
The big 'un did the same to me.
An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a
tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at
his shot.
LITTLE JOHN
(to Wulf)
Right m'lad. Let's see how close
you can git to that bugger.
Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his
father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps
Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
LITTLE JOHN
Take a gander at this 'un, mates.
Never seen nuthin' like it in
my bloomin' life.
Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of
a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not
about to admit it.
MARIAN
This better be damned important.
Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap-
tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats
and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws
back the lid. Marian is speechless.
ROBIN
Nottingham robs the poor. We
rob Nottingham and give back to
the poor.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
MARIAN
Do you think he's going to let
you get away with all this? The
man is without mercy. He will
annihilate you.
ROBIN
Somebody has to take a stand.
MARIAN
You're taking a stand with the
lives of these people. These
young ones.
A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's.
Is there a hint of concern for him also?
MARIAN
What do you want from me?
ROBIN
Nottingham was sending this gold
to buy reinforcements from the
Celtic tribesmen. We need to
warn King Richard.
MARIAN
Nottingham would not dare
challenge the King.
ROBIN
The King is not in England to
be challenged, is he? While he
is away, he may lose his country.
(Marian masks her
concern)
You are Richard's cousin. You
can get word to him. He would
believe you.
MARIAN
Now you want me to participate
in your folly?
A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild
flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering.
CUT TO:
BOUQUET
protrudes from Marian's saddle. She is mounted, ready
to go. Sarah giggles as she takes her leave of Bull.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
(to Marian)
I am sending Duncan with you.
Give him some warm food and a
real bed. I grow tired of his
bellyaching.
DUNCAN
Hah! I have endured more hardship
in my lifetime than any man here.
Robin laughs and speaks to Marian in a stage whisper.
ROBIN
Don't tell him I told you, but
he may be useful to you. There
is no one to whom I would rather
entrust your safety.
MARIAN
Duncan, you are most welcome.
Taking the lead rein from Duncan's horse, she rides away.
ROBIN
(calls after her)
Will you send word to the King?
MARIAN
I'll think about it.
An informal council of war.
Robin uses a stick in the
dirt.
ROBIN
We have to be ready to move camp
at any time. The only way we can
be attacked is from the Nottingham
Road. We hide lookouts in the
trees, here and here. If they
see soldiers, they shoot warning
arrows. Whistles by day, fire
by night.
Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.
WULF
Father!
Come quick.
Mother's
dying.
80.
Hooves fly along a track. Sarah and the courier.
The
courier reins in, Sarah draws alongside.
SARAH
What is wrong?
COURIER
My horse seems to be favoring
a foreleg.
Sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her
across the neck. She falls from the saddle, unconscious.
The campfire. Aslan shrieks a war cry.
Dervishes 'round
the fire, swigging from a jug. Equally
drunk, the Friar
follows, howling, mimicking him. Robin
and the others
watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another
jug and hands it
to Aslan.
FRIAR
Come, you son of Saladin. A toast
to all of Jehovah's children. The
saved and the damned.
ASLAN
This must be a truly evil potion,
to make the soul feel this good.
He downs the entire jug in one long draught.
Refills it.
ASLAN
Come, holy man. A toast to all
of Allah's children. The true
believers and the fat infidels.
Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the
Friar's feet. Heaves up all over the holy sandals. Tuck
looks at Robin.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
FRIAR
How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem
when they can't even hold their
brew?
DISSOLVE TO:
A masked soldier gallops along.
Hurls a bundle to the
ground.
The Friar and the Saracen lie head to head on the dewey
grass. Tuck
snores. Robin shakes Aslan, who grabs for
his weapon.
The hangover hits him like a mallet. He
clutches his temples.
ROBIN
The dancing demon! Good morning.
ASLAN
(wincing)
If it was Jehovah who created this
brew, he is truly wise. He built
the punishment into the crime.
An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree.
Robin reacts.
ROBIN
They need help.
Bull and Hal are crouched in the roadway, over a body.
Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside them. The
body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand... Silence.
Fighting his emotions.
BULL
A bloke wearin' a mask o' the
Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down.
ROBIN
Are you sure it was a Druid mask?
(as Bull nods)
Damn them to hell! They must have
Marian. Do you know where they
meet?
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
BULL
The Gregor Caves, I 'eard tell.
ASLAN
We will go there.
ROBIN
No! You stay here, dammit!
I
will go alone.
ASLAN
You forget yourself.
I am not
your servant.
ROBIN
Then be my friend. There are
women and children here in greater
need of your courage.
ASLAN
(considers)
Take my eyes, then.
He hands Robin his telescope.
CUT TO:
SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin
rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves
cautiously forward.
POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES
No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes.
Remnants of a recent ceremony.
BACK TO SCENE
Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone
circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar.
Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form,
lying face down.
ROBIN
(under his breath)
Marian!
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white
from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across
Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
blackness.
Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering,
glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks
the light from his eyes.
ASLAN
They have poisoned you. There
are herbs that can alter a man's
brain. I know of only one cure.
He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the
other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
down his throat.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
ASLAN
It worked for me this very
morning.
(as Robin heaves)
You will thank me for this later.
Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading
another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across
its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up
in front of him.
ROBIN
You have fulfilled your vow.
Now
you can leave.
ASLAN
Your gratitude warms my heart.
ROBIN
You ignored my request.
ASLAN
It is fortunate that I did.
ROBIN
Because of you, another good man
is dead.
ASLAN
He urged me to bring him. He was
a brave man and I grieve for him.
Praise be to Allah that I do not
grieve for you also. Or for my
broken vow.
ROBIN
To hell with your damn vow.
ASLAN
I am glad you are feeling
better.
Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into
the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the
sky.
ROBIN
The forest!
Ride!
94.
Fire.
Blazing rampant.
Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire
arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming
arrows ignites the trees.
Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback.
One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the
black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.
Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing.
Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion. Little John
vainly attempts to instill calm.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke
ain't gonna kill ya.
Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
Full retreat.
WILL SCARLET
(running up)
It's burning for miles, John.
It's hotter than hades, and them
damn screens ain't worth nothing.
Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of
their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're
impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able-
bodied men to his side.
LITTLE JOHN
'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must
make a stand.
Most of them keep on running.
LITTLE JOHN
Damn y'all! Ya're no more use
than a load o' wet farts.
WILL SCARLET
Where's that damn Locksley?
I'll
swear he betrayed us.

Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody

Hal runs to join them, stuttering.

HAL
Cccc... elts!
WILL SCARLET
Celts?
Where?
HAL
(pointing behind
him)
Gggg... God help us.
Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight.
Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head-
pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie
silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up
to the Chieftain.
NOTTINGHAM
I want prisoners.
The Chieftain does not turn his head.
CHIEFTAIN
We came to fight.
NOTTINGHAM
Nevertheless, I need prisoners.
With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits.
Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol-
diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword.
Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
They charge forward.
The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke
and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the
edge of the clearing.
WILL SCARLET
What are we gonna do, John?
(CONTINUED)
96.

LITTLE JOHN
Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight

Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including
Tack.
LITTLE JOHN
Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin'

FRIAR
This holy man believes in doing
God's work with his hands.
He snatches a quarterstaff.
John slaps him on the back.
The men are encouraged.
LITTLE JOHN
Let's give 'em a bloody good
wallopin' an' all, lads.
Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is
ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em-
battled woodsmen.
ROBIN
Wulf, stay here. I need your
horse.
He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart
of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.
ROBIN
What are you doing?
Out of my
way!
ASLAN
I saved your life. I will not
let you give it away for no
purpose.
ROBIN
Out of my way, damn you!
ASLAN
Does the witch still have
possession of your senses? If
we meet up with the survivors we
may yet give them some help. And
do some damage to the enemy.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
Robin debates.
Relents.
They urge their horses into
a gallop.
The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest.
From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's
men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat,
turn and fire again.
They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries
charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen
drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are
being decimated.
Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy,
inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant.
Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
FRIAR
Surely you would not harm a man
of the cloth?
The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
FRIAR
You would?
Then to hellfire with
you.
He pummels the man to the ground with his staff.
The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group,
including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others
fight on.
Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded
by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out
expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his
attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through
them, slashing with his sword.
LITTLE JOHN
'Bout bleedin' time, mush.
Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver-
ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck
glances heavenwards.
FRIAR
Thank you, Lord.
(an afterthought)
And thank you, Allah.
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
Aslan is a
wild man. Steering his horse with just legs
and knees,
he strikes out with both swords to left and
right. The
momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the
edge of the
clearing. Starts picking off stragglers.
His father
spots him.
LITTLE JOHN
Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,
ya li'l bugger.
Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back...
but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He
freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet.
When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by
three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but
is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down.
Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down
with both swords. Both men topple to the ground
simultaneously.
Suddenly all is quiet.
The smoking clearing is a mass
of fallen bodies. Only
four men seem to be alive.
Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who
is slouched against a tree
gasping for breath, and
Hal, who kneels clutching his
wounded shoulder.
Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed
and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
LITTLE JOHN
Don't 'ee start bleedin'
blubberin', or ya'll make me
bloody vomit.
Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over.
All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen.
ASLAN
It was a fiendish mind that
planned this campaign.
A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a
grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery.
Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags
a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor
and weapons into a growing pile.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
You were an honor to your
countrymen today, Aslan. You
fought better than twenty
English knights.
ASLAN
This war is the God of Abraham
against the forces of evil.
ROBIN
Well, the war is over.
He stares across the desolate clearing.
ROBIN
There is too much blood on my
hands.
A winter's night. Bitterly
cold.
Sad figures huddled
around a small fire. Fanny
tends to John's wounds, their
little ones asleep by their
feet.
John drinks and passes
the jug to Tuck, who numbly
shakes his head. Too
depressed even to drink.
Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who
sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
ROBIN
My pride brought us to this.
ASLAN
No, friend. It was you who gave
these men pride.
ROBIN
I gave them nothing but false
hope. Tomorrow we will disperse.
These people can move south and
start over. You must go home and
win your Jasmina.
ASLAN
And you?
ROBIN
I am no longer your responsibility.
ASLAN
That is for me to decide.
ROBIN
(raging)
Damn you, Arab. I want you out of
my life. Can't you understand
that? Go home. Go back to your
own kind.
Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for
argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips
it from his neck.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Damn you, too, Father.
You reared
a coward and a fool.
He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging
branch.
CUT TO:
NOVEMBER MOON
Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion,
dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees
before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white
moon against the black sky...
DISSOLVE TO:
ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
-- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner.
The round medallion has become a noose.
In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls
on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of
death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another
-- Bull. Another -- Marian.
MARIAN
Kiss me, Robin.
The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face
shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.
Next, Robin's father.
He stares accusingly right AT us.
LOCKSLEY
Why have you betrayed me?
Why?
Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his
hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope.
His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous
cacophony.
DISSOLVE TO:
ROBIN'S FACE
DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of
a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away
the horror.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
The first streaks of light fight their way through a
thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure,
at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence,
Robin looks up.
ROBIN
Will!
I thought you were taken.
WILL SCARLET
I was.
ROBIN
How did you escape?
WILL SCARLET
I promised to kill you.
ROBIN
And will you?
Before Will can answer, Little John runs up.
Grabs
Will's throat.
LITTLE JOHN
I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will
Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a
bloody favor an' all.
Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with
kids clinging to her skirts.
FANNY
Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im
if Wulf be still alive.
Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold
just enough for Will to splutter out...
WILL SCARLET
Y... e...
LITTLE JOHN
Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put
the bleedin' weasel outa 'is
misery.
ROBIN
John, wait.
Let us hear what he
has to say.
LITTLE JOHN
No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff,
'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin'
pockets.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
A traitor sneaks in and out under
cover of darkness. Will walked in
and announced himself.
LITTLE JOHN
(dismissive)
Aye.
'E always did 'ave balls o'
brass.
HAL
Let's sss... string 'im up.
ROBIN
Let him speak.
John reluctantly moves his hold from Will's neck to his
shoulders.
LITTLE JOHN
Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a
bloody blade on 'im somewheres.
Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's
shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and
fresh burns.
LITTLE JOHN
Bugger me.
He steps back.
Ready to listen.
WILL SCARLET
I bring a message from Nottingham.
Our men are to be hung in the
square on Saturday. At high noon.
FANNY
What about my boy?
WILL SCARLET
The boy, too.
Ten men in all.
Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder.
WILL SCARLET
Their
deaths are a warning.
Anyone
who associates with the
outlaw
Hood is to suffer the same
fate.
Man, woman, or child. Even
anyone
who so much as utters his
name.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
FRIAR
Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin
Hood!
(chuckles)
May as well be hung for a sheep as
a lamb.
WILL SCARLET
The hangings are to be part of the
celebration for the Sheriff's
marriage.
LITTLE JOHN
Marriage, eh? What lucky wench
gits to play with the Sheriff's
codpiece?
Will turns his gaze directly on Robin.
WILL SCARLET
Lady Marian.
FRIAR
He takes a bride of royal blood?
LITTLE JOHN
Aye, and then with King Richard
gone, he takes the bloody throne.
Everyone reacts with shock.
Only Robin appears unsur-
prised.
ROBIN
You were to use this news to get
close to me, and then kill me?
Right, Will?
WILL SCARLET
(sly grin)
Not straightway, of course.
ROBIN
What is your intention, Will?
WILL SCARLET
That depends on you, Locksley.
ROBIN
How so?
WILL SCARLET
I've never trusted you, that's no
secret. What I wanna know is, are
you gonna finish what you started?
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
Robin is on the spot.
All eyes on him.
Will presses his
point.
WILL SCARLET
Will ya stay and keep us fightin'
till every man jack of us is dead?
Or will you run like the spoiled
little rich boy I always took you
for?
ROBIN
You present quite a choice.
What
would you have me do, Will?
WILL SCARLET
If you run, I will kill you.
ROBIN
And if I stay, will you all stay
with me?
Robin checks the other faces.
ASLAN
To the end, friend.
FRIAR
If my heathen brother stays, I
stay.
HAL
Mmmm... meee... tttt...
He can't get it out.
Little John covers Hal's mouth.
LITTLE JOHN
'E's in. We're all bloody in.
Daft buggers.
ROBIN
There's your answer, Will.
We
finish it.
Ten gallows, silhouetted against the setting sun. The
black-armored Celt tests a gallows, springing the hatch.
A heavy sack dangles from the rope. Grim-faced peasants
watch. Among
them -- Fanny Little.
107.
In the troubled human realm, Tuck says his morning
prayer.
FRIAR
Lord, grant us the courage to
endure, and if you're as smart as
I believe you are, grant us
victory... and the victuals to
celebrate it with.
Aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow
powder, which is turning black. Tuck approaches.
FRIAR
Will you pray with me, son of
Allah?
ASLAN
I have prayed for you, often, my
brother. But, let us put prayer
aside and help our gods in a more
practical manner. I must reveal
to you the mysteries of the black
powder.
Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to
examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can
react, Robin walks up.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
Will it work?
Aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel A fire-
ball rips ten feet in the air... Tuck falls on his ass
in terror.
ROBIN
(impressed)
You are truly a wizard.
ASLAN
There is no such thing. But if
there was...
(chuckles)
... I would surely be one.
Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of
bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's
hand as he speaks.
ROBIN
We have no armored knights, no
glorious banners. But I am
honored to be going to battle in
this company. Today we fight not
just for the lives of our friends,
but to save all England.
A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand.
ROBIN
We may be only six men, but...
FANNY
Seven!
She strides towards them from the trees.
LITTLE JOHN
What in blazes ya doin', woman?
Where's the little 'uns?
FANNY
Them's safe, wi' my mother.
(pushes past Little
John)
Robin, I been to town an' seen the
scaffold and the guard towers.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya gone bleedin' cracked, girl?
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
FANNY
You go an' birth eight babies and
then you can come an' tell me
'bout hurtin', ya big ox. I ain't
gonna sit aroun' an' let one o'
'em die, neither.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya should be bloody well mindin'
the other seven. Tell 'er, Rob.
Robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a
stick.
ROBIN
Fanny, show me the exact location
of the scaffold.
Little John double-takes.
The gallows. Swathed in a pink glow. A brilliant,
wintry morning. Breath billows from the mouths of the
sentries.
Masses stream in. They give wide berth to a Celtic war-
rior in a boar's head helmet. Soldiers prod and harness
the passing peasants. Tuck drives a cartload of barrels.
A GUARD stops him.
GUARD
What you got there, Father?
FRIAR
The Lord's finest brew for the
good Nottingham's fighting men.
It has a mighty kick.
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
GUARD
(smiling)
I'll warrant. Pass.
Wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out.
Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse, the people are
too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his
baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
amusement. A
yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being
shoved back by guards.
WILL SCARLET
Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have
word for you! Of Robin Hood!
Nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards, who rides
over, grabs Will by the collar, and drags him to his
side.
NOTTINGHAM
Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?
WILL SCARLET
I found his lair, but alas he still
lives.
The Sheriff strikes down with his armored hand.
Will
crumples.
NOTTINGHAM
Stretch his neck with the others.
Hands yank Will to his feet. Dazed, he tries to speak.
Disinterested, Nottingham turns away, until he catches...
WILL SCARLET
...He... He... is here!
NOTTINGHAM
Locksley, here? Where ?
Will struggles to get free of his holders.
WILL SCARLET
Call off your dogs.
NOTTINGHAM
Release him!... Now, where is he?
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
WILL SCARLET
I want your word, in front of
these witnesses. If I tell you,
I will go free.
NOTTINGHAM
(scoffs)
We will find him.
WILL SCARLET
He is concealed. He is going to
free the prisoners and stop the
wedding.
Nottingham's jaw tightens.
Eyes the prisoners, the
scaffold.
NOTTINGHAM
Put Hood in my hands, you go free.
WILL SCARLET
With the reward. Ten thousand
crowns.
NOTTINGHAM
Damn your worthless hide!
Just
tell me where he is.
WILL SCARLET
The reward!
The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf
charges at him, screaming in blind rage. Soldiers grab
Wulf. Throw him down, kicking and beating. Voices in
the crowd plead to let him be. Someone tries to
intervene, gets hurled down.
NOTTINGHAM
(to Will)
You'll get your reward. Where
is he?
CUT TO:
Tuck urges his ancient nag towards the scaffold with his
cargo of barrels. The crowd parts unwillingly.
FRIAR
Out of the way. Make way for
the Lord's business.
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's
direction.
A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large
figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John.
He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall
itself. He slips frequently.
The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded
executioner waits, along with the Chieftain. Wulf
staggers, from his beating.
Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart.
He watches them
nervously.
Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far
below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's
sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his
fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls...
desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging
by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.
Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.
NOTTINGHAM
Step down, friar.
FRIAR
As you wish, sire. Is there
something amiss?
NOTTINGHAM
This man claims you have outlaws
concealed in these barrels. Among
them the cursed Robin Hood.
Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.
FRIAR
This man will rot in hell as a
knave and a liar. These are
libations for the celebration
of your lordship's nuptials.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
NOTTINGHAM
Break one open!
FRIAR
(nervous)
Why waste fine vintage, my lord?
A cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
WILL SCARLET
Try another. There are many
barrels, only a few outlaws.
A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the
scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
steps -- Wulf.
Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
a flame.
John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He
nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks
the man's view.
SENTRY
What is your business, woman?
FANNY
Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly
view up 'ere, ain't it?
She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to
her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams
his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times.
He slumps unconscious.
Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
branch crutch.
WOUNDED SOLDIER
Give room for a fightin' man and
his ma. Step aside, or I'll make
ya. I wanna see the bastards walk
on air.
116.
John struggles over the battlement.
Collapses.
FANNY
'Bout time, ya gurt lug.
She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an
arrow.
FANNY
We be too late.
The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain
guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround
the base.
The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose.
SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
barrels.
A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow.
The executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
Nottingham intently watches Wulf.
The Chieftain stands, impassive.
Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.
His eyes close.
An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
slit.
The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but
the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
Wulf's body plunges.
The rope snaps tight.
Little John yells.
Fanny screams.
A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier
throws aside his crutch... Robin!
Wulf dangles, strangling.
His hands wrench at the
choking cord.
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:
The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the
smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting
it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his
effort to escape.
The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked...
by the Celt with the boar's head.
KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing
smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
confusion.
Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's
rope. He hauls him onto the platform.
Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes
the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig...
It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his
arm.
HAL
Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
WOODSMAN
Hal! What happened to your
stutter?
HAL
It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap!
A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
HAL
Take that, ya mug.
No stutter this time!
The woodsmen join battle with the
guards.
The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head.
The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan.
CHIEFTAIN
Impostor!
You dishonor the clan.
Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering
blows.
FROM PARAPET
John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch
Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him.
LITTLE JOHN
Fight fair...
(CONTINUED)
118.
CONTINUED:
He aims.
Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a
shaft.
LITTLE JOHN
...Or don't fight at all.
ON SCENE
Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking
out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the
trap hole.
Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight
with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and
mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and
around the horse's legs.
Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at
his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood.
Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It
EXPLODES.
The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the
parapet.
GREYBEARD BARON
Up there!
No mercy, shoot them!
Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.
Bolts ricochet
all around Little John and Fanny.
ON SCAFFOLD
Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.
ON SCENE
Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a
soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
armor.
The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his
horse. Will leaps on him.
(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:
WILL SCARLET
Pain or death, you butcher?
The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him.
Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by
four men.
NOTTINGHAM
Here's another message to Robin
Hood, written in your blood.
He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
belly.
WILL SCARLET
It's over, fool. You can kill my
body, but you cannot kill our
spirit.
He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.
REDHEAD BARON
It's Hood!
Get him!
The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.
Aslan loses his sword.
CHIEFTAIN
I am iron.
I am rock. I am your
death.
Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
ASLAN
You talk too much!
He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
ASLAN
Englishmen! I am not one of you,
yet I fight for you. Against a
tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin
Hood.
The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen
soldiers, many join the fray.
(CONTINUED)
120.
CONTINUED:
Nottingham runs through the castle gate.
Angry peasants
pursue.
NOTTINGHAM
Lower the portcullis! Now!
A guard winds down the giant gate.
Nottingham hurls him
aside.
NOTTINGHAM
Too slow, fool!
He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.
Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees
with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he
staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly
peasants
are swarming over his attacker. The baron is
dragged off
and trampled down.
ROBIN
Friends!
We must raise the gate.
Crossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while
spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both
sides.
LITTLE JOHN
Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers.
Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies.
He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he
leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs
his sword.
LITTLE JOHN
Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind
if I borrow this?
He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to
one.
Robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis.
Robin leaps onto Tuck's cart.
ROBIN
Light all the barrels, Tuck.
(CONTINUED)
122.
CONTINUED:
Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across
the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels.
FUSES smoke and CRACKLE.
ROBIN
Jump!
Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the
last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the
horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is
blown to kingdom come.
Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger.
Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.
Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More
peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated
men. Aslan's a whirlwind,
striking out in all
directions. Each blow for
a cause.
ASLAN
For Allah!... For Jehovah!
For brotherhood!... For
justice!
John is in deep trouble, but undaunted.
LITTLE JOHN
Ya gutless bloody sissies.
Someone attacks his assailants from the rear.
The tide
turns.
LITTLE JOHN
Wulf! I told ya to keep outa the
fightin'.
(CONTINUED)
125.
CONTINUED:
WULF
Sorry, Father. Couldn't help
myself.
LITTLE JOHN
Well, ya'll get a bloody good
wallopin' if we get 'ome... For
now, let's see how well I taught
ya.
Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet.
A crossbow bolt strikes Hal between his shoulder blades.
He falls. The Sheriff's soldiers are regaining the
advantage. The peasants are giving up, dropping their
weapons.
HAL
No!
Fight on. Fight!
He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged
prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
FRIAR
Sinners, beware! God's avengers
are at hand.
Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.
HAL
Go' bless ya, Tuck.
Tuck flails a chain at a Celt.
FRIAR
Repent, heathen!
The man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning...
Aslan!
A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the
fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants
and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms,
knives, hooks, and bedpans.
Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers
down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice.

ASLAN
What you fear is not below.
He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams
hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest.
Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all
reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it
further through her body in her effort to get at him.
Clutching, screeching, hissing.
Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the
last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle-
ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to
the ground.
Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts
her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes
out. A spitfire.
MARIAN
Let me go!
Who are you?
(CONTINUED)
129.
CONTINUED:
ROBIN
(restraining her)
I'm your sworn protector.
Any
way I see fit.
Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder,
Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the
fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water.
She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back.
Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers,
enjoying the show.
MARIAN
Robin?
Oh God, is that you?
She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
pounding her fists on his chest.
MARIAN
How dare you?!
Robin grins at the crowd.
ROBIN
I think she's feeling better.
Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of
battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against
Robin's chest.
Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and
Fanny.
LITTLE JOHN
We done it, mate. We clobbered
the buggers.
FANNY
Are you 'urt?
ROBIN
It will mend.
He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of
Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's
head.
ROBIN
Aslan, my friend.
(CONTINUED)
130.
CONTINUED:
ASLAN
I'm going home the easy way,
Robin.
FRIAR
(shaking Aslan)
You die on me, you son of satan,
and I swear I'll bury you as a
Christian in St. Catherine's
Cathedral with a thousand monks
chanting prayers for your
miserable soul. You hear me?
ASLAN
(weakly)
I have no strength, Brother Tuck.
FRIAR
(kicking him)
A fine friend you are! By the
grace of Allah and Jehovah we
have won the day, and you want to
give up the ghost. I'll pickle
your remains in mead, lay you
in your grave with a pig for a
companion, and mark it with a
cross as big as this castle.
ASLAN
Please!
It hurts when I laugh.
FRIAR
See. There's life in the heathen
dog yet.
ROBIN
(laughs)
Here, Tuck. Look after him.
You
deserve each other.
Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering
grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.
CROWD
Robin Hood!
Robin Hood!
DISSOLVE TO:
WEDDING BELLS PEAL. Robin and Marian step out into the
sunlight. The crowd cheers. At a signal from Little
John, the ex-outlaws shoot flaming arrows into the sky...
FIREWORKS...
FADE OUT.
