      30 s) talks on her Bluetooth, while correcting her daughter s 
      homework and feeding celery to a rabbit.

                    None of the evidence is admissable.  
                    It s all fruit of the poison tree.

      Alex hits mutes and turns to her 8 year old daughter, 
      FRANKIE, who s eating breakfast and points to her homework.

                    Only one wrong.  The capital of

                    I know.  It makes no sense.

                    She just got divorced.  It s all 
                    about the kid right now.

      Alex nods in agreement, the guy walks off, shot down. 


      Pete waits as a family places their order at the counter, 
      then steps up to a cute girl, LUCY.

      school bus.  Her cell rings.  The office again.  She looks 
      down at her briefcase, Claude is gnawing on it.

                    I fired him because I m sick of 
                    people in my life letting me down.  
                    I hired him to fix my house, not 
                    bang my childcare.  I could use a

      Pete sits at a Gamblers Anonymous meeting as a middle aged 
      Beverly Hills HOUSEWIFE shares her story.

                    And I m like no, not today.  So I 
                    went to the gym.  And it worked.  I 
                    didn t call my bookie.

      Pete takes this in.  


      They enter the lobby near closing time.  We see the back of a 
      man playing the piano.  It s James.  Pete turns to Frankie.

                                  PETE
                    Wait here.

      He crosses over to James.

                                  JAMES
                    There s my boy.  Remember this one?

                    I do.  Can you do me a favor?

                                  JAMES
                    Son, the world.

                                  PETE
                    Let that girl sit in and play a 
                    song. 

                                  JAMES
                          (shakes his head no)
                    Wouldn t be fair to my audience.

                          (beat)
                    One song.  No ballads. 

      Pete gestures for Frankie to cross over.

                                  PETE
                    Play your song.  These people don t 
                    care. 

      Frankie reluctantly sits down next to James.  

                                  JAMES
                    What re you thinking?

                    Not a crowd pleaser but take your 
                    swing. 

      Frankie looks around, hesitates.  James nods.  Just do it.  
      She plays, hesitantly at first, then a little better.  Pete 
      smiles.

                    What the hell s going on?

      Alex appears, pissed.

                    No.  I think you re resilient.  And

                    That s the scariest thing anyone s 
                    ever said to me.

      They both laugh.  It feels good after the year they ve both

                    Awesome.  8 would be better.

      She shoots him a look.  The manager makes James stop singing.  
      Pete and Alex clap.  James takes a bow, tells Frankie to do 
      the same.
