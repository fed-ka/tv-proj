      The white becomes snowfall, a blizzard.  Through it we can 
      make out a two lane road.  A car emerges from the snow -- 
      rust-spotted, chains on the tires -- coming towards us.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lester stands outside the store, staring in through the plate 
      glass window at a brand new washer dryer set.  He s wearing a 
      puffy orange coat and a wool hat with ear flaps.

      An SUV pulls up down the block.  SAM HESS, 40, climbs out 
      with his TWIN SONS, MICKEY and MOE, 15.  Hess is a big guy, 
      intimidating.  His boys look like two identical blocking 
      sleds.

                                  SAM HESS
                          (to the driver)
                    Circle for a bit.  I m gonna feed 
                    the boys.

      The SUV pulls away.  Hess and sons walk towards Lester.

                                  MOE
                    Dad said I could get pie for lunch.

                                  MICKEY
                          (snickers)
                    Ya. Hair pie.

      Sam WACKS Mickey in the back of the head.  Moe cracks up. 
      Oblivious, Lester stares at the washer dryer.  Walking by, 
      Hess recognizes him.

                                  SAM HESS
                          (stopping)
                    Will ya look at that. It s Lester 
                    Niggered.

      Lester turns, sees Hess.  It takes a moment for him to 
      recognize him, but when he does he looks nervous.                                                                                      7.


                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Come on now, Sam.  It s -- well, 
                    it s Nygaard.  Same as in high 
                    school.

                                  MICKEY
                    You went to high school with Lester 
                    Niggered, dad?

                                  MOE
                    Ya, dad, did you --

                                  SAM HESS
                    Shut up.  How you been, Lester?

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Oh, can t complain.

                                  SAM HESS
                    You look like a damn pumpkin.  You 
                    turn into a pumpkin at midnight?  
                    You got stepsisters?

                                  MICKEY
                      Stepsisters were evil, dad.  They 
                    weren t fairies.

                                  SAM HESS
                    Shutup.

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Um, uh.  You look good, Sam.

                                  SAM HESS
                    Why wouldn t I?  Got my own 
                    trucking company now.  Hess and 
                    Sons. These are the sons. God help 
                    me.

                                  MICKEY
                    Yeah, we re the ...

                                  SAM HESS
                    Shutup.  Got rigs all over the 
                    Great Lakes.  
                          (to his sons)
                    Hey, you remember I told you the 
                    story of the boy I put in the oil 
                    drum and rolled onto the highway?

                                  MICKEY
                    Is that him, dad?                                                                                      8.


                                  MOE
                    Ya, dad.  Is that him?

                                  SAM HESS
                    Oh you betcha.  Good old Lester 
                    pencil dick.  Say, Lester.  What 
                    was the name of that girl you went 
                    with in high school?  The curvy 
                    one?

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Pearl.  

                                  SAM HESS
                    Ya, Pearl.  What a rack on that 
                    girl.  

                                  MOE
                          (to Mickey)
                    Dad s saying she had big titties.

                                  MICKEY
                    I know what rack means, ya fairy.

      Hess smacks both boys in the back of the head.

                                  MICKEY (CONT D)
                    Ow.

                                  MOE
                    Ya, dad. Ow.

                                  SAM HESS
                          (to Lester)
                    You know she gave me a tug once. 
                      Homecoming, senior year.  Had these 
                    nice fat hands.  Real soft.  Let me 
                    feel up her tits while she did it.

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    We re married now.  Going on 
                    eighteen years.

      Sam is taken off guard by this.  The kids crack up.

                                  MICKEY
                    Oh, dad.  That s embarrassing.

                                  MOE
                    Ya, dad. Super embarrassing.

      Hess s eyes narrow. His face is burning and he doesn t like 
      the feeling.                                                                                      9.


                                  SAM HESS
                    Eighteen years, huh? That s 
                      something.  
                          (beat)
                    Never knew what she saw in you, 
                    really. 

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Oh, well --

                                  SAM HESS
                    I mean, help me out.  No looks. Or 
                    brains. Or money.

      Lester can tell he s in danger.

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Ya. Well.  I should get back to it.

      But Hess moves in front of Lester.

                                  SAM HESS
                    A little guy like you.

                                  MICKEY
                    He s real small dad.

                                  MOE
                    A real pee wee.

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Ha. Ya. Real good seeing you, Sam.  
                    Real good.  And meeting your boys.

      But Hess won t let him go

                                  SAM HESS
                          (to his sons)
                    Did I ever tell you how I used to 
                    beat this little guy up in high 
                    school?  I d write my name on my 
                    fist in Sharpie fore I punched him, 
                    so everyone would know who did it.

                                  MICKEY
                    That s a good one, dad.

                                  MOE
                    Ya, dad.  A real good one.

      Hess lifts his fist, shows Lester.

                                  SAM HESS
                    Remember?                                                                                    10.


                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    Ha.  Ya.  That was -- a long time 
                    ago.

      Slowly, Hess moves his fist right in front of Lester s face, 
      enjoying his fear.  Lester stands there, humiliated, not 
      knowing what to do.  Hating his helplessness, his base 
      cowardice.

      Then Hess drops his fist and smiles to show it s all just a 
      big joke.  Lester starts to relax.  Then HESS FAKES A PUNCH.  
      Lester panics, turns and RUNS FACE FIRST into the PLATE GLASS 
      WINDOW of the appliance store -- CRACK!  He falls to the 
      ground, lays on his back.

                                  MICKEY
                    Geez, dad.  His face is pretty 
                    messed up.

                                  MOE
                    Ya, dad.  It s real messed up.

      CLOSE UP OF LESTER S FACE

      As he lays there, his nose broken and bleeding, staring up at 
      the sky.  Beat. We PULL OUT and discover we are now in ...


      The site of Malvo s accident.  The car is still there, its 
      trunk now closed. TWO POLICE CARS are parked nearby, lights 
      flashing.  DEPUTY MOLLY SOLVERSON, 29 stands behind the 
      wreck, kicking her feet to stay warm.

      A THIRD CAR pulls up.  Police Chief VERN THURMAN (40s) gets 
      out. Molly comes over to greet him.

                                  MOLLY
                    Cold enough for ya, chief?

                                  VERN
                    Supposed to get down to negative 
                    ten later.

                                  MOLLY
                    Heard that. Don t much like the 
                    sound of negative.

                                  VERN
                    Thought I might strip down to my 
                    shorts.  Work on my tan.
                          (nods)
                    So what s this here then?

      Molly shows him the scene.

                                  MOLLY
                    Chief, I arrived on the scene at 
                    thirteen hundred hours, found this 
                    late model Ford.  Looks like she 
                    rolled a few times. I found a set 
                    of footprints leading away from the 
                    car.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    16.

                                  MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Possible our driver, injured, got 
                    confused, wandered into the woods. 
                    I was about to investigate.

      Vern circles the car, crouches at the front grill.

                                  VERN
                    Blood here.  Hair too.

                                  MOLLY
                    Saw that.  I was thinkin  maybe a 
                    deer, but couldn t find the 
                    evidence.

      Vern walks out into the road, looking for something.  Fresh 
      snow covers everything.  Vern does some mental calculations, 
      picks a spot and kicks the snow away.

                                  VERN
                    Here it is.

      Molly looks down, sees the underlayer of snow is pink with 
      blood.

                                  MOLLY
                    Son of a gun.

      Vern walks back to the car.  The driver s door is open.

                                  VERN
                          (leans in)
                      Windshield s cracked.  Blood there 
                    too.  Driver musta hit his head

                                  MOLLY
                    Or her head.

      Vern hears something, straightens.  It comes again louder.  
      THUMPING.  From the trunk.

                                  VERN
                    You check the trunk?

                                  MOLLY
                    No, sir.

      The thumping continues.  Vern and Molly approach the trunk.

      ANGLE ON THE TRUNK

      Something is inside, banging.                                                                                    17.


      VERN

      Thinks about opening it, the pros and cons.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Should I unholster my sidearm?

                                  VERN
                    Not unless you think there s a 
                    ninja inside.

      He reaches down and pops the trunk.  It swings open, 
      revealing:

      THE DEER

      Still alive, flailing weakly.

      VERN AND MOLLY

      Look at the deer.

                                  MOLLY
                    Huh.

      Vern takes out his gun, puts the deer out of its misery. They 
      stand for a moment in silence, breath misty.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                          (beat)
                    So -- wanna take a look at those 
                      footprints then?

                                  VERN
                    Sounds good.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Vern and Molly, flashlights on, trudge through the deep snow.

                                  MOLLY
                          (beat, walking)
                    How s Ida?

                                  VERN
                    Any day now.

                                  MOLLY
                    You got a name picked out?                                                                                    18.

                    I can t even get that woman to 
                    decide what color to paint the 
                    nursery.

                                  MOLLY
                          (beat, walking)
                    Can t believe I missed that deer in 
                    the trunk.

                                  VERN
                    Don t be.  I been doin this a long 
                    time.  Never checked for a deer in 
                    the trunk. (Beat) Or any wildlife.

      Molly sees something.

                                  MOLLY
                    Chief.

      He looks where her flashlight is pointed.  There, sitting in 
      the snow, is A MAN IN HIS UNDERWEAR, frozen to death.

                                  VERN
                          (beat)
                    Okay.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      An expensive two story home.  Lester and Pearl stand on the 
      threshold with a meatloaf.  Lester s broken nose is taped, 
      his eyes black.

                                  PEARL
                    How does a grown man fall over his 
                    own feet?

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                    It was ice.  I slipped on ice.
                          (feels his nose)
                    We should have cancelled.

                                  PEARL
                    Don t be a baby.

      Unhappy, Lester rings the bell. SCOTTY, 9, opens the door. 

                                  LESTER NYGAARD
                          (animated)
                    We re here.

      The boy SLAMS the door in their face.  Beat.  Lester rings 
      the bell again.  KITTY NYGAARD, 32, opens the door.  She s 
      pretty, well appointed.

                                  LESTER NYGAARD (CONT D)
                          (tries again)
                    We re here.                                                                                    24.


                                  KITTY
                    Come on in. Ron s working the ham.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Molly pulls up in her prowler.  Vern comes out, climbs in.  
      Molly hands him a coffee.

                                  VERN
                    Thanks.

      Molly drives.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ida sleeping?

                                  VERN
                    Ya.                                                                                    31.


                                  MOLLY
                    Bill s over the Lucky Penny.  Says 
                    it s a real mess.

                                  VERN
                    Bar fight?

                                  MOLLY
                    Nope.  Ya know those back rooms 
                    they got for hanky panky? Well, 
                    sounds like a customer was givin  
                    it to one of the girls.  Got 
                    himself stabbed in the head.

                                  VERN
                    The girl stabbed him?

                                  MOLLY
                    Bill says no.  Says it was an 
                      assassination type deal. 

                                  VERN
                          (thinks about that)
                    Huh.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Malvo approaches his room.  The teen is shoveling snow 
      nearby.                                                                                    34.


                                  MALVO
                    Why do you let her talk to you like 
                    that?

                                  TEEN
                    Aw, she s not that bad.  

                                  MALVO
                    Son, she compared you to a clam. 

      The teen thinks about it.  The woman is kind of a bitch.

                                  TEEN
                    Well, what should I do?

                                  MALVO
                    Guy insulted me once. I pissed in 
                    his gas tank.  Car never drove 
                    straight again.

      The teen smiles, puts down the shovel.  He walks over to the 
      woman s car.  Malvo lets himself into his room.


      Molly stands beside her prowler outside the hospital.

                                  MOLLY
                    Chief, I m over at the hospital. I 
                    was checkin on the Hess boy and --

                                  VERN
                    How is he?

                                  MOLLY
                    Uh, he s, uh -- you know, there 
                    could be some brain damage.

                                  VERN
                    That s a shame.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ya.  Hey, so I got ta talkin to Sue 
                      Roundtree, and I asked her if 
                    they d had any head injuries lately 
                    -- ya know my theory about the 
                    driver in that wreck -- and Sue 
                    says they did yesterday.  A 
                    peculiar fella, she says.  Real 
                    intense.  And here s where it gets 
                      interesting.  Cause she says the 
                    fella with the head injury was 
                    talkin to another fella.  About Sam 
                    Hess.                                                                                    50.


                                  VERN
                    Oh yeah?

                                  MOLLY
                    Yessir.  Says the two was thick as 
                    thieves.  So suddenly I m thinking, 
                    maybe these two cases, maybe 
                    they re connected, huh?

                                  VERN
                          (impressed)
                    Could be.  She say who the other 
                    fella was?

                                  MOLLY
                          (looks in her pad)
                    Lester Nygaard.

                                  VERN
                    Really.

                                  MOLLY
                    You know him.

                                  VERN
                    Sure.  I know Lester.  Sells 
                    insurance over at Bo s shop.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ya. I called over.  They re closed.  
                    So I was gonna go by Lester s 
                    place.

                                  VERN
                    No.  I know Lester.  I ll do it.  
                    You call it a day.  Good work.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Molly pounds on the door.

                                  MOLLY
                    Saint Cloud Police.  Open up.

      Nothing.  She looks in the nearest window, sees Vern laying 
      dead on the hall floor.  

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                          (upset)
                    Oh. Oh.

      She keys her handset.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Officer -- officer down! Send help.

      She pulls her weapon, starts kicking the front door.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    60.



      A state police car is parked on the blind side of an 
      overpass.  Nearby a sign reads Duluth 10 miles.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Gus approaches the driver s side, flashlight out.  The inside 
      of the car is dark, ominous.  We can t see the driver.

      Then the driver s side window rolls down.  Now we see the 
      driver is Lorne Malvo.

                                  MALVO
                    Evening, officer.

                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    License and registration please.

                                  MALVO
                    Well, we could do it that way.  You 
                    ask me for my papers and I tell you 
                    it s not my car.  That I borrowed 
                    it.  And see where things go from 
                    there.  We could do that.  Or, you 
                    could just get back in your car and 
                    drive away.

                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    Why would I do that?

                                  MALVO
                    Because some roads you shouldn t go 
                    down.  Because maps used to say 
                    there be dragons here.  And now 
                    they don t.  But that don t mean 
                    the dragons aren t there.

      From the prowler, we hear Kurt s walkie talkie.

                                  KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
                    Dad.  Come in, dad.  Over.

                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    Step out of the car, please.

                                  MALVO
                    How old is your son?

      Gus puts his hand on his revolver.                                                                                    63.


                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    I said step out of the car.

                                  KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
                    Dad.  Come in, dad.  Over.

                                  MALVO
                    Let me tell you what s going to 
                    happen, Officer Grimly. I m gonna 
                    roll up my window.  And then I m 
                    gonna drive away.  And you re gonna 
                    go home to your son.  And every few 
                    years you re gonna look at his face 
                    and know that you re alive because 
                    you chose not to go down a certain 
                    road on a certain night.  Because 
                    you chose to walk into the light, 
                    instead of into darkness.  Do you 
                      understand?

                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    Sir.

                                  MALVO
                    I m rolling up my window.

      The window rolls up.  Gus stands there, knowing he should 
      pull his gun.  That he should order Malvo out of the car, but 
      something stops him.  The feeling the rabbit gets in the 
      presence of the wolf.

      So he stands there as Malvo s car pulls away.

                                  KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
                    Dad.  Come in, dad.  Over.

      Gus walks back to the car, climbs in, closes the door.  Beat.  
      He picks up the walkie talkie.

                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    Dad here. Over.

                                  KURT GRIMLY
                    Detroit just got a touchdown. Over.
                          (beat)
                    Dad?  Are you there?  Over.

      Beat.  Gus sits, shaken.

                                  GUS GRIMLY
                    I hear ya.  We ll get  em in the 
                    fourth. And hey, don t forget ta do

                    you.                                                                                    64.


      A long silence.

                                  KURT GRIMLY
                    Ya didn t say over.  Over.

                    Over and out.

      Beat.  Gus sits in his warm car, while outside the 
      temperature drops.  Then he picks up his note pad, examines 
      Malvo s license plate number. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It s really snowing now.  Every police car in town is there, 
      along with fire trucks and an ambulance. Patrolmen go in and 
      out of the house.  Molly sits on a planter by the front door, 
      in shock.

      Inside the lobby we can see Vern s body covered with a 
      blanket.  After a moment, Molly gets to her feet and walks 
      down the driveway.

      She passes Vern s prowler.  Something inside catches her eye.

      ANGLE ON TWO CANS OF HOUSE PAINT

      In the back seat.

      MOLLY

      Stands looking in at them, and all they represent.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Molly s car pulls up.  She gets out, grabs the paint cans, 
      starts for the house.  There are responsibilities she will 
      take on now, unspoken promises that must be kept.  

      The front door opens.  Ida comes out.  She knows from Molly s 
      face that the worst has happened. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Molly s dad, Lou, unpacks fishing gear from the back of his 
      Suburban.  Molly, in civilian clothes, sits on the tailgate, 
      looking out at the snow.  Her prowler is parked nearby.

                                  LOU
                    I got two kinds of sandwiches.  
                    Tuna and turkey.
                          (beat, off her)
                    Tuna s for the fish.  Unless ya 
                    think they d think that s 
                      cannibalism.

      Molly doesn t answer.  Lou offloads a cooler.

                                  LOU (CONT D)
                    Nice service yesterday, I thought.  
                    Simple.

      Beat.  Molly is lost in thought.

                                  LOU (CONT D)
                    Ya know, I been looking for some 
                    more help at the restaurant.  
                    Someone to seat customers.  Answer 
                    the phones.

                                  MOLLY
                          (absently)
                      A hostess.

                                  LOU
                    That what they call it?  Anyway, 
                    not sure if that was somethin  you 
                    might be interested in.

                                  MOLLY
                          (this gets a look)
                    I m a police officer, dad.                                                                                    66.


                                  LOU
                    Well, sure.  I know that.  I also 
                    know that people in this world are 
                    less inclined to shoot a hostess, 
                    than, say, an officer of the law.

                                  MOLLY
                          (beat)
                    That s true.

      He kicks snow off his boots.

                                  LOU
                    So, does that mean you re gonna 
                    help yer old man out?

                                  MOLLY
                    No.  But maybe you could put that 
                    in the ad.  

      Molly jumps down from the tailgate.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    On second thought, I m gonna head 
                    in ta work. Coroner s report should 
                    be in.  Rain check on the fishin ?

      He nods.  She kisses his cheek.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Love ya, dad.

                                  LOU
                    Love ya too, hon.

      Molly walks to her cruiser.  Her father watches as we ...

                                                                  FADE TO WHITE:
