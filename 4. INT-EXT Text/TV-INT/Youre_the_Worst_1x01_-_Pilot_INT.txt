      QUICK POPS of an elegant wedding reception.

      -Cater-waiters pour wine at the tables, wiping the bottle 
      after each pour.

      -A Caucasian wedding band plays a Motown classic.

      -A photographer shoots candids of the wedding party.

                                  JIMMY (V.O.)
                    Ugh.  This whole thing...

      -An ELDERLY COUPLE feeds each other cake.

                                  JIMMY (V.O.)
                    I mean, I came, so it s my fault...

      -The bride dances with her father.

      -Everyone is happy and will remember this day forever.

      IN AN ALCOVE away from the action, a GUY and GIRL sit side-by-
      side on a low credenza, watching from afar.

      The girl, we don t really care about.  The guy is JIMMY SHIVE-
      OVERLY, 32.  Jimmy is okay looking, but out of shape, with a 
      blunt force trauma of a personality.  He never once looks at 
      the girl as he talks.

                                  JIMMY
                    ...but sometimes you just want to 
                    witness the beginning of a 
                    disaster, so when the house is 
                    engulfed in flames you can say, 
                     Yeah, I was there when they 
                    installed the faulty wiring.   
                    Sure, getting married vaguely 
                    resembles bravery, but so does 
                    jumping down onto the subway tracks 
                    to grab a quarter.

      ANGLE ON: the BRIDE, beaming, resplendent.

                                  JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    She used to be like me.  Now look 
                    at her...

      WIDEN OUT TO REVEAL that Jimmy has his hand moving under the 
      girl s dress.  It s subtle but unmistakable what s going on.                                                                                        2.


                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                      ...Adopting a dog from a shelter, 
                    taking couple s Bikram, registering 
                    for panini machines.  It would be 
                      absolutely hysterical if it wasn t 
                    so goddamn sad.

                                  GIRL
                      Alll-right.  I m going back in.

      The girl removes Jimmy s hand and smooths her dress.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    Don t tell anyone about this.  And 
                    leave her alone.  It s her big day.

      The girl walks away.  Jimmy keeps staring out the wedding.

                                  JIMMY
                    Of course.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      THE BRIDE stands on stage, talking into the mic.

                                  BRIDE
                    Okay, my lovelies.  Are you ready?

      She turns around and LAUNCHES the bouquet over her head.

      WE FOLLOW as the bouquet FLIES THROUGH THE AIR... and hits 
      GRETCHEN ESSEX, 29.  Gretchen is beautiful with a killer 
      body, her looks off-set by the sour expression she often 
      wears.  The world told her early that she was perfect and 
      would have everything she wanted, but the world has 
      apparently changed its mind: she s broke, her career is shit, 
      and her boobs can hold a pencil for the first time.  Life has 
      cheated Gretchen and she s not going to let it forget it.

      The bouquet hits Gretchen in the chest and bounces off.  She 
      doesn t even flinch.  She pulls from a bottle of champagne as 
      the squealing women scramble for the bouquet.  She inhales on 
        a cigarette, unconsciously flicking ash down onto the women.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      WE FOLLOW as a CATER-WAITER turns a corner to find Jimmy and 
      the bride in an angry face-off.  He quickly walks away.                                                                                        3.


                                  BRIDE
                    I invited you because I thought we 
                    could be friends, Jimmy.

                                  JIMMY
                    That s insane!  What kind of idiot 
                    is friends with their ex?

                                  BRIDE
                    I forgot how you always make 
                      everything about you.

                                  JIMMY
                    No, you didn t.  You wanted to 
                        passive-aggressively rub my nose in 
                    your happiness.  At least I would 
                    have had the decency to rub your 
                    nose in it directly.

      A few GUESTS have begun to gather.

                                  BRIDE
                    Ooh, your commitment to honesty is 
                    soooo refreshing!  It must be hard 
                    being the only one who sees people 
                    for what they actually are.

                                  JIMMY
                          (emotional)
                    It is.  It s incredibly hard.

                                  BRIDE
                    Well, it s also what s going to 
                    keep you alone, because you re ugly 
                    and unpleasant and honestly, Jimmy, 
                    not the original you think you are.

                                  JIMMY
                    I m not original?  Okay, want to 
                    know a few things about you -- ?
                          (stops himself)
                    No.  You re right.  This day isn t 
                    about me.

                                  BRIDE
                    What were you going to say?

                                  JIMMY
                    Nothing.  Forget it.

                                  BRIDE
                    No.  I m serious.  I want to know 
                    what the brilliant Jimmy Shive-
                    Overly has to say about me.                                                                                        4.


      CLOSE ON JIMMY as he fights an internal battle...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Gretchen sneaks food into her purse.  Loud ARGUING AND 
      COMMOTION can be heard.  She peers into the HALLWAY to see:

      Most of the wedding crowd now surrounding Jimmy and the 
      bride.  The bride is sobbing.

                                  JIMMY
                    She told me to!  Seriously?  How am 
                    I in the wrong here?

      The angry crowd descends on Jimmy...

      Gretchen uses the distraction to quickly head to the GIFT 
      TABLE where she starts picking up gifts and shaking them.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Gretchen is on top of Jimmy.  They are vigorously fucking.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I don t know what I m doing here.  
                    I m not even attracted to you.

                                  JIMMY
                    The minute someone tells me they re 
                    not attracted to me, I know I m in. 
                    That s the most attractive thing 
                    about me: I m not that attractive.

      She nods.  Makes sense.  They keep going.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Still naked, they eat cold pasta with their hands.  Champagne 
      from the bottle.  (In this sequence, there should be a slow 
      progression where they make more and more eye contact...)

                                  JIMMY
                    It s L.A.  Who doesn t drive?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    D.U.I.  I occasionally see this 
                    movie director guy --

                                  JIMMY
                    Gross.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    One night he booty-texted me from 
                    some awards show to meet him at his 
                    house.  And I was already at a bar, 
                    so I drove to his house, and he 
                    texted that he was going to be 
                    later, so I drove idly around his 
                      neighborhood for a while until I 
                    kind of sideswiped an off-duty cop.                                                                                        8.


                                  JIMMY
                    I m glad this is a one-night thing 
                    so we can reveal this awful shit 
                    about ourselves.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Totally.

      They high-five.  A piece of pasta drops onto his crotch.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    I ll get it.

      Gretchen s head disappears out of frame.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      More sex.  Jimmy is on top.  He pins her wrists over her 
      head.  She gasps.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Okay, I like that.

                                  JIMMY
                    All girls do.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Don t call me  all girls. 

      He pulls her hair.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Ah, dammit.  That s good too.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      He gives her a foot rub.

                                  JIMMY
                    Right before Becca broke up with 
                    me, I started reading her email.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I ve done that.

                                  JIMMY
                    I was mostly just embarrassed how 
                    many shopping lists she was on.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                        9.

                                  JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    When she broke up with me it 
                    actually kind of knocked me out.  
                    Even though she s clearly a 
                      ridiculous human being.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I mean.  Break-ups hurt.  From what 
                    I ve heard.
                          (off his look)
                    I don t, really, do relationships.

                                  JIMMY
                    Me neither.  Anymore.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    So what, are you one of those 
                    creepy foot guys?

                                  JIMMY
                    No.  I just have nervous hands.  
                    They always have to stay busy.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jimmy is out of frame, going down on Gretchen.

                                  GRETCHEN

                    you son of a bitch.  Oh, yeeee --

      She abruptly opens her eyes.  Looks down.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Did you just spit on it?

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    Yeah.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You spit on my vagina?

                    So?

                    Why?                                                                                        10.

                    Why don t spit on my vagina???

      Jimmy pops his head up into frame.

                                  JIMMY
                    It s saliva.  It s going to get 
                    there anyway.

      Gretchen considers.  He has a point.  She pushes his head 
      back down.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Beat.  They just smile.

                                  JIMMY
                    Hey.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Hey.

      He brushes her hair out of her face.  She kisses his hand as 
      he does.  Beat.  Smiles quickly turn to frowns.  They back up 
      at the same time.

                                  JIMMY
                    I should get some sleep, so...

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yeah.  Night.

      She rolls over.

                    Wait, what?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Relax.  I m just lazy.  I ll sneak 
                    out in the morning.

                                  JIMMY
                    No.  There are no sleep-overs.                                                                                        11.


                                  GRETCHEN
                    Too bad.

      Jimmy is stymied.

                                  JIMMY
                    I have sleep apnea.  I have to wear 
                    a CPAP machine.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Don t care.  I m a log.

      Defeated, Jimmy pulls on mask connected to a machine.  He 
      puts it over his mouth and nose.  She looks over.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    You look like Top Gun.

                                  JIMMY
                          (muffled)
                    Shut up.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Thank god I m not going to remember 
                    any of this in the morning.

      Gretchen cuddles her body close to his.  He opens his eyes.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    For warmth.

      He shuts his eyes again.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Never leave your wingman.

                                  JIMMY
                    Goddamn it.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Goose, you big stud...

                                  JIMMY
                    So stupid.

      She laughs.  He laughs as well.  They both giggle drowsily.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



      Jimmy bolts upright.  He rips off his mask and looks over.  
      Gretchen is still there.  What the fuck?  He shakes her.                                                                                        12.


                                  JIMMY
                    Get up.

      She sleepily smacks his hand away.  Jimmy gets out of bed.

      CLOSE ON Jimmy stepping over Gretchen s purse, not noticing 
      it s being attacked by ants who feast on the purloined food.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jimmy comes downstairs into his sleek kitchen.  His house is 
      a medium-sized modern, pretty empty.  The only piece of art 
      is a huge framed book review from the New York Times over the 
      mantle, accompanied by an author photo of Jimmy.

                                  EDGAR (O.S.)
                    Morning.

      Jimmy finds his childhood friend EDGAR QUINTERO, 32, Latino, 
      cooking breakfast.  Edgar is tall and handsome and well-
      built.  His clothes are simple but always pressed and clean -- 
      training from his military service.  He is sweet and earnest 
      and suffers from PTSD.  He looks up to Jimmy, even though 
      it s sometimes hard to see why.  Edgar lives with Jimmy.

      Jimmy sits at the counter with his iPad.  Starts typing.

                                  EDGAR (CONT D)
                    So I ve been thinking about ghosts.

                                  JIMMY
                    Right.  Which don t exist.

                                  EDGAR
                    You know my great-grandfather 
                    Baldemar on my father s side?

            EDGAR (CONT D)JIMMY
He was this adventurer guy who What?  No.  How could I possibly 
owned a ranch in Zihuatanejo and know your --  Voldemort?   
sold arms and was a matador and What s his name...?  Nevermind --
sounds like the coolest guy.*

      As Edgar talks, he serves Jimmy a scramble with tortillas and 
      chorizo and salsa.  Jimmy shovels it in without looking.

                                  EDGAR (CONT D)
                    Because I was thinking: he sounds 
                    like he had it all worked out, and 
                    maybe if I could learn his secrets, 
                    I could fix my problems.                                                                                        13.


                                  JIMMY
                    How would meeting your dead 
                    relative -- which is impossible 
                    because the soul doesn t exist -- 
                    help you move out of my house?

                                  EDGAR
                          (laughs)
                    No, I m talking about my real 
                    problems.  Like the nightmares and 
                    the crying and how I want to do 
                    heroin all the time.

                                  JIMMY
                    That s because you were an idiot 
                    and joined the Army during a war.

                                  EDGAR
                    But that s because we had no money.

                                  JIMMY
                    Because your father was a lazy 
                    drunk and your mother never used 
                    birth control.

                                  EDGAR
                    Yes, but that s because --  I don t 
                    know why those things, actually.  
                    So anyway, what do you think?

                                  JIMMY
                    I don t have time for this.  I 
                    agreed to write a profile for GQ 
                    about some stupid actor even though 
                    it will kill my soul.

                                  EDGAR
                    I thought there was no soul.

      Edgar just keeps looking at him, expectantly.  Jimmy sighs.

                                  JIMMY
                    What do I think about what?

                                  EDGAR
                    If I should hold a seance to 
                    contact great-grandfather Baldemar?

                                  JIMMY
                    No.

      Jimmy pushes his plate forward.  Edgar puts more food on it.                                                                                        14.


                                  EDGAR
                    I think I m gonna do it.  Thanks.

      Gretchen enters, dressed in her clothes from last night.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Why did you let me sleep so long?  
                    I m famished.

      Gretchen sits down and starts eating Jimmy s breakfast.  
      Jimmy watches in horror.  Edgar looks from Gretchen to Jimmy 
      and back, smiling.

                                  EDGAR
                    Hi.  I m Edgar.

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (mouth full)
                    Gretchen.  This is dynamite.

      Edgar fixes Jimmy a new plate.  Jimmy remains mutely 
      outraged.  Edgar pours Gretchen coffee.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  So how do you two know 
                    each other?

                                  EDGAR
                    I used to beat him up when we were 
                    little.

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (sizing Jimmy up)
                    I can see that.

                                  EDGAR
                    But then I realized he wasn t just 
                    some loser dork but a really smart 
                    guy.  Way smarter than the bozos I 
                    was hanging out with.  So then I 
                    started beating them up for Jimmy.  
                    Have you read his book?

                                  JIMMY
                    Edgar --

      Gretchen shakes her head no.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    You haven t?

      Edgar picks up a book from a stack of them.  Hands it to her.  
      She looks at it.                                                                                        15.


                                  EDGAR
                    Sales were flatter than expected.  
                    That s why he has to do more 
                    magazine work.

                                  JIMMY
                    Shut up at any time.

                                  EDGAR
                    You should read it.

                    K.

                                  JIMMY
                    At least buy your own copy.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Ha, right.

      Gretchen finishes eating.  Puts down her fork.  Belches.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Whoo!  Excuse me.  So, who s gonna 
                    give me a ride to work?

                                  EDGAR
                    I can t drive because I have PTSD 
                    and mild-to-medium battlefield-
                    induced psychosis.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Bummer.  Jimmy, you re up.

                                  JIMMY
                    My car s at the reception.  We took 
                    a cab.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    We did?  Damn.

      She pulls out her phone and dials...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      LINDSAY JILLIAN, 28, drives a brand new Lexus.  Lindsay is 
      slightly overweight, but her clothes and hair are carefully 
      put together and scream,  I m trying to be an adult lady 
      now.   Gretchen sits in the passenger seat, changing into 
      clothes Lindsay has brought her.  Lindsay is not happy.                                                                                        16.


                                    LINDSAY
                    I can t believe it.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Drive faster.  I m late.

                                    LINDSAY
                    You slept with Jimmy.

                                  GRETCHEN
                      Apparently.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Who used to date my sister.  And on 
                    the night of her wedding!

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Why are you crawling up my ass 
                    about this, Linds?

                                    LINDSAY
                    You know what a jerk he is.  I told 
                    you all the time how he swallowed 
                    her up.  She disappeared her life 
                    into his and was never the same.

      Gretchen starts doing her make-up, feet up on the dashboard.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    That s because Becca doesn t have a 
                      personality to begin with.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Well.  That s true.  Uuuck.  
                    Jimmy s the worst.  Did he say 
                    anything about me?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No.

                                    LINDSAY
                    You re not going to see him again, 
                    are you?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Ew.  No way.  But we did have 
                    fun...  God, I hope he doesn t 
                    think it was an actual thing.

                                    LINDSAY
                    No kidding.  Why do you have such 
                    terrible taste in men?                                                                                        17.


                                  GRETCHEN
                    Maybe it s not me.  Maybe it s 
                    them.

                                    LINDSAY
                    No, it s you.  Can you take your 
                    feet off the dashboard?  This is a 
                    lease.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Stop the car.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    STOP THE CAR!  I d rather walk than 
                    ride in this sterile suburban piece 
                    of shit car with my best friend 
                    being shitty and judgemental 
                    because I had sex with a guy at a 
                    wedding.  How many guys did you 
                    blow at our five-year reunion?

                                    LINDSAY
                    ...Four.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You said it was three.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I might have left out Tor 
                      Borgfeldt.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Tor Borgfeldt?  I m seriously 
                    nauseated right now.

                                    LINDSAY
                          (misty)
                    God, we used to have fun.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yeah, we did.  The hell d you have 
                    to get married for?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I know.  I m sorry.
                          (then)
                    Do you like my new haircut?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No.  You look like Ellen Barkin.
                          (beat, then)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                        18.

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT'D)
                    If you get your real estate license 
                    I will stab you in the tits.

      They drive on in silence.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KEVIN NEALON reads to a group of SICK KIDS.

                                  KEVIN
                    ...so the tomato and the 
                      caterpillar lived happily ever 
                    after... until the caterpillar 
                    finally couldn t handle it and ate 
                    the tomato.  Yum!  The end!

      The kids clap.  Kevin smiles.

      REVEAL, Jimmy standing to the side with a note pad, frowning.

      Kevin makes his way to Jimmy.

                                  KEVIN (CONT D)
                    Hey, man.  Thanks for coming here.  
                    This was the only time in my 
                    schedule my retard manager could 
                    find to slot the interview.

                                  JIMMY
                          (dubious)
                    Uh-huh.  Should we go find 
                    somewhere quiet or...?

                                  KEVIN
                      I actually have to stick around a 
                    bit.  But we can start the 
                    interview here if you don t mind.

                                  JIMMY
                    Okay.  Tell me about this new show 
                    you re doing.

                                  KEVIN
                    Well, it s a really cool project...

      A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL with a shaved head runs up to him.

                                  KEVIN (CONT D)
                    Aw, c mere you!                                                                                        19.


      She jumps into Kevin s arms.  A PHOTOGRAPHER materializes out 
      of nowhere.  Kevin poses with the girl.  Turns back to Jimmy.

                                  KEVIN (CONT D)
                    Anyway, they sent me the script, 
                    and I NEVER laugh out loud, but --

      A KID IN A WHEELCHAIR rolls by.  Kevin sees him.

                                  KEVIN (CONT D)
                      Wheelchair race!
                          (to Jimmy)
                    Sorry.
                          (to the photographer)
                    C mon, get this...

      Kevin jumps into a wheelchair and races after the kid, the 
        photographer snapping away.  Jimmy sighs.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Sam and the two guys stand in front of the photographer, 
      NESTOR (male, English, 50 s), pissed.

                                  SAM
                    We re sorry we broke your shit.

      Shitstain and Honey Nutz nod.

      We now see the remanence of a photo shoot, trashed.  The 
      white backdrop has been slashed.  Light stands upended.  
      Catering thrown everywhere.  A 20-something ASSISTANT gathers 
      broken equipment.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Okay, good.  Nestor, we ll figure 
                    out restitution.

      Nestor storms off.  Sam watches his go, scowling.                                                                                        21.


                                  SAM
                    Making us do stupid ass poses...

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Hey.  You okay?

                                  SAM
                    Yeah.  Fuck were you doing, anyway?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Nothing worth talking about.

                                  SAM
                    You still need to make it up to us.
                          (off her look)
                    I m serious.  I ll fire your ass 
                    and it won t mean shit to me.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yes, it will.  You can t function 
                    without me.

                                  SAM
                    See, just to prove you wrong I mma 
                    go to Loyola-Marymont, get me four 
                    fine-ass interns to do the same job 
                    for free.  You owe me, Gretch.

      She sighs.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Fine.  What do you need, Sam?

                                  SAM
                    You need to kiss my quarter-
                    Chickasaw ass.

      Sam turns around.  Gretchen narrows her eyes.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Then you need to go get me some 
                    cocaine.  I m too famous to get it 
                    myself.  I m not playing.  You on 
                    probation now.

      Shitstain and Honey Nutz nod.  Off Gretchen: shit, he s 
      serious...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Kevin now plays the banjo and sings.                                                                                        22.


      Jimmy wants to die.  His attention is drawn by a skinny, pale 
      TEEN KID sitting alone playing a video game.

                                  JIMMY
                    Wait.  Is that... GTA 5?

                                  TEEN KID
                    Yeah.

                                  JIMMY
                    How d the hell d you get it?!

                                  TEEN KID
                    I get games early because I m 
                    dying.

                                  JIMMY
                    Lucky.

                                  TEEN KID
                          (looks up at Jimmy)
                    Why are you here?

                                  JIMMY
                    I m doing a story on that asshole.

                                  TEEN KID
                    Why s he an asshole?

                                  JIMMY
                    Please.  Inviting me here so I ll 
                    write about him hanging around with 
                    sick kids.  Disgusting.
                          (then)
                    So do you get lots of free stuff?

                                  TEEN KID
                    Yeah.  But nothing really cool.

                                  JIMMY
                    Like what would you want?

                                  TEEN KID
                    To motorboat Kate Upton.  You have 
                      a girlfriend?

                                  JIMMY
                    No, I don t believe in girlfriends.

                                  TEEN KID
                    You mean you can t get laid.

                                  JIMMY
                    Fuck you.  I got laid last night.                                                                                        23.


                                  TEEN KID
                    Was she hot?

      Jimmy sits on the arm of the kid s chair as he talks.

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah.  But annoying.  No, not 
                    annoying.  She was... trouble, I 
                    guess.  I mean, she was just kind 
                    of an awful person.  But in a fun 
                    way.  Anyway.  Doesn t matter...

      Jimmy smiles to himself, lost in revere for a moment.  He 
      snaps out of it to see Kevin surrounded by the kids.

                                  KEVIN
                    Group hug!

                                  JIMMY
                    Alright, that s it.

      Jimmy goes to Kevin, who separates himself from the kids.

                                  KEVIN
                    Sorry, sorry.  Let s get back to 
                    the interview.

                                  JIMMY
                    Nah.

                                  KEVIN
                    Excuse me?

                                  JIMMY
                    I m know I m supposed to be giving 
                    you a hand job in this magazine but 
                    this little staged charade is 
                    cynical and ugly and more obvious 
                    than your face lift.  You brought 
                    your own photographer!?  I mean, I 
                    know actors are vain and awful, 
                    but, man, you take the cake.

                                  KEVIN
                    Yeah, I m doing publicity for my 
                    sister s charity.

      PAN OVER to find KEVIN S SISTER sister sitting with the six-
      year old cancer girl.

                                  JIMMY
                    And the girl...?                                                                                        24.


                                  KEVIN
                    Is my niece.  Who has 
                      neuroblastoma.  Dick.

      Kevin walks off.  Jimmy turns to see the teen kid laughing.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jimmy types on his laptop, in a shitty mood.  Edgar enters.

                                  EDGAR
                    I had your car towed back here.

      He puts the car keys on the kitchen counter.

                                  EDGAR (CONT D)
                    And look who I found getting out of 
                    a cab.

      Jimmy looks up to see Gretchen.  She gives a little wave.  
      Jimmy tenses up.  She notices.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Don t worry.  I forgot my purse.  
                    Not on purpose or anything.

                                  EDGAR
                    I was just telling her about my 
                      great-grandfather Baldemar.  She 
                    thinks I should pursue it.

                                  GRETCHEN
                      Definitely.

                                  EDGAR
                          (hugs her)
                    Thanks.  I ll go pay your cab.

      Edgar exits.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    He s sweet.  It s nice that you let 
                    him live with you.

                                  JIMMY
                    You know your purse had food in it?  
                    It was covered in ants.  Who keeps 
                    food in their purse?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Whoa.  What s your problem?                                                                                        25.


                                  JIMMY
                    I had a really shitty day and I 
                    come home to find my bedroom a 
                    goddamn  50 s sci-fi movie.
                          (finally facing her)
                    And why would you sleep over?  
                    That s amateur hour.  What were you 
                    trying to do?

      Gretchen reacts, hurt, surprised.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    And here I was worrying you were 
                    going to get the wrong idea about 
                    last night.  Thanks for saving me 
                    the speech.

                                  JIMMY
                          (laughs derisively)
                    You were going to make a speech?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Oh my god.  Forget it.

                                  JIMMY
                    No kidding.  Save your breath.

      Gretchen turns to leave.  She turns back, a tiger un-caged.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I don t know what planet you re 
                    from, but on my planet someone like 
                    you doesn t just get...
                          (motioning to her body)
                    ...this.  Congratulations.  You 
                    bagged a weakened gazelle.
                          (picking up steam)
                    That s right, I m still retarded-
                    hooked on someone else who is eons 
                    further along the evolutionary 
                    scale than you in all categories 
                    save for  Unearned Ego  and 
                       Backfat.   You so value honesty 
                    that you had to chew out a BRIDE on 
                    her WEDDING DAY in the name of it?  
                    Well, then face this giant hunk of 
                    truth, Jimmy: there s a fat 
                    asterisk next to me on your skank-
                    riddled little Fucklist, and it 
                    reads:  SHE PROBABLY WOULDA GONE 
                    HOME WITH ANYONE THAT NIGHT.   So 
                    thank you for the wake-up call, 
                    Jimmy Stupid-Three-Names.  You are 
                      officially my bottom.                                                                                        26.


      Gretchen storms out.  Jimmy is agog, the smile that forms on 
      his face reading,  Holy shit, that was awesome. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jimmy plays the video game from the hospital, a bottle of 
      scotch in front of him.  A large bag of M&M.  Edgar enters.

                                  EDGAR
                    You busy?

                                  JIMMY
                    Yep.

                                  EDGAR
                    Can you pause it for a second?

                                  JIMMY
                    Nope.

                                  EDGAR
                    Whoa.  Where d you get GTA 5?

                                  JIMMY
                    Don t worry about it.

      Beat.  Edgar grabs the controller out of Jimmy s hand.

                                  EDGAR
                    I have to say something.

                                  JIMMY
                    What s wrong with you?  Give me the 
                      controller!

      Jimmy stands up to grab it.  Edgar pushes him back down onto 
      the couch with surprising force.  Jimmy s scotch spills.  His 
      M&M s go flying.  Jimmy stares in enraged surprise.

                                  EDGAR
                    I ve watched you for two years now 
                    get girls to come home with you and 
                    they re always gone in the morning.

                                  JIMMY
                    I can help it if she refused to 
                    leave?  Give me my controller.

      Edgar doesn t.  Jimmy quickly grabs the other controller from 
      the table.  Starts to fire it up.                                                                                        28.


                                  EDGAR
                    Sorry about this...

      Edgar quickly grabs Jimmy into a tight military headlock.  
      Jimmy flails but it s useless.  He roars with outrage.

                                  EDGAR (CONT D)
                    I don t mind you being jerky to me, 
                    because I know you care.

                                  JIMMY
                          (strangled)
                    No, I don t!  You re an animal.  
                    Living in my house...

                                  EDGAR
                    But Gretchen stayed.  You say she 
                    forced you, but we both know 
                    there s not a person on this 
                    planet s ever had a good outcome 
                    trying to force you to do anything.  
                    She stayed.  And that means 
                      something.  Whether you want to 
                    admit it or not.  I m going to let 
                    you go now.

      Edgar lets Jimmy go.  Jimmy falls down onto the couch.

                                  JIMMY
                    Why would I even listen to you?  
                    You re a mental case.  You re on a 
                    billion medications that all say: 
                     Take For Batshit Craziness. 

                                  EDGAR
                          (hurt)
                    I was defending our country.

                                  JIMMY
                    Please.  You weren t defending 
                    anything except for the business 
                    interests of evil men.

                                  EDGAR
                    Jimmy, our country IS the business 
                    interests of evil men.

                                  JIMMY
                          (stares at Edgar, stunned)
                    That may be the most intelligent 
                    thing you ve ever said.

                                  EDGAR
                    Thanks.                                                                                        29.


                                  JIMMY
                    You re still a fucking lunatic.

      Rubbing his neck, Jimmy heads out of the room.

                                  EDGAR
                    Where are you going?

                                  JIMMY
                    To a bar, where I can drink in 
                    peace!

      The front door SLAMS.  Edgar starts to clean up the mess.  
      The front door REOPENS.  Jimmy storms back in.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Call the police!

                                  EDGAR
                    On me?

                                  JIMMY
                    Someone stole my car!

                                  EDGAR
                          (laughs)
                    Gretchen took it, remember?

                                  JIMMY
                    Gretchen took my car?!  GRETCHEN 
                    TOOK MY CAR?!

                                  EDGAR
                    Yeah.  I saw her driving away.  I 
                    figured you loaned it to her.  Come 
                    to think of it, I did think it was 
                    kinda weird.

                                  JIMMY
                    She doesn t have a license!

                                  EDGAR
                    Huh.  She must have stolen your 
                    keys from the counter.

      Jimmy breathes hard, raging.

                                  EDGAR (CONT D)
                    Well.  You gotta admit, that s kind 
                    of a baller move.

      Jimmy flops down onto the couch, defeated.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                        30.



      Fancy.  Masculine.  Dark.  1000 thread-count.  The lights of 
      Los Angeles spread out below.

      Ty makes sweet, tender love to Gretchen.  He maintains super-
      intense eye contact.  Gretchen smiles, but is clearly not 
      into it.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Um, hey.

                                  TY
                    Yes, Gretchen?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Can we just take a break --

                                  TY
                    Sure.

      Gretchen slides out from under him.  Lies on her side.  Plays 
      with his chest hair.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    So, what s the worst thing you ve 
                    ever done?

                                  TY
                    Gretchen, you know ever since India 
                    I don t dwell in negativity.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I set my school on fire to get out 
                    of a calculus test.

                                  TY
                    What?!  Why are you telling me 
                    that?  That s horrible.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Forget it.  I was kidding.

      Gretchen goes down on him.  He leans back.

                                  TY
                    Ah.  You re a marvel.  Ooh, that s 
                    terrific.  That s --

      A SPITTING NOISE.  He stops.  Looks down.

                                  TY (CONT D)
                    Did you just spit on me?                                                                                        31.


                                  GRETCHEN (O.S.)
                    No.  Yes.  Sorry.

      Ty forgets about it.  They continue.  He leans back.

                                  TY
                    Yes, Gretchen.  That s delicious.

      Gretchen pops her head back up.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Do you still have coke?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A very designed bathroom.  Pointless bowls of vegetable 
      matter.  Rolled hand towels.  Rain shower.  Monster tub.

      Gretchen, in t-shirt and panties, tiptoes in and gently shuts 
      the door.  We see she s carrying a huge bag of cocaine.  She 
      pulls a smaller baggie out of the waistband of her panties 
      and pours some of the coke into the smaller baggie for Sam 
      and crew.  She rubs spillage onto her gums with her finger 
      then reseals the large bag of coke and tucks the small one 
      back into her panties.

      She grabs the bigger bag and goes to leave but suddenly 
      stops, not wanting to go back out there.  Instead, she climbs 
      into the tub, exhales, and leans back, weary.  She stares at 
      the baggie.  Fuck it.  She grabs some tweezers off the 
      counter, pulls her hair back, and digs the tweezers into the 
      coke, brings it to her nose, and sniffs.

      Her phone rings.  She quickly silences it.  She looks at the 
      display and reacts in this order: surprised, pleased, then 
      apprehensive.  She answers, speaking quietly.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Hello?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Jimmy is sitting up in bed, naked.

                                  JIMMY
                    What are you doing?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                        32.



      Gretchen is frozen.  Lying in the bathtub.  Clutching the bag 
      of coke.  The tweezers.  The phone.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Nothing.  I was just... reading.

      INTERCUT AS NEEDED:

                                  JIMMY
                    You won t believe this.  Someone 
                    stole my car.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Oh?  That s awful.

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah.  I have to file a police 
                    report in the morning.

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (shutting her eyes)
                    Um.  I may have... borrowed it.

                                  JIMMY
                    I know.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Sorry.  I told you I m the worst.

                                  JIMMY
                    No, you told me I was the worst and 
                    I was lucky to  get  you.

      She cringes lower in the tub.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yeeeah.  Yeah.  About that...

                                  JIMMY
                    No.  Don t apologize.  It was a 
                    great speech.  Funny and true and 
                    mean.  My favorite kind.

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (pleased)
                    Oh.  Well.  Thanks.

                                  JIMMY
                            (conversational)
                    So I started researching that 
                      ridiculous story Edgar told about 
                    his great-grandfather.                                                                                        33.


                                  GRETCHEN
                    Oh yeah?

                                  JIMMY
                    Turns out it s all true.  And more.  
                    He s used to train hammerhead 
                    sharks.  He had an affair with 
                    Helen Keller.  He challenged the 
                    President of Mexico to a duel.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Whoa.  He sounds amazing.

                                  JIMMY
                    So I m going to work on that story.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Instead of the interview thingie?

                                  JIMMY
                    Oh yeah, they kind of fired me.  
                    But anyway, yeah.  I thought you d 
                    be interested to hear.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    And now Edgar will get to know his 
                      great-grandfather.

                                  JIMMY
                    And the idiot doesn t have to do a 
                    seance.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    He must be happy you re doing that.

                                  JIMMY
                          (pleased)
                    Yeah.  He really is.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I set my high school on fire to get 
                    out of a math test.

                                  JIMMY
                    Ha.  That s genius.

      Gretchen smiles.  A comfortable silence.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    I lied to you before.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    About what?                                                                                        34.


                                  JIMMY
                    I do have a foot thing.

                                  GRETCHEN
                      Seriously?

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah.  In fact I was just trying to 
                    find the right clip online to, you 
                    know... so I could fall asleep.  
                    But nothing s quite right.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Oh.
                          (beat)
                    Want me to try?

                                  JIMMY
                    What?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Shh.  Alright, lemme think...

                                  JIMMY
                    This is stupid.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Shut up.

      WE GO SPLIT SCREEN FOR THE REST:

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                          (adopts a new tone)
                    Boy, I have been walking around all 
                    day in these new shoes and they re 
                    so hot and tight.

                                  JIMMY
                    Oh yeah?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Yeah.  And my socks are all sweaty.

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah, that happens.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I m just going to take them off.

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah, do that.
                          (then)
                    Hey, you re very nice for doing 
                    this.                                                                                        35.


                                  GRETCHEN
                    I m very nice.
                          (suddenly serious)
                    Jimmy.  I m scared of this shit, 
                    you know?  I don t like it.

      It takes Jimmy a second to figure out that she s talking 
      about this, what s happening between them.

                                  JIMMY
                    And I don t believe in it anymore, 
                    so...

                                  GRETCHEN
                    So... if we know it can t work, 
                    there s no harm, right?

                                  JIMMY
                    Right.

      Beat.  They both smile.  They each take a moment to hide it 
      in their voices.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    What kind of socks?

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (vamping)
                    Knee-high basketball socks.  Orange 
                    and green stripes.

                                  JIMMY
                    You re amazing.  Nineteen types of 
                    trouble.  But amazing.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    So are you.  Nineteen types.

                                  JIMMY
                    Okay.  Did you take your socks off?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Not yet.  Because before I do that, 
                    I have these, like, insoles in my 
                    shoes I should change...

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah, that s probably a good idea.

      Gretchen keeps talking.  Jimmy listens.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
