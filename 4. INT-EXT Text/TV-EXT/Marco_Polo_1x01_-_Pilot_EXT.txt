      SHAPES MOVING IN MIST. THE SOUNDS OF WAR: Metal on metal, 
      screams of the wounded, the dying, and, under it, the 
      foreboding low ominous drone of MONGOLIAN THROAT-SINGING...  

      SLOW MOTION: A SINGLE RIDER comes out of the fog, galloping 
      toward us. His helmet and face are covered in a mysterious 
      cowl and he wears the Asiatic style of lamellar armor, sword 
      at his belt, high boots made of felt and leather...

      SUDDENLY: TWO HORSES jump him from tall grass, causing his 
      mount to scream and rear. The Rider is thrown, lands hard. 
      Face down.

      TWO MOUNTED WARRIORS move in. One is armed with a Turko-
      Mongol sabre, the other grips a two-bladed halberd. Asiatic 
      faces, wind-burned and fierce; nomads of the Steppe. They 
      speak MONGOLIAN (subtitled):

                                  MONGOL WARRIOR #1
                          (Mongolian)
                    You take his horse.
                          (beat)
                    I ll take his head.

      One Mongol catches the riderless horse, the other dismounts, 
      all business. Still, a THIRD MONGOL WARRIOR rides up now, 
      cold-eyed. He dismounts, draws a mace.  

      The Fallen Rider rolls to his feet, his helmet somewhere in 
      the grass, his cowl down.

      The Mongols are about to attack when something freezes them.  
      Something utterly strange. The Fallen Rider is a white man. A 
      striking young European.

                                  MONGOL WARRIOR #2
                          (Mongolian)
                    What kind of ugly foreign devil...

                                  MONGOL WARRIOR #1
                          (Mongolian)
                    It is a round-eye... 

      The Third Mongol chambers his mace, is about to cave the 
      Westerner s head when --

                                  MARCO

      Now all three balk, weapons drawn. MARCO POLO, 21, darts his 
      eyes toward the warrior on the horse, takes a cautious step 
      backward... scheming a way out...

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                          (Mongolian)
                    Peace upon you and the Golden 
                    Horde. Bless Genghis Khan... and 
                    the Eternal Blue Sky...

      As he cautiously backs his way toward the high grass, he 
      becomes aware of a FOURTH MONGOL behind him --

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                          (Italian)
                    Mother of God, I m a dead man.

      THE WARRIORS ATTACK!

      Marco ducks a sabre, rolls from the path of the double 
      halberd. It SLASHES at him again. He rolls again, alarmed. 
      Now a hook-scythe comes at him. 

      Marco slaps at his leather boot and draws, a Kerait dagger.

      The Third Mongol charges with a brutal five-blossom spin of a 
      scimitar. He cuts Marco s leather plates, but the young 
      foreigner  swallows  his opponent s momentum...

      SLOW MOTION: Marco spins 180 and impales the attacker with an 
      inverted dagger stab at the same time he fires a round kick, 
      disabling the Halberd Warrior. 

      The Fourth Mongol is stunned by this unlikely display of 
      Chinese martial arts. But not as stunned as Marco; competent 
      skill aside, the young man is sweat-drenched and unnerved as --

      MONGOLIAN SOLDIERS flood the valley. THROAT SINGING chills 
      his blood...

      MARCO SWEEPS A HANDFUL OF SAND at the Fourth Warrior s face. 
      He then grabs the stirrup of his escaping horse, makes a 
      desperate running mount...

      BEHIND HIM: That HORSEBACK MONGOL sets chase with Double Fire 
      Meteor Hammers, two spherical weights connected by a chain, 
      filled with fuel and lit afire.

      Marco gallops for his life across the Steppe. He rides well, 
      but not as well as the Flying Hammer Rider gaining on him at 
      breakneck speed...

      Marco lifts his small, Mongolian-style recurve bow. Draws an 
      arrow from his quiver, nocks it. Turning around in the saddle --
      completely around -- he raises the bow. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/123.

      ALL SOUND FADES. Only MARCO S PULSE -- in his face.

                    I believe it was God s will that I

                    from my travels, so that men might 
                    know the things that are in the 
                    world...

      SLOW MOTION: Marco times his breath with the exact half-beat 
      in which all four of his horse s legs leave the ground -- and 
      he RELEASES A WHISTLING ARROW...

                                                                            CUT TO:




      FOUR YEARS EARLIER. 

      Renowned for her beauty, the  City of Water.  Magnificent 
        architecture frames the Grand Canal; a sultry breeze moves in 
      the curtains of a second story balcony.

      The sounds of boats, chimes, and impassioned fucking.

                                  DONA CATERINA (O.S.)
                    Marco, no... it s not right...




      MOVE IN THROUGH THE BALCONY CURTAINS... ONTO AN ORNATE BED... 
      where 17 year-old Marco Polo makes hot Italian love to 33 
      year-old DONA CATERINA, a blonde Venetian.

                                  MARCO 
                    Sei molto bella...

                    You must leave...

      But her long legs are wrapped tightly around him.

                                  MARCO
                    My soul is moist... but when I touch

                    Sea foam and roses... what is this 
                    scent? Profumo segreto?

      Her fingernails cat-claw into his back. And then -- SUDDEN 
      BANGING AT THE DOOR.

                    Caterina! 

      Young Marco rolls into his trousers. The naked Dona Caterina, 
      nipples erect, blonde tresses wild, ushers him out --

      ONTO THE BALCONY

      Where he gets dressed on the reckless descent, climbing down 
      the portico where incoming ships SOUND BELLS and A DOG BARKS 
      from the next balcony down...

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    Venezia, from the Latin  Veni

                    come, you will always see new 
                    marvels, and new beauties...




      Marco sits on the end of a dock, eyes searching the vast 
      waters of St. Mark s Basin. He is writing in a small leather 
      bound journal...

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    But as a child of the canals I 
                    longed to see the marvels that lay 
                    beyond. The wonders explored by my 
                    father, far out at sea... 

      A GONDOLIER punts his batela dream-like on the lagoon, a 
      silhouette.

                                  MARCO (V.O.)
                    It had been sixteen years since 
                    Nicco Polo sailed on his great 
                      adventure... eight months before I 
                    was born.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Marco!

      Four teenaged Venetian Street Toughs come out from the maze 
      of alleys: The locals call boys like this CANAL RATS.

      Canal Rat #3 wraps his cape up around his head like a woman s 
      shawl and hugs himself in amorous mockery.

                                  CANAL RAT #3

      Marco tries to tug the journal away from the juveniles.

                    Let s see your stories. About the 
                    great traveler --

      He grabs again; a struggle ensues --

                    He s no hero, Marco. He s a carpet 
                    peddler. A spice salesman.

                    Va fanculo tua Madre.

      A FIST smashes INTO HIS FACE as Marco hooks him; fight s on --
      spilling into the -- CANAL ALLEYS.

      Canal Rat #4 draws a street stiletto. Fists fly as Marco 
      takes a punch, throws three back, cuts another guy s eye. And 
      now Marco, too, has a short blade in his hand.

      The other boys spread out to let Marco and Canal Rat #4 pair 
      off with blades. The footwork is an unrefined form of 
      European fencing, blades extended. Lunge and parry; parry and 
      lunge.

      Uncle Maffeo loads crates of spices and fabrics. He gazes out

      please him. Nor does it upset him; he simply shakes his head,

      Niccol  fastens the rope at the mast and looks away. Then, 
      suddenly, Niccol  s eyes widen because he sees:

      MUSIC UP.

      Marco looks over his shoulder as some turbaned members of an 
      ARMED RETINUE escort two of the haggard Priests in the 
      opposite direction; they are retreating. After a concerned 
      beat, Marco spurs his donkey on...

      -- SILHOUETTES AGAINST A RAGING SNOW STORM: hooded, frost-
      bitten men and a LARGER ARMED ESCORT on donkeys lead Bactrian 
      camels 14,000 feet above sea level. Niccol  looks back at 
      young Marco, wrapped in layers, high on a camel. Freezing, 
      but keeping on with absolute determination...

      -- A BARREN SEA OF SAND DUNES. As the Polo caravan crests a 
      giant dune, they behold: the TAKLIMAKAN DESERT. No end in 
      sight. As a sun-blistered Niccol  checks the water supply, 
      another Priest drops to his knees, exhausted. 

      MARCO hears STRANGE VOICES; like a MILLION WHISPERS in 
      different tongues, surrounding him. Calling to him. Then, as 
      the  SINGING SANDS  shift, they WHISPER LOUDER and --

      A SAND STORM swallows the caravan. Shouting in urgent 
      Italian, Maffeo tosses a rope to Niccol . Niccol  tosses a 
      knotted length back to his son. They cling to the same rope 
      as they vanish...

      and handsome. Long curls ride his shoulders; a hint of a 
      beard threatens at his chin. He smiles in awe...

      MUSIC DOWN.




      The Polo caravan slowly approaches a village of adobe-like 
      huts and smoldering thatch. An ARMED GUIDE holds up a warning 
      hand... then cautiously proceeds into -- A RAZED VILLAGE.

      Where they ride along the margin of a high wall. Marco 
      realizes, as he passes through, that the wall has been 
      constructed of dead bodies. He covers his nose with his 
      threadbare scarf...

      The last Priest remaining crosses himself, but endures. 
      Niccol  and Maffeo dismount cautiously and approach a TINY 
      OLD WOMAN; she speaks in hoarse MANDARIN while the Armed 
      Guide begins to translate.

                    She says it s the work of Kublai

      Marco dismounts, curious. He draws near the corpses, 
      breathless. He passes piles of char, begins to slip and slide 
      on the melted fat of burned bodies, falls. Almost vomits when 
      he realizes what he s slipping on...

      Marco absorbs this... then he sees the last Priest doing 
      something odd. He is backing away from the scene and reciting 
      something in Latin about Hell and demons. He turns, begins to 
      run as --

      TWENTY FIVE MONGOL WARRIORS EXPLODE from a gully in a THUNDER 
      OF HOOFBEATS. In their heavy armor and furs, long mustaches, 
      they resemble a cross between mounted Samurai and demons from 
      the pits of Tartarus (the Priest s point, exactly).

      The Mongols surround the Polo party, bows raised and arrows 
      nocked. Niccol  discreetly moves himself in front of his son.  
      Maffeo reaches for his saddlebags, but the MONGOL CHIEFTAN 
      YELLS at him in MONGOLIAN. Niccol  speaks back, calmly. 
      Firmly.

                    Great Lord of Lord s.

      Marco observes as Uncle Maffeo slowly produces a gold-plated 
      wooden passport so all can see...

      The Chieftan rides forward, angles a look on it. The golden 
      tablet bears Mongolian script and Chinese letters. 

      Tense beat. As the Chieftan confers with a LIEUTENANT, 
      Niccol  and Maffeo make cautious eye contact. Marco relaxes a 
      bit, intrigued by the Mongols.

      SUDDENLY: At a one word command by the Chieftan, the Mongols 
      FIRE THEIR ARROWS. They begin to kill everyone. The armed 
      guide next to Marco crumples with an arrow through his 
      throat; another is brain-pierced, falls off his mule. An epic 
      arrow launch takes down the running Priest.

      The Mongols slaughter everyone... except the three Polo s.

      With that, he turns his horse and begins to lead the 
      entourage out of the razed village.

      The Mongol military escorts leads the Polo s toward a 
        magnificent, multi-cultural Utopia (precursor to today s 
      Forbidden City).

      As they approach one the city s three Western Gates, Marco 
      and the elder Polo s are swarmed by a MASS OF VENDORS and 
      LAUGHING CHILDREN. A shouting swell of CHINESE, MONGOLS, 
      TIBETANS, and PERSIANS...

      THREE BOY HORSEMEN gallop past; painted PROSTITUTES gaze up 
      at Marco; A DRUNKEN UIGHUR hurls insults at the Europeans. A 
      MONGOL SOLDIER strikes the offender brutally to the grass 
      with the butt-end of a lance.

      And this is just the village outside the gate. Passing 
      through a GARRISON OF MONGOLIAN AND CHINESE SOLDIERS, the 
      Polo s make a dizzying entry --

      THROUGH THE WESTERN GATE -- INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY.

      Where a CLOCK BELL is ringing a deafening announcement of the 
      arrival. Marco clings to the reins, enthralled, as they are 
      escorted through a SEA OF HUMANITY to --

      A HORN ALERT is sounding and HOOFBEATS gain as MONGOL

      And now the SEA OF HUMANITY, those who swarmed him when he 
      arrived, are swarming him again -- some wanting to touch his 
      skin, some wanting money, some hearing the horn and trying to

      the caravan taking leave.

      wooden saddle on a wild Mongolian pony. With ARMED GUARDS

      9 YEAR-OLD MONGOL BOYS ride circles around the foreigner,

      END MONTAGE. 




      Two Mongol Guards walk Marco across a field, point him in the 
      direction of a lone figure, just sitting out there in the 
      grass. Hesitantly, Marco approaches the man from behind.

      Judging by his saffron robes, he must be a monk. But his hair 
      is worn in a long topknot, the sign of a Taoist. HUNDRED 
      EYES, Minister of Martial Arts, is much younger than the 
      other scholars. 

      After a long moment of what seems to be profound meditation, 
      the monk speaks.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    May I ask... which hand does a 
                    European wipe his ass with? The 
                    left or the right?

      Hundred Eyes bites into a pear as he turns toward Marco. But 
      he doesn t look directly at him. He is blind.

                    I was told that you are to teach me

                    such a discipline?

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                      Absolutely nothing. I just never 
                    met a Latin before. I am curious.

                    Would that be the same hand that 
                    wipes your ass?

      Hundred Eyes goes hard-faced for a moment. Then he breaks a 
      dangerous smile, begins to laugh. Marco knits his brow; this 
      guy doesn t seem like a monk at all.

      SUDDENLY: Hundred Eyes tosses the pear core into the air.

      SLOW MOTION: He whirls, drawing a Chinese broad sword. HE 
      SLICES THE PEAR CORE in half -- not once, not twice, he dices 
      it before the pulp lands like descending blossoms.

      Marco stares, incredulous, a bit unnerved. The blind monk 
      sheathes his sword, rests his hand casually on the hilt.

      He turns his back on Marco, keeps turning, saffron robes 
      whirling -- and sweeps Marco on his ass.

      Marco is swept on his ass. It s been going on a long while 
      and he is sweat-drenched. Dirty-faced. It seems that this 
      monk is taking out his own ordeal on the young, foreign

                    There is no honor in this for me...

      Hundred Eyes walks around him in a methodical circle. Again, 
      he attempts to sweep. But Marco has had it; he decides to 
      evade, and does.

      But Hundred Eyes is not where Marco expected... and the Monk 
      kicks him hard in the ass.

      Marco spins and lunges with Italian temper. Hundred Eyes 
      evades with an almost imperceptible movement. 

      Marco goes at him, swings viciously. Can t touch him.

      Marco goes  canal rat,  advancing with knife-fight footwork, 
      gives it all he s got. Still can t touch him.

      Marco lunges, swings, misses the ghost again.

      bitter hook. Misses cleanly, can t believe it.

      The thought fills Marco with one last burst of rage. He 
      lunges, swings, feels himself giving out... and finally goes 
      down, exhausted in the grass.

      angry, unbroken colt. He gets to his feet just as --

      TWO MONGOL GUARDS ride up on horseback with official bearing 
      and stare down at Marco.

                      sounded...

      Marco is studying the GREAT CLOCK, but then -- at the SOUND 
      OF HOOFBEATS ON PAVEMENT -- he draws back quickly to allow 
      the passage of a mounted detachment: Fierce MONGOL GUARDS on 
      spirited horses.

      Marco observes GUARDS at the West Gate, notes a rotation with 
      OTHER GUARDS, and then AN EXPLOSION rocks the night.

      Marco, startled, trips back as a SECOND EXPLOSION makes him 
      wheel and see --

      POV: The NIGHT SKY bursting with an explosion and what looks 
      like a TREE OF FIRE raining torrents of flame.




      Marco moves curious toward EXOTIC MUSIC AND CROWD SOUNDS. He 
      follows his first view ever of FIREWORKS down the lane lit by 
      paper lanterns when --

      A TWELVE FOOT TALL CHINESE WOMAN in white painted face walks 
      toward him, a colorful fan in each hand. She is on the 
      shoulders of a STILT WALKER who strides through the JOVIAL 
      CROWD followed by ANOTHER. 

      Behind this folk dance, a PLATE SPINNER wheels about and a 
      MANCHURIAN DWARF juggles.

      As Marco drifts through the crowd, his eye is caught by 
      something else, appearing for a moment between passerby. It 
      is Kokachin, the stunning young royal he glimpsed in the 
      Khan s throne room. 

      SLOW MOTION: As she smiles, delighted with the show, Marco 
      watches her. 

      All around Marco, dwarves juggle, stilt-walkers do fan 
      tricks, and  fire trees  light the sky... but it is the 
      beauty of this young girl that has the Venetian utterly 
      hypnotized.

      Kokachin, turning to watch a juggler, spots Marco. She sees 
      him staring at her. Their eyes meet for a powerful, magnetic 
      second. Alchemy, indeed...

      Marco drifts through the street crowd, trying to find the 
      girl. A STILT-WALKER nearly tramples him; he gets around the 
      tall legs and spots her again.




      She walks, her hair falling past her hips. Marco pursues. She 
      glances over her shoulder. And then someone blocks his path. 
      ZA BING, the girl s Guard wears a two foot scimitar on his 
      hip, muscular arms banded in gold bracelets.

      Yet another curiosity: This giant of a man speaks with a 
      voice that lilts somewhere between soprano and contralto, his 
      eyelids darkened with kohl.

      Marco starts away, but tempts the fates with a look over his 
      shoulder. SECOND BELL...

      In the shadow of the Imperial Palace, Marco accompanies 
      SANGA, the tax collector, through the thriving marketplace, 
      the collections wagon ahead. Sanga is round, jolly --

                    tribute -- they end up peddling 
                    outside the wall. No market, no

                    Indeed. Here, in the Hall of Five 
                    Desires.

      Marco is met by an IMPERIAL EUNUCH in silk robes and regal 
      cap.

                    indoor lake, continue toward the 
                    east... there, you will receive 
                    your next instructions. 

      Marco doesn t get it.

                    Proceed.

      As Marco begins to enter the dark, incense-filled hall, he 
      can hear MUSIC that suggests the blend of exotic cultures 
      from the Silk Road...

                                  IMPERIAL EUNUCH (CONT D)

                    You can look... but do not touch.

      Marco studies the eunuch, intrigued now.




      Jingim is sweating under his helmet as he stares into the sea 
      of torches and weapons.

                                  JINGIM
                    Five hundred to the left... five

                                  MONGOL GENERAL
                    Prince Jingim, as your general, I 
                    am advising retreat.

      Jingim surveys his men, struggles with the decision.

                    We lure them to the valley, attack

                    There is no going back without taking 
                    this village. Give the command.

      The General hesitates... then gestures; flags sweep the air, 
      signalling the deep ranks of mounted Mongols. The NACCARA 
      DRUMS begin and THROAT SINGING RISES UP out of the night, out 
      of the earth...

      Jingim s TROOPS COLLIDE with the Song Rebels, metal against 
      metal, MONGOLS SCREAMING wildly...




      Under a new moon, Hundred Eyes is  circle walking,  a Taoist 
      form of martial arts meditation. With his hands held out in 
       Dragon Claws,  he flows around an object in the middle of 
      the circle...

      A COBRA, coiled and threatening...




      THE MONGOLS ARE RETREATING into the Valley Between Two Tiger 
      Hills when Jingim suddenly shouts an order. The GENERAL 
      repeats it, louder. FLAGS ARE HOISTED AND SWEPT from 
      galloping horses... a HORN BELLOWS...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1251.

      THE MONGOLS NOW SPLIT INTO THREE, the center unit making an 
      abrupt turn, UNLEASHING ARROWS. They meet the stunned charge 
      of Song Rebels. Byaamba gallops past Jingim, retching a war 
      cry from his belly.

      On foot now, and drawing his sabre, Jingim fights with the 
        highly-cultivated skill and elegance of a scholar with a 
      paint brush -- noble poetry in motion... while around him, 
      his men, like half-brother Byaamba, fight more like mace-
      wielding barbarians...

      Jingim impales a Rebel, spins and slices two more in one 
      move. He ducks a swing of a pudao and fires a dance-like 
      spinning back kick that crushes an ATTACKER S throat. 

      TWO OF HIS MEN go down beside him. Then another. SONG REBELS 
      are spilling into the valley like floodwaters... a BRUTAL 
      MARTIAL ARTS SPECTACLE.

      As Jingim stares horrified, a BLADE CUTS his leather armor. 
      Quickly he reacts, wheeling. Leaping. And driving his sabre 
      down into the heart of a rebel with a PLUME OF BLOOD...




      Hundred Eyes reverses his circle walk, hypnotizes the Cobra. 
      But then it strikes!


      Jingim is driven back by a WALL OF REBEL FIGHTERS and Chinese 
      weaponry. No choice now. He grabs a runaway horse, not his 
      own, and mounts on the fly.

                    Avvi! Avvi!

      The General s left arm is cut off. Jingim, bloodied, now 
      shouts the retreat command, GALLOPS out of the valley...MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1252.

      AT THE HALL OF FRAGRANCE Kokachin stands on her balcony in 
      her silk robe, a cup of cha already prepared for her. While 
      Za Bing plaits her hair, more like a giant nanny than a 
      guard, she gazes out beyond the walls, toward the Steppe. 
      Toward freedom, perhaps.




      Marco is blindfolded before Hundred Eyes. Together they 
      practice chi sao or  sticking hands,  training Marco to sense 
      changes in pressure, momentum and "feel.

                    Do you feel the darkness that I 
                    live in? Long ago, in my darkest 
                    hour... my life was saved by a 
                    lamb.

                    I ate the bastard. With some cooked 
                    rice and a cup of plum wine.

      With that distraction, Hundred Eyes tries to sweep him. Marco 
      moves into  Dropping Horse  taking the weight off the swept 
      foot and avoiding the  Cutting of the Roots.

      Hundred eyes sweeps the other foot; Marco moves into  Rooster 
      Stance.  Not bad. Basic, but not bad. Hundred Eyes taps him 
      between the eyes and he removes the blindfold, relieved to 
      see again.

      Hundred Eyes makes to leave.

                      Remarkably drunk.

      Marco looks after him, bemused. Then he glances down at a 
      short sword in the monk s small training arsenal. He steals 
      it. Hides it in his nearby saddle scabbard.

      Hearing HOOFBEATS, he turns.

      MARCO S POV: A small ROYAL PROCESSION is passing. Led by Za 
      Bing the Eunuch, Kokachin is seated on an open litter carried 
      on the shoulders of SERVANTS. She is dressed in Mongolian 
      beadwork, felts, and ermine tails, and atop her head is a 
      tall bejeweled boqta. 

      CLOSE ON KOKACHIN -- she keeps her proud face forward, but 
      her pretty Asian eyes look out the corners toward the 
      training field. Toward the young foreigner.

      MARCO reacts to the hard gaze of Za Bing. He casts his eyes 
      downward. When the Princess has passed by, he recovers, 
      prepares another arrow...MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1254.

      Marco sits with his ancient Confucian Calligraphy Tutor under 
      a dragon spruce. He observes the meditative state the scholar 
      enters as he brush strokes a character:

      The ancient artist turns his wizened, 104 year-old face to 
      the young Westerner. He reads the young man s eyes. He 
      smiles...




      A shirtless Marco steps out onto his porch. The defeated 
      Mongol War Party, led by Jingim, rides back into the Imperial 
      City. The Prince is bloodied, mud-caked.

      This last nuance burns the Chancellor. He is about to reply 
      when the girl child, LING LING, appears at her mother s hip. 
      A pampered Imperial Daughter of a concubine. The Chancellor 
      softens.

      Marco kicks Ba-Tu s flanks and trots away...

      TROTTING ACROSS CAMBULAC, he becomes aware of HOOFBEATS 
      behind him. Quickening. Gaining. Overtaking him, and nearly 
      knocking him from his saddle, as a NIGHT RIDER gallops past, 
      making a strange whistle. Marco s horse bolts, chasing --

      Out on the moonlit grasslands, the Night Rider finally reins 
      to a stop, spins his frothing horse in a circle around Marco 
      who tries to recover from the full-out stampede.

      before setting chase, Marco dismounts quickly.

      Urgently, he pulls the two wrapped bundles of salt cakes from 
      his saddle bags and stows them in the ruins of a rammed-earth 
      wall on the Steppe.

      SIXTH BELL...

      The two riders clear the gate, make it in...




      Kokachin, hooded again, turns the corner on her horse. She 
      dismounts, handing the reins to Za Bing. He is sweat-soaked 
      with worry and not pleased with his charge.

                                  ZA BING
                    It won t be you who gets cattle-
                    branded, Princess.

      She ignores him, slips in through the gate. 




      Jingim rides at the head of a SMALL SCOUTING PARTY. When he 
      sees Marco approaching on horseback, gerfalcon on his wrist, 
      he does not bristle. Jingim is too composed for that.

                                  JINGIM
                      I understand that you are to join

                    If it pleases the prince.

      Clearly it does not. Marco offers a look that says:  Fuck

      Byaamba, that tough son of a Khan concubine, rides up on 
      Marco s other side.

      Marco gives Byaamba a testy look, but controls his temper; 
      maybe Hundred Eyes s teachings are taking root. He turns his 
      mount and heads to the back.

      Jingim is now staring at Byaamba.

                                  JINGIM
                    You, too.

      Byaamba pretends he didn t hear his half-brother, rides 
      toward the back by his own accord... with Marco Polo, the 
      Venetian.




      Jingim s procession rides north at a steady trot. When they 
      reach a stream, Jingim orders all to water their mounts. 
      Marco rides his way forward, comes alongside the Prince.

      Marco digests this as Jingim leads his horse away. Looking 
      out, Marco spots a song bird in the sky. Inspired in the 
      moment -- perhaps wanting to show his skills in front of 
      Jingim -- he turns his horse and prepares his gerfalcon.  
      Jingim watches him. So does Byaamba.

      Marco casts the hunting hawk skyward. Impressive. But it 
      doesn t go after the bird. It flies away. Home.

      LAUGHTER from the streamside Mongols. Jingim smiles.

                                    BYAAMBA
                    Your hawk went home. Don t worry. 
                    We will hunt for you. 

      Jingim reins his horse in a tight circle, shouts an order to 
      press on.

      Marco s hawk-glove looks naked, his pride wounded. But he 
      recovers and catches up with the procession.




      A world away from the opulence of Cambulac, this is the old 
      capitol of the nomads. Pastoral. Hundreds of yurts. Adobe-
      like walls and huge stone turtles at the gate.

      TRADITIONAL MONGOLS go about their business... then react to 
      approaching HOOFBEATS. From the walls, GUARDS shout  Khagan 
      Kublai.  A primitive horn is sounded...

      POV: Jingim leads the procession in, the flags of the House 
      of Kublai (sun and moon insignia) held high.

      REVERSE: Ariq emerges from his dwelling, eating borts. The 
      Khan s powerfully-built younger brother watches his ROYAL 
      GUARD hem in and escort the Prince.

      When Jingim dismounts, TWO GUARDS take his horse...

                                  ARIQ
                    My nephew. I see you still ride the 
                    horse I gave you on the White Moon.

                                  JINGIM
                    Uncle...

      Jingim approaches. Ariq offers his arms; Jingim grips them 
      just below the elbows. Marco observes the custom as he 
      dismounts, his curious eyes taking in the tribal city...

                    will kill a sheep and drink kumis. 
                    Come.

      As Jingim and a small entourage follow Ariq toward the huge 
      Royal Yurt at center, Marco follows...

      But at the door Jingim stops, gives him a look. The Prince 
      speaks Mongolian and the door is closed to keep Marco out. 
      The small entourage guards the yurt.

      With CHILDREN gathering around him, curious, Marco remains 
      out in the yurt camp. HARD-EYED GUARDS keep watch on the 
      foreigner.




      Marco is wandering casually, taking in the sight of HUNDREDS 
      OF HORSES pastured close to the city. As he moves past one, 
      he pats it, feels its ribs.

      Now he moves over to large adobe cisterns of grain. He 
      surveys, touches some. Scoops a handful, lets it sift through 
      his fingers...




      Marco is walking back through Ariq s vast herds when he stops 
      and examines. A MONGOL HERDSMAN stands by, watching the round-
      eye with suspicion.

      The Herdsman flinches when the white boy speaks native 
      tongue. But the comment makes him beam.

                    see?

      The Herdsman proudly allows Marco to poke below the loin of a 
      horse, then lift its leg to examine a hoof.

      Then a GREAT COMMOTION draws his eyes to --

      TRADITIONAL DRUMMING and festivity. Jingim is outside the 
      Royal Yurt with his uncle; all is jovial.

      MARCO lowers the horse s leg, dusts his hands off and makes a 
       fine horse  breath sound to the Herdsman who returns it.

      like an animal.

      Hundred Eyes stands before a SMALL ARMY OF KHAN SOLDIERS, 
      training them in Wudang weapon attacks. At the sound of 
      HORNS, DOGS BARKING, and THREE BELLS FROM THE CLOCK, the monk 
      grows silent.

      Marco silently, quickly, slips a bridle over Ba-Tu s poll. He 
      tightens the leather cinch on the wooden saddle...

      Marco trots out steadily... looks over his shoulder... then 
      swings his Mongolian wrist-whip over and under. Ba-Tu bolts!

      Marco leans forward in saddle, making an escape. Breathless, 
      he BUSTS OUT onto the open grasslands, whips Ba-Tu harder.  
      He s going for it. 

      But now OTHER HOOFBEATS pound earth. Gaining. A LONE RIDER 
      pursuing. Whipping faster, harder, Marco drives Ba-Tu at a 
      full canter. But --

      In seconds, the Lone Rider overtakes him, lassos Ba-Tu, yanks 
      hard. Marco is thrown ass-over-stirrups to the ground.

      The Lone Rider circles him.

      Hundred Eyes turns his horse, starts back for Cambulac, calm 
      in the saddle. 

      Marco watches him go, torch light of Cambulac beyond him, 
      debates. Ba-Tu noses him.

                                  MARCO
                    Jesu  Christo...

      FIRST BELL...




      Marco is going spear against sword versus Hundred Eyes, but 
      the monk avoids or deflects every thrust. Marco is breathless; 
      Hundred Eyes hasn t broken a sweat.

      He strips Marco of his sword, knocks it to the grass.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    Why do you think the sword has a 
                    colored sash? To look pretty? Do
                    you wish to fight your opponent? Or 
                    fuck him?

      Marco picks up the sword and this time wraps the sash around 
      his wrist. HOOFBEATS. Steady, intent. Jingim rides up, 
      dismounts. 

                                  JINGIM
                    He s advanced quickly to the 
                      broadsword. You train him well, 
                    Hundred Eyes.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    I must. If any harm befalls him, I 
                    am held accountable.

                                  JINGIM
                    May I join practice?

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    You re the Prince. You may kill him 
                    if that s your desire.

      Marco throws a sardonic look at Hundred Eyes as the monk 
      walks away a neutral distance. Marco stands half-ready with 
      his broadsword, the sash hanging long. Jingim moves with a 
      grace that is terrifying in its slow, flowing, controlled 
      beauty.

      As he circles Marco, the Venetian does a reverse shuffle step --
      a la Venetian fencing style. Hundred Eyes senses something, or 
      hears it in the breeze.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1275.

                    Do you wish to fuck him?

      Marco remembers: Quickly wraps the sash around his wrist just 
      as Jingim lunges and thrusts. Marco blocks and parries --the 
      sword match is on! Jingim wields his weapon like a paint 
      brush, every slash and stab refined and containing uncanny 
      internal power.

      Jingim is playing with him; taunting him. And then he brings 
      it. Hard. Marco slides into  dropping horse  then wheels and 
      slashes, almost catches Jingim off-guard. The Prince drives 
      Marco backward, baffles him with footwork, then delivers an 
      utter BEAT DOWN.

      Hundred Eyes, even in his detached state, almost moves in. 
      But it s over. Marco is on his back, swordless. Jingim s 
       scholar s blade  is at this throat. Precisely.

                                  JINGIM
                    If you ever humiliate me in the 
                    eyes of the Khan again...

                                  MARCO
                    I only told what I saw.

      Jingim composes himself. Gathers his breath. 

                                  JINGIM
                    You were right.

      Marco reacts. Wasn t expecting that.

      Jingim starts to his horse, half-turns; a true scholar-
      warrior, he bows to Hundred Eyes. Hundred Eyes gives a 
      slight, informal head bow in return.

      As Jingim mounts and rides off --

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    I d hate to see what he d do if you 
                    were wrong.

      Marco touches his chin. A little blood. Or is that dirt?




      Excitement on the battlements. General Red Brow assumes a 
      vantage point..

      RED BROW S POV: In the distance, the Mongol Troops are 
        withdrawing; a slow march home in a shroud of humid haze and 
      dust. A miracle...

                                    GENERAL RED BROW (V.O.)
                    They are withdrawing...

      Chancellor Jia Sidao appears. Looks out, containing his joy.

      As OFFICERS GATHER to watch, one of them approaches the 
      Chancellor, whispers at his ear.




      The SONG REBEL ARMY stands amassed on the military floor, a 
      frightening sight. They REPEAT A FIERCE CHANT at the command 
      of General Red Brow. Then the fortress town falls chillingly 
      silent.

      The Chancellor appears before them, dandified in his ornate 
      robes.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    A more fierce army I have never 
                    seen. It is no wonder the 
                      barbarians fled.

      MASS MILITARY CHANT. Then deep silence again.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    But it s come to the attention of 
                    your Prime Minister that some of 
                    his great soldiers have questioned 
                    the political order of the Song 
                    Court now that the Emperor has 
                    died.

      THE FACES OF THE SOLDIERS could be terra-cotta. SWEAT doesn t 
      drip, it courses over their branded tattoos.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    General. Who is the best fighter in 
                    your esteemed army?

                                    GENERAL RED BROW
                    Yang Chun!

      The SOLDIER who steps forward is six cubits and a span tall, 
      sleeveless armor revealing arms like Burmese pythons. His 
      hair and beard are insane -- a perfect example of the kind of 
      marsh outlaws and mercenaries among these Song rebels.

      Called out to the floor, he towers over --

                                    GENERAL RED BROW (CONT D)
                    In Shantung Province, he is called 
                    Whirlwind Tiger. He has mastered 
                    the Five Animal Styles of Shaolin.

      Whirlwind Tiger bows deeply, every sinew rippling.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    Whom do you serve?

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    The walls have ears, my friend. 
                    What do the men say about my study 
                    of crickets? My Praying mantis 
                    games...

      Uncomfortable beat.

                                  WHIRLWIND TIGER
                    With humility and respect, some 
                    have spoken of the Chancellor s 
                    insect games as a... curious hobby.

      Chancellor Jia Sidao digests this.

                                  WHIRLWIND TIGER (CONT D)
                    Those were the only words whispered, 
                    Great Chancellor.

      The Chancellor stares intently into the small eyes of the big 
      soldier. Perhaps he will let it go. Then he smiles. Holding 
      his arms out he summons a PAGE to remove his silk robe. The 
        Chancellor s underlayer is a black silk uniform with white 
      collar.

      Whirlwind Tiger shifts his hard eyes as the smaller man 
      begins to circle him, slowly.

                                  JIA SIDAO
                    Show me your Five Animal Kung Fu.
                    Defeat me and you are promoted to a 
                    command post -- with all the 
                    residual income and pleasures.

      Whirlwind Tiger carefully shifts his weight as the Chancellor 
      tightens the casual circle.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                      However... if I defeat you, you are 
                    my chamber boy.

      Whirlwind Tiger seethes, but contains it. The Chancellor 
      makes a sudden move into a ready stance. Whirlwind Tiger 
      refuses to engage.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    Insult me, you die. Show me why
                    they fear you here and why the name 
                    Whirlwind Tiger is famous.

      Jia Sidao throws a finger jab; Whirlwind Tiger blocks it, 
      effortlessly. Jia Sidao smiles. Game on, he circles faster. 
      Tiger drops low into a  Coiling Dragon  stance and deftly 
      establishes his fighting measure.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1286.

      The entire army stands rapt as the two square off. Then Jia 
      Sidao lunges at the soldier with a flurry of strikes and 
      kicks. Whirlwind Tiger deflects them all and lands a  Crane 
      Strike  (his hand held beak-like) to the neck of the Prime 
      Minister.

      Emboldened, he whirls with a spinning ax kick, and that s 
      when it happens: The Chancellor traps the kick with his hands 
      held in an uncanny imitation of a praying mantis snatching an 
      insect. Whirlwind Tiger spins free and attacks with a flurry 
      of  Snake Strikes ...

      The Chancellor intercepts every blow with Praying Mantis 
      Style moves and then fires a lightning-quick stab to the 
      bridge of the soldier s nose, dropping him.

      A GREAT HUSH of awe spreads through the fortress.

      ANGLE ON: THE FORTRESS BRIDGE -- Mei Lin, being escorted out, 
      stops to watch.

      BACK ON the Chancellor standing over the fallen soldier.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    On your feet. You may take a
                    weapon.

      Whirlwind Tiger rolls to his feet, sweating even harder. He 
      cannot believe what he is tangling with.

      Whirlwind Tiger hesitates a beat then turns to the phalanx, 
      grabs a broadsword. He spins at the chancellor,  flowering  
      the sword in a deadly blur and goes for his head.

      The Chancellor doesn t simply emulate a praying mantis, he 
      seems to channel its essence (hands held up like mantis 
      claws, his torso rocking and swaying) as he lures in his 
      opponent s force, clasps the sword arm in a  hooking hand,  
      twists low, and BREAKS THE SOLDIER S ELBOW with a sound like 
      splintered wood.

      SLOW MOTION: The Chancellor goes airborne and SPINS 360 with 
      a kick that fractures the jaw. As Whirlwind Tiger falls, 
      Chancellor goes with him, shooting a Mantis Hand at a vital 
      meridian point under the big man s arm and paralyzing him.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    Praying Mantis Kung Fu. Curious 
                    little hobby, yes?

      The Chancellor drives the broadsword downward, his knee on 
      the blade and CUTS THE SOLDIER S HEAD OFF (in a move called 
       Mantis Beheads Its Prey ).





                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/1287.

      Now he stands before the army taking great satisfaction in 
      their transfixed gazes. He holds his arms out and the Page 
      hurries to him, helps him back into his silk robe.

                                  JIA SIDAO (CONT D)
                    One rotten log can weaken the
                    forest. 

      As the Chancellor exits, General Red Brow takes over, 
      SHOUTING COMMANDS.

      FROM THE FORTRESS BRIDGE: Mei Lin watching. But it s time for 
      her to leave.




      MONGOL HORSEMEN are practicing war games. 

      Hundred Eyes stands down on the field, listening as a RAM S 
      HORN is sounded and --

      A Mongol Rider explodes out of formation and gallops across 
      the arena. A Second Horseman is charging toward him, each 
      armed with a 12 foot lasso pole. They COLLIDE at center and 
      the Second Horseman ropes the First off his horse.

      ANGLE ON: A Pavilion -- The Khan sits with his Four Wives, 
      watching the war games. Nearby, BARONS and OTHER NOBLES sit 
      as well. Among them, Kokachin, her Attendants, and Za Bing 
      the Eunuch.

      DOWN IN THE ARENA -- The victorious Mongol Rider races toward 
      -- THE FORMATION...

      Where Jingim looks at the next horseman over. It is Marco, 
      wearing leather plated armor and helmet.

                    If you ve been invited to the horse

                    battle with us. To give your 
                    accounts, I assume.

                                  MARCO
                    Don t worry, Jingim. I was told

      Here he is again! In tag-team fashion, A RIDER touches the 
      poll of Marco s horse. Ba-Tu rockets forward, Marco clutching 
      his lasso pole. GREAT CHEERS go up, mixed with AMUSED 
      LAUGHTER.

      HUNDRED EYES cocks his head, feeling the feverish hoofbeats 
      punch past him, weighing the nuance of the laughter.

      ON HIS HORSE, Marco storms Byaamba.

                                    BYAAMBA (CONT D)
                    Behold me, Foreigner. I am 
                    descended from the line of Genghis. 




      THE PAVILION. The Khan observes, expressionless. His wife 
      Chabi leans close while the Three Other Wives TRILL wildly.

                                  CHABI
                    Your son, Byaamba.

                                  CHABI
                    Young Polo.

      The Khan watches, intrigued. KOKACHIN stops fanning herself, 
      and takes interest. 




      Marco and Byaamba charge each other like a cross between 
      Cheyenne warriors and medieval knights. As they collide, 
      Marco slams Byaamba with his lasso pole, but the Mongolian 
      deftly lands the loop around Marco s horse s head and makes 
      him rear.

      Marco is thrown from his saddle to a great burst of TRILLS 
      and HOLLERS. Byaamba prances his horse around him to rub in 
      the victory.

      ANGLE ON: THE PAVILION -- Kokachin stands in worried reflex. 
      All eyes go to her. Slowly, she sits again, fanning herself. 
      Za Bing, standing guard, looks at her for a long moment...

      DOWN IN THE ARENA -- A KETTLE DRUM is booming now. Marco, 
      getting back into saddle, feels a horse trot by closely.

                                  MONGOL GENERAL
                    You. Latin. We need you at East 
                    Flag.

      Marco quickly mounts Ba-Tu and joins in --

      A MONGOL ROUND-UP AND DRIVE.

      As 100 HORSES are released from a holding pen and allowed 
      into the arena. With great fanfare -- and the DRUM STILL 
      BEATING -- Marco, Byaamba, Jingim, Aju, and other horsemen 
      drive the wild herd up and down the arena.

      ON A THIRD PASS -- MARCO sees a rolled and tethered carpet in 
      the dusty arena center. HOOVES STAMPEDE over it, crushing it. 
      Then circle back...

      Jingim does a take, as his horse passes Marco.

                                  JINGIM
                    Sanga. Sanga is in the carpet.

                                  MARCO
                    Sanga? I don t understand...

      Marco watches the HORSE HERD PULVERIZE the carpet for a fifth 
      time.

                                  JINGIM
                    His tax deposits did not balance.

      Jingim and Marco watch as the carpet is unrolled and the 
      broken body of Sanga rolls out into the dirt.

                                  JINGIM (CONT D)
                    He was given an honorable death.

                    the Sky God, did not see his 
                    blood...

      But the look in Jingim s eyes is no more hardened than 
      Marco s. He doesn t like it. But he rides on, working his 
      whip at the rear of the herd. Marco just sits on his saddle, 
      observing Mongol justice. He does not join in for a sixth 
      stampede. He looks up at --

      of the Secretariat Council. Ahmad rises... and leaves.




      Marco stands alone, under the vast night sky, Ba-Tu grazing 
      near. He studies the stars for compass and direction. Should 
      he make a run for the Silk Road? Or risk death going into 
      battle with the Khan s men?  

      Then he spots a Night Rider moving secretly toward a lone 
      tree.  

      POV: Kokachin drops back her head, looks around. She 
      dismounts and approaches the tree, kneels. From a woven bag, 
      she removes a jewel -- looks around again -- then buries it.

      Now she ties some kind of silk ribbon in the tree...

      Marco watches her lope back to the gates of Cambulac. He 
      wonders. But now the MONGOLIAN THROAT-SINGING is rising 
      louder...

      Marco, armored -- sword at his hip, quiver and bow at his 
      back -- slowly rides Ba-Tu (the horse is armored, too) at the 
      rear of the march. He does a take when he sees --

      Jingim, riding in a division of  10  closer to the rear than 
      to the front. Demoted to quartermaster, he is no longer 
      leading a detachment. He leads a group that includes his half-
      brother Byaamba.

      As Marco studies this uncomfortable dynamic:

                                  JINGIM
                    What is General Bataar doing with 
                    the lancers? Who leads us north? 

      That seems to be the prevailing question throughout the mass 
      of troops. Then NACCARANA DRUMS begin to boom. The LIGHT 
      INFANTRY BEGINS TO PART, clearing a path.

      Riding out from the Imperial Palace, flanked by MOUNTED 
      GUARDS is Kublai Khan. He might be overweight, beginning to 
      age, but in his leather-plated armor and iron-spiked helmet, 
      he looks every bit the warrior king, grandson of Genghis.

      ALL OF CAMBULAC GOES PRIMAL. Deafening THROAT SINGING and 
      DRUMMING...

      ANGLE ON: A PAVILION -- Chabi stands, wearing her royal 
      boqta, flanked by her GUARDS and BUDDHIST ADVISORS (who burn 
      incense). The Other Three Wives are there, too, watching the 
      Khan ride to the front.

      NEAR THE REAR OF THE MARCH -- Jingim bows his head with the 
      others as his father rides fiercely toward the front.

                                  JINGIM (CONT D)
                    His health hasn t been good enough 
                    to hunt. How can it be good enough 
                    to go to war?

      Byaamba keeps his head bowed. A true believer.

      AS THE HORSE SOLDIERS MOVE OUT --

      Marco looks up at the HALL OF FRAGRANCE. 

      ANGLE ON: Kokachin on her balcony, watching him go. Their 
      eyes meet. He tries to keep her in view but he is swept along 
      with the great army...

                    Somebody wishes for you to have 
                    this. On your journey.

      Marco receives a Chinese fan, painted and perfumed. He opens 
      the ivory spine and it accordions into a delicate image of 
      two flying cranes.

                                  MARCO
                    Please send my gratitude to Her

                    Master Marco. It s from me.

      Za Bing gazes up with his kohl-painted eyelids. Then he 
      offers up something wrapped in silk.

                                  ZA BING (CONT D)
                    This is from the Blue Princess.

      Marco unwraps a small dagger with an ornate hilt, jeweled at 
      the top.

                    It is from her tribe. Carried in a

      Marco sticks the dagger into his boot sheathe as the surge of 
      moving horses, pushes him toward the gates.

      He realizes now that Hundred Eyes is riding with him. The 
      monk wears no armor -- just his Taoist robe and his topknot 
      drawn long.

      Ariq scans a deep grassy valley. With chilling fluidity for a 
      big man, he nocks an arrow. Aims. Fires.

      The arrow is called a  screamer,  has a hole through the iron 
      head so that it banshees on trajectory, arcs long, whistles 
      downward... plants deep in the earth, a hundred yards south.

      the same. Then he looks out to see --

      Kublai standing alone, staring into the distance. General Aju

      Ariq, on horse, and flanked by TWO SOLDIERS, rides up to face 
      TWO KHAN SOLDIERS sitting motionless on horseback. The horse 
      between them is riderless now...

      Ariq looks at the yurt.




      It begins with a single drum, the war pulse of the Naccarana 
      drums. The THROAT-SINGING begins to DRONE...

      Two massive armies, five ranks each, face each other from 
      across the golden valley.

      Marco looks out toward distant hills now, sees birds coming 
      up out of the fog. That s what Hundred Eyes seems to be 
      listening to; invisible warriors everywhere. 

      Then the THROAT-SINGING ENDS. The DRUMMING STOPS. The silence 
      is death-like. Suffocating. From the hill, Kublai nocks an 
      arrow. He draws back the bow... he FIRES A SCREAMER.

      This triggers the raising of BLACK FLAGS from the next hill 
      over. What follows is done in eerie silence:




      THE KHAN S TWO FRONT RANKS OF HEAVY CAVALRY -- Mounted on 
        heavily-armored horses remain motionless as the remaining 
      THREE RANKS OF LIGHT CAVALRY come galloping through the gaps 
      in the Front Ranks and FIRE A VOLLEY OF ARROWS into the sky 
      (into a predetermined  killing zone  to break up the enemy 
      formation).

      Jingim is one of these Light Archers, just one of the 
      soldiers now. He launches his arrow skyward, then wheels his 
      speedy horse, gallops back.

      ARIQ S SECOND RANK -- Catch arrows in their shields, or in 
      their bodies even as their own LIGHT ARCHERS storm through 
      their own gaps, doing the same.

      JINGIM -- Turns in his saddle, completely around, and times 
      his next arrow (and breath) with the split second that all 
      four of his horse s hooves are off the ground.

      The entire wing of Light Archers does the same, all in 
      harmony. The  Parthian shot.  And as they race back, they now 
      begin an encircling sweep toward the enemy flank.

      AT THE REAR OF THE FIFTH RANK -- Marco raises his leather 
      shield as ARROWS RAIN DOWN. He catches several concussive 
      hits, then lowers the shield. Suddenly, Hundred Eyes moves 
      his own shield at an angle and catches two more  heavies  
      that would have planted in Marco s neck and shoulder.

      ALL AROUND MARCO now, NACCARA DRUMS are beaten from the backs 
      of camels. No more silence. The KHAN S FRONT TWO RANKS scream 
      like demons loosed from Hell... and surge forward.

      ARCHERS encircle. THE MONGOLS COLLIDE...




      Kublai watches, stoic, from the back of his horse.




      FROM A HILL OPPOSITE, Ariq does the same. Like opponents in a 
      great chess match held on the Steppe of their childhoods.




      IN THE BATTLEFIELD:

      -- Byaamba fights from horseback with double broadswords, 
      cutting through Ariq s soldiers. His war cry is chilling.

      -- Jingim, in contrast, weaves and carves with precision. 
      When one of Ariq s warriors swings double meteor hammers at 
      him, he catches the chain with his lance, lets it wrap around 
      the shaft, then yanks the warrior off his horse.

      -- Byaamba gallops over this fallen warrior, CRUSHING HIS 
      BONES inside his armor. In the same surge, Byaamba swings his 
      blades and opens the entrails of an oncoming warrior...




      Ariq gives a calm order. A General repeats it and FLAGS ARE 
      RAISED.




      A THIRD RANK OF ARIQ S MEN gallop toward a NEW SURGE OF KHAN 
      HORSEMEN. But the trick is: Ariq s men each transport a LANCE 
      MAN  hitching a ride  on the right stirrup of each horse.

      Halfway into the charge, the Lance Men drop off the stirrup 
      and prop their spears as the horsemen wheel around and 
      retreat (firing  Parthian Shots ).

      THE KHAN S HORSEMEN plow right into this field of low spears, 
      their horses impaled. One of the ambushed men, the GENERAL in 
      Jingim s wing, pitches from his horse, pierced by a half-
      dozen arrows.

      As the surviving horsemen in the wing fall into disarray, 
      Jingim rides to the wedge point.

                    Tulughma! Tulughma!

      When the men witness Jingim bravely taking over, they fall 
      back in with him. The Crown Prince charges at his uncle s 
      troops, leading his archers. 

      SUDDENLY: A Lancer comes up out of the grass and Jingim s 
      horse is pierced through the breast. But Jingim isn t pitched 
      from saddle; he times it with a leap....

      SOLDIERS, runs his scholar s sword through the eye of a 
      THIRD. 

      In the fray, a wounded but fierce GOLDEN HORDE WARRIOR 
      squares off with Jingim.

                    You. Cousin. I laugh at you. You 
                    fight like a Chinese.

      He attacks with a massive sabre. Jingim blocks, parries, 
      slices his throat like a calligraphy touch.

                                  JINGIM
                          (Mongolian)
                    So I ve been told.

      The Golden Horde Warrior bleeds out on his quivering knees, 
      watching Jingim spin into  Cat Stance  and impale another.




      Kublai remains on his horse, motionless. Only his eyes move 
      here and there, always in anticipation of the next strategy. 
      He orchestrates it all via the Flagmen at his left...

      AT THE REAR OF THE FIFTH RANK -- Marco is trying to restrain 
      Ba-Tu who smells horse blood and wants to run -- either into 
      battle or away from it, doesn t matter. The young horse just 
      wants to run.

      As Marco  bends  his horse into a controlled circle, his eyes 
      pick up SHADOWS in the FOG BEHIND.

      MARCO S POV: Here they come. Ariq s ELITE WING RIDERS, like 
      devils loosed from the mists of Hell.

      HUNDRED EYES remains on his horse, facing the opposite 
      direction of the sneak attack.

                    I m wondering. If you live through 
                    this, does the Khan want you to 
                    describe the battle in all it s 
                    glory? Over a drink of wine?

      The Elite Death Squad is trotting hard at them...

                    Or does he want you to one day tell 
                    the story... so the West will know? 
                    And his name will live forever?

      Marco unsheathes his sword with one hand, restrains Ba-Tu 
      with the other.

      THREE ELITE WING RIDERS come in hard on Marco just as --

      Hundred Eyes spins his horse with two handfuls of long mane. 
      Braided into the mane are heavy, rusted, iron points. The 
      monk  chain whips  One Attacker, crushing his eye socket, 
      punctures the throat of a Second then CUTS THE ENTRAILS from 
      the belly of the Third, his broadsword slicing cleanly 
      through the leather armor.

      Marco s sword remains clean and unused.

      A FOURTH RIDER EXPLODES from the mist. Marco reacts, blocks a 
      spear attack, slashes the Fourth Soldier s wrist, cuts him so 
      deeply across the neck, he crumples in saddle before being 
      swallowed by the battle.

                    Good, Latin.

      Hundred Eyes smiles, darkly. Now he HEARS what MARCO SEES: A 
      DOZEN MORE ELITE WING RIDERS coming hard.

                                    HUNDRED EYES (CONT D)
                      Retreating shot. Go.

      Ba-Tu rockets away. The blind monk turns now, faces the 
      onslaught. His right hand holds a broadsword, his left 
      reaches to a scabbard and pulls out something Ariq s men have 
      never seen: A short spear combined with a dagger-axe.  

      The blind monk meets the charge of Golden Horde.

      THROUGH A NARROW VALLEY OF BLOODY GRASS -- Marco is galloping 
      for his life. He looks over his shoulder, only seeing FOG.

      SUDDENLY: TWO HORSES jump him from tall grass, cause his 
      mount to scream and rear. He is thrown, lands hard. Face 
      down.

      TWO MOUNTED WARRIORS move in. One is armed with a Turko-
      Mongol sabre, the Other grips a two-bladed halberd. Asiatic 
      faces, wind-burned and fierce; Nomads of the Steppe. 

      One Mongol catches the riderless horse, the other dismounts, 
      all business. Still, a THIRD MONGOL WARRIOR rides up now, 
      cold-eyed. He dismounts, draws a mace.  

      Marco rolls to his feet, his helmet somewhere in the grass, 
      his cowl down.

      The Mongols are about to attack when they realize he is a 
      white man. It freezes them for a moment. 

      The Third Mongol chambers his mace, is about to cave the 
      Westerner s head when --

      Now all three balk, weapons drawn. Marco darts his eyes 
      toward the warrior on the horse, takes a cautious step 
      backward... scheming a way out...

                    the Eternal Blue Sky...

      As he cautiously backs his way toward the high grass, he 
      becomes aware of a FOURTH MONGOL behind him --

      THE WARRIORS ATTACK!

      Marco ducks a sabre, rolls from the path of the double 
      halberd. It SLASHES at him again. He rolls again, alarmed. 
      Now a hook-scythe comes at him. 

      Marco slaps at his leather boot and draws Kokachin s Kerait 
      dagger.

      The Third Mongol charges with a brutal five-blossom spin of a 
      scimitar. He cuts Marco s leather plates, but the young 
      foreigner  swallows  his opponent s momentum...

      SLOW MOTION: Marco spins 180 and impales the attacker with an 
      inverted stab of the blade at the same time he fires a 
      balletic round kick, disabling the Halberd Warrior. 

      The Fourth Mongol is stunned by this unlikely display of 
      Chinese martial arts. But not as stunned as Marco; competent 
      skill aside, the young man is sweat-drenched and unnerved as --

      MONGOLIAN SOLDIERS flood the valley. THROAT SINGING chills 
      his blood...

      MARCO SWEEPS A HANDFUL OF SAND at the Fourth Warrior s face. 
      He then grabs the stirrup of his escaping horse, makes a 
      desperate running mount...

      BEHIND HIM: That HORSEBACK MONGOL sets chase with Double Fire 
      Meteor Hammers, two spherical weights connected by a chain, 
      filled with fuel and lit afire.

      Marco gallops for his life across the Steppe. He rides well, 
      but not as well as the Flying Hammer Rider gaining on him at 
      breakneck speed...

      Marco lifts his small, Mongolian-style recurve bow. Draws an 
      arrow from his quiver, nocks it. Turning around in the saddle 
      -- completely around -- he raises the bow. 

      ALL SOUND FADES. Only MARCO S PULSE -- in his face.

      SLOW MOTION  Marco times his breath with the exact half-beat 
      in which all four of his horse s legs leave the ground -- and 
      he RELEASES A WHISTLING ARROW...

      And it misses. Cleanly.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/12104.

      The Flying Hammer Rider bears down, has Marco dead to 
      rights... when a RED TASSELLED SPEAR IMPALES HIM.

      The Horseman who did the job keeps galloping past in the 
      opposite direction. Before he vanishes in the mist, he looks 
      over his shoulder. Jingim. Almost like rubbing it in.

      Marco finally breathes.




      Kublai gazes out. A Guard hands him a horse-hide container of 
      drink. He takes a swig, wipes his lips.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    Ariq believes my gates are too

      He looks into the distance as if hoping to catch sight of his 
      brother.

      A flag is raised. Not a black one. Not white. It is a flag 
      with an EMBLEM OF A DRAGON.




      Ariq sits on his horse, holding himself back from riding down 
      and taking heads. Then he hears the sound. Coming up from 
      behind, over the hills and bluffs, TWO RANKS OF NORTH CHINESE 
      FOOT SOLDIERS, armed with exotic variations on the 18 Weapons 
      of China.

      Ariq can t believe his eyes. At a breath sound, his flag men 
      raise a BLUE BANNER.  




      Ariq s Heavy Artillery turn and ride back to meet the charge 
      of Chinese Soldiers loyal to the Khan. The collision is epic; 
      the final eruption of the volcano. Mongolian warfare versus 
      Chinese martial arts.MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/12105.

      Ariq watches, seething. His General observes...

                                  ARIQ S GENERAL
                    Feign retreat...

      Ariq won t have it. He whips his horse and gallops down the 
      hill. His Guards go with him... and finally the General, 
      drawing his sword.




      Marco rides out, finds Hundred Eyes trotting toward him. The 
      blind monk collects his charge and the two ride back to the 
      outskirts.

                                    HUNDRED EYES
                    The Khan is winning... it will soon 
                    be over.




      Ariq is fighting like a rabid bear. In full armor he wields 
      his 2-foot sabre, severing limbs and crushing skulls. He 
      takes out three, four, five at a time.

      Still, the numbers are too great; he finds himself overcome, 
      surrounded by the Khan s Chinese and Mongolian warriors. 
      Byaamba is at the helm, breathing like a wounded animal and 
      cursing his uncle in Steppe Tongue...

      Ariq curses back, spits, throws his sword down.  

                                  JINGIM (O.S.)
                    Keep him alive...

      Ariq looks over to see Jingim, bloodied and on foot, aiming 
      an arrow. TEN MORE HORSE ARCHERS do the same. 

                                  ARIQ
                    Nephew. Altai. The horse I gave to 
                    you in the White Moon... did he die 
                    here today?

      Jingim spits blood, turns. Walks away.

      Byaamba signals for the Soldiers to restrain Ariq on his 
      knees. As they do, he looks up to see someone riding in.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)MARCO POLO:  NETWORK DRAFT04/06/12106.

      Kublai approaches on his horse, flanked by his General and 
      Guards. He rides up to the defeated Ariq, stares from the 
      saddle.

                                    BYAAMBA
                    Royal Father! Look! He is yours to

                                  ARIQ
                    Look where it has ended, Brother.  
                    The same valley where you and 
                    M ngke used to race horses... and I 
                    just watched.

      Kublai contemplates. With great effort he dismounts from a 
      creaking saddle and approaches his kneeling, restrained 
      brother. As he walks up on him, he unsheathes his sabre.

                                  ARIQ (CONT D)
                    Honor me, Kublai. You know 
                      Grandfather s law. Do not let Tengri 
                    the Sky God see my blood in the 
                    grass.

      Kublai appears unmoved. Keeps his sword out.

                                  KUBLAI KHAN
                    Give him his sword.

      No one moves. Even Ariq looks up, not sure he heard right.  
      After a moment, Byaamba who hustles to the task, picks up the 
      bloody steel and brings it to Ariq.

      The Khan s Soldiers release Ariq, let him get to his boots.  
      He grips his sword with two hands.

      At a gesture from the Khan, the men spread out into a great 
      circle. Riding into that circle to observe is Marco. Hundred 
      Eyes brings up the rear. 

                                  KUBLAI KHAN (CONT D)
                    We fight, Brother. If you win...

      IN THE CIRCLE OF MEN AND HORSES -- Jingim leans close to 
      General Bataar.

                                  JINGIM
                    We cannot let him do this...

      IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE -- The two brothers, grandsons of 
      Genghis Khan, circle each other slowly. It is true, Kublai is 
      overweight. Aging.

      His breath is heavier, more labored than his younger, more 
      vital brother s. But his eyes are blank, like those of a 
      killer wolf.

      Slowly, they circle each other. Bucolic Mongolian blue above; 
      grass slick with blood and horse waste below. The Khan lowers 
      his steel as if the weight tires him, or his mind is 
      elsewhere. This is the  silent stance,  trying to draw the 
      opponent out.

      Ariq smiles through caked blood and dirt. He won t be spooked 
      by big brother s deceptively-passive method. Instead, he 
      adopts it himself; the two large men encircle each other in 
      an almost sleepy stagger...

      MARCO looks at Hundred Eyes. The monk has his face turned 
      down toward his saddle, concentrating on the sounds -- the 
      birds, the breaths of the spectators, the absence of clanging 
      steel...

      ARIQ spins suddenly and lunges, Kublai BLOCKS STEEL. Ariq 
      spins again, younger, more lithe. Kublai blocks again... a 
      moment of strength against strength... then the Khan relaxes 
      his blade and lets gravity deliver Ariq. When the Khan goes 
      for a death-swipe, Ariq smacks him upside the helmet with the 
      flat of his blade.

      MARCO looks at Jingim as the CROWD REACTS. Jingim closes his 
      eyes for a moment. Sweat beads at his temples...

      ARIQ circles, lunges and goes for a beheading. Kublai avoids 
      and slashes his brother s torso, cutting deep through leather 
      plates. Ariq goes for another death-swing. Kublai blocks and 
      slashes Ariq s left arm, drawing blood.

      Ariq parries, cuts Kublai s hip, spins and peels the back of 
      his shoulder armor. Smelling blood now, smelling the throne, 
      Ariq turns it on, a frightening Mongol warrior.

      The two brothers go sword-to-sword in a flurry that leaves 
      the older Khan staggered. Now, when he lowers his sword and 
      goes flat-eyed, it is clearly not the  silent stance.  The 
      man is exhausted. Wounded. Stumbling...

      Ariq sees it. Scents it. Hears it in the worried breath 
      sounds of the Khan s own men. And so he launches like a bull 
      yak, swings for the neck.

      Kublai blocks it. Not with his sword. With his heavily 
      armored left arm. He takes the cut deep through the leather 
      plates, into bone. 

      With his right arm, he swings his sabre and cuts Ariq nearly 
      in half. The leader of the Golden Horde tries to spin, but 
      falls numbly to his knees. Across his rib cage, his lamellar 
      armor is turning black with the blood seep. Organ damage.

      The sun glints off his sword, in the grass, a short distance 
      away. The sun glints in his eyes as he takes in the bear-like 
      silhouette of his older brother. Hovering.

                                  ARIQ
                    Please. Older Brother. Let me leave 
                      Karakorum. You will hear my name no 
                    more... 

      Kublai hoists his blade high... and cuts his brother s head 
      off. As Ariq s torso topples and the Steppe drinks blood, 
      Kublai looks out at the surviving, wounded warriors from 
      Ariq s army. The Golden Horde.

      There is little doubt now. Word will travel. Tengri the Sky 
      God has witnessed it. Kublai is Khan of all Khan s. Kublai is 
      still a Mongol.

      He takes a few steps away in silence. For a moment, it 
      appears as if he might topple. Instead, he hands his sword to 
      Byaamba who cleans it on the grass. The Khan walks to his 
      horse. 

      For one moment -- one fleeting moment -- he catches sight of 
      young Marco Polo on his horse. The look the Khan gives seems 
      to say:  This is how I roll, Latin. Write it down. 

      Jingim watches his wounded father helped up into his saddle. 
      The Crown Prince s eyes betray his burdened thoughts. 

      Marco is looking across the circle at Jingim now. He sees 
      that look. Maybe he feels for him. He sees it all...
