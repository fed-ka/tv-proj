      SUPER: GLENFINNAN, SCOTLAND 1606, MACLEOD CLAN VILLAGE

      Past the wall of a crofter's hut, IAN MACLEOD and 3 or 4
      CLANSMEN standing by a crude wooden SHEEP PEN.  Warriors,
      mostly 30 to 40, the youngest is NEIL MACGREGGOR, 20s, a
      sour man.  The oldest is OLD TOM, probably mid-50s, but is
      nearly toothless and looks 20 years older.

      Ian is angrily discussing a wolf that's been decimating their
      livestock.

                                    IAN
                    We've but twenty sheep left.  Twenty,
                    not including the ram!
                          (grim)
                    That damn wolf has to be killed.

                                    NEIL
                    How do we know it's a wolf?  The
                    Campbells have stolen from us before.

      Ian throws him a look.

                                    IAN
                    And when they have, have they left
                    great bloody paw prints all over the
                    fields?
                          (grim)
                    'Tis a wolf, and a hungry one.  If
                    we're not to go hungry ourselves,
                    we've got to kill it.

      NEW ANGLE - THE WALL OF A CROFTER S HUT

      Where YOUNG DUNCAN MACLEOD and his cousin ROBERT listen
      intently.  Young Duncan is 13, an energetic, confident boy
      with dark good looks.  Robert is a year younger, blonde, his
      eyes almost popping at the news.

                                      ROBERT
                    Did you hear that, Duncan?  A wolf!

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Quiet, Robert, I cannot hear!

      RESUME - SCENE

      Neil and the others aren't happy about entering the Donan
      Woods.

                                    NEIL
                    No one's laid eyes on the beast.  It
                    comes and goes like a ghost.  Back
                    to its lair in the Donan woods.

                                    IAN
                    Then we'll follow it and set a lamb
                    for bait.

      The Clansmen shift uneasily, look at each other.

                                    IAN (CONT'D)
                    What ails you!  You're not put off
                    by a bloody overgrown hound?

                                    NEIL
                    You're chief of this clan, Ian
                    MacLeod, and I'd go to hell itself
                    for you, but the Donan Woods... Things
                    happen there.  There's been talk of
                    a witch since before my grandmother's
                    time.

      Old Tom rises from the stump he is sitting on.

                                    OLD TOM
                    And I have seen her.

      Old Tom moves around the men, working the crowd.

                                    OLD TOM (CONT'D)
                    She waits for the one who was born
                    on the winter solstice.
                          (beat)
                    She will devour him.  Old she is,
                    with snakes for hair and eyes that
                    glow like coal.  She's what's been
                    stealing our sheep!

      Others nod their assent.  Ian snorts derisively.

                                    IAN
                    What's stealing our sheep is a wolf,
                    and we're going to kill it!
                          (challenging)
                    Or maybe you'd rather have Old Tom
                    tell your wives why they're to starve
                    this winter?

      The men look embarrassed.  No one's going to risk that.

                                    IAN (CONT'D)
                    We'll start out tomorrow morn.
                          (beat)
                    And I'll hear no more talk of witches.

      As the men start to move off --

      YOUNG DUNCAN runs up, bursting with excitement, followed by
      Robert.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Father!  I'll join the hunt!  I'm
                    not afraid of wolves or witches!

      Ian ruffles the boy's hair affectionately.

                                    IAN
                    Good on you, Duncan.  You're a stout
                    lad...
                          (beat)
                    But this isn't boys' play.  The men
                    will go alone.

      Young Duncan's face falls in dismay.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    But Father...

                                    IAN
                          (sharply)
                    You'll not come tomorrow, Duncan,
                    and that's the end of it!

      Duncan stands chastened as the men move off.  NEIL turns to
      Young Duncan and Robert with a ghoulish leer.

                                    NEIL
                    Only one thing a hungry wolf likes
                    better than a lamb, Duncan MacLeod...
                          (beat)
                    And that's a young boy.

      He pulls his dirk and prods Young Duncan, theatrically
      demonstrating a gruesome scene.

                                    NEIL (CONT'D)
                    It starts with the softest parts. 
                    Like here.  Or here... then works
                    it's way up to the hardest.
                          (beat)
                    Your head.

      He RAPS Duncan sharply on the head, and moves off laughing. 
      Angry and humiliated, Duncan calls after him.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I'd not be afraid of any wolf!

                                      ROBERT
                    That's a good one.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    And I suppose you'd not wet your
                    kilt if You saw one.

      Robert shoves him.

                                      ROBERT
                    Look who's talking!  You wet yours
                    when Debra Campbell looked your way.

      Young Duncan shoves him back.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I did not.

                                      ROBERT
                    Did to.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    It was raining!

                                      ROBERT
                    I don't think so.
                          (beat)
                    I think you'd rather face the wolf
                    than Debra Campbell.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    And you'd not face either one of
                    them, Robert.

                                      ROBERT
                    I would too!

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (setting him up)
                    Prove it.  Hunt the wolf with me.

                                      ROBERT
                          (scared)
                    You want to go to Donan Woods?
                          (off Young Duncan's
                            nod)
                    I've never been there.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Come on, where's your spine?

                    You and me, Robert, we'll be heroes.

      Robert is taken aback.

                                      ROBERT
                    You heard what your father said!

                    What do you say?

      He extends his hand, waiting.  A BEAT -- Robert spits in his
      palm, slaps it into Duncan's, sealing the pact.  And OFF the
      clasped hands --96501       "Prophecy"       11.       Final Shooting Script 6/26/96




      A darkly treed forest.  Twisted trees, OWLS hooting in the
      distance -- it's a spooky atmosphere.  Young Duncan and Robert
      move uneasily into a clearing.  Far from the village, Robert
      is losing his bravado.

      The wind whistles through the trees.

                                      ROBERT
                    What was that?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    'Tis only the wind, Robert.  Calm
                    yourself.

                                      ROBERT
                    I cannot, my head is full of witches
                    and wolves.

      Young Duncan raises a hand, stopping him.  He looks at the
      ground, touches the earth.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    He was here.  And this is where he'll
                    return.

                                      ROBERT

                            look)
                    Old Tom swears she is.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Old Tom's mad as a loon.  When he
                    isn't drunk.

                                      ROBERT
                    Still.  She could cast a spell.
                          (worried)
                    What if she turns me into a toad?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Who'd know the difference?
                          (beat)
                    Now quiet, and hold this.

      He hands Robert a length of rope, then bends a branch down,
      cutting it with his knife to set a snare.  Robert looks
      doubtful as he loops the rope and hands it back.

      There's a DEEP GROWL directly behind them.  BEAT.  They look
      at each other in dismay, and whirl to see --

      THE WOLF

      a huge black thing, larger than life, gleaming yellow eyes,
      almost surreal, staring straight at them.

      The boys stand frozen, too terrified to move.

      Young Duncan drops his knife as they turn and sprint for
      their lives.

      ROBERT

      stumbles and falls, crying out.  Young Duncan turns back,
      yanks him to his feet.  They turn to run, but --

      THE WOLF

      stands before them.  Robert is terrified.  Young Duncan
      remains calm.  He slowly picks up the only weapon he can
      find -- a sharp stick -- and brandishes it at the wolf.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Back to the village!

                    Go!  I'll follow.

      Robert edges slowly away -- then runs for his life.  Young
      Duncan raises the stick.  He swallows, takes a firmer grip
      with both hands.

                                                                        CUT TO BLACK.

      1606 - NIGHT

      Next to the hut is what remains of a charred tree that's
      been struck by lightening.

      YOUNG DUNCAN'S POV - A SMALL POND IN THE WOODS

      Rising halfway out of the pond where she has been bathing is
      Cassandra.  Beautiful, wild-haired, the most remarkable thing
      Young Duncan has ever seen.

      RESUME YOUNG DUNCAN

      He acts stunned, overwhelmed, then embarrassed.  He quickly
      averts his eyes, closing them, turning away.  A battle rages
      within him, as almost against his will his face turns back
      to the goddess.

      CASSANDRA

      is slipping on a long silk robe, not self-conscious of her
      nakedness before Young Duncan.  She smiles as she sees him. 
      With the moonlight behind and in the loose robe she appears
      like an angel with wings.  She pulls back her hair and moves
      toward Young Duncan.

      YOUNG DUNCAN

      swallows hard as the vision approaches.  He backs into the
      wall of the hut and slides down on his butt.  He swallows
      hard.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Are you an angel?  Am I in Heaven?

      She smiles and shakes her head as she looks down on him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Not for a long time yet.
                          (beat)
                    My name is Cassandra.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    The wolf... Why did it not kill me?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Perhaps because I didn't want it to.

      He looks to see if she's kidding, but her smile is
        inscrutable.  She moves toward him and he backs away.

                    Don't be afraid.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I'm not afraid.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I can see that.
                          (beat)
                    I think you're a very brave boy,
                    Duncan MacLeod.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I am not a boy.  I am thirteen...
                          (beat)
                    How did you know my name?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Who else was born on the winter
                    solstice?

      Duncan reacts.  What does she mean by that?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (as it hits him)
                    Are you the witch of Donan Woods.

      Cassandra looks away into the night.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Some call me that.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    But they said that you're old... 
                    older than the Clan.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Do I look old?

      He shakes his head, faltering.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    They say you're evil.  That you cast
                    spells.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Do they now?

      She leans toward him, long hair cascading down her shoulders,
      letting her beauty speak for itself.  She knows the effect
      she's having on him.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    I might cast spells... But do I look
                    evil to you, Duncan?

      Young Duncan stares.  Clearly smitten.  He shakes his head,
      mumbles something under his breath.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    What was that?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (repeating what he
                            said)
                    You look beautiful.

      And OFF her smile, we --

110110OMITTED


      Tall cliffs, craggy and dramatic, tower above MacLeod and
      Cassandra as they sit on MacLeod's car, looking over the
      water.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not the Highlands, but it has
                    its charm.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It's beautiful.  I can see why you'd
                    want to stay.

      She turns -- MacLeod is gazing at her, remembering the
      attraction from his childhood.  She sees his look.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Why are you looking at me like that?

                                      MACLEOD
                    The last time I saw you I was thirteen
                    years old... and you were a witch in
                    the forest.
                          (beat)
                    I must have gone back into that forest
                    a hundred times... but I never found
                    you.
                          (beat)
                      I convinced myself you were a dream.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    How could you know I was Immortal? 
                    Or see what you would become?

                                      MACLEOD
                    But you knew.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The moment I laid eyes on you, I
                    knew you would fulfill the prophecy.

      MacLeod stops, gives her a look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Like you said, it's the twentieth
                    century.  I left prophecies behind
                    with the witches and fairies.

                    Duncan, listen to me.
                          (urgent)
                    The prophecy tells of a Highland
                    foundling born on the winter solstice
                    who would go through darkness into
                    light and survive to challenge the
                    voice of death.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Really?
                          (beat; flip)
                    Is that before or after I slay the
                    dragon?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan, this is real!  I've waited
                    centuries for the time to be right.

      She's desperate, almost pleading.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And Roland is part of this prophecy?

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (grim)
                    Yes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And he's right behind you.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He always is.

      At that moment they get the BUZZ.  They turn --

      ROLAND

      stands above them on a bluff.  When he sees who Cassandra is
      with, he smiles.

      RESUME SCENE

      Cassandra backs away.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It's him.

                                      ROLAND
                          (in a voice like
                            thunder)
                    MACLEOD!

      The voice echoes.  MacLeod's hand goes to his ear.

                    I get the feeling he doesn't like
                    me.

      MacLeod starts toward the stairs.  Cassandra grabs his arm
      in alarm.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    We have to leave, now!  What are you
                    doing?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (glib)
                    I guess asking him to dance is out
                    of the question.

      MacLeod starts up the stairs.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You don't understand.  You can't
                    win!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Your confidence is overwhelming.

      NEW ANGLE - THE CLIFFSIDE

      As MacLeod faces Roland.

                                      ROLAND

                    Very good.

      Roland smiles.

                    Roland Kantos.  And I've been looking
                    for you for a very long time.

      And OFF his look --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Near the hut, Ian MacLeod paces, frustrated, as his wife
      Mary and Old Tom look on.  They're worried about the missing

                    Something terrible has happened.  I

                                    OLD TOM
                    It's the witch.  She's taken them.

                    Shut up, you old fool.

      There's a shout and a commotion in the distance, as

      ROBERT

      stumbles in, half-carried by two CLANSMEN.  He's breathless,
      clothes torn and muddied as he's brought before Ian.

                                    IAN
                    Robert MacLeod, you'd better have a
                    good story to tell, make no mistake.

      He looks around for Duncan, ready to berate him.

                    Where's my son?  Where's Duncan?

      Robert is panting, can barely get the words out.

                    Still there.  The wolf.... The wolf...

      Ian grabs him by the shoulders.

                    Wolf?!  Out with it, boy, what in

                    And Duncan?

      Robert shakes his head helplessly, near tears.  Ian turns,
      tight with alarm, and yells at the Clansmen.

      As Clansmen move away, Ian turns to Mary, takes her shoulders
      gently.

                    Trust in God.  We'll find him.

      She nods, not trusting herself to speak, as ROLAND arrives
      on horseback, dressed in dark clothes.  He looks foreign,
      menacing.

      Ian waits as he rides up, noting his foreigner's dress, his
      sword.

                    urgent business.  We've no time.

                                      ROLAND
                          (lying)
                    Not even for a lost son?
                          (beat)
                    Years ago robbers killed my wife and
                    stole him.  He was only a baby.  I
                    fear he may have been sold.  Or left
                    as a foundling.

      Ian and Mary exchange a glance, afraid hills talking about
      Duncan.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    He'd be thirteen now.
                          (beat)
                    Like that one.

      He suddenly POINTS directly at Robert.  Robert quails under
      the penetrating gaze, moves towards the hut.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    But that's not him.
                          (beat)
                    I'll know him when I see him.

      BEAT.  Ian catches Mary's eye, then answers in a firm voice.

                                    IAN
                    I cannot help you.  There are no
                      foundlings here.

      Roland looks at him a LONG BEAT, but Ian doesn't flinch. 
      Neil and the other Clansmen approach.

                                      ROLAND
                    Then I'll keep looking.  I swore to
                    it on my wife's grave.

      He starts to turn away.  The guilt gnaws at Mary.

                                    MARY
                    But surely, after thirteen years,
                    you'd not even know him.

      Roland's eyes gleam, ominous.

                                      ROLAND
                    I'll know him and I'll find him.
                          (beat)
                    However long it takes.

      He turns his horse and rides off.  Mary turns to Ian.

                                    IAN
                          (shortly)
                    Leave it alone, wife.

                                    MARY
                          (aside, urgently)
                    I love Duncan as you do, as my own
                    flesh and blood...
                          (beat)
                    But you know he's a foundling!  What
                    if it's Duncan he seeks?

                                    IAN
                    Duncan is our son.  He always will
                    be.
                          (beat)
                    If he still lives.

      He moves to where the other Clansmen wait, and they start
      for the forest.

      ON MARY

      She sighs, fretful, moves to busy herself with chores.  She
      picks up a water-bucket.  She turns to move back to the hut --
      and lets out a gasp.

      ROLAND

      stands before her.  He hadn't made a sound.

                                      ROLAND
                    About the foundling.

                                    MARY
                    I know nothing.

      She avoids his eyes, starts to move past.

                                      ROLAND
                    Tell me.

      He's using a touch of THE VOICE.  Mary is feeling moved by
      her guilt, by the voice -- she fights it.

                                    MARY
                    You've had your answer... there is
                    nothing more to tell!

      She tries to  step around him, but Roland increases the power
      of the voice.  His words are compelling, overwhelming,
      weakening her resolve.  Her hand loosens, the bucket falls
      from it.

                                      ROLAND
                    A boy... found on the winter
                      solstice... a foundling child.

                                    MARY
                    No... no, there WAS none!

      She tries to move to the hut, fighting to resist, but THE
      VOICE is taking over her senses.

                                      ROLAND
                    I don't believe  you.
                          (spreading his arms)
                    Open, your heart to me, woman..! 
                    Tell me what I, want to know...

      MARY can't resist any more.  She is about to speak, when her
      eyes fall upon --

      MARY'S POV - THE HUT

      the CRUCIFIX over the door a touchstone of hope And strength. 
      Mary gathers her strength, and with an effort of will, places
      her hand oh the Crucifix.

                                    MARY
                          (under her breath, a
                            prayer)
                    Help me... Give me strength.

                                      ROLAND
                    Tell me...  You know, you must! 
                    Where is he!

      Mary gathers herself, turns and faces him.

                                    MARY
                    The one you seek... is not... here.

      It's a supreme effort of will.  Roland bridles, but sees
      this is a wall he can't yet penetrate -- the strength of
      this woman's faith.  He turns and leaves.  And OFF Mary,
      closing her eyes in silent thanks --


      Young Duncan moves to Ian and the others.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    Father!  I'm here!

      Ian grabs him by the shoulders, anxiously examining the
      scratches, the torn clothes.

                                    IAN
                    You're all right?  The wolf didn't
                    harm you?

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    I'm fine.

      Ian hugs him thankfully, then resumes his gruff manner.

                                    IAN
                    Of all the wild notions you've had...
                    Are you daft, boy?  The wolf might've
                    torn you apart!

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                          (chastened)
                    Yes, Father.

                                    IAN
                    Out here in the forest all night,
                    Your mother worried half to death!

      Young Duncan glances back to the hut he just left.

      ANGLE THE HUT

      The burnt tree is there, but the hut is gone.

      Young Duncan looks back to his father.

                                    IAN
                    Anything might've happened, anything!

      It's clear no one but Duncan saw the hut.

                                      YOUNG DUNCAN
                    But nothing did happen, Father.
                          (beat, innocent)
                    Nothing.

      Ian glances at him with a hint of suspicion, but Duncan's
      look gives away nothing.  This will stay his secret.

                                    IAN
                    We'd best be getting back.  The wolf
                    can wait for another day.
                          (beat)
                    I don't want you out of my sight for
                    a while.

      As they move away, Young Duncan looks back, over his shoulder,
      to where the hut stood.  And OFF this, as they move from
      sight --


      Roland eyes MacLeod with intense interest.

                                      ROLAND
                    So you lasted.  Just as the prophecy
                    foretold.  You lived.

                    And you can live too... if you leave
                    now.

                                      ROLAND
                    I'm afraid I can't, MacLeod.  The
                    signs for the prophecy are all in
                    place.  You're all that stands in my
                    way.
                          (curious)
                    Or don't you believe in signs?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Some.
                          (beat)
                    Don't litter, no spitting, keep off
                    the grass.

                                      ROLAND
                    I prefer rest in peace.

      He pulls his sword.

      MacLeod draws his, and they go at it.  Roland fights well,
      but MacLeod takes him on confidently, matches him blow for
      blow.  Then Roland steps back, moves away.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Is that all you have, MacLeod?

                                      MACLEOD
                    There's more.

                                      ROLAND
                    I don't think so.  I think you're
                    already finished.

      And he uses the VOICE.

      An evil breeze blows through the area.  The light shimmers.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    I think you re tired, MacLeod. 
                      Exhausted.
                          (beat)
                    Can't you feel it?  You re fighting

      ON MACLEOD

      as he feels the effect.  He tries to shake it off, resume
      his stance.

      MACLEOD S POV

      Roland the Giant.  He dwarfs MacLeod.

                                      ROLAND
                    Every muscle, every inch of your
                    body wants to quit... to surrender.

      MacLeod swings his katana.  His sword now larger, heavier in
      his hand.  He is slow, clumsy, sweating with effort.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Right now, you're probably thinking,
                    How does he do it?

      ECU ROLAND'S LIPS

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Your sword is heavy... so heavy...
                    you can barely lift it... you CAN'T
                    lift it.

      MacLeod tries to lift the katana.

      But Roland steps in and with an easy flick, lances his side. 
      MacLeod staggers back, wounded.

                                      ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    Well, I'm bored.

      Roland moves in for the kill.

      ANGLE - CASSANDRA

      at the bottom of the cliff, she sees it.

      RESUME SCENE

      As Roland moves closer.

                    You don't want to fight anymore,
                    MacLeod.  You can rest.  Just close
                    your eyes... it's so easy.

      The KATANA drops from MacLeod's hand, falls down the cliff. 
      MacLeod watches it go, but it doesn't seem to matter.  He
      stands there, helpless.  His eyes close.

                    NO!

      The sound is deafening.  Roland looks at MacLeod.

      ROLAND'S POV

      The world shimmers violently before him, in and out of focus.

      RESUME SCENE

      as Roland swings --

      MACLEOD'S

      eyes open as he reacts to the echo of Cassandra's scream. 
      He uses his last bit of will to push off the cliff -- Roland's
      sword slices the air, missing him.

      as he curses and moves to the stairs, but --

      RESUME -- CLIFF BOTTOM

      as Cassandra shoves the dying MacLeod into his car, throws
      in his sword.  She hops behind the wheel and screeches away.

      ROLAND

      sinks to his knees, exhausted, depleted by the use of his
      power.

                                      ROLAND
                    Now or later.  It doesn't matter.

      And OFF his grim look --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      THREE COPS sit outside a fast food joint eating.  Roland
      approaches.  One of the cops looks up as Roland stands near

                                    COP ONE
                    Something I can do for you?

                                      ROLAND
                    I'm looking for someone.

                    Missing Persons is downtown.

      The Cop turns away from Roland and back to the other cop.

                    So I said to her, you were doing

                    And she's driving in this bikini top
                    that's like two strings and a band-
                    aid.

      Roland places the picture of MacLeod in front of him.

                                    COP ONE (CONT'D)
                    Would you go away?

      Roland uses The Voice.

                                      ROLAND
                    His name is Duncan MacLeod.  He is
                    armed and dangerous.

      The Cop stares at the picture.

                                    COP ONE
                    Armed and dangerous.

                                      ROLAND
                    He'll be hiding in a church or
                    cemetery.  Somewhere close.  You
                    must find him and bring him to me.

      The Cop nods.  The Voice does its work.


      Cassandra sits, exhausted by the effort of using her power. 
      MacLeod paces before her, pissed at having been manipulated.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't like being controlled.  Not
                    by Roland, by you... by anyone.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What choice did I have?  He would
                    have killed you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan, you felt his power.
                          (beat)
                    The prophecy is at hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This is holy ground.  Power or no
                    power, he can't hurt us here.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    And none of us can avoid our fate.
                          (beat)
                    "An evil one will come to vanquish
                    all before him.  Only a Highland
                    child, born on the winter solstice,
                    who has seen both darkness and light,
                    can stop him.  A child and a man."

      As Cassandra speaks we will hear and see echoes of Old Tom,
      Cassandra, and Roland offering their pieces of the legend.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We make our own destinies.  Nothing
                    is written.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No?  Did you pass through darkness
                    into light?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Everyone does.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Not like you.  You were truly evil,
                    Duncan.  You know the darkest place
                    in men s souls.  You ve been there
                    and survived.
                          (beat)
                    You're the one from the prophecy.  I
                    knew it in that forest... I know it
                    now.
                          (beat)
                    Do you believe me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I believe Roland wants my head.
                          (with urgency)
                    Teach me.  Like you taught him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I can't.  Roland's gift was always
                    there.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then what?!  What can I use?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Use the prophecy.  If you're the
                    man, who's the child?

      He turns back to her, but instead of finding Cassandra, he
      finds himself in --96501       "Prophecy"       39.       Final Shooting Script 6/26/96



      RESUME SCENE

      He's where he was before, Cassandra watching him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did you do that?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I helped.
                          (impatient)
                    What happened?  What did you see?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me as a child.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The child and the man.
                          (beat)
                    The prophecy.

      Before he can answer --

                                    COP ONE
                    You!  Don't move!

      TWO COPS race toward MacLeod, their guns out.

                                    COP ONE (CONT'D)
                    Freeze right there!

      MacLeod raises his hands.

                                    COP ONE (CONT'D)
                    Turn around.

      MacLeod does as asked.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's this about?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    It's Roland.  He knows we're here. 
                    He's using them!

      As Cop one tries to cuff MacLeod, he moves quickly, flips
      the man, slams him on his back.

      A spinkick takes out Cop Two.

      Cassandra pulls him away.

                    Go!  Hurry!

      MacLeod turns and heads down the pathway, toward a door. 
      Cop One staggers up, grabs his gun and lurches after him.


      MacLeod pelts into the alley, aiming for the open end.  He
      almost reaches it --

      A COP CRUISER squeals in, coming straight at him.

      THE DRIVER

      throws it into a sideways skid, and SLAMS into MacLeod, sends
      him flying.  As he tumbles to a stop --

      The DRIVER COP gets out as Cop One and Two arrive.  They
      toss MacLeod in the back seat, jump in the cruiser, and squeal
      out.  As they fade in the distance --

      stands in the alley, watching it go.  And OFF her stricken
      look --
