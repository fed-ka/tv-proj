          JOHNNY and BRUCE hop out of the Jeep, heading into a
          crowded restaurant.  Johnny hesitates.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Busy night.

                                        BRUCE
                        It'll be crowded everywhere. 
                        It's Friday. 



          Johnny exits the restaurant just in time to see Natalie*
          saying goodnight to the Pep Boys as they go their separate*
          ways.  Natalie enters the bookstore and Johnny crosses*
          the street, following her.*



          Johnny dashes out of the store, looking both ways for
          Natalie.  He spots her up the street and gives chase.



          He tracks Natalie up the street.  She's a block ahead,
          window shopping.  As he follows her, he passes (but does*
          not notice) TWO MEN sitting in a car, one smoking, the
          other talking on the phone. *



          Natalie is looking at the window display of a Travel*
          Agency, the maps, posters, and ticket prices for exotic
            destinations beckoning to her. 


          NATALIE - REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW

          Lost in thought, she looks radiant in the glow of the
          travel display.  She notices Johnny approaching in the
          reflection.

                        I'm beginning to think you're
                          following me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What makes you think that?

                        Ohh... the fact that you're

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  I didn't mean to spook
                        you.

                                        NATALIE
                        You didn't.

                                (re:the display)
                        Going somewhere?

                        Nah.  Just day dreaming.  I keep
                        telling myself someday I'm going
                        to just buy a ticket and go.  No
                        plan.  Don't even pack.  Buy
                          whatever I need when I get there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where would you go?

                          Someplace warm.  Italy.  I've
                        always wanted to see the Amalfi
                        coast.  Doesn't matter really.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds great.

                                        NATALIE
                                (can hear the ocean)
                        Hmm...

          She starts walking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mind if I walk with you?

                        That would be nice actually.

                        Listen, I'm sorry about being
                        mysterious before, when you asked
                        me what I do.  It's not something
                        I tell many people.

                        So how does it work?  What, do
                        you read palms, tarot cards or
                        something?

                        Nothing like that.  I'm not really
                          a "psychic", I hate that word.
                                (thinks about how to
                                put this)

                        shoulda killed me.  Instead, it*
                        turned something on inside that*
                          uncharted part of my brain.  Now,*
                        when I touch a person, or an
                        object, I see things.

                        the future, sometimes in the past. 
                        Once in a while it's good.

          She thinks silently for a beat, letting it soak in.

          Johnny hesitates.  How does he put this?

                                        NATALIE
                        Tell me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, it was just a quick flash
                        of you in the future... not far
                        in the future... like... right
                        now in the future.  You were
                          standing right about... here.

          He gently moves her a foot closer to a streetlight.  We
            recognize it from the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...and I was right about here.

          He steps in closer.  She starts to backup, then decides
          to stick it out.

                                        NATALIE
                        Then what happened?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You really want to know?

                        No... yes... I dunno.  Do I want

                        What?  No way.  I knew this was
                        some kind of line.

                        No really.  I know how it sounds. 
                        But it's the truth.  I swear.

                        this before.  When I see something,*
                        it's always for a reason.  That's*

                        In the vision, while we were
                          kissing, it was blinking, like it
                        was about to burn out... but that
                        hasn't happened yet.

                        So when it does, you're going to
                        kiss me.

          Johnny steps closer -- and she lets him, curiosity getting
          the better of her.  Face to face, they both watch the
          streetlight out of the corner of their eyes.  A long beat
          passes.

          EXTREME ON NATALIE

          As the realization that something incredible is happening
          fills her eyes.  She turns from the light, to Johnny,
          their eyes locking.  She kisses him.  It's just a peck.*

                        That's not what I saw.

          She doesn't need anymore convincing.  This time he kisses
          her... and she kisses back.  It's the soulful passionate
          kiss from the vision. 

          THEN SHE SLAPS HIM!

                        Excuse me.


          WIDER VIEW REVEALS

          A MAN approaches Johnny and Natalie, catching them off
          guard.

                                        MAN
                        Sorry to interrupt.  You have the
                        time?

          Johnny checks his watch, wary of this guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Nine thirty.*

                        Thanks.  Now give me the watch.

          The man pulls a gun out of his windbreaker.

          Johnny and Natalie look down at the ground.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.  Okay.  Be cool.  It's all

                        You.  The purse.  Now!

          Johnny and Natalie stay cool, hand everything over.  Johnny
          tries to sneak a glance.

                        Don't look at me.

          Johnny complies, staring at the ground.


          JOHNNY'S POV - THE GROUND

          He notices the Man's shiny black work boots, glinting in
          the headlights of an approaching car.


          WIDER

          As a car pulls up, the Mugger shoves his loot into his
          jacket.  Then without warning, he calmly shoots Natalie
          point blank in the chest.  It's stunningly real, played
          very naturalistic, almost ordinary.  Johnny just has time
          to see her hit the ground before turning back to find the
          gun pointed at his face.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          As the night is obliterated by the muzzle blast.

          As a startled Johnny finds himself back where the night
          started -- right after Johnny has caught the purse.

                        Got it.

          Natalie grabs his hand a split second later, and the two
          of them negotiate the spilled purse back up onto the bar. 

                                        NATALIE
                          Sorry...


          NATALIE

          Helps Johnny drop the contents of her purse on the bar. 
          Usual stuff.  Keys, wallet, phone, and a small photograph.*

                                        NATALIE
                        ... you okay?

          Johnny steadies himself, looking around to get his
            bearings.  He's just woken up from a nightmare to find
          everything is okay.  Except it wasn't a nightmare -- it
          was vision of his future.  He looks into Natalie's eyes,
            horrified to see there's not even an inkling of
            recognition.

          Johnny dashes outside, spots Natalie up the street,
          standing in front of the Travel Agency.  He calls to her...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Natalie!

          But she doesn't hear him.


          MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          As he starts moving fast up the street.  He doesn't get
          very far when something stops him cold.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          Halfway between himself and Natalie, he sees TWO MEN
          sitting in a car, one smoking, the other on the phone. 
          The man riding shotgun snaps his phone shut and gets out
          of the car.  Johnny instantly recognizes his shiny black
          work boots.


          JOHNNY

            Instinctively starts running toward Natalie, but only
          takes a few steps before he gets an idea.*

          reflection at the travel display -- except this time,
          instead of Johnny stepping into her reflection, the Mugger
          does.

                                        MUGGER
                        Excuse me Ma'am, do you have the
                        time?

          She turns to face him.

                                        NATALIE
                                (guarded)
                        No... sorry.

                                        MUGGER
                        That's okay, doesn't matter.

          He pulls out his gun.  Natalie freezes.  Headlights sweep
          across her terrified face as the Mugger's accomplice pulls
          up, screeching to a halt...

          But it's not the accomplice, it's Johnny.  He lays on the
          HORN.

          Caught in the blinding headlights, the Mugger pockets the
          gun and turns to run.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get in!

          Natalie is still frozen, confused, a deer caught in the
          headlights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's me.  Johnny Smith.  Get in
                        the car.

          Natalie is still frozen, when the STREETLIGHT behind her
          goes on the fritz.  It's just enough distraction to snap
          her out of her state of shock.

            Natalie's feet kick in before her brain does and she runs
          to the car, jumping in as Johnny steps on the gas.



          The Mugger's car burns around the corner and keeps going. 
          After a long beat, one of the cars on the lot comes to
          life --- Johnny's Jeep pulls out of the lot and off the
          curb, heading in the opposite direction of their pursuers.



          Johnny's car rolls to a stop in the loading zone in front
          of the hotel.



          Johnny pursues Natalie out into the street.  She's freaking
          out, just like Bruce predicted.  She's on the verge of
          tears, terrified.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Natalie wait.  It's not safe.

          Natalie finally stops and turns back toward Johnny, letting
          him catch up.  Something she sees fills her eyes with
          terror.


            NATALIE'S POV

          Looking past Johnny, where the muggers are exiting the
          restaurant.  Bruce follows a beat later, calculating what*
          kind of move he could make.*


          JOHNNY

          Sees danger in Natalie's eyes and turns in time to see
          the Muggers crossing the street toward him and Natalie. 
          Johnny turns back to Natalie, wrapping himself around
          her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look out!

          The Muggers  make their move, reaching into their jackets,
          when suddenly, headlights sweep across them, freezing
          them in their tracks.  Car tires screech to a halt.  A
          siren WOOPS.  Police Flashers light up every shadow.

                        I'm sure.  I've never seen either

          Natalie looks at Johnny, still not sure just who this guy*

          sipping Martinis


  5151-- THE BOOKSTORE

          everyone gone - Johnny miming the waiter gag.


  5252-- THE LIGHTPOST

          He's kissing her, but just for story purposes, the instant
          the kiss breaks, he mimes the slap, then he's telling her*
          how they got robbed, his hand suddenly a gun.

          laughing as they sit in their spot in the used car lot,
          Johnny pointing out where the muggers drove by.

          sunk shots into.  She is completely blown away by
          everything he's saying.

          with Stemple.

                                        NATALIE
                        You tackled Stemple and crashed
                        through this window?  For me?*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yup.

          Natalie studies Johnny.  Sexual gravity begins drawing
          them together, slowly.

                        I don't think I've ever met anyone
                        like you.

    55CONTINUED: (2)55

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not the first time you've told me*
                        that.*

          Natalie thinks for a beat, wondering about something.*

                                        NATALIE
                        What were we doing up here before
                        Stemple showed up?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was kissing you.

                                        NATALIE
                        What was I doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kissing me back.

                                        NATALIE
                                (takes her time)
                        What was that like?

          But Johnny can't answer, his lips are busy.


  5656THE BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

          They tumble onto the bed together, a jumble of skin and*
            inconvenient clothes.  A few quick cuts and most of the
          clothing is gone.

          Their hands sample unfamiliar territory, their eyes explore
          each other, finding only beauty.  They pause to catch*
          their breath, eyes locking, the calm before the storm. *
          Then he kisses her as their bodies melt into one another.*

                                                                              FADE OUT:
