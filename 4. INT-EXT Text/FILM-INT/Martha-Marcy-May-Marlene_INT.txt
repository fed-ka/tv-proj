A large room with unfinished wood walls has several
blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.
TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.
MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered
face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.
The men sit around a table eating dinner.
One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.
Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is
WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy
beard.
2.
The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
outside.
The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
new serving of food.
The women sit around the table eating very small portions
of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.
CUT TO:
The kitchen is filled with dishes.
TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
crib.
People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
a figure passes quickly through frame.
Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled
cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food
like she hasn't eaten in days.
5.
The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They
are seated. Martha returns to eating.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Marcy May?
It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.
WATTS
What are you doin'?
Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits
across from her.
Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.
WATTS (CONT'D)
We were worried about you.
MARTHA
I'm fine.
WATTS
Patrick's worried about you.
MARTHA
I just wanted to come into town.
WATTS
I could've brought you.
MARTHA
I wanted to walk.
WATTS
Through the woods?
WAITRESS
(TO WATTS)
Can I get you something?
WATTS
No.
WAITRESS
(TO MARTHA)
You done?
MARTHA
Yeah.
6.
The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his
hand out to stop her.
WATTS
(TO MARTHA)
You not gonna eat that?
Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs
it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate.
Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his
hands and mouth while he chews.
WATTS (CONT'D)
You ready to go?
Martha doesn't respond.
WATTS (CONT'D)
Come on!
MARTHA
Not right now.
WATTS
No?
The waitress drops the check on the table.
Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
WATTS (CONT'D)
I'll get this.
He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
eye contact with her.
Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
make a scene in front of all these people.
He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly
cuts through the kitchen.
7.
Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against
the window watching the road behind her in the side view
mirror.
LUCY
It's nice to see you.
MARTHA
You too.
Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised.
LUCY
What's going on?
MARTHA
Not much.
LUCY
You alright?
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
You sure?
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
You were pretty upset on the phone.
MARTHA
Sorry. I over reacted.
8.
LUCY
To what?
Martha thinks.
LUCY (CONT'D)
What happened?
MARTHA
We had a fight.
LUCY
Who?
MARTHA
Me and this guy.
LUCY
Who?
Martha doesn't answer.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Your boyfriend?
Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Did he hurt you?
MARTHA
No!
LUCY
Are you sure?
MARTHA
No. I'm fine.
Lucy is skeptical.
LUCY
Did you guys break up?
Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D)
How long were you together?
MARTHA
A while.
9.
LUCY
How long?
MARTHA
I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or
less.
LUCY
And you were here the whole time?
Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D)
You've been back in New York for over a
year and you haven't called me?
MARTHA
I'm sorry.
Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm.
LUCY
Well, I'm glad you're here now.
Lucy makes the bed. Martha enters the room wrapped in a
towel. Her hair drips on the floor.
LUCY
I made you some tea.
MARTHA
Thanks.
Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair.
LUCY
Ted should be up from the city soon.
He'll cook us some dinner.
MARTHA
I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go
to bed?
LUCY
Of course.
(BEAT)
Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new
tomorrow.
10.
Lucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her
wet towel.
Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE.
The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters.
He speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT. He sets down his bag and
gives her a hug and a kiss.
TED
Well?
LUCY
She seems okay.
TED
What did she say?
LUCY
Not much, she's pretty tired.
TED
Where's she been?
LUCY
She had some boyfriend, they were living
in the Catskills.
TED
What?
LUCY
It's okay.
TED
Not really Lucy.
LUCY
It's fine. She's here now.
Ted keeps his comments to himself.
TED
(HALF JOKING)
Well, how long's she staying?
LUCY
(LAUGHING)
I don't know.
11.
TED
I told you she was fine. You spend all
that time worrying.
Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor
cabinet and pours a scotch.
CUT TO:
The house is completely dark. Martha finds her way
through the hallway and into the kitchen. She drinks
water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst.
The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright
spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is
beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces
herself to slowly turn and look. She puts her head down
and quickly returns to her room.
Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor.
LUCY
Martha? Why are you on the floor?
Martha does not know where she is. A moment passes before
she starts to come to.
MARTHA
I'm sorry.
LUCY
It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come
have some breakfast.
Lucy and Ted eat at the kitchen table. Martha enters.
TED
Martha! Welcome!
MARTHA
Hi.
12.
TED
Great to finally meet you. You sleep
alright?
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
How do you like the house?
TED
It's just a rental.
LUCY
Well I love it.
Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha.
MARTHA
It's nice. I didn't know there was a
lake.
LUCY
Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
MARTHA
You don't live in the city anymore?
LUCY
We do. This is for weekends and holidays.
Ted and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Ted's finishing a new building down town
and when it's done we're taking one of
the new apartments. You want to see
pictures?
Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room.
Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice.
TED
(TO MARTHA)
Do you think she's excited to have you
back?
Lucy re-enters with her digital camera.
LUCY
This is the view, the interiors are
obviously not finished. It's nice right?
(MORE)
13.
LUCY (CONT'D)
We were supposed to move in the spring
but construction halted, so, it'll just
be a little while longer.
TED
(SARCASTIC)
Yep, just a little while longer.
LUCY
Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
Lucy notices that Martha isn't eating.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Aren't you hungry?
MARTHA
Not really, sorry.
TED
Well, you've got to eat.
LUCY
It's okay, I can fix you something later.
Martha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite.
Martha sleeps. Lucy notices the bruising on Martha's ear.
LUCY
Martha!
(BEAT)
I've been trying to wake you. You should
get up or you won't sleep through the
night.
Martha wakes up.
LUCY (CONT'D)
You should eat.
MARTHA
I will. I'm just going to sleep a little
more first okay?
LUCY
Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you
before.
MARTHA
It's okay.
Lucy leaves. Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta
outside then goes back to sleep.
18.
TED
She's not coming?
LUCY
She's in a really deep sleep. I can't
wake her.
TED
She seems a bit off, no?
LUCY
She's just really tired.
(BEAT)
She's had a bad breakup. I want to give
her a couple days to get situated, you
know?
TED
Has she always been like this?
LUCY
A pain in my ass, yes.
They laugh.
Martha sits up in bed wide awake. She turns and stares
out her window into the dark trees that surround the lake
house.
CUT TO:
People are scattered around a large room sleeping. Watts
enters and bangs two pots together to wake everyone.
Martha other girls get dressed in the communal closet.
Martha does dishes, Katie clears the table.
KATIE
We switch off jobs each day so we all
know how to do different things.
(BEAT)
Do you knit?
20.
MARTHA
No. I can learn though.
KATIE
It's okay, you'll find your role. It
takes time for people to find their role
in a new family.
Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around.
KATIE (CONT'D)
We sell blankets in town. We still need
some money, but when the farm's up and
running we'll be self sufficient and
we'll never have to worry about it again.
MARTHA
When do you think that'll happen?
KATIE
Hopefully by the end of the summer but
we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and
live stock without cash.
MARTHA
That'll be nice.
Katie accidentally drops a plate.
KATIE
Shoot.
Martha gets down and starts to clean it up.
Lucy is putting away groceries. Martha enters.
LUCY
Good morning. How are you feeling today?
MARTHA
Good.
LUCY
There's this great juice shop in town, I
got us a couple of juices.
(MORE)
22.
LUCY (CONT'D)
This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives
me energy, so I thought it might help
you.
Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it.
LUCY (CONT'D)
I got pineapple orange too if that's
better.
MARTHA
Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
LUCY
I also got a box of these protein bars
just in case you want to snack.
Martha watches Lucy put the groceries away.
MARTHA
Why is the house so big?
LUCY
It's not that big.
MARTHA
For two people, it's huge.
LUCY
We like to entertain. Our friends
come up for weekends and sometimes
we have parties. It's just good to
have space.
MARTHA
So no one else lives here?
LUCY
Of course no one else lives here.
Martha sits on the bed watching Lucy go through her
closet looking at old clothes. Lucy holds up a summer
dress.
LUCY
Put this on.
MARTHA
You're kidding.
LUCY
Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just
try it.
MARTHA
Why does it matter?
LUCY
It just feels good to put on something
nice and comfortable.
Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose.
LUCY (CONT'D)
It looks good you little shit.
MARTHA
Whatever makes you happy mama bear.
LUCY
You're making fun of me and I think it
looks really good.
They both laugh.
26.
Ted and Lucy get ready for bed.
TED
She seems better today.
LUCY
Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go
tomorrow.
TED
Let me take you.
LUCY
No, I don't want to leave her alone.
(BEAT)
You'll be nice to her right?
TED
I'm always nice.
27.
LUCY
Right.
They laugh and kiss.
Martha lies awake in bed staring at the ceiling. She is
lost deep in thought.
CUT TO:
MARTHA SLOWLY WAKES UP. SHE IS LYING ON HER STOMACH ON
COLD CEMENT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CANDLES ON THE FLOOR.
SHE IS DISORIENTED AND FEELS SOMEONE ON TOP OF HER. SHE
TURNS BACK TO LOOK BUT IT'S HARD TO MOVE. SHE CATCHES A
GLIMPSE OF PATRICK, LEANING OVER HER DRIPPING SWEAT.
PATRICK IS AGGRESSIVELY HAVING SEX WITH HER FROM BEHIND.
Martha seems like she has been drugged, she has a white
robe draped around her. Katie consoles her and makes her
drink water.
KATIE
I know you feel like something bad just
happened Marcy May, but you have to trust
me, that was not bad, it was truly good.
We've all been in this situation, and we
wouldn't all still be here if what
happened in that room was bad. We all
love each other very much, we are all
together on this, you have to trust us.
(BEAT)
Do you believe me?
Martha nods.
Zoe and Martha share a single mattress on the floor in a
small dark room. Martha is still wrapped in the robe, she
is still dazed.
28.
ZOE
You're so lucky, I'd give anything to
have my first time again.
MARTHA
Really?
ZOE
Yeah, it's so special.
MARTHA
I can't remember anything, I just woke up
on the floor and felt this pain -
ZOE
That's the cleansing. It's good. It means
it's working if you can't remember
things. You're cleansing yourself of the
past and the toxins.
Martha is distant.
ZOE (CONT'D)
You need to share yourself, don't be so
selfish.
MARTHA
I'm not.
ZOE
So smile then, enjoy this amazing night.
It only happens once.
Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They
curl up together in a very intimate way.
Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is
caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on
the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.
Ted walks into the kitchen.
Martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen
floor.
Ted gets a six pack out of the fridge. He cracks a beer
and drinks it.
TED
What are you doing?
MARTHA
Cleaning.
(BEAT)
I thought I'd help out more.
TED
Alright. I'm going to take the boat out,
do you want to come?
30.
MARTHA
Is Lucy coming?
TED
She had to run to the city.
MARTHA
Oh.
TED
I'll teach you how to drive the boat,
come on.
MARTHA
It's okay.
TED
Come on.
The hallway is dark, the space is unclear. Martha walks
down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. She
walks into Patrick's room. She get's into bed with him
and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. She looks safe
and happy. He welcomes her, the room looks warm and
comforting.
CUT TO:
34.
Martha sleeps. THUMP. Something hits the roof. Martha
wakes up. THUMP, ROLL. Martha sits up and listens. She
waits in anticipation. THUMP.
Martha walks down the dark hallway and slowly opens the
door to Ted and Lucy's room.
Ted and Lucy are having sex. Martha watches for a moment,
then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the
edge of the bed.
Lucy does not see Martha. Ted does not say anything, he
continues to have sex with Lucy. His motion becomes
harder, Lucy opens her eyes and Ted jumps up.
LUCY
(STARTLED)
What? What?
Ted gestures to Martha.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Martha, what are you doing?
MARTHA
Nothing!
Ted turns on the light. He sits on the edge of the bed.
LUCY
Jesus, you can't just come in like that.
MARTHA
Sorry.
Martha gets up to leave.
LUCY
God damn it, what's wrong?
Martha stops and stands facing the door.
MARTHA
It's been hard to sleep alone.
TED
All you do is sleep.
35.
Martha goes to leave again.
LUCY
(TO MARTHA)
Stay, just stay.
Martha comes back and sits on the bed.
LUCY (CONT'D)
(UPSET)
Why would you think it was okay to come
in like that?
MARTHA
I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys
were on the other side.
LUCY
You can't come into our room when we're
having sex, that's not normal! It's
private.
MARTHA
Sorry.
LUCY
Don't apologize, I just want you to
understand why it's not okay.
MARTHA
Okay.
LUCY
Do you?
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
Well?
MARTHA
Because it's privte and it's not normal.
Lucy can see something is really wrong.
LUCY
Just lie down Martha.
Martha lies in Lucy's lap. Lucy is uncomfortable with the
contact, she pushes Martha's head onto a pillow.
36.
TED
This is just brilliant.
Ted stands up and puts on his sweatpants and walks out.
Martha closes her eyes.
CUT TO:
Martha wakes up in Patrick's room, he is gently having
sex with her. She doesn't enjoy it but she doesn't stop
him.
Ted is half asleep on the couch. Lucy sits to wake him.
Martha is lying in their bed listening to them through
the cracked doorway.
LUCY
I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for
being patient.
TED
I don't have much choice do I?
LUCY
I just want to make sure she's okay.
TED
I get two weeks a year to come out here
and try to relax before I have to go back
to work!
LUCY
I know.
TED
I am under so much pressure right now-
LUCY
I know you are.
TED
I have a month to get this building up
and running or the bank takes it.
LUCY
That has nothing to do with Martha.
37.
TED
My point is, I don't need the extra
stress.
LUCY
I'm her only family. She needs to be able
to depend on me right now.
(BEAT)
It's complicated Ted.
TED
As complicated as it might be, we can't
just keep ignoring the fact that her
behavior is fucking insane.
Martha pretends to go back to sleep.
Martha sits in the passenger seat, Lucy drives.
Martha notices a BROWN CAR is parked at the top of the
driveway on the side of the road. Martha is troubled by
the parked car's presence.
MARTHA
Whose car was that?
40.
LUCY
I don't know. Why?
MARTHA
Just curious.
LUCY
There's a hiking trail, people leave
their cars there all the time.
Lucy looks through produce. Martha takes the cart and
runs down the isle with it. She picks her feet off the
ground so she is riding on the cart. Lucy is amused.
Martha turns around and goes faster, flying all the way
down the isle. A good looking YOUNG MAN walks into the
isle. Martha almost hits him with the cart but she slams
her feet on the floor and just misses him. Lucy runs up
and takes the shopping cart back. Martha doesn't say
anything, she just stares at him.
LUCY
Sorry.
YOUNG MAN
It's okay.
The young man walks down the isle. Martha watches him go.
LUCY
You're going to hurt someone.
Martha is distracted.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Can you go get me a large jug of water.
MARTHA
What's wrong with the tap?
LUCY
I like bottled.
MARTHA
It's a waste.
LUCY
Will you get it or not?
41.
Martha walks through the refrigerated section looking for
water. She notices the Young Man walking behind her. She
stops to get water.
He stops to buy beer. He looks at her. She grabs the
water and walks away.
Martha and Lucy get into the car in the grocery store
parking lot. Martha watches the rear view mirror.
MARTHA
Did you know that guy?
LUCY
What guy?
MARTHA
The guy in the store.
LUCY
The one you almost ran into? No.
MARTHA
He was looking at me like he knew me.
(BEAT)
Did you say something to him?
LUCY
Like what?
MARTHA
I don't know, you tell me.
LUCY
What are you talking about?
MARTHA
(FRUSTRATED)
He was staring at me like he knew me, did
you talk to him about me?
LUCY
(EMPHATICALLY)
No. Jesus. The guy was checking you out
Martha! Relax.
(Lucy starts the car.)
(MORE)
42.
LUCY (CONT'D)
If you don't want guys to drool all over
you, then wear more clothes-
MARTHA
Just drive the car Lucy.
LUCY
What?
MARTHA
Drive the car!
Lucy is unpacking groceries. Ted enters. Lucy puts
something in a cupboard. Ted takes it out and puts it in
a different cupboard.
LUCY
I don't think we should have the party.
TED
It's labor day, we always have it.
LUCY
Things are just too stressful right now.
TED
I've already invited clients.
LUCY
I'm sure people would understand-
TED
They wouldn't.
LUCY
I just think it would be best.
TED
For who, Martha?
LUCY
For all of us.
TED
It's not an option! We're having the
party.
LUCY
And that's the end of it, because you say
so.
43.
TED
Yes!
Martha shows Sarah a large walk in closet. Martha puts
Sarah's clothes on a shelf with all the other clothes.
MARTHA
We share all of this, if it fits, you can
wear it.
SARAH
Cool.
They walk into a small bedroom.
MARTHA
This is where we sleep. You can take any
bed that's open or you can sleep
downstairs.
They walk downstairs. And see another large bedroom.
SARAH
I'm hungry, can we eat?
MARTHA
We don't eat until the evening.
SARAH
Really?
At the bottom of the stairs, several make shift beds are
laid out on the floor.
MARTHA
You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't
need that much food. You're taught to
overconsume.
There is a baby asleep in the crib.
SARAH
He's beautiful. Whose the mother?
MARTHA
Katie's, but we all help out.
SARAH
Is Patrick the father?
44.
MARTHA
Uh huh.
SARAH
They look just like him.
(BEAT)
All the kids here are boys?
Martha picks one up, she is very natural with him.
MARTHA
He only has boys.
SARAH
You're good with them.
MARTHA
You want to hold him?
SARAH
No Thanks.
(BEAT)
I don't have to take care of them do I?
MARTHA
Not if you don't want to. There are
plenty of jobs to be done.
(BEAT)
You'll find your role. It takes time for
people to find their role in a new
family.
Katie teaches Martha how to make a vegetable drink.
Martha adds some herbs.
KATIE
That's enough.
Katie hands her a large chalky white pill.
KATIE (CONT'D)
Half is fine.
Martha breaks the tablet in half and drops it into the
drink. She crushes it with a spoon.
Martha is back at the Lake house. Lucy enters and begins
to load the dishwasher. Martha holds the glass with the
green drink which we now see is just water.
LUCY
I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
MARTHA
I don't mind.
LUCY
Get some sleep.
MARTHA
Okay.
Martha leaves. Holding the glass tightly, Martha walks to
her bedroom.
IN ONE LONG TAKE, WHILE WALKING FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE
BEDROOM, THE GLASS OF WATER HAS CHANGED BACK TO THE GREEN
DRINK MARTHA PREPARED WITH KATIE.
Martha enters her bedroom holding the green drink.
Sarah sits in a chair wearing a WHITE ROBE. The room is
no longer Martha's bedroom at the lake, it is a small
dark room at the farm.
47.
MARTHA
Oh, hi.
SARAH
Hi.
Sarah is nervous. Martha brushes Sarah's hair.
SARAH (CONT'D)
What do I have to do?
MARTHA
Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it
will help you relax.
Sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink. She gags.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
It's herbal. It's the start of your
cleansing.
Martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
We've all done it so you know there's
nothing to worry about.
SARAH
Do I have to wear this robe?
MARTHA
(WHISPERING)
I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a
part of it.
Sarah looks very uncomfortable. She is getting light
headed from the drink.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
You look amazing. It's your special night
with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.
SARAH
Thanks.
Martha helps Sarah up and passes her through a door to
the next room. She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on
the ground. Martha shuts the door locking her in.
Martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball.
48.
Martha wakes up wearing Lucy's dress. She has wet
herself.
Martha takes off the dress and stuffs it between the
mattress and the box spring.
Ted, Lucy and Martha eat at the dinner table.
TED
So what are your plans Martha?
MARTHA
For what?
TED
Life.
MARTHA
I don't know.
TED
Are you thinking about what you can do
for work?
51.
MARTHA
No.
TED
You're at an age where you need to start
thinking about a career.
MARTHA
Why?
TED
It's a part of adult life.
MARTHA
There are other ways to live.
TED
Really?
MARTHA
Sure.
TED
Like what?
MARTHA
I don't know. People don't need careers,
people should just exist.
Ted laughs.
LUCY
He's just saying we should start talking
about what you're interested in. Maybe we
can help you get some ideas together.
TED
I have moments when I would love to move
to France and just exist but it doesn't
work that way.
MARTHA
You can do that if you want to.
TED
It's not that simple.
MARTHA
(CAUTIOUSLY)
It's not your fault but you learned that
success is measured by money and
possessions. It's just not the right way
to live.
52.
Lucy is floored by Martha's response.
TED
And what do you think the right way to
live is? Being a hysterical mess and
causing your family pain. You're eating
my food and sleeping under my roof so
watch your mouth. You're rude.
Martha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands
up to Ted.
MARTHA
You don't know anything about it.
Ted and Lucy are speechless. Martha leaves.
Martha sneaks downstairs in the middle of the night. Ted
and Lucy are asleep in their room. Martha picks up the
phone and dials a number. A WOMAN picks up.
WOMAN
Hello...Hello.
MARTHA
Who's this?
WOMAN
Who's this?
(BEAT)
Zoe?
MARTHA
She not there?
WOMAN
She's not.
MARTHA
Where is she?
WOMAN
Who is this?
MARTHA
Who is this?
WOMAN
It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this.
53.
Martha hangs up. The phone rings. She unplugs the phone
and collapses on the floor.
CUT TO:
Martha looks for Max. She finds him in the hay loft.
MARTHA
You okay?
MAX
I'm fine.
(BEAT)
I'll probably leave this place soon
anyways.
MARTHA
Where are you going to go?
MAX
I got places. My cousin lives in
Bennington, he said I could go up there
and make like, $500 a week selling weed.
MARTHA
You don't want to do that.
MAX
I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all
these rules.
MARTHA
Max, they're not rules. It's just common
sense.
MAX
It feels like rules. They won't let me do
anything. I can't even go on the house
runs. I'd be great at taking shit.
MARTHA
It's not about taking shit.
MAX
Sounds like it's about taking shit to me.
57.
MARTHA
And that's why you don't get to come.
You just don't get it.
(BEAT)
You need to quit drinking.
MAX
I'm not drinking.
Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale.
MARTHA
You're still living with all the shit you
carried out there. You're the only one,
let it go.
MAX
I'll try.
MARTHA
No. You can't try. You have to stop. They
love you, they just want you to be
stronger.
MAX
I'm strong, they'll see.
Max leans up and tries to kiss her. Martha stops him. She
hugs him instead.
MARTHA
You'll be okay.
Martha and Watts walk through the house. They sneak past
a living room where a woman watches television.
There are two place settings at the dinning room table
and two candles burning in vintage, steel candle holders.
Watts blows out the candles, pours wax on the table and
lays the candles down. He steals the candle holders.
There is a large painting on the wall. He motions for
Martha to help him. They get on either side and dismount
the painting, then lay it face up on the floor.
They hear the man come inside and talk to his wife.
They continue to creep through the house, into the
kitchen and out the back door.
Martha, Watts, Zoe, Max and a few others have sex with
each in the same room.
Patrick walks down stairs and sits quietly in the corner
watching them.
CUT TO:
Martha lies awake in her room. She hears a car outside.
She creeps to her window and peeks out. She can't see
what kind of car it is. It leaves the lights and engine
on for a moment, then it shuts off. No one gets out. She
is frozen with fear. She builds up courage then leaves
her room.
59.
Martha walks through the dark lake house, looking out the
windows trying to see if anyone is coming, almost as if
she is standing guard. She is trembling with fear.
A dark figure crosses from one room to another behind
her. She freezes, turns and holds her breath.
The man walks out of the room. Martha screams. It's Ted.
TED
Jesus Christ you scared me.
MARTHA
Sorry.
They take a moment to calm down.
TED
Did I wake you?
MARTHA
No. I can't sleep.
TED
Me neither. I was going to watch a movie.
(BEAT)
You want to watch?
Martha thinks about it.
MARTHA
I should try to sleep.
TED
It always helps me. It's better than
lying in bed awake.
He takes a couple of beers out of the fridge.
Ted sits on one end of the couch, Martha on the other
end. He wears his robe and drinks a beer. He glances over
at Martha who is lost in the movie, laughing.
TED
I'm sorry about before, Martha.
60.
MARTHA
It's alright. It's your house.
Martha lies down. He offers her a pillow. She raises her
head and he puts it under.
Lucy walks into the living room to find Martha curled up
on the couch next to Ted. The TV is on and there are
three empty beer bottle on the table.
Lucy is furious. She picks up the bottles and walks into
the kitchen, being sure to make as much noise as she can.
Ted and Martha wake up. Martha sits up on the couch and
watches Ted walk into the kitchen.
Lucy puts on the kettle. Ted comes into the kitchen and
opens the fridge.
TED
You want me to make some breakfast?
Lucy walks away.
TED (CONT'D)
Hey!
Ted follows her into their room.
Ted and Lucy enter.
TED
What's wrong?
LUCY
You can not be serious right now.
TED
What?
Beat.
TED (CONT'D)
Lucy!
61.
LUCY
One minute you're going after Martha at
the dinner table, then you're curling up
together on the couch?
TED
No one was curling up with anybody.
LUCY
You really do think I'm stupid don't you?
TED
Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a
movie, she came out and sat down and
started watching with me. What am I
supposed to do, tell her to leave?
Beat.
TED (CONT'D)
You're being ridiculous.
LUCY
You can lose your temper at will but when
I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or
ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad
for a reason.
Lucy gets undressed and gets in the shower.
TED
Are you accusing me of something? Because
if you are, I'd like you to say it out
loud so you can hear how absurd it
sounds.
LUCY
Fuck you. I just want you to think about
how walking in on that might make me
feel.
TED
You ask me to make more of an effort. I
try to do that and you get upset. I can't
win.
LUCY
You're unbelievable.
Martha looks out the window at the brown car with the
smashed window. It is raining.
Martha lies in bed. Something thumps on the roof. Martha
flinches. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. She flintches with each
thump.
CUT TO:
Martha helps Lucy clean the house.
MARTHA
You shouldn't smoke.
LUCY
What? I don't smoke.
63.
MARTHA
Especially if you're trying to have a
kid.
LUCY
Maybe you should mind your own business.
The phone rings. It startles Martha.
LUCY (CONT'D)
I can't deal with talking to anyone right
now.
Martha is frozen, watching the phone ring.
Lucy fixes Martha's hair and puts make up on her. Martha
sits passively like a doll.
LUCY
What are you talking about?
MARTHA
They're here.
Martha is frantic, she begins to hyperventilate.
Lucy tries to hug her, Martha squirms free. Lucy hugs her
again and pulls her onto the bed, trying to get her to
calm.
LUCY
Breath.
MARTHA
Don't touch me, you're not listening to
me!
66.
LUCY
Martha please try to breath. I don't know
what you're talking about.
Ted walks into the bathroom and gets pills. He forces
them down and makes Martha drink water.
She calms down. She falls back onto the bed.
Ted and Lucy look exhausted.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Martha walks through a large house in the dark. She gets
to the front door and opens it letting in Katie, Zoe,
Watts and Patrick. They immediately scatter around the
house, looking in cupboards. Suddenly the lights turn on.
MAN
What the fuck.
WATTS
Hey, we can go.
The man is confused.
MAN
What do you want?
WATTS
Nothing.
The man goes to pick up the phone to call the police.
Watts stops, turns and get's in his face.
WATTS (CONT'D)
No need for that, we are leaving.
Watts, Zoe and Martha walk to the front door.
Patrick appears behind the man.
PATRICK
Calm down, if you calm down no one will
get hurt.
MAN
What do you want?
67.
PATRICK
We're not stealing, we don't want
anything.
MAN
Just get out.
PATRICK
We're just looking at the house. It's
nice.
(BEAT)
We didn't realize you were home. We
wouldn't have come in otherwise.
MAN
Just Leave.
PATRICK
I would but I can't be sure you won't
call the police.
MAN
I won't. You didn't take anything so just
go, I just want my family to be safe.
PATRICK
Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless
you call the police, everything will be
fine.
MAN
Okay, I won't. You have my word, please
just go.
Martha walk outside. Patrick just stands there, he won't
leave. Katie and Zoe walk out of the other room and are
standing behind the Man. They don't move. He feels
surrounded.
MAN (CONT'D)
Get the fuck out of my house.
Martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door. No
one knows what to do. The girls are looking to Patrick
but he's not doing anything. Suddenly Katie lunges at the
man and stabs him in the neck. Blood spurts out and she
stabs him again in the ribs.
They all run out.
68.
Martha is in a small wood paneled room lying on a
mattress. She is stunned.
She looks through the open door to see Katie and Watts
washing in the bathroom.
Patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with
Martha. Martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep.
PATRICK
Look at me.
Patrick runs his hands through her hair.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
You okay?
MARTHA
Uh huh.
There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay.
PATRICK
You know that death is the most beautiful
part of life, right? Death is beautiful
because everyone fears death. And fear is
the greatest human emotion of all because
it creates complete awareness. When
you're scared it forces you to be
completely aware of your surroundings and
the moment you're in. It brings you to
NOW and that makes you truly present. And
when you are truly present, that's
nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is
pure love.
CUT TO:
Martha wakes up. Lucy is sitting on the bed. She has
brought Tea. Martha sits up and takes a sip.
LUCY
It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.
She smiles, lies down and curls up again. She is half
asleep.
69.
MARTHA
Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
LUCY
Everything was fine.
MARTHA
Is it over?
LUCY
Yes, you slept through the night.
MARTHA
That's good.
LUCY
Are you going to drink the tea?
MARTHA
I don't want it.
Lucy gets up and leaves.
CUT TO:
MARTHA
How long do you think we'll be down here?
ZOE
It'll just be a few days. Just to be
safe.
Everyone is sleeping. Max is curled up in the corner.
Martha walks over to him and wakes him. There is vomit in
the corner.
MARTHA
Do you feel alright? If you hit your head
you shouldn't sleep.
MAX
I'm fine.
MARTHA
Do you know why we're down here?
MAX
No. Do you?
She shakes her head.
MARTHA
What do you think it was?
MAX
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
71.
MARTHA
Do you still think about leaving?
MAX
No. It's cool now, I don't really have
anywhere to go. Why, would you?
MARTHA
No. I just wanted to see about you.
FADE IN:
Martha is cleaning the house. The phone rings, she picks
it up. A young girl's voice is on the other end.
MARTHA
Hello?
VOICE
Hi, is Watts there?
MARTHA
Who's this?
There is something written on the wall Martha reads.
Martha signals to a girl in the kitchen to go outside.
VOICE
Jane. Is Watts there?
MARTHA
Can I help you?
VOICE
Who's this?
72.
MARTHA
It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name
Jane.
VOICE
Heller, sorry, do I have the right
number?
Martha writes JANE HELLER on a list of names on the wall.
Some of them have been scratched out.
MARTHA
I don't know, do you?
Watts comes inside.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
It's a Jane.
WATTS
Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do
it, I'll be around there on Friday. No,
that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll
see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad
you called.
Watts hangs up. He and Martha have a quiet exchange and
Watts walks away.
WATTS (CONT'D)
Hey.
Martha just stands there quietly.
Martha cooks with Katie.
Martha sneaks a bite of bread. Katie whacks her in the
ear with a wooden spoon. A slight ringing remains
throughout the scene.
KATIE
Nothing till they're done. You know
better.
MARTHA
I know. Sorry Katie.
LUCY (O.S.)
Who's Katie?
73.
Martha turns her head to see Lucy instead of Katie.
Martha is at the lake house cooking with Lucy.
MARTHA
What?
LUCY
Who's Katie?
MARTHA
Oh, nothing.
Beat.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
Lucy?
LUCY
Yeah.
MARTHA
Is this from the past or is this now?
LUCY
What?
MARTHA
I don't remember waking up this morning.
LUCY
Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish
up.
Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes
the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the
couch in front of the television.
Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the
couch.
He reaches out and holds her hand.
TED
What's going on?
LUCY
Who the fuck knows.
TED
She needs to see someone.
74.
LUCY
I know.
TED
I'll start looking into places tomorrow.
We can arrange for her to be somewhere by
Wednesday.
LUCY
Places?
TED
I don't think she should stay with us
anymore. We can't do anything for her
when she's like this.
Lucy goes back to chopping.
LUCY
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
CUT TO:
Martha and Zoe sit in bed.
MARTHA
Zoe?
ZOE
Yeah.
MARTHA
I can't stop feeling terrible for that
poor man.
ZOE
I know. It happens though, we're never
really dead or alive, we just exist, so
he's still existing, but it's in a
parallel time. Just don't think about it,
it's in the past.
Martha is upset with how cold Zoe is.
Martha sits in the bathroom, knees pulled up to her chest
as she rests on the edge of the bathtub.
75.
Someone knocks at the door. She pretends not to be in
there. There is another gentle know.
ZOE
Martha, it's me, can I come in?
Martha unlocks the door for Zoe. Patrick bursts in, slams
the door and corners Martha and yells at her.
PATRICK
Haven't you learned anything?
MARTHA
I have.
PATRICK
I felt like we had a connection.
MARTHA
(DESPERATE)
We do!
PATRICK
That's not what you're showing me.
Patrick calms down. He sits.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Maybe I asked too much from you too soon.
You have potential but you're just not
there yet. I'll expect less of you fro
now on.
Martha is upset, like a trained animal, she runs back to
his side, sits next to him and rests her head on his
shoulder.
MARTHA
I'm sorry.
He runs his hand through her hair.
PATRICK
Shhh. It's okay.
He puts his hand on the inside of her thigh.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
You're my favorite, I won't lose you.
CUT TO:
76.
Martha wakes up on the couch confused, she sees a man
standing over her. She quickly pushes him up, jumps over
tyhe back of the couch and runs away.
The man is Ted. He follows her, trying to calm her down
but she is in a blind state of panic.
She runs to the stairs. He follows her. She trips. He
goes to see if she is okay. She kicks him. He falls down
the stairs.
The lights turn on. Lucy comes out of the bedroom to see
Ted at the bottom of the stairs. She rushes over to him.
Ted gets up slowly.
LUCY
Are you alright?
Ted pushes Lucy off of him.
LUCY (CONT'D)
What the fuck happened?
TED
She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus
Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.
Martha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is
irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha.
LUCY
You could have killed him.
Martha backs away.
MARTHA
I was confused.
LUCY
About what, what are you so confused
about?
MARTHA
I thought he was someone else.
Lucy's anger is building.
77.
LUCY
You thought he was someone else? What is
wrong with you?
(BEAT)
I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing
this anymore. I beat myself up over you
for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of
chasing you down and worrying about you.
I need to move on.
MARTHA
I'm sorry.
LUCY
You need help Martha.
MARTHA
I know.
LUCY
What happened to you?
Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her
eyes.
LUCY (CONT'D)
What happened to you?
MARTHA
(SCREAMING)
I don't know.
Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is
too far gone.
LUCY
We're going to get you proper help.
There is a long moment of silence.
MARTHA
Are you going to send me away?
LUCY
I don't know how to help you anymore.
MARTHA
(PLEADING)
Please don't. Please don't.
LUCY
I can't help you.
78.
MARTHA
Please, I can't be alone, please.
LUCY
We're trying to start a family and I
don't trust you to be here.
Lucy walks away.
MARTHA
Lucy?
LUCY
What?
Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs.
LUCY (CONT'D)
What?
MARTHA
You're going to be a terrible mother.
Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into
tears. There is a long, tense silence. Lucy dries her
eyes.
LUCY
Do you have any money left?
Martha shakes her head.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Of course you don't.
(BEAT)
We'll make sure everything is taken care
of.
Lucy walks away, Martha is frozen on the stairs.
Martha walks through the house. All of the luggage is
packed and sitting by the front door.
Ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a
beer.
79.
Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted
drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway
and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha
gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the
breaks.
TED
Jesus Christ.
LUCY
Are you okay?
TED
Yeah.
LUCY
Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit
him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into
the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car
drives behind Ted's car.
Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back
again to see that he is still there.
81.
She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying
something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in
silence.
