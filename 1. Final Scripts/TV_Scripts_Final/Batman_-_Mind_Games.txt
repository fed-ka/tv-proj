                                      BATMAN
                                        
                                     "Mind Games"

                                        ACT ONE

            FADE IN:

            EXT. GOTHAM CITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

            AERIAL PAN over the Dark Deco city. It's immediately obvious
            that crime is rampant, even in this crime-ridden city. From on
            high we see buildings burning, looting, hold-ups ... if this
            isn't a full-scale riot, it's damned close. SFX: POLICE SIRENS,
            DISTANT EXPLOSIONS, GUNFIRE. CONTINUE PAN to find the city's
            richest area: Gotham Heights. Here PAN STOPS on a mansion that
            could rival Wayne Manor in splendor. PUSH IN on the imposing
            edifice.

            ANOTHER ANGLE - MANSION - NIGHT

            In front of the mansion, an N.D. DOORMAN/BUTLER in white gloves
            and tails holds open the door of a stretch limo as a middle-aged
            SOCIETY COUPLE exits the car and ENTERS the mansion.  The front
            door is held open by an N.D. BUTLER. As we FOLLOW the couple to
            the door we hear PARTY WALLA and appropriate SFX: (the CLINKING
            of glasses, the POP of a champagne cork, etc.) DIAL UP PARTY
            WALLA.

                                GUESTS
                          (party walla)

            INT. THE MANSION BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

            We FOLLOW the couple inside as yet another N.D. SERVANT takes
            their hats and coats, then we PAN PAST them to take in the rest
            of the room.  Every upper-crust face in Gotham City is here,
            chatting, laughing, snatching canapes and drinks from passing
            trays.

                                GUESTS
                          (laughter, party walla)

            PAN CONTINUES until it STOPS on a tall, broad-shouldered figure
            in a tuxedo, his back to us, talking casually to socialite
            VERONICA VREELAND (from episodes #406-547, "Birds of a Feather",
            and #406-565, "The Worry Men").  They stand near some French
            doors opening onto a balcony.

                                VERONICA
                      It's just been awful.  What with all
                      this crime in the streets, I haven't
                      been able to shop at my favorite
                      boutique in weeks.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            The figure turns TOWARDS CAMERA and places his empty glass on a

                                                                                                  Page 1 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            tray carried by a passing WAITER.  It's BRUCE WAYNE.

                                BRUCE
                          (dryly)
                      It's stories like yours that really
                      bring home how serious this situation
                      is, Ronnie.

            ON BRUCE AND VERONICA

            She gives him a look, not sure if he's serious or not.

                                VERONICA
                      Oh, Bruce.  I can never tell when
                      you're kidding.

                                BRUCE
                      That's me -- a man of mystery.

            ON VERONICA

            Her face is reflected in the French doors as she looks up, as if
            searching the night sky for the Bat-signal, which is not there.

                                VERONICA
                      Seriously, though -- it seems like
                      everyone I know has been robbed
                      lately.
                          (beat)
                      Where's Batman?  That's what I'd like
                      to know.  He hasn't been seen in
                      weeks.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            Face grim, eyes narrowing.

                                BRUCE
                      I'm sure he's just waiting for the
                      right moment to strike.

            WIDE ANGLE

            On this line the French doors suddenly BURST OPEN, revealing THE
            PENGUIN, along with two or three HIRED GOONS.  The Penguin
            gestures dramatically with his umbrella.  In his other hand he
            holds a large leather carrying bag.  The goons have their Dark
            Deco guns at the ready, though they're not aiming them at
            anyone.

                                PENGUIN
                          (loudly)
                      Ladies and gentlemen, your attention
                      if you please!

            ANOTHER ANGLE - PANNING

            Showing the shocked faces of the crowd.

                                GUESTS
                          (shocked walla)

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      Oh, no! / The Penguin! / I knew
                      something like this would happen! / 
                      What'll we do? (Etc.)

            FAVOR PENGUIN

            Bruce and Veronica, both looking quite distressed, are in b.g.

                                PENGUIN
                      Due to the seriousness of the recent
                      crime wave, it would behoove you all
                      to put your valuables somewhere safe.

            CLOSER ON HIM

            He smiles wickedly and holds the bag up, opening it.

                                PENGUIN (CONT'D)
                      Allow me.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            He waddles along in front of the shocked and frightened guests
            as they drop wallets, purses, necklaces, watches and so forth
            into the bag.

            ANGLE INCLUDES VERONICA

            The Penguin turns toward her.  His face lights up as he
            recognizes Veronica.

                                PENGUIN
                      Ronnie!  How splendid to see you again
                      -- especially under these
                      circumstances.

                                VERONICA
                          (frightened)
                      Oswald ... you're looking
                          (swallows)
                      ... robust ....

            She glances over at where Bruce was standing, then does a take
            as she realizes he's gone.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. MANSION GROUNDS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

            Bruce, glancing back at the mansion to make certain he hasn't
            been spotted, runs towards the nearby hedges, pulling off his
            tie as he goes, giving the impression he's about to become
            Batman.

            ON HEDGES

            Bruce BURSTS OUT through the other side, running toward the
            road, pulling his jacket off.  He stops as O.S. headlights
            illuminate him.  He waves his jacket over his head as we REFIELD
            TO INCLUDE an approaching police car.


                                                                                                  Page 3 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                                BRUCE
                          (shouts)
                      Hey!  Over here!

            ON BRUCE

            He stands in the middle of the road, forcing the car to SKID to
            a halt, fishtailing sideways, so it stops just inches from him.
            Bruce flinches back.

            ON SQUAD CAR

            The passenger door flies open and an angry HARVEY BULLOCK
            lumbers out.  RENE MONTOYA gets out of the driver's side.

                                BULLOCK
                      Whadda you, nuts, Wayne? You tryin'
                      t'get yerself --

            ON BRUCE

            He points towards the mansion, quite upset.

                                BRUCE
                          (breathless)
                      Inside the mansion!  The Penguin -- a
                      robbery --!

            BACK TO BULLOCK AND MONTOYA

            They look at each other, then Bullock pulls his gun from inside
            his baggy jacket.

                                BULLOCK
                      Let's go, Rene!  You take the back --
                      I'll cover the front!

            ON MONTOYA

            She glances quickly at Bruce as she pulls her piece.

                                MONTOYA
                      For your own safety, Mr. Wayne -- wait
                      here.

            Then she takes off O.S., following Bullock.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He looks relieved.  Then something bothers him; he frowns in
            confusion.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. MANSION BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

            The front doors suddenly SLAM open, revealing Bullock with gun
            in hand.

                                BULLOCK
                          (shouts)

                                                                                                  Page 4 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      Okay, beak-brain!  Getcher flippers
                      up!

            ANGLE INCLUDES PENGUIN AND HIS GOONS

            Surprised in the midst of their looting, they wheel about.  At
            this point Montoya comes through the open French doors behind
            them, gun leveled at the goons.

                                MONTOYA
                          (steely)
                      Prone out!

            The goons hastily DROP their guns and lie down on the floor.

            ON PENGUIN

            He scowls at Bullock.

                                PENGUIN
                      What unfortunate timing -- for you!

            He lowers his umbrella and SPRAYS a thick opaque mist from its
            tip.

            ON BULLOCK

            Taken by surprise, he begins to COUGH as he's enveloped by the
            mist.

                                BULLOCK
                          (coughs)

            WIDE ANGLE - THE FLOOR

            PANDEMONIUM, as the guests run this way and that, blinded by the
            fog.

                                GUESTS
                          (frightened shouts)

            ON MONTOYA

            Surrounded by the mist as well.  Thinking quickly, she drops to
            the floor, where there's a few inches of clear air between the
            parquet and the mist.  ANGLE ADJUSTS TO FOLLOW.

            LOW ANGLE - MONTOYA AND GOONS

            Montoya still has her gun.  The goons aren't going anywhere.

                                MONTOYA
                      Relax, guys.

            EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

            The Penguin charges through the open doors, dropping the mist-
            spraying umbrella and pulling another one from inside his
            overcoat.  He raises it overhead; propeller blades SPROUT from
            it and begin to WHIR.  He begins to lift off O.S., carrying the
            bag of loot.

                                                                                                  Page 5 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Bullock stumbles out onto the balcony, still COUGHING.

                                BULLOCK
                          (coughs)

            He looks up, to see the airborne Penguin crossing the full moon.
            He raises his gun, then realizes the fowl fellow is well out of
            range.  Play his disappointment, then

                                                                WIPE TO:

            INT. BRUCE'S OFFICE - CLOSE ON TV SCREEN - MORNING

            In BLACK-AND-WHITE, we see SUMMER GLEASON sitting behind a news desk,
            delivering a report.  Behind her in a small INSET is some kind of
            stylized graphic:  Perhaps a silhouette of the Gotham skyline with
            images of the Joker, Harley, Two-Face, the Penguin, Rupert Thorne,
            Poison Ivy, etc. looming over it.  Across the bottom of the screen is
            the legend .
              CRIME WAVE: GOTHAM UNDER SIEGE -- DAY 8

                                SUMMER
                          (filtered)
                      ... last night's brazen robbery by the
                      Penguin at the Van Pelt estate was the
                      latest in the worst series of crimes
                      Gotham City has ever seen, made all
                      the worse by the mysterious absence of
                      Batman.

            Now the inset behind Summer suddenly becomes a shot of Batman.

                                SUMMER (CONT'D)
                      After more than a week without his
                      protective presence -- his longest
                      disappearance that anyone can recall --
                      Gotham City can only wonder, "Batman,
                      where are you?"

            PULL BACK to show that we've been watching a small TV on the
            desk of Bruce's secretary, DANA.  She reaches over to turn off
            the set.

                                DANA
                      One good question, that.

            ANGLE INCLUDES DOOR

            The door opens and ALFRED, in his chauffeur's livery, comes in.

                                ALFRED
                          (cheery)
                      Good morning, Miss Dana.

                                DANA
                      Is it?  Not with all those weirdoes
                      running amuck.  Why isn't Batman doing
                      something about it?


                                                                                                  Page 6 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ON ALFRED

            He shrugs; "Why ask me?" and walks across the reception area
            toward Bruce's inner office.

                                ALFRED
                      I expect he has his reasons, however
                      obscure they may appear to us common
                      folk.

            ON INNER OFFICE DOOR

            It OPENS just before Alfred can reach it, and a preoccupied
            Bruce strides out, schedule book in hand, almost knocking Alfred
            aside.

                                BRUCE
                          (preoccupied)
                      Excuse me, Alfred.

            He crosses to Dana's desk.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Dana, I'm having a problem with my
                      personal calendar.

            ON BRUCE AND DANA

            He leans over her desk, pointing out discrepancies in his
            schedule book.

                                BRUCE
                      I just can't seem to remember what I
                      was doing most evenings last month.
                          (beat)
                      I've got nearly all of my nights
                      completely blocked off -- but why?

            ON DANA

            She looks up at Bruce, a faint smile on her lips.

                                DANA
                      Too many girlfriends to count?

            Bruce gives her a look.

                                BRUCE
                      You're not helping. Just double-check
                      this and update me in the morning,
                      okay?

            ANOTHER ANGLE - BRUCE

            grabs his topcoat off a coat tree and heads for the door, Alfred
            opening it.  Dana waves good-bye.

                                DANA
                      No problem, Mr. Wayne.  Have a nice
                      evening.


                                                                                                  Page 7 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He hesitates at the door, that odd feeling bothering him again.

                                BRUCE
                      Thanks. I'll ... try.

                                                                WIPE TO:

            EXT.  WAYNE ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

            As we PUSH IN on the stately old manor, we HEAR:

                                BRUCE (V.O.)
                      It's really bothering me, Dick.

            INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

            Bruce stands by the tall windows, backlit by the full moon, as
            he talks to DICK GRAYSON, who is lounging in a chair like a
            typical teenager, reading the daily newspaper, which is angled
            so we can see its  headline which obscures
                        WHERE IS BATMAN?
            Dick's face.

                                BRUCE
                      I've never been this absent-minded
                      before.

            ON DICK

            He lowers the newspaper so we can see that he's mildly annoyed.

                                DICK
                          (not paying attention)
                      Y'know, Batman's not the only one
                      who's missing.  How come the news
                      reports never mention anything about
                      Robin?

            Dick gets up and walks across the room, casually folding the
            paper and tossing it on top of a small pile of papers in the
            corner.

                                DICK (CONT'D)
                      If I were Batman's partner I'd be
                      getting ticked off bigtime.

            ON BRUCE

            He glances out the window to see the Bat Signal shining across
            the night sky, projected against the clouds.

                                BRUCE
                      There it is again.

            Dick ENTERS SHOT, looking out the window.

                                DICK
                      Yeah.  Wonder if he's going to answer
                      it this time.


                                                                                                  Page 8 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            WIDE ANGLE

            Bruce stands looking at the logo rippling over the clouds.  Dick
            picks up a few textbooks and heads for the door.  Alfred,
            meanwhile, has ENTERED the room and is busily tidying up the
            stack of newspapers Dick has left behind.

                                DICK
                      Gotta go.  I've got a study date with
                      Cindy and I'm running late.

                                ALFRED
                      Your roadster is idling in the
                      driveway, Master Dick.

            FAVOR ALFRED

            He stacks the pile of newspapers neatly while he talks to Bruce,
            who still stands looking out the window.

                                ALFRED
                      Anything I can do for you, sir?

            FAVORING BRUCE

            Still at the window.  He turns, his expression confused, to look
            at Alfred.

                                BRUCE
                      Ever had the feeling there was
                      something wrong with your life,
                      Alfred?  Something ... missing?

                                ALFRED
                      Not actually, sir.  All in all, I must
                      say I'm quite contented with my lot.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He looks back out the window, at the Bat-signal in the sky,
            which is reflected on the window glass, superimposed on his
            face.

                                BRUCE
                          (softly)
                      I wish I could say the same ...

                                                                WIPE TO:

            EXT. GOTHAM CITY STREET - DOWNTOWN - DAY

            It's a gray afternoon; dark clouds roll in over the city and
            there's a distant RUMBLE OF THUNDER in the air.  Bruce and Dana
            walk toward us, Dana pulling the collar of her topcoat closer
            about her throat as she glances up at the gathering clouds.
            Bruce also looks up as we slowly PUSH IN on him.

                                DANA
                      Gonna come a big rain, looks like.

                                BRUCE

                                                                                                  Page 9 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      Don't worry.  We can still make it
                      back to the office before ...

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            As he looks up at the threatening sky, we hear a sudden CRASH OF
            THUNDER and it starts to RAIN, huge drops SPLATTING on his face.

                                BRUCE
                          (voice trailing off)
                      ... it starts ...

            WIDE ANGLE

            Dana, trying to suppress her laughter, stands at the mouth of an
            alleyway, holding her purse over her head to keep off the rain.

                                DANA
                      We can take a shortcut through this
                      alley.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            Eyes narrowing, expression growing grim.  He's uncomfortable and
            he doesn't know why.  The RAIN is getting worse.

                                BRUCE
                          (uneasy)
                      ... I don't like alleys.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            As the rain becomes a DOWNPOUR, a smiling Dana grabs Bruce's
            wrist and gently pulls him into the alley after her.

                                DANA
                      Well, I'm not particularly fond of
                      drowning either.  Come on!

            LOW ANGLE - BRUCE AND DANA

            They run along the alley, Dana still holding her purse above her
            head to protect herself, Bruce cautiously looking both ways as
            they run as if something may suddenly spring out of the shadows
            to grab him.  Ahead in the alley large crates are stacked along
            the sides, easily high enough for someone to hide behind.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            TWO BIKER THUGS step out just in front of Bruce and Dana from
            behind the crates.  Dana is frightened, Bruce concerned.  One of
            the thugs holds a length of tire chain, the other a lead pipe.

                                1ST THUG
                      Out for a stroll on a rainy night like
                      this?

                                2ND THUG
                      And in such a bad neighborhood too. 
                      Not a smart idea.


                                                                                                  Page 10 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            FAVOR 1ST THUG

            He moves toward the frightened Dana.

                                1ST THUG
                      Gonna have to ask you for your money,
                      people.

                                2ND THUG
                      It's the economy.  You understand.

                                DANA
                      N-no ... d-don't ...

            FAVOR BRUCE

            Reaching inside his jacket, he pulls out his wallet and holds it
            out to the second thug gingerly.

                                BRUCE
                      Okay, easy ... we don't want anyone
                      hurt here.

            FAVOR 2ND THUG

            He SLAPS the pipe against his palm and grins unpleasantly as he
            moves toward Bruce.

                                2ND THUG
                      Speak for yourself, pal.

            As the Second Thug reaches for the wallet --

            ON BRUCE

            He suddenly delivers a smashing side kick straight INTO CAMERA.
            SFX:  THUD!

                                2ND THUG (O.S.)
                          (grunt of pain)

            ON ALLEY WALL

            The Second Thug sails THROUGH FRAME and SMASHES into the brick
            wall.  He slips to the ground, dazed.

                                2ND THUG
                          (dazed groan)

            ON 1ST THUG

            Furious now, he CHARGES at Bruce, his pipe raised overhead.

                                1ST THUG
                      Big mistake!

            WIDE ANGLE

            The First Thug swings his pipe at Bruce.  Bruce easily grabs the
            pipe, then pivots and uses the other's momentum to help flip the
            thug over his shoulder.  The First Thug SLAMS back first into


                                                                                                  Page 11 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            the opposite wall and slips to the ground in a heap.

                                1ST THUG
                          (dazed groan)

            Dana watches all this in open-mouthed astonishment.

            ON BRUCE

            He stands in the pouring RAIN, fists clenched, the two thugs
            sprawled to either side of him.  He is shaking; not with fear,
            but with rage, as a concerned Dana rushes up to him.

                                DANA
                      Mister Wayne, you okay?

                                BRUCE
                          (tense)
                      I'm fine, Dana.  They never even
                      touched me.

            FAVOR DANA

            She puts a comforting hand on Bruce's arm.

                                DANA
                      They could've done a lot more than
                      just touched you, boss man.
                          (beat)
                      What in the world got into you?

            ON BRUCE

            He looks up, his face grim, his fist still clenched.

                                BRUCE
                      I wish I knew, Dana.  I wish I knew.

            A sudden CRASH OF THUNDER and flash of lightning punctuate his
            words.

                                                               FADE OUT.


                                      END ACT ONE




                                        ACT TWO

            FADE IN:

            EXT. CORRIDOR (DREAM SEQUENCE)

            Bruce is in shirt and slacks, walking along a Caligari-esque
            corridor, distorted and nightmarish, with all the angles a
            little off.  Confused, Bruce looks around as he walks, uncertain
            where he is.

            ANOTHER ANGLE


                                                                                                  Page 12 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            He rounds a bend in the corridor, to see that it ends in a
            massive bookcase, filled with books as far as we can see in all
            directions:  A huge cliff of literature.

                                BRUCE
                          (surprised gasp)

            ANGLE DOWN ON BRUCE

            Bruce studies the bookcase, running his fingertips along the
            spines of the books as he moves along, reading the titles.

            CLOSER

            As he starts to pull a particular title from the shelf, suddenly
            a familiar black-gloved hand shoots out from between the books,
            KNOCKING several volumes to the floor.  Batman's hand grabs the
            startled Bruce's wrist and pulls him forward.

                                BRUCE
                          (gasp of fear)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Bruce struggles to free himself, and another gloved hand shoots
            out and grabs him, then another and another, reaching out from
            behind the bookcase like arms in a Cocteau film.

                                BRUCE
                          (straining)
                      Let -- go ...!

            CLOSER

            As the frightened Bruce is pulled toward the bookcase, books
            fall away, revealing a BLACKNESS beyond in which many pairs of
            slitted eyes glow.

                                BRUCE
                          (cry of fear)

            ON THE CUT Bruce sits bolt upright in bed, wide-eyed and sweaty.

                          (harsh breaths)

            ANOTHER ANGLE - BRUCE

            He realizes he's been dreaming, throws back his tangled covers
            and swings himself up so he's sitting on the side of his bed,
            his face in his hands.

                                BRUCE

                      Only a dream ...

            FOLLOWING BRUCE

            Unshaven, still in his pajamas, he stumbles to the door.

            INT. WAYNE MANOR - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

            Dick sits reading the morning paper while Alfred dusts.  ANGLE
            WIDENS TO INCLUDE Bruce standing framed in the doorway, one arm
            leaning against it for support.  They stop what they're doing
            and stare at him.

                                ALFRED
                          (startled)
                      Master Bruce?  Is something wrong,
                      sir?

            Dick rises, starts toward him.

                                DICK
                      You okay?  You look like something the
                      cat tossed up.

            ON BRUCE

            He runs his fingers through his tousled hair as he walks past
            Dick, over to the huge bookcase that fills one wall of the room.

                                BRUCE
                      ... Just had a nightmare ... I'll be
                      fine.

            CLOSER ON BRUCE

            He's at the bookcase now, running his finger along the spines of
            the books like he was doing in his dream.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Weird dream ... I was in front of a
                      bookcase just like this one, looking
                      for ... for ...

            CLOSE ON BOOKSHELF

            His hand stops on the book he reached for in his dream:  The
            spine is labeled .CHIROPTERY

                      -- This one!

            Bruce pulls the book halfway out of the shelf, and something
            CLICKS.

            DRAMATIC ANGLE

            All three men react as the entire bookshelf SLIDES to either
            side, revealing a stairway hidden behind it.

                                BRUCE

            FAVOR DICK AND ALFRED

            They cross to the stairway; Dick cautiously looks down into
            darkness.  We can hear the FAINT ECHO we associate with the
            Batcave.

                                ALFRED
                      Where does it lead to?

                                DICK
                      Only one way to find out.

            He starts down the steps.

            ON BRUCE AND ALFRED

            They exchange a quick surprised glance, then move quickly after
            Dick, following him down the stairs into darkness.  Bruce stops
            a few steps down, feeling the wall.

                                BRUCE
                      Wait.  I think I've found a light ...

            CLOSE ON HIS HAND

            He CLICKS the switch.


            ON BRUCE, DICK, ALFRED

            The lights go on O.S.  Bruce, Dick, and Alfred look O.S. down
            the stairway, stunned by what they see.

                          (awed)
                      I didn't know we had a basement ...

            THEIR POV - DRAMATIC ANGLE - BATCAVE

            Here we can see the Batmobile, there we catch a glimpse of the
            trophy room with the robot dinosaur and the giant penny.  In one
            corner looms the crime lab, in another the huge computer.  A
            flurry of bats SQUEAK and FLAP THROUGH SHOT.

            WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE - PANNING

            They move down the stairs and into the cave proper, looking
            around in amazement.

                                DICK
                      This can't be what I think it is.

                                BRUCE
                      What else could it be?

            Completely at sea.

                      But what's the Batcave doing under our
                      house?  This is just too weird.

                                                                                                  Page 15 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            He picks up a silver tray that contains an empty coffee cup and

            an empty glass bottle labeled .

                      I concur heartily with Master Dick's
                      opinion.  This is your special coffee
                      mug, sir, and the lad's favorite soft
                      drink.

            He scratches his head in complete confusion.

                      What does it all mean?

            ON BRUCE

            As grim as we've ever seen him.

                                BRUCE
                      I think I know.  I'm not sure how, but
                      I can feel it in my gut.

            His eyes widen as he stares at Bruce in disbelief.

                                DICK
                      Say what?  No way!

            He stares at Bruce.

                      You're serious.

            ON BRUCE

            Grim, almost expressionless.

                                BRUCE
                      Dead serious.

            Behind him several bats FLUTTER THROUGH SHOT.

            INT. BATCAVE - HOURS LATER

            Bruce and Dick are wearing their costumes now, but with their
            masks off.  (NOTE:  Even when they're completely costumed, we
            still won't refer to them as Batman and Robin, because they
            aren't yet.  The steely toughness and streetwise attitude --

            even their posture -- is missing.)  Dick is also not wearing his
            utility belt.  Alfred is no longer there.

            ON GYMNASTIC EQUIPMENT - FOLLOW BRUCE

            as he does a flip off the hanging rings, somersaults in mid-air,
            lands hands-first on the sidehorse, then flips again so he lands
            gracefully on his feet right in front of a much-impressed Dick.

                                DICK
                          (impressed)
                      Outstanding!  I didn't know you could
                      do that.

            FAVOR BRUCE

            He looks back at the gym equipment, his hand to the back of his
            head, almost surprised at what he's just done.

                                BRUCE
                      Neither did I.
                          (beat)
                      It just felt right -- like muscle

            He holds up his utility belt and starts investigating the
            various compartments.

            CLOSER

            He finds several of the small black gas balls, rolls them around
            in his palm like marbles, then drops them back into their
            compartment.

            WIDE ANGLE

            He takes the grappling gun out of its compartment in the belt's
            rear and looks at it.

            He snaps his head aside just enough for the grappling hook to
            narrowly miss him as it WHIZZES THROUGH SHOT.

                                BRUCE
                          (sternly)

            carefully puts everything back in the utility belt, not certain
            of what else he might accidentally set off.  Over this:

                                DICK
                      This is just too much! I don't even
                      know if I want to be Robin.

            CLOSE ON DICK

            worried, emotionally overwrought.

                                DICK
                      I mean, being a crime fighter is a
                      great fantasy, but the reality is
                      pretty intense.

                                BRUCE (O.S.)
                      I know exactly how you feel.

            Determined, he turns and walks over to the computer as Dick
            follows.

                      But if this is our destiny, we can't

            Bruce gingerly sits at the computer console and starts TYPING.

                      Maybe this computer can tell us what
                      happened to our memories.

            We look up at the computer screen where we can see the phrase
            INVALID COMMAND PARAMETER repeated down the whole length of
            the screen.  Dick steps INTO SHOT and looks at the screen.

                                ALFRED (O.S.)

            He walks over and hands Bruce a large leatherbound ledger.

                                ALFRED
                      According to this ledger, we all
                      recently received flu shots from a
                      Doctor Otto Sonderbar.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Alfred is obviously pleased with himself.  Dick scratches his
            head.

                                ALFRED
                      This took place the day before Batman
                      and Robin vanished.

                                DICK
                      Sonderbar ... name doesn't ring any
                      bells.

            ON BRUCE

            He rises from the computer, walks across the room.

                                BRUCE
                      That's something else we've all
                      forgotten.  But at least it's a
                      starting place.
                          (beat)
                      Come on, Dick.

            ON BATMOBILE

            Bruce climbs a bit awkwardly into the waiting Batmobile and
            pulls on his mask.  As Dick ENTERS SHOT:

                                BRUCE
                      Better put your mask on, Dick. We're
                      going to pay the good doctor a visit.

            FAVOR DICK

            He puts on his own mask and climbs into the Batmobile, looking
            nervous.

                                DICK
                      You sure you know how to drive this
                      thing?

                                BRUCE
                      It's a car.  How hard can it be?

            As one, they look down at the dashboard.

            THEIR POV - DASHBOARD

            It's the most complicated thing this side of the B-12 Bomber.

            ANGLE INCLUDES BRUCE AND DICK

            Bruce studies the complicated dash for a beat, then reaches over

                                                                                                  Page 20 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            and, feigning a confidence he doesn't feel, TOGGLES a switch.

            ON BATMOBILE'S FRONT BUMPER

            The grappling hook suddenly FIRES from the front of the car,
            narrowly missing a nearby stalagmite.  After a beat it retracts
            (SFX: WINCH WHINE).

            RESUME BRUCE AND DICK

            Dick raises an eyebrow.

                                DICK
                      You were saying ...?

                                BRUCE
                      Keep quiet or I'll make you drive.

            He tries another switch.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Let's see what this does ...

            ON BATMOBILE'S REAR ENGINE PORT

            The afterburner suddenly IGNITES and the engine ROARS into life.

            ON BATMOBILE COCKPIT

            They look up as the canopy SLIDES shut.  We can see Bruce put
            his hands on the wheel.

                                BRUCE
                      Here goes nothing ...

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            The Batmobile ROARS up the ramp as Alfred watches, obviously
            concerned.

            ON RAMP - TRACK WITH BATMOBILE

            It ZOOMS up the winding ramp, weaving slightly, heading toward
            what appears to be a solid rock wall.

            INT. COCKPIT - BRUCE AND DICK

            They brace themselves for what looks sure to be a fatal
            collision.

            ON RAMP

            The Batmobile goes through an electric eye beam, breaking it.

            ON ROCK WALL

            Just before the car hits it, the hidden ramp lowers like a
            drawbridge.

            INT. COCKPIT - BRUCE AND DICK

            They relax.

                                                                                                  Page 21 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND


            EXT. HILL BENEATH WAYNE MANOR - DUSK

            The sleek Batmobile ROARS across the chasm and out into the
            night.  As it disappears into the distance:

                                DICK (V.O.)
                      Well, we made it out of the cave alive ...

                                                                WIPE TO:

            EXT. N.D. GOTHAM CITY STREET - NIGHT

            The Batmobile ROARS along a lamplit street, still the most
            powerful beast on the road.

                                BRUCE (V.O.)
                      There's another problem we haven't
                      discussed.

            INT. BATMOBILE - MOVING

            Bruce watches the road as he drives.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Whoever caused our amnesia must also
                      be aware of our secret identities.

            Dick shrugs.

                                DICK
                      Hey, before today I didn't even know I
                      had a secret identity.

            OTS BRUCE AND DICK - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

            Our heroes' attention is drawn to the sudden CLANGING of a
            BURGLAR ALARM ahead.  We can see two BURGLARS running out of a
            ritzy store, the sign above which proclaims it the SECOND AVENUE
            FURRIERS.  The thieves leave a trail of mink and ermine coats
            behind them as they rush to a waiting van.

                                BRUCE
                      Look!

            ON BURGLARS

            As they load the furs into the van, they are startled by the
            sudden approach of the Batmobile and freeze in their tracks. The
            FIRST BURGLAR addresses someone unseen in the van.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                      Boss!  It's the Bat-car!

                                2ND BURGLAR
                      They ain't supposed ta be --

            WIDER ANGLE

            The burglars watch, confused, as the Batmobile ROARS right on
            past them.

            INT. BATMOBILE - MOVING

            Dick looks at Bruce in surprise.

                                DICK
                      What, you're just going to ignore
                      them?

                                BRUCE
                      They're armed.  We're not.

                                DICK
                      Do you think that'd stop Batman and
                      Robin?

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He considers what Dick has just said.  His eyeslits narrow and
            he cuts the steering wheel sharply.

                                BRUCE
                      You're right.

            ON BATMOBILE

            It makes a SCREAMING U-TURN in the middle of the street and
            heads back toward the startled fur thieves.

            ON THE BURGLARS

            As the Batmobile approaches, they pull hand guns and OPEN FIRE
            on our heroes.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                      Knew it was too good t' be true!  Take
                      'em down!

            ON BATMOBILE

            It SQUEALS to a halt as the slugs RICOCHET harmlessly O.S. Then
            the canopy slides open and the costumed Bruce rises.  He hurls a
            batarang O.S.

            ON BURGLARS

            They watch, astounded, as the batarang flies wide, not coming
            close to hitting any of them.  Then they OPEN FIRE again.

            ON COCKPIT

            Bruce ducks back down behind the bullet-proof windshield beside
            as several more SHOTS CRACK against it.

                                BRUCE
                      That didn't work.

                                DICK
                      Wait!  I got an idea ...

            He reaches for the dashboard.


                                                                                                  Page 23 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            EXT. STREET - BATMOBILE AND BURGLARS

            The grappling hook FIRES from the front bumper like it did in
            the cave.  It EMBEDS in the side of the van, causing the
            burglars to leap out of its way, one to either side.

                                BURGLARS
                          (startled cries)

            ON BATMOBILE

            Bruce and Dick, not quite as graceful in their costumes as
            usual, leap out.  Bruce TACKLES the First Burglar, KNOCKING him
            flat.

                          (impact grunt)

            The First Burglar leaps to his feet and grabs Dick from behind,
            SLAMMING him back against the van.

                                DICK
                          (groan of pain)

            Bruce is SLAMMED from behind by the Second Burglar, winding up
            against the van beside Dick.

                                BRUCE
                          (impact grunt)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Side by side now, backed against the van, Bruce and Dick stand
            braced as the two burglars brandish their guns.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                      Y'know, you two ain't nearly as tough
                      as we heard you was!

                                2ND BURGLAR

            Two-Face approaches the costumed Bruce and Dick, guns cocked.

            He snarls and raises his guns menacingly.

            ON BRUCE AND DICK - FAVOR DICK

            The two are pressed against the side of the vehicle as Two-
            Face's shadow flows over them.  Suddenly Dick's eyeslits widen --
            he's got an idea.

            ON DICK'S HAND

            He fumbles with his utility belt and two small GAS BALLS drop
            into his gloved hand.

            WIDE ANGLE

            Dick hurls the balls to the ground in front of the burglars and
            Two-Face.  The balls BURST and billowing clouds of gas envelop
            the startled crooks.

                                TWO-FACE, BURGLARS
                          (choking coughs)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Dick and Bruce quickly cover their mouths and noses with their
            cloaks as the gas rises about them.  Two-Face and his two
            toadies collapse at their feet.

                                TWO-FACE, BURGLARS
                          (fading groans)

            ON BRUCE AND DICK

            They lower their cloaks as the gas dissipates.  Bruce is
            suitably impressed.

                                BRUCE


                                                                                                  Page 25 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      How did you know those were gas bombs?

                                DICK
                      I didn't.  I was just hoping they
                      weren't grenades.

                                                                WIPE TO:

            EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

            Bruce and Dick finish tying up Two-Face and the burglars as they
            hear approaching POLICE SIRENS.  They look up to see several
            squad cars SQUEAL to a halt near them.

            ON LEAD SQUAD CAR

            Harvey Bullock and COMMISSIONER GORDON get out of the lead car.
            Gordon seems both stunned and thrilled to see our heroes.

                                GORDON
                      Batman!  Robin!  Is it really you?

                      So it would seem, Commissioner.

                                GORDON
                      But where have you been?  The city's

            He starts to explain.

                                DICK
                      It's a long story, Sir.  We were --

            Bruce steps forward, interrupting a surprised Dick.

                                BRUCE
                          (quickly)
                      Working, ah, undercover.  We'll
                      explain when we can.

            ON BRUCE AND DICK

            They get back into the Batmobile as Gordon and Bullock watch.

                                BRUCE
                      For now, we'd appreciate it if you
                      wouldn't tell anyone we've returned. 
                      We'll make it all clear to you,
                      Commissioner ...

            INT. BATMOBILE

            Bruce drops into his seat beside Dick as the canopy SLIDES shut.

                                                                                                  Page 26 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      ... just as soon as it becomes clear
                      to us.

            ON GORDON AND BULLOCK

            They stand watching as the Batmobile ROARS off into the night.

                                GORDON
                      I don't really care where they've
                      been. I'm just glad they're back.

            CLOSE ON BULLOCK

            He SNAPS the toothpick he's been chewing on in two.  He looks
            like a man who's just smelled something unpleasant.

                                BULLOCK
                      Yeah, well ... everyone's entitled to
                      their opinion.

            EXT. DR. SONDERBAR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

            A nice Brownstone building on a quiet residential street.  There
            is an alley running beside the building, and as we PUSH IN, we
            can just barely make out the Batmobile parked in the alley.

            INT.  SONDERBAR'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

            It's pretty much the kind of place you'd imagine it to be from
            the outside:  Leather chairs for waiting patients, a few framed
            diplomas hanging, a tall bookcase against an inner wall, etc.
            Bruce finishes climbing into the darkened room through a side
            window, and Dick climbs in behind him.

                                BRUCE
                      Looks like nobody's home.

            ON BRUCE

            He looks around the room, finds a framed photo on the wall.  He
            takes it down and studies it.

            OTS BRUCE - ON PHOTO

            Now we can clearly see the photo:  A black-and-white shot of DR.
            OTTO SONDERBAR accepting some award.  Sonderbar is short, squat,
            with thick glasses, a full head of graying hair and a neatly
            trimmed salt-and-pepper beard.

                                BRUCE
                      The mysterious Dr. Sonderbar, I

            INT. SONDERBAR'S INNER OFFICE (FLASHBACK)

            A very QUICK CUT of a smiling Sonderbar approaching with an air
            hypo in one hand.

                                                            CUT BACK TO:

            INT. OUTER OFFICE - AS BEFORE

            The framed photo slips from Bruce's fingers and SHATTERS on the
            floor.  Bruce looks up from it, grim and determined.

                                BRUCE
                      It was him, Dick. I'm sure of it.  I
                      don't know why yet -- but I will.

            ANOTHER ANGLE  

            He notices something on the wall that was hidden by the picture --
            a pressure plate. He presses it. 

            WIDE ANGLE

            The wall slides back to reveal a large hidden laboratory.  Dick
            moves to join Bruce as they enter cautiously. 

                                DICK
                      What, does every place in Gotham have
                      secret rooms?

            INT. LAB - ESTABLISHING

            Filled with all sorts of electronic and chemical equipment,
            including a complicated distillation apparatus -- glass tubing,
            retorts, beakers, etc. -- and a device with a rotating radar
            like dish connected to a computer monitor and keyboard. SFX: 
            SLOW BEEPS.  The device seems to be transmitting.  Dick notices
            this.

                                DICK
                      Oh, this doesn't look at all
                      suspicious.

            FAVOR DICK

            He stands at the computer keyboard and TYPES in a few commands.

                      Check this out, Bruce -- I mean,
                      Batman.

            He stands beside Dick, looks at the monitor.

                          (grimly)
                      I'd say we've found the gadget
                      responsible for our memory loss.

                                DICK
                      Yeah ... looks like a standard
                      operating system ...

            Dick quickly TYPES some more.

            ON MONITOR

            The screen now asks: DEACTIVATE VIRAL RECEIVERS (Y/N?) 
            PULL BACK to include Bruce and Dick.  Dick looks at Bruce.

                      What do you think?

            Bruce's gloved finger jabs INTO FRAME, pressing the  key.

            WIDE ANGLE

            As the dish stops rotating and the BEEPING ceases, Bruce and
            Dick convulse with pain, grabbing the sides of their heads as if
            afraid they might explode.

            DRAMATIC ANGLE - BATMAN AND ROBIN

            We PUSH IN as their pain passes.  They take their hands away
            from their faces and rise to their full heights.  Their body
            language is different now; no longer are they Bruce Wayne and
            Dick Grayson awkwardly wearing odd costumes.  Now, once again,
            they are BATMAN and ROBIN!

                                ROBIN
                      Wow, did that hurt.  You okay?

            Jaw set, eyes narrowing, once more the most dangerous man alive.

                      Never felt better.

            Batman puts down the air hypo and looks at the dormant radar
            dish.

                      Since our last encounter I have
                      remained convinced of your true
                      identity -- and, by extrapolation,
                      that of your companion.

                                STRANGE
                      But of course.  It was a simple matter
                      to forge the necessary papers so that
                      your regular physician's service would
                      direct you here.

                                STRANGE
                      Not at all.  You prevented my
                      profiting from your true identity once
                      before -- this time, however, I've
                      done quite well.

            Strange moves to a safe, dials a combination and opens it.
            Inside we can see stacks of money, negotiable bonds, etc.

                      guarantee no interference from Batman
                      and Robin.

            ON STRANGE AND BATMAN

            Strange closes the safe and approaches, gun held ready.  The
            Dark Knight glares at him.

                                STRANGE
                      So you see, I must insist that you
                      continue this charade ... whether you
                      wish to or not.

                      I could, of course, simply shoot you --
                      but that would be a waste of valuable
                      scientific knowledge.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            His goons keep Batman and Robin covered while Strange walks over
            and picks up his air hypo.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                      Instead, I am curious to see what
                      might happen were I to inject you both
                      with a second viral receiver ...

            CLOSER ON STRANGE

            He loads a cartridge into his air hypo.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)

                                                                                                  Page 32 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      ... and then turn up the broadcast
                      frequency to maximum.
                          (beat)
                      In theory, it should leave you both
                      complete mental vegetables.

            WIDE ANGLE

            Strange turns his device back on.  The dish begins to revolve
            and BEEP.  Strange twists a large potentiometer dial on the
            machine; in several V.U. gauges above it, needles bury
            themselves in red zones.  The BEEPS INCREASE in frequency and
            urgency.

            ON BATMAN AND ROBIN

            Strange turns back to them with his air hypo in hand.  His goons
            close in beside him.  Our heroes stand their ground, ready for
            anything.

                                STRANGE
                      Now, you will please to cooperate ...

            Batman backs up toward the distillation apparatus. Strange
            follows him. 

            CLOSE ON BATMAN

            His hand reaches behind him, finds the control on a bunsen
            burner and turns it up. The small gas flame flares up under a
            glass retort. 

            WIDE ANGLE

            A green liquid begins BUBBLING and coursing through the spiral
            tubing, filling a resevoir at the far end. The resevoir SHATTERS
            under the pressure. Strange and the two goons are momentarily
            distracted. 

                                STRANGE
                       --?!What

            ON BATMAN

            He suddenly lunges forward, grabbing a startled Strange by the
            wrist of the hand that holds the air hypo.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                          (startled cry)

            FAVOR ROBIN

            As the two goons turn toward the struggling Batman and Strange,
            Robin leaps into the air and KICKS the guns out of both goons'
            hands.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Robin throws a straight jab directly at us until it FILLS FRAME.
            SFX: WHACK!


                                                                                                  Page 33 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ON 1ST GOON

            Obviously having taken Robin's punch full on the chin O.S., he
            reels back against the wall and slumps, dazed, to the floor.

                                1ST GOON
                          (fading groan)

            ON 2ND GOON

            Robin does a back kick that catches Goon #2 full in the gut,
            sending him CRASHING into a bank of equipment.

                                2ND GOON
                          (impact grunt)

            He sags to the floor, out cold.

            ON BATMAN AND STRANGE

            With a strength born of desperation, Strange tries to press the
            air hypo to Batman's shoulder, but Batman will not let go of the
            other's wrist.

                                STRANGE
                          (straining)
                      Not -- again!  You will not ruin
                      everything again!

            CLOSER ON AIR HYPO

            As the two men struggle, its tip points first one way and then
            the other, then back again.  It's impossible to tell which man
            may take the lethal shot.

                                BATMAN
                          (straining)
                      Give it up ... Strange ...!

            FAVOR STRANGE

            With the last of his strength he twists away from Batman,
            pulling his wrist free of the Dark Knight's grip.

                                STRANGE
                          (shout of triumph)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            But his own momentum causes Strange to stumble against the wall,
            the impact pressing the air hypo to his chest.  It fires with a
            WHOOSH OF COMPRESSED AIR.

                                STRANGE
                          (cry of fear)

            ON STRANGE

            He looks down at his chest in sheer horror, then at the
            radiopathic transmitter.  He lunges toward it, trying to shut it
            off before his racing bloodstream can carry the viral receiver

                                                                                                  Page 34 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            to his brain. He's almost to the cut-off switch when --

            CLOSE ON HIM

            He freezes, his mouth growing slack, his pupils becoming tiny
            pinpoints.  Strange slumps to the floor, staring blindly off
            into space -- his mind wiped completely clean by his own
            machine.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Robin leaps to Strange's machine and SMASHES it, but it's too
            late.

            ON BATMAN

            He kneels by Strange, checking his condition.

                                BATMAN
                          (grimly)
                      Too late.

            Batman slowly rises and turns to Robin.

                                BATMAN (CONT'D)
                      It seems our secret is finally safe.

            They stare down at the mindless idiot that was Dr. Hugo Strange
            as we

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            INT.  WAYNE MANOR DEN - ONE WEEK LATER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON TV

            The TV shows Summer the news desk again, giving a report.  A
            still photo behind her shows Batman and Robin delivering a tied-
            up Penguin to the police.

                                SUMMER
                          (filtered)
                      ... and things have finally returned to
                      normal in Gotham City now that Batman
                      and Robin are back in action.  A
                      grateful Mayor Hill said today that --

            Suddenly Dick's hand reaches INTO FRAME and CLICKS the TV off. 

                                DICK (O.S.)
                      Love to hear more, Summer, but I've
                      got a date with Cindy tonight.

            ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE Dick and Bruce, with Alfred nearby.

            ON ALFRED

            He stands by the tall window, hands behind his back.

                                ALFRED
                      It would appear that fate dictates
                      otherwise, Master Dick.


                                                                                                  Page 35 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ANOTHER ANGLE 

            We can see the Bat Signal out the window behind Alfred, flashing
            in the night sky.

            FAVOR DICK

            He SIGHS, shrugs and heads to the open grandfather clock, where
            Bruce already stands waiting.

                                DICK
                          (sighs)
                      Alfred, could you please call and give
                      Cindy my apologies?
                          (beat)
                      Y'know ... in some ways life was a lot
                      more fun when we didn't know the
                      truth.

            They step through the clock, which closes behind them, and we

                                                               FADE OUT.
