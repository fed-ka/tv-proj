  EXT. A DESERT IN THE MIDDLE EAST - NIGHT 2210 
 
  Pitch black night. The spitting fire of six automatic 
  weapons blazes into the night. Men are laughing, 
    hysterical with delight. 
 
  CLOSE UP: a cigar lighter flares. The face of SERGAI 
  LERMOV - in arabic clothes - lighting a cigar. He is 
  grinning. He turns. 
 
  From his POV: A magnificent desert tent. It belongs to a 
  prince. From within there is the low, yellow glow of 
  lamps. 
 
  LERMOV shouts to the tent. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                      Wilder! Maynard! Join the fun! 
 
  INT. TENT IN THE DESERT - NIGHT 2211 
 
  The tent is a luxurious mix of traditional and ultra 
  modern. The lamps are state of the art, battery driven. 
  They throw romantic shadows. A fire burns in the centre. 
  There is a computer with a satellite dish turned to the 
  roof. 
 
  A servant is moving about arranging dishes of food before 
  cushions. 
 
  Two Englishmen recline on cushions: HAMPTON WILDER and 
  DICK MAYNARD. 
  HAMPTON WILDER - tall, slightly stooping, a mandarin 
  manner, very aware of his long hands, doe eyes that give 
  nothing away, a mouth that often has a little smile that 
  may be read as sardonic ... His enemies hate that smile. 
 
  DICK MAYNARD - fifty, not tall, fit with chunky 
    shoulders, sandy haired, of a fair complexion with an 
  open fresh face. He stands like a boxer; he has the Jack 
  Kennedy habit of touching the middle button of his 
  jacket. The immediate impression is of a warm, sound, 
  intelligent man. There is Yorkshire in his voice, 
  smoothed by education. 
 
  MAYNARD is in a suit. 
 
  WILDER is wreathed in Arabic clothing. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 2
 

                                  LERMOV (O.S.) 
                                Wilder, Maynard! 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          Our Russian friend is off his head. Where did 
                        the Sheikh get hold of him? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            His Highness chooses his friends carefully. 
            But once chosen, they find they re treated 
                              very well indeed. 
 
  He looks at two young men and two young women who are 
  sitting in the corner of the tent, grinning and smirking 
  at them. MAYNARD - sheepishly - is enjoying himself. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            If certain colleagues in my party could see 
                                      this! ... 
 
                                        WILDER 
              My lot have killjoys too. I find it best 
                          simply to lie about fun. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                      Yes ... 
 
  MAYNARD is having difficulty breaking eye contact with 
  one of the young women. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT D) 
                Though, Hampton, I do have the feeling 
                    something else is expected of us. 
 
                                        WILDER 
              People like us always raise expectations, 
                                      Richard. 
                                        (Low.) 
              There s a skill in knowing how to answer 
                                        them. 
 
  A beat. They are close. MAYNARD is looking at him. Then 
  he smiles. 
 
  And into the tent come men carrying weapons, led by the 
  SHEIKH - a large energetic man - LERMOV at his wide. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
                  Your Highness, all to your liking? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 3
 

                                        SHEIKH 
                A wonder. A British weapon that works. 
 
  All laugh, too loudly. The SHEIKH shakes hands with 
  WILDER then with MAYNARD. MAYNARD shakes with LERMOV. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                      You are enjoying the desert? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            It has much to offer. 
 
  As he does so one of the young men takes a photograph 
  with a flash camera. 
 
  LERMOV clicks his fingers and holds out his hands. The 
  two boys go to him and take his hands, smiling. There is 
  a great expectation in the tent. 
 
                                LERMOV (CONT'D) 
                Your Highness, Gentlemen, shall we ...? 
 
  WILDER stands. MAYNARD does not know what to do. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                That s for you. 
 
  He nods at the girls. 
 
  All the other men and the boys go out of the tent. 
  Laughter in the dark outside. MAYNARD looks at the girls 
  - who smile. 
 
  CAPTION:  NINE YEARS LATER.  
 
  EXT. OUTSIDE AN OPEN PRISON - DAY 1. 1109 
 
  Flat countryside. A sunny day. An open prison. A driveway 
  off a country road. Steel fencing. A pale blue sign: 
   H.M. Prison Sidham.  
 
  Press are waiting at the gates. A big turn out: some are 
  on ladders with their cameras. One looks at his watch. 
  Police are waiting. 
 
  We see that DANNY is standing at the back of the media 
  scrum. He turns away and whispers to his pal. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 4
 

                                        DANNY 
                                  No show yet. 
 
  Go to a TV news team from the BBC. The 1ST BBC MAN, with 
  a news camera, is up a ladder. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                            (Looks at her watch.) 
                              What s keeping him? 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                  Paying the Governor his backhander. 
 
  Stale laughter. 
 
  Figures can be seen through the metal gates. A tall man - 
  it s HAMPTON WILDER - is shaking hands with others, 
  obviously Prison Officers. They laugh at something WILDER 
  says. Obviously he s been a popular prisoner. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                                    Where s ITN? 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                          (Looking over the heads.) 
                          Ten feet to your right. 
 
  The press surge forward. In the scrum the BBC WOMAN kicks 
  and trips another woman. The ITN woman goes down with a 
  cry. 
 
                                BBC MAN (CONT'D) 
                                      Result! 
 
  Police hold them back, but the situation is immediately 
  out of control. The BBC WOMAN fights toward the front. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      (At the back. Into his lapel.) 
                                    Go go go! 
 
  He plunges into the scrum. 
 
  The BBC WOMAN is at the front. A smiling HAMPTON WILDER 
    approaches her. 
  The Press are calling out. 
 
                                  PRESS VOICES 
              Hampton! Hampton! Hampton? Hampton look at 
                                  me! Hampton! 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 5
 

                                        DANNY 
                                Come on come on! 
 
  A car is pressing forward. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                    (Jostled, gets her question out.) 
              Mr. Wilder, what are you going to do now? 
 
  WILDER s immense self-confidence is masked by a humble 
  manner but it still shows through. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                  I want to apologise. I let down my 
                      colleagues, my friends, my ... 
                            (A hesitation. Tears?) 
                ... My country. The pleasures of life 
              overwhelmed me. I abused the sacred trust of 
          my high office. I lied, I stole public money, 
                and I have now paid for that mistake. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                        Mr Wilder. BBC Television. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                Ah old friends. 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                Was the real reason for your conviction 
            illegal arm sales when you were Minister ... 
 
  WILDER has turned away and speaks over her. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            I now go into private life. The one shining 
            thing for me, from my time in prison, is to 
          have found that the Lord Jesus is my saviour. 
 
  He moves forward into the ruck. 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                              (To the BBC WOMAN.) 
                        What are you trying to do? 
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                        Get at the truth?  Truth?  
 
                                      BBC MAN 
                                      Oh that. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 6
 

                                        WILDER 
                        Thank you all so very much. 
 
  DANNY s got to HAMPTON WILDER. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      Mr. Wilder Sir, in the back. 
 
  DANNY opens the back door and WILDER gets into the car. 
  Then he gets into the car shouting  Go! Go!  
 
                                    BBC WOMAN 
                                What s going on? 
 
                                      BBC MAN 
            Must have sold his story to a tabloid. Now, 
            no doubt,  on his way to a secret location.  
 
    ESTABLISHING - THAMES HOUSE EXTERIOR - DAY 1. 1141 
 
  INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK BENEATH THAMES HOUSE - DAY 1. 
  1142 
 
  The car pulls up with a screech of tyres. The doors are 
  opened. DANNY gets out quickly. 
  To his lapel. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            We are in. Close the carpark. Number 1 here? 
 
  WILDER gets out of the car. HARRY is walking towards him, 
  TESSA a step behind him. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                              Well hello Harry. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Hello Hampton. This better be about something 
                                        big. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                How about the fall of the Government? 
 
  WILDER looks around at the grim surroundings. A look of 
  fear on his face. 
 
  Close up on his face. FREEZE. 
 
  CREDITS.

  INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK BENEATH THAMES HOUSE - DAY 1. 
  1145 
 
  There is a table with a white cloth, champagne bucket and 
  three glasses upon it. HARRY pushes by. 
 
  TESSA is sitting at the table. TOM is standing in a 
  corner, hands in his pockets. It s all deliberately 
  arranged to unnerve WILDER. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                And you are ... 
 
  TESSA does not smile or offer her hand. TOM stares back. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                I thought we d talk somewhere congenial. 
 
  He gestures towards the table. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                    Good Lord. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Champagne? 
 
  WILDER jerks his head toward TOM. 
 
                                      Why not? 
 
  TOM opening the bottle. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  No doubt you see through all this. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                              You re poisoning me? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                It s a new interrogation technique. To 
              disorientate the subject. What do you think 
                                  of it so far? 
 
  But it is getting to WILDER. 
 
                                        WILDER 
          I am not here for an interrogation. I am here 
                  at my own request. I think I ll go. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 8
 

  WILDER realises that, threateningly, DANNY is standing 
  close behind his shoulder. 
 
                                        TESSA 
          You must realise that you remain a Category A 
                                  security risk. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                          (Straight into her face.) 
                    Oh how I ve missed tough women. 
 
  1-0 to WILDER. TESSA is infuriated. 
 
  TOM has opened the champagne and has poured out three 
  glasses. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
                              Thank you very much. 
 
  Taking the glass WILDER looks up at a CCTV camera in the 
  corner. Trained on the table. He smiles wryly to himself 
  and sips. He closes his eyes with pleasure as the first 
  alcohol for a long time hits him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    (To DANNY.) 
                              Thank you number 9. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Oh. Right. Yeah. 
 
  He turns on his heel and goes to the staircase. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                    You call each other by numbers? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            It s the latest fad. Some youth in an Armani 
                  suit advising the Joint Intelligence 
                                      Committee. 
 
  Smiles. The smiles die. WILDER suddenly looks at TOM, who 
  is stony-faced. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                            I don t want him here. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              He s just a bit of muscle in case you ... 
                                    (To TOM.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 9
 

                  Thank you we can pour from now on. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Yes Sir. 
 
  TOM gives a little bow and turns away. WILDER puts his 
  glass on the table. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            Before we talk seriously, would you mind if 
                    we joined in a moment of prayer? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  You re joking. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                (Ignoring TESSA.) 
                          Will you do the honours? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                    Of course. 
 
  HARRY and WILDER hold their hands together and close 
  their eyes. HARRY gives a daggered glance at TESSA, who - 
  furious at all this - puts her hands together and closes 
  her eyes. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
            Lord of all who sees all, look down this day

                                        Amen. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Thank you for that, Hampton. Now could you 
                possibly tell us why you want to see us? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                      You don t think I m sincere. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  By their fruits ye shall know them.

                            Profound, for a spook.

                                        HARRY 
                    I am beginning to lose patience. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            My trial was a deal with the Government, of 
                course. If I shut up and went down for 
              embezzlement, I wouldn t be prosecuted for 
            treason. But once in what is laughably called 
            the prison  system , I was ... How shall I 
                put this ... Overcome with a wholesome, 
              burning hatred for all the hypocrites who 
                couldn t get enough of me when I was the 
              rising star, and who wouldn t come near me 
                                  when I fell. 
                            So I wrote my memoirs. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                      Very full, very frank memoirs.

                      How were you able to do that? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            Oh everything is possible in prison, number 
                                        ...?

  The stony look from TESSA. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT D) 
                                    (To HARRY.) 
              It s a matter of distributing favours and 
                threats. Very like running a Government 
                                      Department. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          And the memoirs tell ...? 
 
                                        WILDER 
              Everything. Oh the parties, who slept with 
              who and that kind of thing. But at a more 
                        profound level I wrote oh ... 
                                (A casual air.) 
            How I tried to arrange another super gun for 
            Iraq, dealing through a Dutch intermediary 
                                        ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    Another ... 
 
                                        WILDER 
            ... didn t work out. But a lot did. Trade is 
            trade. Backstreet designer trainers, sold off 
          the back of a lorry, uranium-tipped anti-tank 
              missiles sold on the sly to a middle east 
            customer, smuggled out with a legit cargo ... 
            What s the difference? The illegal trade in 
              arms is worth millions for this country. A 
            blind eye is turned in all kinds of corners. 
            And of course my main client was the Royal 
                family of the Confederated Gulf States. 
 
  HARRY is alarmed. It makes him very cool. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      You wrote about Sheik Rasul? 
 
                                        WILDER 
              Oh yes, a friend of Britain in a sea of 
              fundamentalist Islam? He can do no wrong - we 
              sell arms to him officially. All I did was 
              slip him the hard stuff under the counter. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            For a fat commission. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                (Ignores that.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 12
 

                            A great host, you know. 
              In my memoirs I recount ... Rather well I 
              think ... how one beautiful night in the 
                  desert, I corrupted a fellow British 
                  politician into the Sheikh s service. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                                    Ask me who. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Who? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                Richard Maynard. 
 
  It s a bombshell. WILDER savours the moment. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
                Oh yes. He was like an overripe peach, 
                                  falling open. 
                        (A gesture with his hands.) 
                                      Squelch. 
 
                                        TESSA 
          Dick Maynard is one of the most respected men 
                                in Parliament. 
 
                                        WILDER 
              He s the Prime Minister s favourite in the 
            Government certainly, the bosom friend, but 
                respected? Most of his party think he s a 
                                sanctimonious shit. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      This is just vile slander ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Yes thank you Tessa. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                (Turns to TESSA.) 
            Tessa? Tess? Thomas Hardy s heroine? She knew 
                        the world was rotten fruit. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            What exactly did you write about golden boy, 
                                Richard Maynard? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            How he continues my work. How he works hand 
                in glove with the Sheikh s Mr Fixit. A 
              Russian named Sergai Lermov. Ex KGB. Do you                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 13
 

                                    know him? 
 
  They do. They are stony-faced. 
 
  INT. THE GRID - DAY 1. 1152 
 
  TOM is now upstairs with the team. ZOE and DANNY are 
  listening in.

                        Lermov? That bucket of filth? 
 
                                        TOM 
              What was A section s last report on him? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            He got back from a trip to Amsterdam three 
                                    days ago. 
 
  INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK - DAY 1. 1153 
 
  WILDER is enjoying himself. TESSA and HARRY have 
    regrouped. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            If you want revenge, why tell us this? Why 
                                  not publish? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            And be damned? Yes, that was my plan. I am 
            single, I am childless, I have only myself to 
            ruin. So I hid the manuscript. I was to come 
          out of gaol, go abroad, publish it in France, 
            Holland? Make a second fortune in this life. 
                                    (A beat.) 
              But as my sentence wore on I ... Will you 
            understand this? No you won t. Christ began 
                              to work in me ... 
 
  TESSA looks up to the ceiling -  oh spare me this ...  
 
                                WILDER (CONT D) 
            I wrestled with Him. Then, five weeks ago, I 
              let Him into my life. And now I bitterly 
                          repent writing the book. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        Then why didn t you burn it?

                                        WILDER 
                                      I couldn t. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Why not? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            I went to its hiding place but it had gone. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Gone? 
 
                                        WILDER 
          It may come as a surprise to you that prisons 
                            are full of thieves. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Did you report this to the Governor? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                Don t be absurd. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              You could have asked to see us when this 
                                      happened. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            I had to stay on the right side of cons. I 
              couldn t have anything looking like filth 
            near me. Particularly MI5 filth. This is the 
            first opportunity. I am doing my duty. I m 
                asking you to find it and destroy it. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        What you wrote. Is it true? 
 
  There is a moment of watchfulness from WILDER. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                      Oh yes. 
                                (Very serious.) 
            Illegal arms dealing in my day was an almost 
            innocent activity. But now ... Weapons sold 
              by a Cabinet Minister, reaching terrorist 
              groups, being turned back on the country of 
              manufacture? Who could bear the scandal? The 
            Government would fall. And would America ever 
            trust us again? It s for Downing Street to 
            deal with Maynard, privately. Do not let my 
                wretched scribblings wreck my country.

  HARRY is thinking  he s good, he s very good.  
 
                                        HARRY 
              So. Where in the prison did you hide this

                          (Sipping champagne again.) 
                      I have become a keen gardener. 
 
  EXT. INSIDE SIDHAM OPEN PRISON - DAY 1. 1301 
 
  A large rose bed. Police tape is all around it. PRISON 
  OFFICERS are digging up the roses one by one. TOM and 
  DANNY are supervising. 
 
  A rose bush is pulled out of the earth. There is a 
  plastic bag buried beneath it. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                I think we ve ... 
 
  He holds up a plastic bag. 
 
  TOM goes to him, takes the bag. He s wearing gloves. He 
  brushes dirt from the plastic. He opens it and takes out 
  a large slab of dope. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                                  Jesus Christ! 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          That what I think it is? 
 
    A Prisoner with a wheelbarrow sees this, slams his wheel 
  barrow down. 
 
                                      PRISONER 
                              Anyone for a spliff? 
 
  The sound of laughter and shouts throughout the prison. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                              (To two officers.) 
            Miles! Basset! Return all prisoners to rooms. 
 
  The two Prison officers run off towards the buildings.

  ZOE is laying photographs before HARRY. She has a medium 
  file and a very fat file. 
 
    A photograph: WILDER and MAYNARD shaking hands with a 
  robed figure. Smiles all round. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Hampton Wilder and Richard Maynard did go on 
            a visit to the Confederated Gulf States nine 
            years ago. It was a general goodwill business 
            trip, cross party. It sealed the delivery of 
          some British small arms, nothing spectacular. 
                  And there was a night in the desert. 
 
    A photograph. It shows the moment already seen in the 
  tent: MAYNARD shaking hands with the SHEIKH. HARRY peers 
  at it. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
                        Maynard s file. And Wilders. 
 
  She puts the file down on his desk but has not finished. 
  There are three more for WILDER she unloads from a box. 
 
  HARRY stares at the pile with immense weariness. 
 
  She gives him a chit to sign. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
                                  Sign please. 
 
  HARRY signs but looks up when ZOE goes into a spiel by 
  rote. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
            No files are to be left unattended on desks. 
          All files are to be locked away in lockers at 
                the end of the day. Registry is to be 
              informed if files are to be retained more 
                          than twenty-four hours. 
 
  HARRY stares at her. ZOE goes bright red. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
            Sorry, it s the new security clamp down. We 
                  have to ... Say that. To each other. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            (The ghost of a sigh.) 
                                    Yes we do. 
                              (Signing the chit.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 17
 

          You know you are one of the brightest and the 
                                        best. 
 
  ZOE is very embarrassed by this. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        I ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          It can be hard to bear. 
 
  She hesitates, unable to say anything. Then she turns to 
  go. 
 
  EXT. INSIDE SIDHAM OPEN PRISON - DAY 1. 1307 
 
  The rosebed is now fully dug up. DANNY pulls out a cloth 
  from beneath the last rosebush. Unravels it. It contains 
  a ferocious looking hunting knife. 
 
  TOM is getting really browned off. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Officer Blunden. 
 
  The Senior Prison Officer approaches. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                    Another little something for you. 
 
  The Senior Prison Officer takes the knife, both hands, 
  with bad grace. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
              Shouldn t you wear gloves? That s evidence. 
 
  The Senior Prison Officer is embarrassed, he tries to 
  hold the knife by its end, then he takes out a crumpled 
  tissue from his pocket. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                Going to put the roses back now,  Sir ? 
 
  TOM does not even try to hide his anger. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Did you or other Prison Officers know what 
                                was buried here? 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
          It s no big deal, just prison bits and pieces                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 18

                                        TOM 
              This is an area of importance to national 
            security. Special Branch will supervise. Now 
                        I want to see the Governor. 
 
                            SENIOR PRISON OFFICER 
                              (A touch of fear.) 
                                        Right. 
 
  INT. GRID - DAY 1. 1807 
 
  ZOE is going home. She is locking papers in her locker. 
  She turns. TESSA waylays her. Big smile. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  Everything OK? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Fine. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        (Low.) 
              The money from that agent of mine, is it 
                                        safe? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                You mean the agent that doesn t exist? 
 
  ZOE looks around. She is horrified this conversation is 
  happening in the middle of the grid. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        It s a deep operation, Zoe. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Right. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                  Don t interfere with it, that s all. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              The money s safe. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Oh! You haven t spent it yet? 
 
  Smiles again and sweeps off towards the corridor. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 19
 

  ZOE is cowed. She turns for a moment toward HARRY s 
  office but sees that it is empty. She turns and walks 
  hurriedly towards the pods. 
 
  INT. THE GRID - CORRIDOR - DAY 1. 1810 
 
  HARRY and TESSA passing. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Any result from the rose bed? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Dope, five knives, and a collection of 
                pornographic videos. No deadly memoirs. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    That s because they don t exist. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  Why so sure? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    Because Hampton Wilder is a liar. 
 
  HARRY is taken back by her fervour. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  He got under your skin, didn t he. 
 
  TESSA finds her feeling difficult to describe. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                There s a sense of ... evil about him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        (Not taking her seriously.) 
                MI5 doesn t  do  evil. Just treachery, 
                            treason and armageddon. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            The man lies as naturally as the rest of us 
                          breathe. Oh what the hell. 
 
  She turns to go. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          You don t get it Tessa. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    Get what?

                                        HARRY 
                It s not a question of whether Wilder s 
              memoirs are telling the truth about Richard 
              Maynard, or even if they exist. It s about 
              the damage the very idea of them can do. 
                          Scandal works like that. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              Well then Wilder s way ahead. He s got us 
            running around, digging up prison gardens and 
              fingering the Prime Minister s best friend. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              So what do you suggest we do? Ignore the 
            whole thing? We have to check Maynard out. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    (A beat.) 
                              Yes I can see that. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  There s a routine Ministry of Defence 
                briefing tomorrow. I ve moved heaven and 
            earth to get Maynard along. I want you to sit 
                    in, stroke him, see if he meows. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Right. 
 
  HARRY hurries flipping through a swing door. TESSA turns 
  away, a flicker of tension. 
 
  INT. OUTSIDE TOM S FLAT - NIGHT 1. 1924 
 
  TOM arrives home. He s exhausted. He collects himself 
  then opens the door, calling out ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Ellie? 
 
  He slips his coat off. His shirt is smeared with dirt 
  from digging up the rose bushes. 
 
  And MARK HODD walks out of the kitchen. He s fit, shorter 
  than TOM, sun tanned. Gold at his throat. 
 
  TOM makes an involuntary movement as if he s going to hit 
  him. But MAISIE steps from behind MARK. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 21
 

                                        MAISIE 
                              This is my Daddy. 
 
  MARK stares at TOM s dirty shirt. TOM swirls the jacket 
  and puts it back on - a single movement. TOM holds out 
  his hand. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Matthew Archer. 
 
  MARK does not shake hands. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                    Hello Tom. 
 
  MAISIE is standing in the kitchen door. ELLIE is behind 
  her. MARK is patronising. 
 
                                        MARK 
            Oh yeah the man who fiddles with computers. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Right. And you re the oilman ex? Just back 
                                  from the Gulf? 
 
                                        MARK 
                        Glamorous part of the world. 
                            (Over TOM s shoulder.) 
                    You should come out there, Ellie. 
 
  MARK has got right up TOM s nose. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Gushes, oil, doesn t it? Like you gushed 
                              promises to Ellie. 
 
                                        MARK 
                              (Squaring up to TOM.) 
                    Don t do this in front of my kid. 
 
                                        TOM 
            You haven t been  in front of  your kid for 
                                    two years! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                        Maisie go and do a drawing. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                A drawing of what?

  And she skips off into her room. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Cupcake? 
 
  MARK instinctively makes a move to hit TOM who steps 
  back, expertly. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      Don t Mark, he could hurt you!

                                        on. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  Mark just go. 
 
  He waits a moment, then moves to leave. 
 
                                        MARK 
                          I m warning you, chummy. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Thank you very much. 
 
                                        MARK 
                                    (To ELLIE.) 
                                      Ring me? 
 
  ELLIE looks away. MARK looks from one to other. Then he 
  goes. 
 
  EXT. OUTSIDE TOM S FLAT AND STREET - NIGHT 1. 1926 
 
  The furious MARK stumbles out of the door. 
 
  He walks away then has a thought. He turns back and looks 
  at TOM s car. He looks at the number plate. He takes a 
  pen out and scribbles the number on his wrist.

  INT. TOM S FLAT - NIGHT 1. 1932 
 
  TOM and ELLIE are now in the middle of a blazing row. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  But you said your name was Matthew! 
 
                                        TOM 
                      It was a slip of the tongue. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          No. It comes out of what s wrong. Your bloody 
                                        job. 
 
                                        TOM 
          So I lied to him! The man s obviously a jerk. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Oh you make moral judgements about whom you 
          lie to, do you? Well what if you decide I m a 
                                        jerk? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    I love you. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              Oh great! So I know you tell me the truth 
                  because we sleep together. Terrific. 
 
                                        TOM 
          Look ... I hardly know what my name is myself 
                                      sometimes. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          Well boo hoo, poor you. And poor me. And poor 
                                      Maisie. 
 
  She turns away and is weeping. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        I ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Don t say anything. Because ... Right now ... 
                      Anything you say will be wrong. 
 
  She calms herself. She does not turn back to him. She is 
  hanging on to the cold inside her to make her decision. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
              Maisie and I are going to Di s old flat.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 24
 

 
                                        TOM 
                                        Where? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    Di s flat. 
 
                                        TOM 
                You can t leave. You won t be secure. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            If the door s dodgy I ll get a deadlock put 
                                        ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                              (under his breath) 
              No you might not be safe because of me. 
 
  She stares at him. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                Safe? Oh my God. What are you saying? 
 
            TOM is really upset by having to say this. 
 
                                        TOM 
              In the service dependents can be at risk. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Risk? 
 
                                        TOM 
                      I m talking generally, I ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          What do you mean, once someone s lived with a 
          spy they can t leave, for reasons of national 
                                      security? 
 
                                        TOM 
              There is a risk. It s real. It s why the 
                  service doesn t like mixed affairs. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
            MI5 Officers sleeping with ... Real people. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Oh they want you to sleep with each other!                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 25
 

                Well you d better go and get yourself a 
                little Mata Hari the job approves of. 
               Dependents at risk,   mixed affairs . Don t 
            you realise how horrible these things sound? 
 
  He can t go on before her hostile stare. He knows he s 
  blown it. She leaves his POV. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT'D) 
                I can t be part of your world, I can t. 
                  Maisie and I will move our things. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              This is so unfair. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      Do you mean to me, or to you? 
 
  He closes his eyes. 
 
  EXT. STREET - NIGHT 2. 1935 (FORMERLY SCENE 56) 
 
  MARK HODD rings a number on his mobile phone, walking 
  along. 
 
                                        MARK 
            Brian. It s Mark Hodd. ... Yeah! Back in the 
            land of the living ... Listen Brian, I want 
            to pull a favour off you. A number ... You 
              are brilliant. It s a Vauhall Vectra, the 
                                  number s ... 
 
  He looks at his wrist. 
 
  INT. THE GRID - DAY 2. 0959 
 
  HARRY is making his way toward the pods. He calls out. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Tessa! 
 
  ZOE watches TESSA hurry to the pods. 
 
  RICHARD MAYNARD comes through. Departmental officials, 
  two women and two men, are behind him. 
 
  ZOE watches HARRY and TESSA as introductions are made. 
  She gets up and goes. 
 
  Over to the Ministerial group. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 26
 

                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                        And this is Tessa Phillips. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                      How do you do, Miss Phillips. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Very well, thank you Minister. 
 
  Obviously they ve not met. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            Well Harry, haven t been briefed in the holy 
                              of holies before. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Surely you ve been to Thames House? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              Never. Just looks like an office. I s pose 
                      it s all in the mind, secrecy. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    Absolutely. Minister, shall we ... 
 
  INT. GRID - MEETING ROOM - DAY 2. 1003 
 
  The Ministry of Defence delegation in the meeting room, 
  settling down. HARRY is there. ZOE is busying herself 
  with notes at the top of the table. There is a slide 
    projector. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            This is a briefing about the illegal sale of 
                battlefield weapons out of this country. 
            We re very eager to have interdepartmental 
                input on this, so I d like to thank the 
            Minister for being here. Now I would like all 
              of us to look at this man. Sergai Lermov. 
 
  To MAYNARD. Not a flicker on his face. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
            Ex Cultural Attache at the Russian Embassy. 
                                That is ex-KGB. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Yes, where are all the old comrades now eh? 
 
  A rustle of amusement. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 27
 

                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
            Well some of them like Mr Lermov have become 
            powerful men. He has moved around the world, 
              but at present is resident in London. He 
            works for a charity called Hope for Chechnya. 
            Which is trying to get food and medicine to 
          that wretched part of the planet ... no doubt 
                  wrapped up in the odd rocket grenade 
                                      launcher. 
 
  He flicks through, fast, without comment, a slew of 
  appalling scenes of destruction and suffering in Grozny. 
  Back to LERMOV s face. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                Forgive that. But sometimes you have to 
            remind yourself of the reality you re dealing 
                                        with. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                      (Glance at HARRY, gets a nod.) 
            Mr. Lermov is not only an arms dealer, but 
                    also a spy. We have had him under 
              surveillance for some months. We believe he 
                is feeding information about Chechnyan 
                  contacts back to the Sluzhba Vneshney 
              Razvedki. SVR, Russian Foreign Intelligence 
                                      Service. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Old secret policemen never die, they simply 
                            change their acronyms. 
 
  A rustle of uneasy of laughter. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                What s this man s immigration status? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    Oh we can throw him out anytime. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                  Why don t we? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Because he is also a middle man for a gun 
              running cartel. Run out of the Middle East, 
            the Confederated Gulf States. A country we 
                              are friendly with.

                                      MAYNARD 
                                      Indeed. 
 
  No sign of a crack in MAYNARD at all. HARRY clicks off 
  the image on the screen. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            What we need Minister is to liaise closely. 
                It would help us greatly if you could 
              authorise a thorough audit of all weapons 
                                      stocks. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                Massive task ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
            We suspect weapons have been stolen and sold 
                          abroad through this man. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          Dear God. Of course we will co-operate fully. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Thank you. Well, that concludes things. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            Then on behalf of my colleagues I must thank 
                you for this briefing, so reassuringly 
                                      alarming. 
 
  Polite laughter. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        Thank you again, Minister. 
 
  Meeting breaking up. MAYNARD, confidentially to HARRY. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              I think I met him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    You met ...

  INT. THE GRID - DAY 2. 1008 
 
  They have come out of the meeting room.

              Lermov. On a trip a few years ago. Unsavory                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 29
 

              bastard I thought. I told MI6 of course. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Of course. 
 
  HARRY smiles. MAYNARD s comments seem wholly innocent. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Would you like a personal tour of the more 
                    sensitive areas of Thames House? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          That would be exciting. 
 
  ZOE has reached her station. She looks back, eyes on 
  TESSA who is shaking hands with the officials. 
 
  TESSA and MAYNARD make for the double doors leading to 
  the corridor.

  INT. THAMES HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY 2. 1010 
 
  TESSA and MAYNARD walking. A polite, conversational tone. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              There are cameras. 
 
  MAYNARD looks about. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        Where? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                Tiny, state of the art. See? It s a new 
              security drive. Since the war on terrorism 
                began there s been much more money for 
                                      everything. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                      (Neutral.) 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              It s not perfect. There s a dead spot just 
                              beyond these doors. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                      (Lightly.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 30
 

                                  Dear oh dear. 
 
  They are going through the doors ... 
 
    CONTINUOUS 
 
  INT. THAMES HOUSE - BEYOND CORRIDOR DOORS - DAY 2. 1011 
 
  The doors flip shut. 
 
  TESSA turns to MAYNARD, urgently. They are very close 
  together. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                            They re out to get you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              What do you mean? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        I can t tell you here. We... 
 
  They are looking at each other. 
 
                                  TESSA (cont d) 
              Oh god Dick, what are you involved with? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                        (not taking her seriously) 
                                Well. With you. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Yes. 
 
  She presses into him, kissing him passionately. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              I don t think so... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                      I do... 
 
  She pulls at his clothes. 
 
  He responds, his hands running down her back and her 
  buttocks. 
 
  He pulls her skirt up from behind. She fumbles with his 
  flies. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 31
 

  They pull at each other s clothes. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                Someone will ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  Don t care ... 
 
  They almost fall over. 
 
  MAYNARD, breathless. 
 
  She cries out. 
 
  And as their lovemaking climaxes through the glass of the 
  swing doors we see a man is walking down the corridor at 
  speed, files under his arm, head down. 
 
  The doors bang open. TESSA and MAYNARD freeze, holding 
  each other, trying hard not to breathe. 
 
  And the man doesn t see them in the corner. He hurries 
  past mumbling to himself, head down, and goes down stairs 
  fast. 
 
  TESSA and MAYNARD look at each other. 
 
  TESSA laughs, high on the danger, the risk, the 
    absurdity. Then MAYNARD pushes her away, pulling at his 
  clothes. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                      You re completely mad, Tessa. 
 
  TESSA, loving the madness. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Yes, but a bonk in the MI5 building, that s 
                      got to be worth some airmiles. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                            For godsake let s ... 
 
  MAYNARD steps back and is putting his clothes to right. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    We ve got to talk somewhere safe. 
 
  EXT. KENSINGTON PARK - OUTSIDE THE ORANGERY - DAY 2. 1649

  TESSA and MAYNARD are talking. She wears a head-scarf and 
  dark glasses. They are tense. Behind them the lights from 
  within The Orangery are beginning to shine as the light 
  fades. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I have been whizzing round the tube system in 
            and out of three stations. I have caught two 
              buses and had two purposeless taxi rides. 
            Sorry if I sound a prick but I am a minister 
            of the crown y know, I do have better things 
                                      to do. 
 
  MAYNARD stares at her. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              (Machine gun speed.) 
            Are you taking kickbacks from illegal arms 
                              sales in the gulf? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Dick, they re going to crawl all over you. 
                  How well do you know Sergai Lermov? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I told Harry. I met him once. What is this, 
                          where s this coming from? 
 
                                        TESSA 
              Hampton Wilder came to see us the moment he 
                                  was released. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              Hampton Wilder? You believe what that ... 
                          You ve got to be joking. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            You ve got a lot of enemies. Now please. Tell 
              me: are you involved in any kind of deal? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                    Do you for a moment believe ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Believe you re a lying, unpatriotic bastard? 
              I don t know. You can cheat on your wife 
                  maybe you can cheat on your country.

                                      MAYNARD 
                        Oh God, dear God Tessa ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
              I ll help you. But you ve got to tell me. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          There is nothing to tell! 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                Think about it. 
 
  She kisses him tenderly on the cheek and walks away. 
 
  Stay with MAYNARD. He looks one way then another. The 
  nightmare has begun for him. 
 
  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - DAY 2. 1750 
 
  ZOE has had a shower and is in a bathrobe. Wet hair. Her 
  clothes are thrown about the living room in her very own 
  messy style. 
 
  She is very upset, sitting on the floor against a sofa, 
  knees up to her chin, hugging herself. A flicker of her 
  eyes. She looks at the door of Danny s room. It has a 
  notice on it:  Danny s Room  ... With a nuclear warning 
  sign. 
 
  She raises a glass of Vodka - Polish peaty coloured 
  Vodka, the best - and sips it. 
 
  EXT. STREET - DAY 2. 1751 (FORMERLY SCENE 65) 
 
  A lot of traffic. Some passersby. 
 
  MARK is walking along. His mobile rings. 
 
                                        MARK 
              Oh Brian yeah ... What you got ... What s 
                            listed mean ... What? 
 
  Two men are behind him listening to this. One nods to the 
  other. They turn a corner. 
 
                                      1ST MAN 
                                    Mr. Hodd? 
 
  MARK turns. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 34
 

                                        MARK 
                                    You what? 
 
                                      1ST MAN 
                                  Mr. Mark Hodd? 
 
                                        MARK 
                                      Yeah ... 
 
                                      2ND MAN 
            Good evening sir. Could we have a word with 
                                        you? 
 
                                        MARK 
                                    What about? 
 
                                      1ST MAN 
                      The phone call you just made. 
 
  MARK is stunned. He steps back. They close on him. 
 
                                      2ND MAN 
            Now you re not going to be stupid are you? 
 
  MARK s frightened face. 
 
  INT. SMALL INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 2. 1759 (FORMERLY SC 66) 
 
  MARK is sitting at the table. There is no window, and no 
  tape machine. The two men are standing by the door. 
 
                                        MARK 
                              I want my solicitor. 
 
                                      2ND MAN 
                              Don t be a wuzza. 
 
  DANNY comes into the room. The two men go out. DANNY has 
  a file. 
 
                                        MARK 
                                    What is ... 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Earlier you made a phone call to a Sergeant 
            Brian Malhorn at Metropolitan Central. You 
            asked him to do you a favour - to trace the 
                                car of this man. 
 
  He puts a picture of TOM on the table. MARK is terrified. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 35
 

                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
            Sergeant Malhorn has been suspended from duty 
              and, at this moment in time, is having a 
                nasty experience with Special Branch. 
 
                                        MARK 
                              You can t do this. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            We can t do everything we want with you, but 
                          we can do a great deal. 
 
  MARK goes to pieces. 
 
                                        MARK 
                          Sorry ... I think I ... 
 
  DANNY withdraws the photograph, puts it in the file, 
  stands and leaves the room. 
 
  MARK seen from high up. 
 
  EXT. RUSKIN PARK - NIGHT 2. 1805 
 
  A South London park. There is a bandstand, a pond nearly. 
  Rising ground. 
 
  TOM is walking to a bench. He sits. A DERELICT MAN - 
  street sleeper in a filthy state - is sitting at the end 
  of the bench. 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
                            (Not looking at TOM.) 
                                  That s Lermov. 
 
  Last seen he was in Arab clothes. Now he is a dapper man 
  in a fine coat. He is throwing bread to ducks on the 
  pond. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Where is it? 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
                              (Middle-class accent.) 
                      Back of the Bowling Green Hut. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Tell all of Section A to clear the area. 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
            Took us months to find this drop, don t blow                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 36
 

                                    it for us. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Higher thinking. Sorry. 
 
                                  DERELICT MAN 
                    Ah well, when the gods command. 
 
  TOM stands and walks away. 
 
  A moment later, behind him, the DERELICT MAN stands and 
  shuffles away. 
 
  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - NIGHT 2. 1811 
 
  DANNY comes in the front door. He sees ZOE s mess. He is 
  not amused. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Oh no Zoe, please. 
 
  He notices the vodka. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                              What you drinking? 
 
  She looks back, mischievously. 
 
  He goes to his door. He feels for something at the top of 
  the door. Finds it. A sliver of matchwood. He looks at 
  ZOE who stares back. 
 
  The game between them is on! 
 
  INT. RUSKIN PARK - NIGHT 2. 1812 
 
  SERGAI LERMOV moves expertly through the twilight. He 
  stops. Tuts. Dog mess on his shoe? No, an excuse to bend 
  down and look around. He sees no one. 
 
  He walks briskly through a gap in a hedge. A bowling 
  green. It is derelict. The hut is boarded up. 
 
  He goes behind it. There are bushes. It is well 
    concealed. There is a chalk mark, a quarter of an inch 
  long, up under the eves. He bends down. There is a small 
  drain. He lifts it. He takes out a matchbox sized packet, 
  wrapped in polythene. 
 
  TOM comes out of the bushes behind him.

                                        TOM 
            Feel like the old KGB days, does it Sergai? 
 
  LERMOV swings round, a small automatic pistol in his 
  hand. TOM smashes the side of his hand between LERMOV s 
  nose and upper lip. LERMOV collapses, dropping the 
  pistol, his nervous system momentarily paralysed, his 
  eyes streaming, saliva pouring out of his mouth. 
 
  TOM leans over him, speaking fast. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
            We are not lifting you, do you understand? 
                              This is not a lift. 
 
  INT. DANNY S ROOM - NIGHT 2. 1814 
 
  The door opens. DANNY takes out a little torch and shines 
  it at the light switch. 
 
  CLOSE UP(VERY CLOSE): 
 
  On the switch there is a very finely cut slither of 
    cellotape. DANNY s finger throws the switch. The 
  cellotape tears. 
 
  With the light now on he looks around the room. 
 
  He goes on all fours and crawls to an area of carpet near 
  a low chest of drawers. He looks carefully at the carpet. 
 
  CLOSE UP AT FLOOR LEVEL: 
 
  There is a dust of very fine powder over the pale blue 
  carpet. DANNY puts his hand in it. It leaves a faint but 
  clear imprint. But the powder is undisturbed; no one has 
  walked there. 
 
  He straightens up and walks on his knees to a chest of 
  drawers. He examines the edge of the top drawer. 
 
  CLOSE UP (ALMOST MICROSCOPIC): 
 
  There is a human hair along the divide between drawer and 
  the side of the chest. 
 
  DANNY frowns. 
 
  He opens the drawer. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 38
 

  All is neat inside. A men s magazine has been thrown 
  casually over folded clothes. He looks carefully at the 
  distances of the edge of the magazine compared to the 
  pattern of a pullover. 
 
  Again nothing seems to have been disturbed. 
 
  He reaches to the bottom of the drawer and takes out an 
    apparently unopened bottle of dark Polish Vodka. He peers 
  at the seal. 
 
  CLOSE UP (AGAIN ALMOST MICROSCOPIC): 
 
  The seal is unbroken. He picks at it with his thumbnail. 
  He smiles, stands. 
 
  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - NIGHT 2. 1816 
 
  DANNY comes in waving the bottle of Polish Vodka. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Want a real drink? 
 
  She watches him. He opens the vodka and drinks a slug 
  straight out of the bottle. He spews it out with disgust. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                                  What is that! 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    Cold tea. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        You cow. You absolute cow. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              Twenty quid to me. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              My Polish vodka! I was saving that for a 
                          serious night of nookie. 
 
  ZOE puts her hand out. DANNY takes a twenty pound note 
  out of his pocket and throws it on the floor in front 
  her. She picks it up. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                Lovely bit of work on the sealed top. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 39
 

                                        ZOE 
                        Why thank you kindly, Sir. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                There any left? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                In the tea pot. 
 
  DANNY looks at the teapot on the table. 
 
  EXT. RUSKIN PARK - NIGHT 2. 1817 
 
  On the park bench. LERMOV has a slight, smoothed out 
  accent. His English is precise. 
 
  TOM has the polythene package in his hand. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Instructions from Moscow? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
              It will tell you nothing, it s a deadlock 
                                        code. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Doesn t matter, now that you re a useless 
                                        asset. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                              Is that what I am? 
 
  TOM pockets the package. 
 
  A sharp look from LERMOV. 
 
                                LERMOV (CONT'D) 
                                You re not MI6. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Why not? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            You have bad manners. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Never mind the messenger, hear the message. 
                                  You are blown. 
 
  Now LERMOV s glance is sly. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 40
 

                                        LERMOV 
                                    You are  5? 
 
                                        TOM 
                    You have been blown for months. 
 
  LERMOV is relaxed. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            Confident, aren t you? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Very much so. 
 
  LERMOV boils inside at what he sees as a smug little 
    Englishman from a puny organisation. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Listen to me, little dog pup. You think you 
            are safe because you have the powers of the 
            state behind you. But a state can disappear 
                                    like that! 
                                (Clicks fingers.) 
                I saw it happen. I was a servant of the 
                Soviet Union and suddenly ... Freefall. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Cold War. We won, you lost. 
 
  LERMOV scoffs. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Yes. But personally, the fall of the Soviet 
            Union was a rebirth. All the communism washed 
                off me and I was born anew. Capable of 
                                  amazing things. 
 
                                        TOM 
          You think capitalism has turned you into some 
                              kind of superman? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
          It is true that now that I make my own way in 
                  the world, I am much more powerful. 
 
                                        TOM 
              I could change my mind and have you in an 
            Immigration Detention Centre within the hour. 
              Or be more unofficial, summon friends now 
                            lurking in the bushes? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 41
 

  TOM turns and looks at him. The physical threat from TOM 
  hangs in the air. LERMOV shrugs and decides to trade. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                              What is it you want? 
 
                                        TOM 
                Oh ... Your contact in the Ministry of 
              Defence? Helping you with illegal weapons 
                                    procurement? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                He went to gaol. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          But he has a successor. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            Really? Introduce me. 
 
  TOM, intimately. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Sergai, we won t touch you. You re a window 
            through which we can see the filthy world you 
            live in. But you must ... Keep open. We own 
                                you now, Sergai. 
 
  A beat. LERMOV laughs. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            You use my Christening name, that is rude. 
                    You are a cocky little dog pup. 
                                (Anger in him.) 
            I have more powerful friends than you who are 
                                  not so rude. 
 
  TOM turns and calls out. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Good evening, Bill. 
 
  The DERELICT MAN walks out of the bushes and strands 
  behind the bench. He stands at full height - a formidable 
  figure. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            Like the good old days. The name you want is 
                                Richard Maynard. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 42
 

  They stand still for a moment. Then TOM stands and walks 
  away, his back to LERMOV, who remains seated. The man 
  follows TOM then peals away. On TOM s face: worry, his 
  eyes flickering. 
 
  INT. PRIVATE DRINKING CLUB - NIGHT 2. 1903 
 
  JOOLS is having a quiet drink in a small private drinking 
  club which is run by six. 
  The bar is tiny. Like a glittering little cave of bottles 
  and framed photographs, all of chorus and showgirls, some 
  from the 20s. 
 
  A large doorman comes down poky stairs - big man, 
  stooping, obviously heavy muscle - and speaks quietly. 
 
                                      DOORMAN 
                              A Mr Lermov up top. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Yes thank you Gabriel. He s a guest, please 
          show him down. And make sure anyone else goes 
                              to the upper bar. 
 
                                      DOORMAN 
                                      Yes Sir. 
 
  JOOLS sips a drink, looks at his hair and adjusts his tie 
  in the mirror behind the bar. 
 
  A grim, furious LERMOV comes down the stairs. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Sergai. I m having a drink before the opera 
          but do join me. Help yourself we don t have a 
                                barman down here. 
 
  LERMOV crashes behind the tiny bar. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                          Call off those imbeciles. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                        You ll have to be precise. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            You are MI6, I deal with the real toffs. Not 
                                        MI5. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Oh those imbeciles. What have they been doing                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 43
 

                                      to you? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
              Giving me threats. Wanting to own me. Me! 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            You seem to have every security service in 
              the world claiming they run you. Maybe we 
              should all have a special tie. The  I Ran 
                              Sergai Lermov Club.  
 
                                        LERMOV 
                      Are you taking me seriously? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Oh I ll always take you seriously Sergai. 
            Remember the first time we met? Moscow, the 
              dead boy in the Hotel Ukraine? I saved you 
                  from your masters over that affair. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                  We go back. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                We certainly do. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                        What did the children want? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                      A name. 
 
  LERMOV drinks deep and puts the glass down, panting. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            They do seem to have rattled you. Well don t 
              pricktease, you Russian baboon. What name? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
              They asked if I had dealings with Richard 
                                      Maynard. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                  Did they now. 
 
  A touch of glee from JOOLS as he sips his drink. 
 
  INT. THAMES HOUSE - HARRY S OFFICE - NIGHT 2. 1934 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 44
 

  HARRY and an agitated TOM. 
 
                                        TOM 
              I admired Maynard. I thought he was a good 
                                        man. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    He is. Lermov is probably lying. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            To mess us up. That s what spooks do to each 
            other, it s in our nature whatever side we re 
                                        on. 
 
                                        TOM 
                But there s a huge question mark there, 
              Harry. Get Special Branch to pull Maynard, 
                          give him a good squeeze. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              That s not wanted. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Not ... 
 
  HARRY looks at him. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
                              Oh. Downing Street? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              They want a ring of steel around Maynard s 
              reputation. They don t want him destroyed. 
                Because he s the favourite, he has many 
                        enemies. People are jealous. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Is it up to MI5 to protect a politician from 
                                    embarrassment? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                The allegations against him are highly 
            contaminated. Memoirs that may not exist, the 
                word of a slime ball double agent ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Is Maynard clean? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 45
 

                                        HARRY 
              We ve never had anything concrete on him. 
 
                                        TOM 
            So where s the threat to National Security? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              If Maynard goes down in a scandal about 
              illegal arms, it could open the floodgates 
          for all kinds of things. The Government could 
                                      collapse. 
 
                                        TOM 
                We re crossing a line here. We re not 
                protecting the country we re protecting a 
                                political party! 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              There is no line. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Is that official? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    As far as you re concerned, yes. 
 
  TOM is angry. But HARRY stills him. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
              But we find out everything. Knowledge is 
                                        power. 
 
  A beat. They are staring at each other. HARRY - enjoying 
  TOM s heat - grins a little. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                            There something else? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Lermov said he had  powerful friends.  I got 
                  the impression he s being protected. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Who by? 
 
  They look at each other. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      Oh God.

  INT. ROYAL OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 2. 1940 
 
  Tight on JOOLS SIVITER. 
 
  Straight to his face. His cheeks are stained with tears 
  as Wotan sings his Act II monologue. 
 
  He takes a vibrating mobile out. He begins to text 
  message. a WOMAN leans into view. 
 
                                        WOMAN 
                  Do you mind awfully not doing that? 
 
  JOOLS leans into her ear and speaks low. Sound tight on 
  his words. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            Madam are you a Nazi? 
 
                                        WOMAN 
                              I beg your pardon? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I mean we Wagner fans are a pretty rum lot. I 
            myself bugger skinheads so kindly don t tell 
                        me what I can or cannot do. 
 
  He calmly continues to text message. The WOMAN stares 
  ahead in shock. 
 
  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - NIGHT 2. 1941 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are drinking, sitting side by side on the 
  floor backs against the sofa. He is pouring from the 
  teapot. 
 
  It s clear they have been drinking for an hour or so. Not 
  slurred but bumpy conversation. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    So why are. You getting pissed? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Why? Are you? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Unlucky in love.

                                        ZOE 
                                        Ah. 
 
  He looks at his watch and sighs. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Stupid. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Very stupid. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                              Danny. I m scared. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        I ... 
              (Her breathing is shallow. She swallows.) 
              I don t know whether to tell. Or not. They 
                should give us training. How to decide 
                        decisions when you re drunk. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            A pissed spooks course. I ll drink to that. 
 
  Raising his glass.

                    Tessa is running phantom agents. 
 
  DANNY stares at her, galvanised.

                                How do you know? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                I went to meet one. And she turned up 
                              instead. And told me. 
 
  DANNY puts his drink down.

  Looks at his watch.

  EXT. OUTSIDE COVENT GARDEN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 2. 2011 
 
  JOOLS approaches TOM and HARRY. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Gentlemen thank you so much for coming out 
            here it s Die Walkure you know, been waiting 
                              for this all year. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Was it worth it? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                        You re not Wagner are you. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Isn t it the most repugnant music ever 
                                      written? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            (Not at all put out.) 
              It is a bit of a closet thing these days 
            people can t handle the dark side. Anyway Act 
            Three kicks off in twenty minutes so what can 
                                  I do for you? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Have you turned an SVR agent called Sergai 
                                      Lermov? 
 
  JOOLS is in very good humour. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Sergai, yes, terrific agent. Course we 
              noticed your Section A s been all over him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              You noticed we ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Don t get on your high horse Harry this isn t 
                for once a turf war. We like you people 
                  tailing him it gives him credibility. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 49
 

  He laughs. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  We ve had to have a word with him. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                  May I ask why? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            We think he s trying to smear a Government 
                                      Minister. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Oh Lermov will say anything about anyone it s 
              part of his charm. I assume we re talking 
                      about the Dick Maynard thing. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          Jools what is going on? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Oh alright I ll send them over in the 
                                      morning. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Send what over? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Hampton Wilder s memoirs. They re what you re 
                              salivating for, no? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    They exist? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Course they exist, we dug them up soon as he 
                  put them in the prison s rose bed. 
                                      (Laughs.) 
            You re really not on top of this one are you. 
              No we put an agent into the prison as an 
                        inmate. Just to keep an eye. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                MI6 had an agent inside the prison ... 
 
  He can hardly retain his wrath. 
 
                                        TOM 
          What do you have on Dick Maynard? Do you have 
              any trace that he and Lermov did business                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 50
 

                                      together? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                          Not outside the memoirs. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        So it s a straight slander. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                              It looks that way. 
 
  He takes a breath and expels air slowly before replying. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              Alright I ll tell you. It was Dick Maynard 
          who shopped Hampton Wilder to us. Without him 
            blowing the whistle, Wilder would never have 
                              been brought down. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      So this is straight revenge. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          The trouble with whistle blowers is they play 
                                their own tune. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            You distrust Maynard? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          To my mind there s an ambiguity there. Do you 
                              do ambiguity, Tom? 
 
  TOM refuses to rise to the bait. 
 
                                        TOM 
          No. In the end, a thing s a lie or it s true. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                    What an admirable point of view. 
 
  JOOLS looks at TOM for a moment - quizzical, alert. Then 
  he s back into the persona. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT'D)

  And he s gone. 
 
  TOM and HARRY look at each other. They are deeply 
  suspicious. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      Why is he being so nice to us?

  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - NIGHT 2. 2020 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are drinking coffee. He is now in a 
  bathrobe. Their heads are close together. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  So Tessa s been taking you into her 
                                      confidence? 
 
  ZOE nods. 
 
  ZOE is overwhelmed with relief at being able to tell 
  someone. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            She ... Gave me money. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            You mean the ten grand next door, behind the 
                                  plug socket? 
 
  She s startled. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
            Yeah I was giving your room a sweep, part o  
                                  the game ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    I don t want to play that anymore. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                            So what s Harry say? 
 
                                        ZOE

                                        DANNY

                                        ZOE 
              I mean, what if it s a real op that Tessa s 
                                      running? 
 
                                        DANNY 
          That involves giving you ten grand? She s got 
                                to be bent, Zoe. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          It s just that Tessa ... 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        What? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            She was what I wanted to be. I thought she 
                        was fantastic. I still do. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        Zoe she s eating you alive. 
 
              Go to Harry, first thing in the morning. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        I ... 
 
                                        DANNY 
              You ve laid this on me. Now I m involved. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              It s my problem ... 
 
  DANNY is angry. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          I ve got to keep squeaky clean with Harry. He 
            said I could be one of the brightest and the 
                                        best. 
 
  He stands. He goes to the tea pot, pours, there s nothing 
  in it. He slams it down. The handle comes away. He looks 
  at it in his hand. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          He said that to me too. 
 
  They look at each other. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 53
 

                                        DANNY 
                      Then we re both great spooks. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Think so? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            You are, you got at my vodka. Zoe ... don t 
                let Tessa mash you up. You re too ... 
 
  He can t say it ...  precious ... beautiful.  A flash of 
  sexuality between them. She puts her hand out, he takes 
  it. 
 
  The door bell rings. 
 
  Their lips are almost touching. 
 
  The doorbell again. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Go. 
 
  ZOE pulls her robe tight around her. DANNY goes to the 
  door. He looks through a spy hole. He turns to look at 
  ZOE. 
 
  She is struggling to stand. 
 
  He opens the door. 
 
  ZOE falls over the sofa on her face, behind in the air, 
  robe rucked up the back of her legs. 
 
  A young Japanese woman - ANNETTE - is standing at the 
  door. She is well dressed and carries a small overnight 
  case. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                          I ve decided to say yes. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Ah. Great. 
 
  ANNETTE sweeps into the room, very confident. She looks 
  at the sprawled ZOE, who stands unsteadily. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
            You must be Sally. Celestine told me about 
                                        you.

                                      Did he. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                            So what is going on?

                                  What was it?

                                  (Big smile.) 
              Street urchin? Don t worry, we can get you 
                              another pussy cat. 
                                    (To DANNY.) 
                            Where s the rest room? 
 
  Indicates the door. ANNETTE sweeps towards it closing the 
  door. 
 
  ZOE and DANNY talk fast and low. 
 
                                        ZOE

  LERMOV is pulling at his pocket, but the YOUNG MAN is 
  close. The flash of a thin bladed knife. The YOUNG MAN 
  whispers into the dying LERMOV s ear. 
 
                                      YOUNG MAN

  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - DANNY S ROOM - NIGHT 2. 2340 
 
  DANNY and ANNETTE are sleeping in each others  arms. His 
  mobile rings. 
 
  DANNY reaches out for it. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Unh. Unh. 
 
  He puts the phone down. ANNETTE stirs. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                                        Unh? 
 
  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - ZOE S ROOM - NIGHT 2. 2341 
 
  ZOE asleep. Her mobile rings. She lifts it. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Unh. 
 
  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - DANNY S ROOM - NIGHT 2. 2343 
 
  ANNETTE wakes. She sees that DANNY is not in bed. She 
  gets up, pulling the duvet around her. 
 
  She goes into the living room. 
 
  DANNY and ZOE have got dressed, though DANNY is still 
  tucking his shirt in his trousers. They have been 
  talking, facing each other. Their heads turn sharply to 
  look at ANNETTE. DANNY looks down - zips up his trousers. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                                What s going on? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          I ve got to go into work. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                        In the middle of the night?

                                        DANNY 
                It s a crisis on the Singapore market. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                        Sally why are you dressed? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            Early office cleaning. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                                        Ah. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      You go back to bed, love ... 
 
  He tries to kiss her. She holds her hands up. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                  Maybe I will, maybe I won t.  Love.  
 
  She looks daggers at them both. She turns to go back to 
  the bedroom. 
 
  And ZOE looks daggers at DANNY.

  HARRY is in a very worried, tough mood. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    No. This is not for lower ranks.

  HARRY points at the telephone. TOM, getting the point 
  that this is very serious, lifts it.

  INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 2. 2347 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are arguing in desperate whispers. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          We can t leave her here. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  We ve got to. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Danny there are bills, stuff with our real 
                      names on all over the flat ... 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              She won t notice. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              It s terrible tradecraft. Throw her out. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                But I like her. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        Then throw her out nicely. 
 
  DANNY s phone rings. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Yeah. Oh Rodney ... 
                                    (A beat.) 
                                        Right. 
 
  Off the phone. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                                    It s off. 
 
  ANNETTE comes into the room. She is dressed and carrying 
  her overnight bag. 
  She stands looking at them. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 61

                                      ANNETTE 
                        What happened to Singapore?

                                  It went away. 
 
  ZOE turns towards her door, in a filthy temper. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                          What about the cleaning? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              It s not that dirty. 
 
  She goes into her room, slamming the door. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Don t go. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
            You want to sleep with her and with me? You 
                                    are insane. 
 
  She goes, slamming the front door. 
 
  DANNY alone. He slams a fist into his palm. 
 
  ZOE s door opens slowly. She leans against the door post, 
  looking at him. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        I just want a normal life. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Yeah, I know. 
 
  She slides back into her room, closing the door softly.

              Knifed by a bit of rough? I thought Lermov 
                              was more of a pro. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            He had a weakness for a fumble in the dark. 
            How many hardened professionals have we seen 
            destroyed by that? Tom ... You thinking what                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 62

              So maybe Maynard s got a Guardian Angel. 
                                      (Standing.)

                      The pod has stopped someone. 
 
  HARRY types in a code on the pad. The pod opens. A 
  furious JOOLS SIVITER shoots out. 
 
  JED struggles to suppress laughter. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                  What is this, some kind of infantile 
                                  practical joke?

                            Thank you Tessa, Jed. 
 
  TESSA steps back at this exclusion. TOM too, though, has 
  found JOOLS  accident funny. He tries to suppress it. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Jolly japes in the playground is it Tom? I

                                        JOOLS 
              There is someone in this building who is 
              seriously disloyal. We could be looking out 
                              at him or her now. 
 
  HARRY stands, goes to the window of his office looking 
  out over the grid. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              That is a very serious allegation against 
                              your sister service. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            My  sister  should be bent over and given a 
                          good whack on her behind. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        I don t find that helpful. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          You get an excellent asset of mine killed and 
                                  you want HELP? 
 
  JOOLS and HARRY are squaring up to each other. For a 
  moment TOM thinks they are going to hit each other. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
            Oh well, suffer the little children to come 
            unto the senior service. I suppose you want 
                    to read Hampton Wilder s memoirs. 
 
  HARRY knows JOOLS is up to something. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          That would be ... Useful. 
 
  To TOM and HARRY s alarm JOOLS undoes his jacket and 
  begins to undo his trousers. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I don t know if I can entrust such sensitive 
            material to this organisation but I am taking 
            pity. I suppose we are after all on the same 
                                        side. 
 
  He has a security pouch across his thigh. There is a 
  glimpse of silk underwear. He takes out a photocopied 
  manuscript. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              Needless to say I expect your registry to                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 64
 

                            monitor all readings. 
 
  He hands the manuscript to HARRY. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Thank you. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                      (Putting his clothes to rights.) 
            It s been a very long night. The death of an 
              agent and one of the worst productions of 
                Wagner I have ever seen. Dear God, the 
            Valkyrie were all wearing scuba gear! So good 
                                  night to you. 
 
  He goes. HARRY looks at the manuscript in his hand. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              He s setting us up. I know it in my water.

                                    (A beat.) 
            We ll read this in the morning. And you ll 
                    interview Maynard. Go at him hard.

              He s a minister, we ll need Downing Street

  EXT. OUTSIDE ELMWOOD TUBE STATION - DAY 3. 0827 
 
  TOM watches MAYNARD who is now looking around bad-
  temperedly. He turns to go back into the tube. 
 
  TOM dodges traffic across the road. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  Hey Dick I saw you across the road.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 3. 0846 
 
  TOM and RICHARD MAYNARD are walking down a country road 
  (it leads to the Siegfried Sassoon estate, now occupied                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 67
 

  by Middlesex University.) 
 
  MAYNARD is talking too much because he s nervous. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              The wonders of the end of the Piccadilly 
            Line, eh? You come out of a tube station and 
                        you re ... Sort of nowhere. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Let s go in that field. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                  (Scared now.) 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
              So I can put a bullet in the back of your 
                                neck, why else? 
 
  CLOSE UP: MAYNARD laughs but he is very, very tense. 
 
  INT. THAMES HOUSE - THE GRID -DAY 3. 0847 
 
    Everyone s laughing: an hysteria has gripped the readers 
  of the memoirs. 
 
  EXT. FIELD - DAY 3. 0850 
 
  TOM and MAYNARD are sitting on two big stones by a hedge, 
  under a tree. 
  TOM has a grass stalk between his teeth. TOM does not 
  look at him. His tone is matter-of-fact, remorseless. 
  MAYNARD becomes increasingly exasperated - which is TOM s 
  purpose. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          One more time. I only met Sergai Lermov once. 
 
                                        TOM 
            He was stabbed last night. Stabbed to death. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I m sorry, that s terrible but nothing to do 
                                      with me. 
 
  TOM doesn t look at him. He has adopted a casual, 
    ruminative manner.

                                        TOM 
                            Good for you, though. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        How? 
 
                                        TOM 
                Lermov can t be a witness against you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          Are you saying that I ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                Illegal arms is a dangerous world to be 
                                  involved in.. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            I m NOT involved! Dear God what times are we 
            living in? Does just to SAY you re innocent, 
                              prove you re guilty? 
 
                                        TOM 
              It began nine years ago, didn t it? The 
              Confederated Gulf States. You, Lermov and 
              Hampton Wilder, a night under the stars? 
 
  TOM takes out a photograph of the hunting party which we 
  saw in HARRY s office. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                All right! All right I ll tell you what 
                                      happened. 
 
  MAYNARD looks out over the field and composes himself. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT'D) 
            Wilder made a proposal. He wanted me to come 
                                  in on a deal. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            A deal. Involving what? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            The illegal sale of anti-tank weapons. I was 
            on the Commons Committee scrutinising arms 
            procurement. He wanted me to make sure no one 
                                got wind of it. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  And did you?

  MAYNARD, furious. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            No I went straight to MI6! I shopped Wilder. 
            Dear God it was me who put them on to him, I 
            brought him down. I am an unsung hero. So why 
            am I being persecuted? I mean who is doing 
                                    this to me? 
 
  He is desperate. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT D) 
              You re a spook, find out who is destroying 
                                        me. 
 
  For the first time in the interview TOM looks him 
  directly in the eye.

  INT. THAMES HOUSE - HARRY S OFFICE - DAY 3. 1802 
 
  TOM looks down at the desk. Several copies of the centre 
  of the Evening Standard are thrown around it. The spread 
  is of two pages from the manuscript of the memoirs, with 
  names blacked out. There is a photograph of the Sheik s 
  hunting trip - we have already seen it. The huge headline                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 73

                                        TOM 
              No way could the leak have come from us. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            I know, I was scrupulously paranoid about the 
                                      copies. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Who then? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Remain calm. Steer the ship onward. 
 
  DANNY knocks on the door. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  Sorry, but ...

                                  No no, Danny. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          It s on the wires. Richard Maynard s resigned 
                              from the Government. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Well there we have it. Thank you Danny. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Right. 
 
  DANNY leaves - reluctantly, he s curious about the mood 
  in the room.

            Maynard s resigned. Spectacular in t it, when 
                      politicians destroy themselves. 
 
                                        TESSA

                                        TOM 
            MI6 got hold of Wilder s memoirs - full of 
            hatred for Maynard - and decided to use them 
                                to destroy him? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              There you have it. 
 
                                        TOM 
              And they ve set us up to blame us for the 
                              leak to the press?

                                        TOM 
            But Maynard shopped Wilder to MI6. Why would 
                            they turn against him? 
 
                                        HARRY

                                        HARRY 
            Don t brood, Tom. Politicians are conniving, 
                wheeler-dealing scum. Don t have a fit of 
              morals over them, they wouldn t over you. 
 
  HARRY looking rugged and secure.

  TOM follows him into the flat. Soulless reproduction 
  regency. The flat does not look lived in at all.

  There are three big suitcases, two ready for travel. One 
  opened on the bed. MAYNARD is looking through his 
  clothes. A whiskey bottle is open on a table. 
  A knock on the door. MAYNARD stares at it. A knock again. 
  He rushes at the door.

            No idea who did that. Good riddance though.

                                        TESSA 
            It was simple. I tipped off the Russians. He 
                            was two timing them. 
 
                                      MAYNARD

  Close to JOOLS. His face is closed.

  INT. ROOM IN THE HOTEL GARDENIA - DAY 3. 1858 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              No. I never had any corrupt dealings with 
                                  Lermov, ever. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Oh please! You shopped Wilder and took over 
                                  his network. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            What is this? I had no business arrangements 
                            with Wilder or Lermov. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              I don t believe you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              That s your problem. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            If you re innocent, why did you resign? ... 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            Political critical mass. The rumours were too 
            much. They could have damaged the PM. Even 
          he, in the end, had to ask me to go. I agreed 
                        of course. He s my friend. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        He s left you with nothing. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                  Not ... Exactly. I ve been offered a 
              professorship, teaching politics in Harvard. 
              It s been kept warm for me for some time. 
                                      (Grins.) 
          Have you any idea how much American academics 
                                    are paid? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                          You re going to America? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                I m being looked after. A new life. No 
              politics, no wife, no mistress. I m looking 
                        forward to it. Goodbye Tessa. 
 
                              MAYNARD turns away.

                                        TESSA 
          Why do I always have to fall in love with men 
                who are either bent, or weak. Or both. 
 
  She turns away and leaves, slamming the door.

            I am going to sit here and drink your drink 
                              until you tell me. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            You think you can go one to one with me in a 
                                drinking contest?

                You slandered Maynard. He was innocent.

              I wanted revenge. But I genuinely repented 
              writing the memoirs, I would like you to 
            believe that. I was going to destroy them. I 
            went to dig them up and they weren t there. 
 
                                        TOM

                                        JOOLS 
            All right Harry. Richard Maynard was fast-
              tracking up through the Government ranks. 
          With his middle eastern knowledge, experience 
            at the Ministry of Defence, he would all too 
          soon have made a brilliant Foreign Secretary. 
              There was no way we or the Foreign Office 
                      were going to let that happen. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Why not? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Because the white as snow Richard Maynard was 
                                  a CIA Asset. 
 
    A bombshell. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              Oh yes. I know that as it is we re just a 
              comfortable itch in the great American boxer 
              shorts, but could we really have a British 
                Foreign Secretary who was a CIA Agent? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        When did they recruit him?

            Six months ago. A drunken conversation with 
                  an American cousin in this very bar.

                                Didn t the PM ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            The PM is blind to the fault of his friends. 
            We had to run another reason for getting rid 
              of Maynard. The memoirs were a godsend.

                          You could have told me. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Don t be silly you re far too ethical. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Is that a compliment or an insult? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            It s a good outcome all round Harry. A nasty 
                  foreign dead, a dodgy Brit disgraced.

                I have been involved in a filthy trade. 
              Weapons I helped to be sold illegally, have 
                  almost certainly found their way to 
              terrorists. I wrote lies that destroyed a 
            good man. You think I m irredeemable, don t 
                                        you?

            I think that s between you and your Saviour. 
                      If you really believe in Him.

                  Oh I do. But he asks a heavy price.

                                    No doubt. 
 
                                        WILDER

                          I ... Really think I ... 
 
  WILDER starts to unbutton his shirt. He turns pulling it 
  off, the buttons popping. His back is lacerated: some                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 84
 

  scars have healed, others are recently applied.

                I can t live with myself, you see. Not 
                                      really. 
 
  TOM looks, without reaction.
