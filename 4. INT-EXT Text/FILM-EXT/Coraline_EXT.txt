Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an
ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.
NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old
apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a
harvest cart.
DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of
TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks
out for her pursuer.
NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall
grass. She can't see him but she knows something is
there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the
stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!
STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both
angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.
CORALINE
You scared me to death, you mangy thing!
Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl
as she stands. She exhales.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I'm just looking for an old well. Know
it?
Cat BLINKS EYES slowly.
CORALINE(CONT'D)
Not talking, huh?
The wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick,
closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,
SAYS:
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...
the well!
ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into
frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a
button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.
STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.
UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,
Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-
lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S
COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!
CORALINE (CONT'D)
(freaked out)
AHHHHH!
He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the
bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to
WHACK HIM with her forked stick.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
GET AWAY FROM ME--
He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the
ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP
onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-
EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.
And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and
this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and
Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.
Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE
LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims
it around.
WYBIE
(OBLIVIOUS)
Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or
Utah; someplace dried out and barren,
right? I heard about water-witching
before but it doesn't make sense; I mean,
it's just an ordinary branch.
Coraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS.
CORALINE
(ENRAGED)
IT'S A DOWSING ROD!
Coraline smacks Wybie.
WYBIE
Ow!
CORALINE
And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by
PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!
He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.
WYBIE
He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral
 you know, wild? Of course, I do feed
him every night and sometimes he'll come
in my window `n bring me little dead
things.
The cat PURRS like a diesel.
CORALINE
(TOUGH)
Look, I'm from Pontiac.
WYBIE
Huh?
CORALINE
MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",
THEN--
(points stick, stomps foot)
--where's the secret WELL?
WYBIE
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!
Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy
scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING
made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under
one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the
covering.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell
to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a
sky full of stars in the middle of the
day.
CORALINE
(SOFTENS)
Huh.
Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head,
noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and
the well cover thumps in place.
WYBIE
Surprised she let you move in...
Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace"
(indicates house in distance)
Won't rent to people with kids.
CORALINE
What do you mean?
WYBIE
(suddenly worried)
Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.
Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.
CORALINE
(SKEPTICAL)
Wybie?
WYBIE
Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of
course. What'd you get saddled with?
CORALINE
I wasn't saddled with anything. It's
Coraline.
WYBIE
Caroline what?
CORALINE
Coraline. Coraline Jones.
WYBIE
(confused, not hearing it)
Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I
heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --
Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
-- can lead people to have ordinary
expectations about a person--
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
(calling from afar)
Wyborne!
CORALINE
I think I heard someone calling you,
Wyborne.
WYBIE
What? I didn't hear anything--
CORALINE
Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-
you-born.
A distant dinner bell clangs.
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
Wyborne!
WYBIE
(under his breath, nervous)
Grandma!
He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes
closed, forcing some laughs.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan
water witch.
He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his
gloved hands.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
But I'd wear gloves next time.
CORALINE
(SKEPTICAL)
Why?
He points to her dowsing rod, nods.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
`Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh,
it's poison oak.
CORALINE
Ehh!!
Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her
hands on her clothes.
The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying
look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER
TONGUE at him.
She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline
finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE.
Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery
"plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.
ROTATE DISSOLVE TO:
It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-
LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,
squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.
She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one
hand.
The main floor kitchen, like most
things in the Pink
Palace, is barely maintained, and
looks worn and faded.
Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,
bangs away at her
laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES
stacked nearby. She's
plain-looking and tired and wears
a NECK-BRACE.
CORALINE
I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
MEL
(not listening)
Uh huh.
CORALINE
I would have died.
MEL
(continues typing)
That's nice.
Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.
CORALINE
Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's
perfect weather for gardening.
MEL
No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
mess.
Coraline turns to her.
CORALINE
But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
friends come to visit. Isn't that why we
moved here?
MEL
Something like that. But then we had the
accident.
CORALINE
Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
MEL
I never said it was.
CORALINE
(MUTTERS)
I can't believe it -- you and Dad get
paid to write about plants and you hate
dirt.
Mel stops typing, loses her patience.
MEL
Coraline, I don't have time for you right
now. And you still have unpacking to do.
Lots of unpacking.
CORALINE
That sounds exciting.
Mel remembers something.
Mel (CONT'D)
Oh - some kid left this on the front
porch.
Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED
PACKAGE. Attached note reads:
WYBIE (V.O.)
Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's
trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.
She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE-
HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head
credits - it's a litte Coraline!
CORALINE
(to herself)
Huh... a little me? That's weird.
She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed.
MEL
What's his name, anyway?
CORALINE
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.
WIDE ANGLE ON HOUSE. Pouring rain. We hear Charlie
singing a song about Coraline, badly.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,
It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house
and grounds. Coraline  yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS
in hand  opens the front door. Stepping out onto the
porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she
picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.
CORALINE
Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...
Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Ohh, Poo-eeeee!
She goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads
"Bobinsky there" with an arrow that points up long,
winding outside stairs. With an "oh well" shrug, she goes
up.
At the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious.
CORALINE
H-hello?...
She knocks again.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I think our mail got mixed up.
Should I
leave it outside or...
The door swings open. Curious, Coraline peeks inside:
it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove
and a caged chicken.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Hmmm...
Suddenly a HUGE BLUE MAN swings down behind her and
SCOLDS:
MR. BOBINSKY
SEE-KRET...
She whips around to find MR. Bobinsky - upside down,
reaching right at her face! She ducks and he reaches past
her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it
shut.
The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and
shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy.
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
(SCOWLING)
Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready,
little girl!
CORALINE
(CONFUSED)
Circus?... Oh, uh, I brought this for
you.
She holds out his mail. Bobinsky takes it, smelling the
stinky envelopes deeply. Nods approvingly.
MR. BOBINSKY
(SNIFFS)
Mmmm... Noviseer.
CORALINE
Huh?
MR. BOBINSKY
New "cheese" samples.
He swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her
on the balcony. Coraline backs away.
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak
my home and peek at meeshkas
CORALINE
Meeshkas?
MR. BOBINSKY
The Mice!
CORALINE
Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.
MR. BOBINSKY
(BOWS)
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you
can call me Mr. B, because amazing I
already know that I am.
He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems
to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline
rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch
railing behind her.
MR. BOBINSKY
Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my
new songs go oompah oompah. But the
jumping mice play only toodle toot, like
that. Is nice, but not so much amazing?
So now--
(indicates smelly mail)
--I switch to stronger cheese, and soon 
VATCH OUT!
He opens his door, crouches low and turns. He hands her a
beet.
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
Here, have beet. Make you strong.
(salutes her )
Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline.
He scuttles inside and slams the door shut. Coraline
mutters.
CORALINE
Cor-a-line.
Looking at the beet, she makes a disgusted sound and
tosses it away, then heads down the stairs.
EXT HOUSE, SOUTH SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS
When she gets to the bottom, she starts towards the back,
gardening shears out.
CORALINE
(to herself)
Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.
MR. BOBINSKY (O.C.)
EHHH! CAROLINE: PA-DAZH-DI'-- WAIT!!
She looks up.
CORALINE
No!!!
Bobinsky LEAPS all the way to the ground, landing beside
her, out of breath.
MR. BOBINSKY
The mice...asked me to give you message.
CORALINE
The...jumping mice?
Mr. B nods gravely. He leans down, so close his moustache
touches her ear, and whispers, his voice DEAD-SERIOUS.
MR. BOBINSKY
They are saying: do not go through leetle
door. Do you know such a thing?
Coraline is startled.
CORALINE
The one behind the wall paper? But...
it's all bricked up.
The old man shrugs, straightens.
MR. BOBINSKY
Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the
mice are leetle...
He points to his head and rotates his finger.
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your
name wrong, you know. They call you
Coraline instead of Caroline, not
Caroline at all.
He starts back up the stairs.
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
Maybe I work them too hard...
Coraline stares after him.
SHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where
one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it
free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese
schoolboy's cap.
Coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At
the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and
waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it
reads "No whistling in the house."
She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly
LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS
SPINK  wearing some sort of house robe  opens the door
and three SCOTTIE DOGS  HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS  shoot
out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them
down.
MISS SPINK
(HARSH)
Oh cease your infernal yapping!
(to Coraline, sweetly)
How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you
like to come in? We're playing cards.
CORALINE
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
MISS SPINK
(over shoulder)
Miriam, put the kettle on!
Coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level, intrigued
by her fortune.
CORALINE
(to herself)
Danger?
Behind her, a PERISCOPE RISES from the WAIST-DEEP FOG.
Coraline just catches it in her peripheral view.
She frowns but doesn't let on she's aware of it. She
walks ahead nonchalantly, the periscope following her,
then suddenly turns and GRABS it, PULLING UP WYBIE, then
PUNCHES him in the arm.
WYBIE
Owwwwwwww!
CORALINE
Great, the village stalker.
WYBIE
Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're
hunting banana slugs.
Wybie takes some SALAD TONGS from a tool belt, snaps
them.
CORALINE
What d'ya mean, "we?"
There's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it
up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his
shoulders.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss-
puss!
Cat glares at her angrily.
WYBIE
What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.
CORALINE
(MOCKING)
Wuss-puss...
Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a
tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
So... that doll. Did you make it look
like me?
Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks
his head up for a moment.
WYBIE
Oh no; I found it that way. It's older
than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.
Coraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt.
CORALINE
(points to self)
C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and
raincoat?
Wybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN
SLUG to Coraline.
WYBIE
Dang, check out Slugzilla!
She's not impressed.
CORALINE
(FRUSTRATED)
You're just like them.
WYBIE
Huh?
He looks from the slug to himself.
CORALINE
I meant my parents; they don't listen to
me either.
Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera --
WYBIE
Uh huh... You mind?
-- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot.
He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash
shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND
EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat
it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in
another. She can't help but GIGGLE.
CORALINE
Ew!
Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and
takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful,
then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and
speaks in a SAD TONE.
WYBIE
You know, I've never been inside the Pink
Palace.
CORALINE
(SCEPTICAL)
You're kidding.
WYBIE
Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's
dangerous or something.
CORALINE
Dangerous?
WYBIE
Well... she had a twin sister.
CORALINE
So?
WYBIE (O.C.).
When they were kids, Grandma's sister
disappeared.
(ON CAMERA)
She says she was stolen.
CORALINE (O.S.)
(SKEPTICAL)
Stolen?
ANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues.
Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT
THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things.
CORALINE(CONT'D)
Well, what do you think?
WYBIE
Uhhh, I-I don't know.
BACK TO KIDS. Wybie, astride his electric bike now,
WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto
his shoulders.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
Maybe she just ran away?
We hear Wybie's agitated grandmother call out.
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
Wyborne!
Wybie turns away: he's said too much.
WYBIE
Look, I gotta go.
He starts to pull away.
CORALINE
Wait a minute!
And he's gone. PUSH IN on her pensive face.
INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CU ON DOLL FACE, back in
the chair by the bed. Coraline
takes some yellow cheese
from her pocket and puts it by
the door: mice bait. She
lies down and her breathing
slows, the doll watching
her with a nearly IMPERCEPTIBLE
SMILE on its face.
INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - LATER
Coraline sleeping, lighting suggests another dream. SOME
THINGS go t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, looks to her
door, and spots a COUPLE OF KANGAROO MICE stealing the
last bit of cheese.
Coraline opens the gate to the garden. A large CRESCENT
MOON RISES, and THINGS START TO GROW.
Two dead shrubs start to RISE, then BLOSSOM, then the
blossoms themselves are LIT UP by some GOLD AND AMBER
HUMMINGBIRDS.
The hummingbirds circle around Coraline, light her
DRAGONFLY BARRETTE, then continue on, LIGHTING UP PITCHER
PLANTS that have grown up in a nearby flower bed. A
beautiful FROG POKES OUT of one blossom.
The birds lead Coraline up steps past a stone wall where
BLEEDING HEART GROW, AND GLOW, AND BEAT.
She spots the Other Father, riding a PRAYING MANTIS
TRACTOR on the hillside, planting SEEDS that instantly
grow into FLOWERING PLANTS.
OTHER FATHER
Hey!!!
CORALINE
I love your garden!
He waves back, calling:
OTHER FATHER
Our garden, Coraline!
A gang of SNAP DRAGONS goes at her, TICKLING Coraline
till she falls down. Her squeals of delight grow into
HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.
CORALINE
(GIGGLING)
Oh ah, stop! Stop tickling, ah!
The Other Father hears this and looks over.
OTHER FATHER
Oops, daughter in distress!
He guns the tractor full-speed over a little bridge,
grabbing a GOURD TRUMPET from a vine and blowing it.
JACK-O-LANTERNS surface in the pond below and spout
STREAMS OF WATER.
Arriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the
naughty snapdragons.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers!
Then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to
Coraline. She nods thanks.
CORALINE
Well, she says it's time for dinner ...
breakfast ... food?
OTHER FATHER
Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you
something!
She does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB,
pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They
RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden
is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE.
CORALINE
I can't believe you did this!
OTHER FATHER
Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows
you like the back of her hand.
He pulls a lever and they ZOOM out of frame.
The Other House  lit by amber spotlights looks MAGICAL
with ornate GINGERBREAD TRIM; glowing TOPIARY in the
yard. The kids come out the front door.
CORALINE
You're awful cheerful, considering you
can't say anything.
Other Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up
the stairs to Bobinsky's.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...
She points to her mouth. There's an awkward moment and
then he points past her, excitedly: a SMALL BLIMP is
flying towards Bobinsky's door.
They run up the stairs and watch it slip through an
opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door
suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE.
--SQUEALING brakes, as the Jones' JEEP pulls up in front
of "Northwest Garden" headquarters. TOWNSFOLK in
SHAKESPEAREAN COSTUMES stand about, advertising a local
festival. Coraline is sharing her latest dream:
CORALINE (V.O.).
... there were garden squash like balloon
animals AND snap dragons.
ON FAMILY: Coraline continues from back seat as her
father and mother review their work pages.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse
circus, not pretend like the crazy man's
in our house.
Her parents, preoccupied, ignore her.
CHARLIE
You sure you won't come?
MEL
(indicates neck brace)
Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new
catalog. At least, they'll love my
chapters.
Gives her an "aren't you funny" look, opens door. Mel
looks back at Coraline.
MEL (CONT'D)
I did not call him crazy, Coraline.
He's
drunk.
She makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to
Coraline, pinches her nose.
CHARLIE
Well, I guess I'll see you around, you
dizzy dreamer.
Coraline cuts him off, embarrassed.
CORALINE
Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.
Dad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel
and Coraline drive off.
Coraline, dressed in her FANCY NEW CLOTHES, steps onto
the FRONT PORCH and BURPS. It's always nighttime in this
world.
A CAT MEEEROWS. Coraline looks up to see a BLACK CAT on
the porch roof above her.
Coraline raises her brows, studies the animal a moment.
CORALINE
Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at
home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that
talks too much. You must be the Other
Cat.
The cat LEAPS down and lands on the railing by the
basement stairs. He shakes his head and SPEAKS!
CAT
No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.
He tips his head to one side, opal blue eyes glinting.
Coraline is surprised.
CORALINE
Um... I can see you don't have button
eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can
you talk?
The cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers.
CAT
I just can.
He leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large,
FALLEN TREE.
CORALINE
Cats don't talk at home.
CAT
No?
CORALINE
Nope.
Climbs up the tree's upended roots, head held high and
proud.
CAT
(DRYLY)
Well, you're clearly the expert on these
things. After all, I'm just a big fat
wuss puss.
CORALINE
Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I
called you that, I really am.
Coraline forces herself to be polite.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
How'd you get here?
CAT
I've been coming here for a while.
He DISAPPEARS behind one a thick root that sticks up,
then REAPPEARS from a large knot hole beside Coraline,
startling her.
CAT (CONT'D)
It's a game we play. She...
(indicates house)
...hates cats and tries to keep me out.
But she can't, of course.
He pokes his HEAD DOWN into the knot hole, then POPS IT
UP out of ANOTHER KNOT-HOLE, ten feet away.
CAT (CONT'D)
I come and go as I please.
CORALINE
(SKEPTICAL)
The Other Mother hates cats?
CAT
(CONTEMPTUOUS)
Not like any "mother" I've ever known.
CORALINE
What do you mean? She's amazing!
Cat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof.
CAT
You probably think this world is a dream
come true. But you're wrong. The Other
Wybie told me so.
CORALINE
That's nonsense. He can't talk.
The cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence.
CAT
Perhaps not to you. We cats, however,
have far superior senses than humans and
can see and smell, and --
Suddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes,
sensing something.
CAT (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING)
Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over...
He SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the
corner.
Coraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to Spink and
Forcible's, their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS.
Other Wybie escorts Coraline up the stone stairs from
Spink and Forcible's apartment. The Other Mother and
Other Father, a huge, full moon rising behind them, wait
at the top of the stairs.
OTHER FATHER
Hey there.
OTHER MOTHER
Was it wonderful, dear?
Other Mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and Other
Father dapper. Coraline shakes with excitement as they
walk toward the front porch. Other Wybie holds back,
loses his smile.
CORALINE
Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me
right out of my seat  Spink and
Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies,
that was just a disguise. But then, I was
flying through the air and... it was, it
was magic.
They walk up the front steps.
OTHER MOTHER
You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?
CORALINE
(nods, turns back)
Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.
Other Father takes Coraline inside. Wybie, at the bottom
of the steps, looks GUILTY AND SAD. Other Mother glares
at him, makes a huge, false smile then points to him. He
just lowers his head.
She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden.
OTHER STEEP HILLSIDE TRAIL
She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance.
ENTRANCE TO OTHER ORCHARD
She runs down the path.
OTHER ORCHARD
Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES
AND RIPE RED FRUIT.
She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The
further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees
become.
She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.
CAT
And what do you think you're doing?
The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.
CORALINE
Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what
I'M doing.
The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become
WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the
old well be here?
The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give
way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.
CAT
Nothing out here ... it's the empty part
of this world. She only made what she
knew would impress you.
CORALINE
But why? Why does she want me?
They walk over the horizon.
CAT (cont'd)
She wants something to love, I think.
Something that isn't her... Or maybe
she'd just love something to eat.
CORALINE
Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat
daughters!
CAT
I don't know. How do you taste?
OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS
A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and
becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat
slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills,
white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL
IN.
CORALINE
Huh? But how can you walk away from
something and still come back to it?
The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its
head to one side.
CAT
Walk around the world.
CORALINE
Small world.
Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a
shrub.
CAT
Hang on--
He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE
KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before
Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.
CORALINE
Stop, he's one of the circus mice!
With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse
into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a
QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse
TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He
drops the rat on the ground.
CAT
I don't like rats at the best of times,
but this one was sounding an alarm.
The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed,
Coraline speaks with admiration.
CORALINE
Gooooood kitty.
Coraline looks to the house with a determined look.
On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the
UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand.
But it's just Wybie, the real boy.
CORALINE
Oh... the Wybie that talks...
He's waves, face down, awkward.
WYBIE
Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know
tha-that old doll I gave you?
Coraline tenses, sharp breath.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was
her sister's - the one that...
disappeared?
She reads him like a book.
CORALINE
(REALIZATION)
You stole that doll, didn't you?
Wybie answers quickly, guilty as heck.
WYBIE.
Well, i-it looked just like you. And I
FIGURED--
Coraline, rushing the words, tells him the truth.
CORALINE
It used to look like this pioneer girl;
then Huck Finn junior; then it was this
Little Rascals chick with all these
ribbons, and braids, and....
Her voice trails off. Coraline studies Wybie, then, snaps
her fingers.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Grandma's missing sister!
He nods, one brow raising up.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I think I just met her. C'mon!
She pulls him inside and--
INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
--drags him down the hall.
WYBIE
Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed
TO--
Door flies open and Wybie RUNS down the front steps to
his electric bike. Coraline RACES down after him.
CORALINE
You creep!
WYBIE
(calling over his shoulder)
Crazy!!
He RUNS his bike towards the FALLEN TREE, HOPS ON and
PEDALS LIKE MAD. As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he GUNS
the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway.
CORALINE
Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave
me the doll!
Out of breath, she turns away and notices her PARENTS'
CAR parked to the side.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Mom!
Dad!
Excited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the
car.
Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the
garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas
of glowing flowers.
She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog
suddenly SWALLOWS the animal.
She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now
LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall.
At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her.
She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS
like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS
sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground,
spilling her bag.
CORALINE
No!!
They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and
shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE
MOUTH.
Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS
OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she
is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.
Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when
a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't
attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the
TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Stop!!
Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she
crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and
FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the
ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out.
She picks up the triangle candy.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Why steal this?
With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it
up to her eye and GASPS.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Wow...
EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all
color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she
turns back to where she started, she sees something,
right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S
EYE!
CORALINE (CONT'D)
That must be it.
She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the
ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the
preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF
HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its
controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL
PIANO HANDS.
HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The
mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and
the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She
yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:
OTHER FATHER
Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee.
Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the
fountains as the tractor moves in.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you.
The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the
mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge -
STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it.
Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE
HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a
moment.
Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE
HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
Taaaake it!!!!!
Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the
tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE
WATER.
Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire
GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD.
Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear
knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary.
BOY GHOST
Bless you, miss, you found me! But
there's two eyes still lost.
CORALINE
Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it!
Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other
House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale
acid green.
Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she
heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and
Forcible's show song starts to play...
CORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the
door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues.
REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM.
INT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME
WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears
behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the
curtain open. Song stops.
POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming
through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on
the ground.
ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS
FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive,
then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and
startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats.
One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light
and shivers.
On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge,
wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and
sandbags.
She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED
TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be
seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY-
WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming
from inside the wrapper.
Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels
herself, then reaches inside. She touches something
sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she
grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY
HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.
Her heart thumps. She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like
scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed.
CORALINE
(REALIZING)
The pearl!
The hands suddenly GRAB HER! She SCREAMS. Young Spink and
Forcible, twisted together into one taffy monster, THRUST
THEIR HEADS FROM THE BAG!
TAFFY MONSTER
Thief!! Give it back!
Coraline PULLS AWAY, STRETCHING the candy arm out across
the stage! The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired
arm, and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE, ropes
swaying on pulleys.
TAFFY MONSTER (CONT'D)
(in unison)
You thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Give it
back! Thief! Give it back! Give it back!
Thief! Stop thief! Thief! Stop!
Coraline, desperate, gets an idea. She clicks on her
flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS. They GROWL with
annoyance, OPEN their wings.
The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER! Coraline hurls the
flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM. Angered, they
TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned!
Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on
the right! She waits to the very last second, and then
DIVES OUT OF THE WAY!
BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is
released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The
bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as-
stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and
theater.
The PEARL in Coraline's hand PULSES BLUE.
TALL GIRL GHOST (V.O.)
Hurry on, girl - her web is unwinding!
Coraline nods, sticks the pearl in her bag, and looks up
towards the ceiling and beyond.
CORALINE'S MOVING POV, on lower ext stairs to UP ANGLE ON
BALCONY. We hear haunting circus music in the air.
Other Mr. B's Russian flag, TORN in places, waves in the
air. The pale green moon is nearly HALF-ECLIPSED now with
what is clearly the SHADOW OF A HUGE, DARK, BUTTON.
ANGLE ON CORALINE as she climbs the last flight of stairs
to Bobinsky's. She stops with a SHUDDER at the top. The
flag has been replaced with the EMPTY COAT OF OTHER WYBIE-
gloves, pants and sneakers pinned on - hanging like old
laundry.
CORALINE
Oh, Wybie...
She takes a breath, leans out over the railing and
shouts.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
EVIL WITCH ... I'M NOT SCARED!
The door behind her CREAKS open. Coraline shivers - she
is definitely scared.
The RAT DUCKS, the CANDY MISSES, and the cheese-wheel rat
ESCAPES down the stairs with the ball.
--OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
with ATTACHED STAIRWAY.
CORALINE
Noooo!
The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it
collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the
house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.
WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and
knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white
gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and
circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost
eye.
Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light,
turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the
DARK BUTTON SHADOW.
Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her
knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
(DEVASTATED)
Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost
everything.
She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light
that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone.
In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -
CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust
leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the
eclipse paused.
There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.
Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT,
licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet.
CAT
I think I mentioned that I don't like
rats at the best of times.
Coraline smiles, walks towards him.
CORALINE
I think you might have said something
like that.
CAT
It looked like you needed this one,
however.
He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.
She picks it up , sticks it in her bag. Around her, the
YARD, HOUSE, TREES, SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY.
CORALINE
Thank you.
Looks towards house.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I'm heading inside. I still have to find
my parents.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON MOON. The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN, and in
one beat, the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED
OUT. The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY.
ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has
begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of
paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.
The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the
SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL, revealing dirty white
light. The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant
hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing
louder.
UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply
alarmed, they look from one direction to another.
POV out front yard. The destruction TRAVELS up the
driveway, PULLS APART the poplars, and then UNRAVELS the
topiary elephant and bird.
DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE
PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY
SHRINKING ISLAND!
NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their
feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat
makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the
movie!
Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her
guardian angel.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Come on, quickly!
The cat LEAPS and she catches him, then CARRIES HIM up
the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door. She
gets through just in time, and SLAMS it shut!
A MAGIC ART SKY animates subtly.
CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline, studying sky, her back to us.
From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to
shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes.
Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE
GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES
RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS.
SWEET GIRL GHOST
It's a fine, fine thing you did for us,
miss.
CORALINE
Well, I'm glad it's finally over!
A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They
gather around Coraline and bow their heads.
SWEET GIRL GHOST
(SIGHS)
It is over and done with ... for us.
Silent beat.
CORALINE
What about...me?
The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then BLURTS
OUT:
TALL GIRL GHOST
You're in terrible danger, girl!
Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.
CORALINE
But how?
I locked the door!?
SWEET GIRL GHOST
It's the key, miss, there's only one and
the Beldam will find it.
The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out
in front of Coraline. She grabs it.
The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.
BOY GHOST
(WHISPERS)
Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ...
thou art still ... living...
They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and
faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she --
CUT TO:
She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with
BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow.
CORALINE
... I give you bowls of porridge
And I give you bowls of ice cream.
LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND
drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I give you lots of kisses,
And I give you lots of hugs ...
Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the
well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.
CORALINE
... But I never give you sandwiches
With grease and worms and mung beans.
Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS
behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.
Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one
side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating,
she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's
around her neck.
The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS
HER!
Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.
The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the
air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!
Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught
between the key string and her neck!
The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the
LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION!
A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN
SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his
own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining
electric bike!
WYBIE
YAHHHHH!!!!
Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the
confused HAND with his slug tongs!
He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to
throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his
handlebars.
OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND
HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just
manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand,
caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and
face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS
FINGERS to make him fall!
WYBIE (CONT'D)
(STRUGGLING)
Get off!!
Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her
BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the
crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND.
It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it.
The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It
crouches to attack her!
And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG
ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE
LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.
Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing
hard - removes the key and string from around her sore
neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the
needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together
with the string. The key is left attached.
The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and
DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,
they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in
the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover
in place.
Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his
injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He
looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little
with moonlight.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you
about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline.
Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath,
stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the
first time.
CORALINE
Why did you change your mind?
He walks over, and takes out an old B&W; photo from his
jacket.
WYBIE
W-well, Gramma showed me this picture,
after I called you crazy?
He hands it to her.
ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed
in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink
Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks
just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH
BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her.
WYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
It's her and her sister, before she
disappeared.
ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall
like snow in the orchard.
CORALINE
The sweet ghost girl.
Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the
distance.
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
Wyborne!
Come home!!
WYBIE
(re: his grandmother)
Oh, man...what am I going to tell her?
She looks up from the photo and smiles.
CORALINE
Just bring her by the house tomorrow.
We
can tell her together.
WYBIE
We...we can??
CORALINE
You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk
me.
She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS.
WYBIE
Wasn't my idea.
The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS.
Coraline smiles.
We TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds -
like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright
gibbous moon.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY
One WHITE BALLOON floats against a blue sky with puffy,
white clouds. WE TILT DOWN past more balloons to a TABLE
OF REFRESHMENTS, set up by the front gates.
Coraline picks up a TRAY OF DRINKS and heads out to her
hard-working GUESTS, all wearing garden gloves and
showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED
RED TULIPS.
SPINK AND FORCIBLE, along with their DOGS, are set up at
a table below the steps. Empty plant cartons are stacked
nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of
peat moss.
CORALINE
Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss
Forcible.
MISS FORCIBLE
(straining to see)
Oh, look April - Pink Ladies!
CORALINE
Actually, it's just lemonade.
Coraline hands them the beverages, then nods towards the
GREY DOG digging in the flowers.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
How's Angus doing?
Miss Spink sighs.
MISS SPINK
Oh, much better, dear... But he can't
duck his wings forever!
Coraline heads up the steps to find her PARENTS dumping a
heavy bag of PEAT MOSS around the dead-looking tree in
the stone circle.
CHARLIE
Here comes a burp.
Charlie BURPS.
MEL
(SCOLDING)
Charlie!
CHARLIE
Oh, excu-say-moi, but that pizza was
delicious.
Mel SIGHS.
CORALINE
Cold drinks?
Charlie nods, grabs them for Mel and Wybie.
CHARLIE
(HAPPILY)
Oh yeah, great!
MEL
(SKEPTICAL)
You were right, Coraline. I really hate
dirt, but the tulips look nice.
CORALINE
Thanks, mom.
Coraline, delighted, moves on.
Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained
fish pond. He's stealthily PULLING just-planted tulips
from the dirt there, and putting BEETS in their place.
MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)
(pulling beets)
Ooo, dret nican...neit, neit...da, da, dat iz
possible.
Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT to get his attention.
CORALINE
How are the meeshkas, Mr. B?
Surprised and looking very guilty, he tries to cover up
his activities. She smiles and hands him a drink.
MR.
BOBINSKY
(SMILES)
Dey tell me that
you - are saviour,
Caroline. And --
soon as dey are ready --
dey vish to give
special tenks-you
performance.
He drains his glass of lemonade. A familiar voice is
heard approaching. Coraline turns and smiles.
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
Wyborne, I know where I'm going--
ANGLE ON Wybie and his GRANDMOTHER as they walk through
the garden gates
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER
(CONT'D)
--I grew up here.
Coraline sees them and waves.
CORALINE
Welcome, Ms. Lovat!
The old lady looks up and smiles.
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER
Oh, hello.
CORALINE
I'm Coraline Jones -- I've got so much to
tell you!
MEL (O.C.)
(background dialog)
Here.
CHARLIE (O.C.)
(background dialog)
Thanks.
MISS SPINK (O.C.)
(background dialog)
Ooo, do you want to pop a little gin in
it dear?
MISS FORCIBLE (O.C.)
(background dialog)
Of course!
CAMERA PULLS UP from the GARDEN, FLIES OVER THE HOUSE and
BOOMS DOWN to the PINK PALACE APARTMENTS SIGN out front.
On top of the sign sits the black cat, who looks right
into camera, blinks, then walks behind the thin post that
holds the sign and DISAPPEARS.
THE END
