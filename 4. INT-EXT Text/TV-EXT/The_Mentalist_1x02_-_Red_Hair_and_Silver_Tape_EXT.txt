      JANE, LISBON, CHO, and a 45ish Tommy Lee Jones SHERIFF 
      MCALLISTER -  walking between rows of vines on the hillside 
      of a green little valley. 

                                    SHERIFF
                    Boy I am happy to see you guys.  
                    We are sorely ill-equipped for this 
                    kind of a deal.

      They come upon a body dumped in a shallow ditch by the edge 
      of a dirt track through the vineyard.  There's yellow tape,  
      a Deputy amateurishly photographing tire tracks while others 
      give him sage advice.

      The body is a young red haired woman fully clothed in jeans 
      and a T-shirt, tightly and thoroughly bound in silver duct 
      tape.  There's one large knife wound in her abdomen.

                                    SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                    Quail hunter's dog found her this 
                    morning about five-thirty.  Wasn't 
                    meant to be hunting quail, but he was.

                                  LISBON
                    Do we know who she is?

                                    SHERIFF
                    Nope.  Looks familiar though. 
                    So I'm guessing local.  People look 
                    different when they're dead, don't they?  

      Lisbon and Cho get in the ditch to examine the body.

                                  CHO
                    That wound doesn't look fatal.  

                                  LISBON
                    Doesn't does it?  No ligature marks 
                    on the neck, so she wasn't 
                    strangled or hung.  But the gums 
                    are livid, eyes are hemorrhaged.  

                                  CHO
                      Suffocation.

      Lisbon nods. 


                                    SHERIFF
                    My bet, meth-heads from the city, 
                    coming off the interstate.  
                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    2.
      CONTINUED:11

                                  JANE
                    No.  It was a local.  And it was an 
                    accident.  Her killer didn't intend 
                    for her to die this way. 

      Given the state of the body, it's understandable the Sheriff 
      is incredulous.  Lisbon, looking under Melanie's fingernails, 
      knows Jane better...

                                  LISBON
                    How so?

                                  JANE
                    Her clothes are still on.  Her 
                    abductor was taking her to a location 
                    where he would have time and privacy 
                    to undress her for a sexual assault.  
                    But she made too much noise at the 
                    wrong moment.  He tried to keep her 
                    quiet and he smothered her by mistake.  
                    No good to him now.  So he dumped her.  
                    In a spot only a local would know. 

      That all makes good sense to Lisbon, but the Sheriff, 
      irritated by Jane's certainty, ain't buying. 

                                    SHERIFF 
                      Outstanding.  What happens next?  
                    Do we catch him?   

                                  JANE
                    Of course.  

                                  LISBON
                          (nods to Coroner's men)
                    Okay guys, she's all yours.  Thanks 
                    for waiting so long.

      Jane, Lisbon, Cho, and the Sheriff walk away from the 
      cordoned body, back to the cars.

                                  CHO
                    Why a sexual motive?  Could be 
                    gangs, or drugs.  

                                  JANE
                    A drug trade smothering?  By who?  
                    The Sesame Street Crips?  

                                  LISBON
                    Nothing there to say it's not plain 
                    boyfriend trouble. 

                                  JANE
                    Could be boyfriend trouble.  
                    But it doesn't feel that way. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    3.

                    Who is this?

                                  LISBON
                          (been here before)
                    He's a consultant.  You want CBI    
                      assistance on this, he comes as 
                    part of the package.  

                                    SHERIFF 
                          (hostile now)
                      Consultant.  You're clairvoyant or 
                    some gizmo like that huh?  You got 
                    "psychic powers"?   

                                  JANE
                    No.  No powers.  I had them once.  
                    I mean, I pretended I had them, 
                      obviously.  There's no such thing 
                    as psychic powers. 

                                    SHERIFF
                    Oh-kay.  So uh, what is it that you 
                    do exactly?

                                  JANE 
                    Do you know rock paper scissors?

                                    SHERIFF
                    Sure.

                                  JANE
                    Play me.

      The Sheriff shrugs bemused - okay.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    On three.  One two three.

      The Sheriff throws a rock.  Jane throws paper.  

                                    SHERIFF 
                    One two three.  

      The Sheriff throws paper, Jane throws scissors. 

                                    SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                    One two three.

      The Sheriff gets beat again, and again, and again, and as we 
      kick into the theme and FADE OUT, Jane still hasn't lost.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Deep in the country.  A weary blue-collar woodframe house 
      flanked by various trailers and sheds.  Lazy dogs, goats in a 
      pen, an old F-150 up on bricks, a big John Deere in good 
      working order.

      MERCEDES O'KEEFE - forty-one, zaftig Mexican/American in 
      Wranglers and a San Francisco Giants T-shirt - takes laundry 
      off a clothesline and folds it with the help of her son 
      FRANKIE - wiry, tough, 9-10 years old.  

      They stop when she sees a Sheriff's Dept. CRUISER and the 
      CBI's PASSENGER VAN come along the winding road toward the 
      O'Keefe property.

                                  MERCEDES
                    Honey, go get started on your 
                    homework.

      Frankie's about to protest, but he sees the fear in her eyes 
      and it impels him into the house. 

                                  MERCEDES (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    Joe.

      JOE O'KEEFE - forty-five, rangy, a fighter's face under 
      Celtic red hair and a battered Raiders cap - emerges from one 
      of the sheds, wiping oily hands on a rag.

      He joins his wife and they watch in highly charged silence as 
      the cars pull up; the Sheriff and Jane and Lisbon and Cho and 
      a Deputy walk somberly toward them.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. and Mrs. O'Keefe?  I'm Agent 
                    Teresa Lisbon, California Bureau of 
                      Investigation.  I'm sorry.  I'm 
                    bringing bad news.  We found your 
                    daughter Melanie...

      Two hearts breaking.  Joe turns to stone.  Mercedes begins to 
      WAIL, low at first.  Lisbon touches her arm in sympathy.  
      Jane drifts away toward the house.


      At a wooden bench and table Joe and Mercedes O'Keefe sit side 
      by side, numb with shock.  Lisbon sits opposite.

                                  MERCEDES
                    The night before last, she didn't 
                    come home from work.  She 
                      waitresses at Shand Creek Winery 
                      Restaurant.  It's in all the 
                      guidebooks. 

      Lisbon notes the Sheriff react strongly to this news and 
      wonders why.

                                  MERCEDES (CONT D)
                    She was on 'til eleven.  Her car's 
                    still in the parking lot there.

                                  JOE
                    We're always asleep when she comes 
                    in so we didn't know she wasn't 
                    here until the morning.  We called 
                    all her friends.  She wasn't with 
                    them.  Nobody saw her after she 
                    left work.


      Lisbon talking to Mercedes and Joe; Cho and Sheriff listening 
      in. 

                                  MERCEDES
                    She was going to college in the 
                    fall.  She won a softball 
                      scholarship at the UCLA?  
                    They say it's one of the best 
                    schools in the country.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    7.

                                  JOE
                    We were worried about her going 
                    down there to Los Angeles.  You 
                    hear about all the crime.  Did 
                    they, you know, do anything to her?

                                  LISBON
                          (knows what he means)
                    It doesn't appear so.  She was 
                    fully clothed.  

                                  JOE
                    Thank God for that at least. 

                                  MERCEDES
                    Who would do this?  Why?  Why?

                                  LISBON
                      Oftentimes, it's the first name that 
                    springs to a mother's mind that turns 
                    out to be the guilty party.  

      Mercedes and Joe search for a name.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    A jealous boyfriend, that sort of 
                    thing. 

                                  JOE
                    No.

                                  MERCEDES
                    No.  There was no-one like that. 

                                  LISBON
                    Never?

                                  JOE
                    She's always been shy of boys.  

                                  MERCEDES
                    A good girl.  She took the purity 
                    pledge in ninth grade and she still 
                    wears that ring today. 


      Cho and Lisbon by their car.  Lisbon takes out phone.

      In BG the Sheriff has a few parting words with the O'Keefes; 
      and Jane emerges from the house and heads toward Lisbon.


      Lisbon on phone leaning on car.  Cho waiting.  Jane joins them.

                                  LISBON 
                    Did you get the fax from the 
                    sheriff's office here?
                          (listens)
                    Okay.  Van Pelt, run the details 
                    through the crime database.  See if 
                    we get any matches.


                                  LISBON
                    No, stay there.  I'll call if we 
                    need you. 

      She hangs up.  Jane and Cho exchange a glance.  Why's Lisbon 
      being mean to Rigsby?   

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                          (off the house)
                    Anything?

                                  JANE
                    She has a lover.  Met him round 
                    Christmas at a fair and he's either 
                    too old, too closely related, or 
                    too villainous to tell the folks 
                    about.  I'd bet on villainy.
                    And his first name begins with H.

      Lisbon and Cho shake their heads in rueful amusement.

                                  LISBON
                    That would explain why she wasn't 
                    wearing her purity ring.

      The Sheriff joins them.  Lisbon looks at him expectantly.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Damnedest thing.  I was at Shand 
                    Creek that night on a call.  Right 
                    about the time she must have been 
                    taken.  Drunk wouldn't pay his 
                    check.  

      Cho and Jane and Lisbon give him a dry look.

                                  LISBON
                    That is the damnedest thing.  You 
                    notice anything might be useful?

                                    SHERIFF
                          (recalling)
                    Oh for crying out loud.  When I got 
                    there, I saw a black truck, a full-

      The Sheriff gets out of his cruiser.  A BLACK TRUCK makes a 
      tire-squealing exit at the far end of the lot.  

                                    SHERIFF (V.O.)
                    ...and I nearly went after them...

      We see the Sheriff think about going after the truck, but he 
      is diverted by a WAITER, who emerges from the back of the 
      restaurant and beckons urgently.

      We watch the Sheriff hurry to back of the restaurant and have 
      a quick conversation with the waiter alongside a parked PANEL 
    VAN emblazoned with the SHAND CREEK LOGO.  The two men go 
      inside together.

      Cho, Lisbon, and the Sheriff looking over the lot.

                                  LISBON
                    What time was that?

                                    SHERIFF
                    About quarter to twelve.  

      Lisbon notes that down.  

                                  LISBON
                    Have those woods been searched?

                                    SHERIFF
                    Not to speak of.

                    You might want to put a few man-
                    hours into that.

                    You want to take that?

      Cho nods and peels off to check out Melanie's CAR, an ancient 
      Japanese hoopty.

      MOS - Randall leans against his car, smoking.  Tosses it away 
      when he sees Melanie exiting the restaurant and walking to 
      her car.

                                    RANDALL (O.S.)
                    I'm like hey Melanie, how you 
                    doing?  And we talked.

      Randall approaches.  Melanie doesn't see him coming and jumps 
      a little when she hears him, but smiles when she sees it's 
      Randall.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    20.

      MOS Randall is talking away, and Melanie smiling and laughing 
      tightly, strictly out of politeness, whilst looking anxiously 
      down the road in anticipation of someone's arrival.  

                                    RANDALL (O.S.)
                    So I made my move. 

      Randall suddenly lunges at Melanie and tries to kiss her.  She 
      resists and he tries harder and they wrestle for a moment. 

                                    RANDALL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And ah, she wasn't so into it.  
                    Which is cool.  Only I know she's 
                    got this whole I'm a virgin thing 
                    going so I figure I have to be, you 
                    know, be goal oriented...

      Randall won't take no for an answer.  Melanie knees him in 
      the balls.  He goes down on his knees.  

      She's apologetic but firm - back off.  Her hair and clothes 
      are in disarray. 

      Randall hurls pain wracked obscenities at her - fucking dyke 
      bitch, etc. - as he staggers back to his car. 

                                    RANDALL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And she was kind of upset.  
                    So I apologized for the 
                      misunderstanding and I left.

      A tract house in a scrubby neighborhood.  Big black truck in 
      the driveway.  We join the warrant serving just as Lisbon, 
      Rigsby, Cho, and Van Pelt, fronted by a half dozen VACAVILLE 
      P.D SWAT GUYS move stealthily but swiftly into position to 
      bust down the front door.  Then holding very still, nothing 
      but the sound of heavy breathing and pounding hearts, as the 
      LEAD SWAT GUY counts down with his fingers... 

      ANGLE reveals Jane waiting anxiously in the street, leaning 
      against a car.  

      Back to Van Pelt, breathing heavily with nerves, eyes locked

      NEW ANGLE - We watch the little house from JANE'S POV - 
      awaiting the outcome on the street. It's quiet like an 
      everyday city street.  An ICE CREAM TRUCK in the distance.  
      The whoosh of CARS on a nearby freeway.  As if nothing at all 
      was going on.  The seconds tick by.  O.S CRAAASH!  Then a 
      MUSCULAR TATTOOED MAN IN UNDERSHORTS with a MACHETE in his 
      hand comes sprinting round the corner of the house.  Lisbon 
      follows him, gun drawn.  HECTOR - for it is he - sprints 
      around the side of the house, but when Rigsby and Van Pelt 
      and a SWAT guy appear, coming the other way, he doubles back 
      and sprints toward the street.  Toward Jane, who becomes 
        increasingly concerned about the outcome.  But Lisbon tackles 
      Hector round the legs and brings him down hard.  The machete 
      clatters out of his hand and slides to a stop at Jane's feet.  
      Lisbon is up and on him and cuffs him like it's a calf roping 
      contest.

      FADE IN:


      Jane drains a bottle of water while Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt, 
      and Rigsby doff their body armor and helmets and stuff and 
      pack them in their VAN.  IN BG, Hector is put in back of a 
      cop car.

      They are still up on the buzz of a hot warrant.  Rigsby is 
      acting out Lisbon's take down of Hector.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    ...Boom, out of nowhere.  He didn't

                    What were you going to do if Lisbon

                                  JANE
                    Oh I didn't bother to formulate a 
                    plan.  I knew she'd stop him.

                    Staties, then go back to

      Rigsby and Van Pelt are surprised, cast down.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes boss. 

      Lisbon goes, Jane by her side.  We follow them.

                                  JANE 
                    I don't get it.  You won't allow 
                    sexual tension in your sacred unit, 
                    but you're leaving those two in the 
                    office with nothing to do.  It only 
                    heightens the tension.  

      Lisbon smiles.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  The sooner they start having 
                    sex the better.  Then one or other 
                    of them will have to transfer out.

      Hector's truck pulls into the lot and stops.

                    We were supposed to meet at eleven-
                    thirty at the restaurant.

      Hector looks around the lot for Melanie.  No sign of her.  He 
      looks at his watch and scowls.

                                  HECTOR (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I got there maybe ten minutes late 
                    and she hadn't come out yet. 

      A FEW MOMENTS LATER.  

      Hector tosses his cigar, and shouts imprecations in the 
      direction of the Restaurant and Melanie. 

                                  HECTOR (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    So I waited for a few minutes and I 
                    left.  I'm impatient.  I was angry. 

      Hector drives off at speed.  As he leaves, the Sheriff's  
      cruiser enters the other end of the lot.

                    Walk this way.


      'Start the weekend lunch' - a Summer Friday afternoon 
      tradition - is in full swing.  An outdoor grill, wine from 
      the barrel, and a convivial crowd getting buzzed for the 
      weekend.  The California Country bon temps are rolling. 

      Rigsby waits by the maitre d's desk - in his best slacks and 
      dress shirt - scanning the crowd with what he hopes does not 
      look like a policeman's suspicious glare (it does though, a 
      little). 

      Van Pelt appears, lovely in a summer dress.  Looks around for 
      Rigsby.  Rigsby makes an unconscious NOISE OF YEARNING.

                                  CHO (O.S.)

                    How do I look?

                    Good.  You look good.

                    I mean can you see the wire?

      Rigsby bends to peer closer at the flower on her bosom.


      Van Pelt and Rigsby are shown to their table on the terrace.  
      Van Pelt's red hair catches the light.

                                  JANE (O.S.)
                    ...is present him with something he 
                    can't resist.  Something he'll jump

      She is looking nice.

                    Ow.

      But he just sits there.  Everybody's still looking, but

                                  VAN PELT
                    You're meant to shout at me and go.

      Rigsby stands up, extremely self conscious.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Now you've gone too far! 

      Turns to walk away, but thinks of something, turns back...

      meal.  She's hungry.  Pour a glass of wine. 


      Rigsby joins Cho in the CBI van.

                                  CHO
                    Smooth work.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (grimly)
                    Don't.


      UNKNOWN POV, closer now - most customers have gone.  Van Pelt 
      has finished her meal and paid the check and stands up just a 
      tiny bit unsteadily.  Sandra intercepts her.

                                  SANDRA
                    Can I call you a cab, ma'am?

                                  VAN PELT
                    No, thank you.  I need a walk.  
                    I have a cab number if I need one. 
                    Thank you for a delicious meal.

      Van Pelt makes her way out of the restaurant.


      Van Pelt walks along a dark, shady, stretch of gravel road 
      through a forest of Eucalyptus and Magnolia.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I'm on the driveway now, walking 
                    toward the main road.

      We watch Van Pelt walk.  She's about to say something when A 
      MAN APPEARS OUT OF THE SHADOWS!  Van Pelt jumps.


      Rigsby and Cho jump.


      The Sheriff - for it is he - raises his hands.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Whoa, sorry miss.  Didn't see you 
                    there.  I was just... Are you okay?

                                  VAN PELT
                    No sure, absolutely.  Scared me a 
                    little. 


      Van Pelt continues walking.  The Sheriff keeps up.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Taking a stroll, huh?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Fresh air.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Only you need to be careful.  We've 
                    been looking for a murderer loose 
                    round here.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No kidding.

                                    SHERIFF 
                    Went after a girl just like you. 
                    Red hair and all.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No kidding.

                                    SHERIFF
                    I'll drive you to the main road.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Oh thank you but--

                    --No trouble.  My vehicle's just up 
                    along here.

                    Please advise.


      Cho and Rigsby share a glance.  Rigsby nods.

                                  CHO
                    Keep it rolling.  



      NB - As the scene proceeds three cars go by, including the 
      Shand Creek panel truck.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Excuse me?

                                  VAN PELT
                      I wasn't....

                                    SHERIFF
                    You're here alone?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    I had an argument with my date.

                                    SHERIFF
                    That's too bad.  You were my date I 
                    wouldn't argue.  A beautiful woman 
                    like you.  Here we go.

      He points down a dark side road. 

                                    SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                    My vehicle's this way.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's okay.  I'll walk.

      He stands in her way.  She tries to go around him, but he 
      won't let her.

                                    SHERIFF
                    Wait now miss.  I don't know if I 
                    should let you...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Really, I'm okay.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    48.

                    I think you're intoxicated miss.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I am not.

      Rigsby comes out of nowhere and shoves the Sheriff away from 
      Van Pelt.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Get your hands off her!

      The Sheriff falls on his ass, scrambles up, reaching for his 
      gun. 

                                    SHERIFF
                      Sonofabitch!  You are under arrest!

      But is forestalled by Rigsby showing his badge and gun.

                                  RIGSBY
                    No, you're under arrest, you piece

                    --Rigsby! Calm down!

      The Sheriff sees Cho come running up.

                                    SHERIFF 
                    Cho?  This clown's with you?  What 
                    in hell is going on here?

        A SHERRIFF'S DEPARTMENT VEHICLE with a DEPUTY at the wheel 
      comes rolling into view along the dark side road.  The 
      Sheriff was telling the truth.  The Deputy leans out of the 
      driver's window. 

                                  DEPUTY
                    Sheriff?  Everything okay?


      Lisbon strides to the (unmarked) CBI car, gets in, slams the 
      door.  Sits there a moment, fuming.  Takes out phone, speed 
      dials.

                                  LISBON
                    I'll be right there.


      Cho on the phone.  Rigsby and the Sheriff arguing in BG.    
      Van Pelt trying to mediate...

                                  CHO
                    That would be good.

                    What were you doing out here in the 
                    bushes?

                                    SHERIFF 
                    While my guys were searching the 
                    damn trees like your boss asked, 
                    I was urinating.  Is that okay with 
                    you, Agent?  Is that okay?


      Lisbon pockets her phone.  Behind her, the Shand Creek panel 
      truck comes rolling past and backs into the space outside 
      room 9A.  If Lisbon looks over her shoulder, she'll see the 
      truck.



      The burial of Melanie O'Keefe.  Mercedes, Joe, and Frankie at 
      the head of a small gathering.  Jane, Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt, 
      and Rigsby at the edge of the group, a little apart.  Lisbon 
      is still in shock.   

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don't understand it.  One crazy 
                    evil person, I understand, but two? 
                    Husband and wife?  Marriage should 
                    be a sacred, loving thing.

      Cho and Rigsby exchange guy looks.

                                  JANE
                    They were soulmates in their way.  
                    It's not just love that unites 
                    people.    

      As the mourners are walking away after the service, the 
      O'Keefes approach the CBI team.  Mercedes embraces Lisbon.

                                  MERCEDES
                    God bless you.

      Lisbon looks down at the ground.

      Jane and the CBI team leave.  Jane puts a consoling hand on 
      Lisbon's shoulder.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
