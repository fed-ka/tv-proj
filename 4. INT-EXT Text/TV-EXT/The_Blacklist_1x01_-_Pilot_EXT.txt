      We dance through the capitol city.  The National Mall.  The 
      Lincoln Memorial.  The pace is energetic and bright as --

      -- Red is chauffeured through the city by A MAN IN A GREY 
      FLANNEL SUIT.  Passing monuments reflect in the glass of his 
      limo as Red rolls down the window, drinks in his hometown.

      ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE...

      Red steps from the car.  Finds himself standing in the shadow 
      of a daunting concrete structure.  He looks up, delighted to 
      see the words etched in the facade: J. Edgar Hoover Building.

      INSIDE F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS...

      Red strides through the lobby with purpose.  He s been here 
      before.  Belongs here.  Finds his way to a FEMALE GUARD at 
      the security desk. 

                                  RED
                    Good afternoon.  I m here to see 
                    Assistant Director Harold Cooper.                                                                                      2.


                                  GUARD
                    Do you have an appointment?

                                  RED
                    Tell him it s Raymond Reddington.

      The Guard scowls and calls upstairs.  Red waits.  Takes in 
      the details around him; the bulletproof glass, the American 
      flag, the display of the  Ten Most Wanted  on the lobby wall.  

      Red takes off his jacket, folds it neatly, and places it on 
      the ground next to his briefcase.  

      The Female Guard listens to the voice on the other end of the 
      line, watching Red as --

      -- he lowers himself to his knees over the F.B.I. seal in the 
      terrazzo floor.  A passing AGENT sees this.  Looks uneasy.   

      The poor Guard on the phone can hardly comprehend what she s 
      hearing.  She follows Red s eyes.  Sees what Red sees.  He s 
      staring at a picture of HIS OWN FACE among...

      THE TEN MOST WANTED. 

      Red CLASPS HIS HANDS behind his head.  Closes his eyes.  The 
      Guard calls for backup, but before she can muster the words --  

      -- ALARMS SOUND.  METAL CURTAINS drop over the windows.  

      The entire F.B.I. goes into  LOCKDOWN  as F.B.I. POLICE swarm 
      Red, WEAPONS drawn and SCREAMING into their radios. 

      But Red s calm.  Proud perhaps.  As he s thrown to the ground 
      his expression tells us this is a day Red has anticipated for 
      years.  We DRIFT UP, over the chaos, past the American flag.

      The F.B.I. s NUMBER FOUR MOST WANTED has just surrendered.


      Liz s suburban rolls through the city.  We INTERCUT between 
      the vehicles.  Ressler and Liz are now separated.  It wasn t 
      planned this way, but the girl s safe.  SWAT teams trail in 
        bumper-lock.                                                                                    23.


      IN LIZ S SUBURBAN...

      The little girl stares at the fully armed SWAT Agent seated 
      across from her.  His radio crackles.

                                    RESSLER (O.S.)
                    Target onboard.  Notify McNair.

                                  DISPATCH (O.S.)
                    Copy.  You have an HRT escort.

      Beth s eyes well with tears as --

                                  LIZ
                    Can you turn that thing off?

      -- the little girl starts CRYING.  

                                  LIZ
                    Hey.  You re okay.  

                                  BETH
                    Is my Daddy hurt?

                                  LIZ
                    Oh, no.  Your Daddy s fine.  We re 
                    on our way to see him right now.
                          (searching)
                    Hey, your name s Beth, right?  I m 
                    Beth.  Elizabeth.  My friends call 
                    me Liz.

                                  BETH
                    My Daddy has a pin like that.

      She s looking at the AMERICAN FLAG PIN on Liz s lapel --

                                  LIZ
                    I bet Daddy has lots of medals.

      -- Liz sees the caravan is crossing the Potomac.  They pass 
      over the massive WOODROW WILSON BRIDGE, escaping Washington. 

                                  LIZ
                    To get a pin like this you gotta be 
                    really brave, like your Dad.  Like 
                    you were back there.

      Liz removes the pin from her lapel and pins it on Beth s 
      sweater.  Beth touches the pin.  It reflects the sunlight.  
      She forgets her tears as --

      -- Beth looks at her own CHARM BRACELET.  Kiddie jewelry.  A 
      trinket from a gum ball machine.  She takes it off and starts 
      to clip it around Liz s wrist.                                                                                     24.


                                  LIZ
                    Oh, you don t have to give me...
                          (smiles)
                    Thank you.  It s beautiful.

                                  BETH
                    It s a charm bracelet.  It s got  
                    little animals.  

      Beth leans into Liz.  Feeling safe now.  Liz puts her arm 
      around the girl.  She s got a way of putting kids at ease.    

                                  LIZ
                    You re safe with me. 

      Liz spots a few tail lights ahead --

                                  LIZ
                          (into her radio)
                    What s going on up ahead?

                                    RESSLER (O.S.)
                    Accident.  Dispatch is re-routing.

      Liz eyes the accident as their suburban slows.  Ressler gets 
      out, talks with an officer, but Liz senses something.  Eerie 
      silence.  She considers their stalled caravan as she looks in 
      the rearview mirror to see --

      -- the bridge lights and traffic signals FLICKERING OUT.  One 
      by one, the power outage races toward them like a tidal wave.

                                  LIZ
                    It s happening...
                          (into her radio)
                    IT S HAPPENING!

      The entire bridge LURCHES.  Cars SHAKE.  Ressler looks down 
      to see the steel plates between his feet open up --

                                    RESSLER
                    The bridge.  Turn around.  GO! 

      -- THE DRAWBRIDGE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED.

      We INTERCUT among the caravan.  Vehicles jockeying to perform 
      three point turns as the bridge begins to incline.  Liz s 
      suburban is sideways in the road when she looks up to see -- 

      -- A GARBAGE TRUCK barreling toward them.

                                  LIZ
                    GET DOWN.                                                                                    25.


      Liz covers Beth with her body as the garbage truck SLAMS into 
      the driver-side of their suburban.  GLASS SPRAYS.  The driver 
      is killed on impact as the suburban is SHOVED toward --

      -- THE RISING GAP IN THE BRIDGE and across the interlocking 
      seam.  Gears turn.  The traffic decks RISE UP to a FIFTEEN 
      PERCENT INCLINE.  A man leaps from his car before it falls 
      through the widening gap into the Potomac below. 

      Now TWENTY PERCENT.  Rising.  Liz realizes her suburban is 
      now on the OTHER SIDE of the traffic deck.  The gap in the 
      drawbridge has effectively separated Liz and Beth from the 
      rest of the caravan.  At TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT --

      -- cars begin to scoot.  SLIDING downward.  Liz looks to see 
      a TEAM OF MASKED KIDNAPPERS racing up the traffic deck toward 
      her.  Past her car.  They race to the apex of the bridge and 
      anchor GRAPPLING HOOKS into the steel decking.  

      THIRTY PERCENT.  Pedestrians tumble down the traffic deck.  
      Agents scramble to no avail.  The Kidnappers drop back down 
      toward Liz on RAPPELLING LINES, scooting with the car.  One 
      Kidnapper takes out a gun and -- 

      KA-BAMM

      -- SHOOTS THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Kills Liz s SWAT Agent.  Blood 
      spray hits Liz.  Beth SCREAMS.  Liz tumbles and lands against 
      the windshield.  Loses her gun.  The door above them opens to 
      reveal a MASKED KIDNAPPER.

                                  LIZ
                    Take my hand, Beth.  Stay with me.

      The Kidnapper climbs into the car.  Reaching for Beth.  Liz 
      swats at him as he GRABS THE LITTLE GIRL.  She reaches out -- 

                                  LIZ
                    BETH.  TAKE MY HAND.

      -- they lock eyes.  FORTY PERCENT.  The girl grabs Liz s hand 
      but suddenly the suburban falls.  Liz goes with it.  As the 
      car falls away, the Kidnapper s left holding Beth, dangling 
      from the rappelling line as --

      -- Liz s car ROLLS TWICE.  Lands hard.  The Kidnappers 
      holding Beth climb up toward the apex of the bridge which is 
      now fully open.  Below --

      ON THE POTOMAC

      -- a SPEEDBOAT arrives.  The Kidnappers rappel down, girl in 
      hand, into the boat.  As they speed away Liz opens her eyes.  
      Her world slips into focus.  She reaches out.  Lying among 
      the splintered glass she finds... BETH S CHARM BRACELET.                                                                                     26.



      An F.B.I. convoy escorts RED S ARMORED TRUCK past uniformed 
      guards and onto the historic U.S. military base on Greenleaf 
      Point.  Majestic views of the Potomac.  Sprawling lawns.


      Red steps from his armored vehicle and takes in his new home; 
      a breathtaking COLONIAL MANSION overlooking the Potomac.  The 
      Army owned home is not only historic, but one of the most 
      well protected estates in all of Washington.

      INSIDE RED S HOUSE...

      Agents remove the mirrors and silverware.  Cameras are 
      installed.  Red admires the beautiful coffered ceilings.  
      It s a fitting home for a military man. 


      Ressler finds Liz looking out at the boat yard, drinking in 
      the beauty of the water.  A rare moment of peace.

                                    RESSLER
                    They found the lab.  Interrogating 
                    the Chemist as we speak.

                                  LIZ
                    We have the Chemist?

                                    RESSLER
                    Big fish, right?  Based on what we 
                    pulled from his lab we think we ve 
                    caught it in time.  Shut down his 
                      operation.  We re making progress.

                                  LIZ
                    What about the bomb?                                                                                    36.


                                    RESSLER
                    HDS is running samples.  We ll have 
                    results within hours.

      Liz stares out at the water.  He lights a cigarette.

                                  LIZ
                    I didn t choose any of this.

      He doesn t believe her.

                                    RESSLER
                          (feigned)
                    Of course not.  He chose you.  
                    There s a bigger picture we re not 
                    seeing, but we will.  Give it time.

                                  LIZ
                    I gotta clear my head.  Get out of 
                    here for a bit.  Grab a shower. 

                                    RESSLER
                    Don t go too far.

      As she walks away, he watches her go.  There s not a bone in 
      Ressler s body that trusts this woman. 


      It s raining now.  Liz sits in her car.  Hiding from the 
      world and sobbing.  Her emotions swelling inside until --

      -- Liz repeatedly POUNDS THE STEERING WHEEL in a violent 
      outburst.  The surge of pure rage CATAPULTS us to:


      It s quiet.  The silence is jarring.  Liz stands with Ressler 
      and Cooper outside the house.  Liz is still shaky.  

                                    RESSLER
                    Why would he try to kill himself?

                                  LIZ
                    Why s he doing any of this?  It 
                    happened.  I can t explain.

                                    RESSLER
                    Your back was conveniently toward 
                    the camera, so the footage is 
                      inconclusive, but you know what I 
                    think?  I think you re lying.  
                    You ve lost your objectivity --

                                  LIZ
                      Objectivity?  What do you expect? 

                                  COOPER
                    Liz, calm down.

                                  LIZ
                    My husband was stabbed.  He s on 
                    life support.  I have a house full 
                    of beat cops waiting for my 
                      statement.

                                  COOPER
                    Liz, this is about your safety.  
                    The last thing I want is you in the 
                    same room with this guy.

                                  LIZ
                          (realizing)
                    Don t push me out of this.

                                  COOPER
                    Liz.  It s not a request.  Go home.  

      Liz turns, defeated.  As she walks away they watch her go.                                                                                     43.


                                    RESSLER
                          (mistrustful)
                    Doesn t feel right.  There s 
                    something she s not telling us.  


      The hand of a child is STAMPED at the entry.  The same PENNY-
      SIZED TATTOO Liz saw on Zamani s hand: an ADMISSION STAMP.                                                                                    50.


      INSIDE THE ZOO...

      Liz pushes past families.  Children everywhere.  She spots 
      BETH SITTING ON A BENCH.  The little girl looks terrified.  

                                  LIZ
                    Beth, remember me?  Are you alone?

                                  BETH
                    He said to wait here for my Daddy.

      Liz sees Beth s BACKPACK and carefully unzips it to reveal --

      THE BOMB.                                                  

      It s a marvel of molded plastic and parallel circuitry.  A 
      digital countdown reads  00:03 MIN / 00:13 SEC .  Liz takes a 
      heart pounding breath.  Reaches for the shoulder strap.

                                  BETH
                          (through tears)
                    He said not to take it off...

      Beth unzips her sweater to reveal a TANGLE OF WIRES wrapped 
      around her torso.  The backpack is booby trapped.  Slowly, 
      Liz reaches out.  Her phone RINGS.  She JUMPS.  Answers. 

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    Whatever you do, don t touch it.

                                  LIZ
                    There s less than three minutes.  I 
                    gotta evacuate... call the bomb --

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    Your people will never be there in 
                    time.  My friend.  He s on his way.  

                                  LIZ
                    Your friend?  What [friend] --

      The call disconnects as we re HURLED BACK TO:


      Liz is on the phone, calling for backup, when she glances at 
      the timer on the bomb.   01 MIN / 00:16 SEC .  Their fate is 
      all but sealed.  Liz looks to Beth.  Behind her, she sees --

      -- a UKRAINIAN MAN WITH A DUFFLE BAG emerge through the sea 
      of kids.  He s bald.  Blond eyebrows.  Looks like a thumb.  
      The Ukrainian sits on the bench next to Beth and removes a 
      TOOL KIT from his bag.  

                                  LIZ
                    Who are you?  What are you doing?

      The Ukrainian barks at Liz in Slavic as he cuts open Beth s 
      backpack with a pair of surgical scissors.

                                  LIZ
                    I don t know what you re saying.   

      He motions for them to be still.  Liz holds Beth.  Watches in 
      disbelief as the Ukrainian works to dismantle the bomb.  Beth 
      tries not to move, but she can t help it.  The Ukrainian is 
      frantic.  Screaming.  Confusion in a foreign language.  Beth 
      cries as Liz sees --

      --  00:32 SEC .  This is it.  She finds Beth s eyes.                                                                                    52.


                                  LIZ 
                    You know, I was really scared once, 
                    too.  I was all alone, but I had a 
                    secret weapon to help me.  My Daddy 
                    gave it to me.  You wanna see my 
                    secret weapon?

      Beth quivers.  Nods yes.  Liz slowly, gently, opens her palm 
      to reveal her BURN SCAR.

                                  LIZ
                    I never show this to anybody.  It s 
                    super special.  Like magic.

                                  BETH
                    What does it do?

      Liz is soft and calm.  Pure motherly instinct.

                                  LIZ
                    Any time I feel scared or afraid I 
                    touch it... and it makes all the 
                    bad things go away, makes me brave.   
                    Do you want to see if it can make 
                    you brave?  

      Beth nods.  Places her palm in Liz s palm.  As she does, Liz 
      wraps her free arm around the girl and closes her eyes.  The 
      SOUND EVAPORATES.  Tranquil silence.  It s as if the entire 
      world falls away, nothing else matters, until --

                                  UKRAINIAN
                     ZASNY!!!

      -- Liz s eyes POP OPEN.  The Ukrainian throws his arms around 
      Liz, talking a mile a minute.  Kiss her square on the mouth. 

                                  LIZ
                    Did you stop it?

      He removes the bomb from the backpack.  The countdown clock 
      is stopped at  00:12 SEC .  A collective exhale as --

                                  LIZ
                    HE STOPPED IT.

      -- the Ukrainian places the device in his duffle bag.

                                  LIZ
                    What?  Wait.  What are you...

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    Consider the device his payment.                                                                                    53.


      The Ukrainian turns to see RED approaching through the crowd.  
      They embrace.  The Ukrainian picks Red up in a full-on bear 
      hug.  He then turns and zips his bag, blows Liz a kiss, and 
      saunters off into the zoo with a bomb in his duffle bag. 

                                  LIZ
                    What the -- WAIT!  He can t... 
                    that s a biological weapon.

                                  RED
                    He s fascinated with the things.  
                    Has more use for it than I do.
                          (to Beth)
                    Run along, now.  Daddy s here.

      Beth whips around to see GENERAL RYKER running toward them.  
      With RESSLER.  Surrounded by agents.  Beth grabs Liz s hand.  
      Looks at the scar.  It really is magic.  As the AGENTS rush 
      in, Red lowers himself to his knees, hands behind his head.  

                                  LIZ
                    I m gonna ask you again.  I deserve 
                    the truth.  Did you send Zamani to 
                    kill my husband?

                                  RED
                    We re going to make a great team.

      F.B.I. AGENTS storm Red.  Guns drawn.  Ressler takes him down 
      but Red s eyes never leave Liz.  He smiles as if she has just 
      passed some strange, perverted test. 

                                  BETH (O.S.)
                    DADDY!

      General Ryker lowers himself to his knee and Beth jumps into 
      her father s arms.  As they embrace, Ryker smiles to Liz.  

                                    GENERAL RYKER
                    Thank you.

      A weight is lifted.  Liz s shoulder s drop.  We HEAR:

                                  COOPER (O.S.)
                    Who.  Is.  The Ukrainian?

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    His name slips my memory.
