      INT. GROCERY MART - NIGHT11

       Stay Awake  pills.  A cute blonde woman (20s), grabs them 
      from a display:

                                  WOMAN
                    Look, I ll worry about getting 
                    addicted to pills when I get out of 
                    med school.  Right now, I ve got 
                    mid-terms, and I need this. 

    She and her date start toward the cash register in a family-
    run grocery mart, mostly empty, when-- BOOM-- the front door 
      bangs open, a man blasting in, firing a gun into the ceiling!  

                                  ROBBER
                    Everybody shut up, and don t move!  

    The ROBBER.  African-American.  Large.  Mid-20s.  In a 
      Chicago Bulls sweatshirt.  He hops the counter, shoves the 
      Persian store-owner to the floor, slams open the cash 
      register when-- 

                                  ROBBER (CONT D)
                    What you staring at?!  Get down!  *

    The woman and her date drop hurriedly down.  Both peering up, 
      seeing the robber shoving cash into his pockets.  But the 
      woman turns, sees...

      ...a customer creeping up the aisle, gun drawn.  A PLAIN-
      CLOTHES COP.  He gestures toward her: shhh, and he JUMPS UP:

                                  UNDERCOVER COP
                    CHICAGO P.D.!  DON T MOVE!

      But-- BOOM-- the Robber fires, blasting a cereal box near the 
      cop s head!  The cop fires back, hitting tequila bottles 
      behind the Robber s head, and we see...

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY22

      ...it s a TV movie playing on a monitor in the downstairs 
      conference room.  Five lawyers watching.  ALICIA, CARY, a few 
    we haven t met yet.  No one seated: the screening arranged on 
    the fly.  On the screen...

      ...BOOM-- the Robber fires again-- the cop hit, mid-chest.  
      Slow motion, he waves his arms, starts to drop, as the Med 
      Student on the floor screams, silently, in slow-motion, as... 






                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    2.

                                  CARY
                    Oh, come on.  Talk about  undue 
                      publicity. You re telling me that
                    didn t affect the jury pool--?!

                                  BREE
                    No, I m saying we don t have time!  

      Looking up at a clock is BREE (31), mid-level litigator, most 
      senior person in the room.  Dresses and argues meticulously.  
      Intelligence to her is an aphrodisiac.  The argument fast:

                                  BREE (CONT D)
                    We have fifty-five minutes to get 
                    this brief to the county clerk.  If 
                    we re late, Clarence Wilcox stays 
                    on death row.  We can t risk it. 

      But-- BOOOM-- they all look toward the screen, the Robber 
      blasting two shots into the cop s head.  Cary points at it:

                                  CARY
                    We can t notrisk it.  The  undue 
                    publicity  argument is the weakest 
                    part of the brief--

      Alicia peers toward Cary: interesting that he s the 
      passionate one on this.  

                                  BREE
                    --Which would be a problem if it 
                    were the only part of the brief.  
                    We ve got five other solid 
                    arguments in there--  

                                  ALICIA
                    Let s ask Will.

      They all look at her.  The power of the rarely offered 
      opinion.

                                  BREE
                    He ll agree with me.

                                  ALICIA
                    Good, then it ll be settled.

      Cary smiles, peers toward Alicia: odd they re in agreement. 

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Look, if it doesn t end up in the 
                    brief, Will can t use it in oral 
                    arguments.  Right?

      Bree brushes her hair back nervously.  Jeez.  53 minutes now.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    3.
      CONTINUED: (2)22


                                  BREE
                    This is crazy.  There s no time to 
                    write it.

      Clearly that s a yes.  Alicia bursts out the door, Cary too, 
      running, starting up the stairs, Bree yelling after them:

                                  BREE (CONT D)
                    It ll mean open heart surgery on 
                    the brief!

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAYS - DAY33

      Cary and Alicia turn the corner, moving fast. 

                                  ALICIA
                    This is odd.  

                                  CARY
                    Yeah.  We can compete tomorrow.

      Alicia smiles, liking him at that moment, as they rush up to 
      Will s door... 

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY44

      Will looks up: Yeah?

                                  ALICIA
                    We think we have time to add one 
                    more argument to the Legal Aid 
                    appeal, but we need to do it 
                    quickly.

                                  WILL
                          (looks at watch)
                     Quickly  would seem to be an 
                    understatement.  What time s the 
                    cut-off?

                                  CARY
                    5 pm.  There was a cable TV movie 
                    broadcast a week before jury 
                    selection.  We believe it 
                    influenced the jury.

                                  WILL
                          (hmmm, interesting)
                    Why didn t Legal Aid pursue it?  

                                  CARY
                    We don t know.   

                                  WILL
                    Can you do it in 48 minutes?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    4.

                    Just.

      Will takes a second, rubs his chin, then... nods-- go-- and 
      Cary and Alicia blast out the door...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAYS - DAY55

                                  CARY
                    You re the faster typist.

                                  ALICIA
                    We need to get cable viewership in 
                    Cook County. 

                                  CARY
                    I m on it.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY66

      And-- wham-- Alicia almost slams the  return  key on her 
      laptop, her office filled with lawyers, people arguing, 
      overlapping, all points important, but Alicia typing.  Just 
      racing forward.  Trying to block them out.  Bursting in:

                                  CARY
                    I got cable viewership from six 
                    years ago-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    Just give me the numbers.

                                  CARY
                    It s not broken out by program.

                                  ALICIA
                    What?!

    All the lawyers grab for some of his paper.  Helping.  Bree 
      checks the clock...

                                  BREE
                    We re not going to make it.  

                                  ALICIA
                    We have twenty minutes.  We e-mail 
                    it, and-- damn.

                                  ALICIA
                    Shh--!

      Alicia hurriedly cuts and pastes as Cary tosses the paper:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    5.

                                  ALICIA
                    Ask upstairs if he needs it?

      Right.  Cary bursts out the door, races toward the stairs.    

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY77

    He again races to Will s office, out of breath now, Will in 
      with Diane.  Cary composes himself, knocks...

                                  WILL
                    Yeah?

                                  CARY
                    We re almost done with the TV movie 
                    argument, but we can t specify the 
                    saturation of the jury pool.

                                  WILL
                    You don t have the ratings broken

                    Okay, we ll slip it into a Friend 
                    of the Court brief.  Just submit

                          (checks a clock: ten to five)
                    ...now.

      Right.  Cary bursts out the door, running.  Leaving Diane and 
      Will.  Diane looks to Will: what was that?

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    The appeal Legal Aid couldn t

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY88

    But in Alicia s office, it s still chaos, everybody seemingly 
      leaning over Alicia s shoulder, talking at the same time, 
      looking up toward the clock.  Five minutes.  

                                  BREE
                    The typo!  There!  No, there!

      Cary sees Alicia s trying to concentrate, yells: 

                                  CARY
                    SHUT UP!

      And... everybody does.  Silence.  The office crowded, but 
      quiet, as Alicia scans the paragraphs she just wrote.  Cary 
      peers up toward the clock-- two minutes-- carefully hits 
      speed dial on his cell, whispers in the silence:

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    This is Cary Agos at Stern, 
                    Lockhart, and Gardner.  We have a 
                    death row appeal coming to you...

    He looks toward Alicia.  She nods, hits a  send  key.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    ...now.  If you don t mind I ll 
                    stay on the line and make sure you

      A second.  Another second.  Everybody waiting.  Looking 
      toward Cary.  He shakes his head.  Alicia peers toward the 
    top bar on her computer s desktop: the faded WiFi icon...

                                  ALICIA
                    Dammit, WiFi s low!  Come on, come 
                    on.

                    You re sure?  You don t see it?

      Alicia again hitting  send.   Eyeing the WiFi bar.  It 
      strengthens... slightly. One more bar!  She looks up toward 
      Cary.  Well?  He smiles:

                    Good to know, thank you.

      INT. ILLINOIS APPELATE COURT - DAY1010

      ...thump-- a brief is dropped on the appellant's table in the 
      well of the Illinois AppelateCourt by... Will.  Behind him 
    sit Bree, Cary, and Alicia.  Waiting for the three justices 
    to arrive at their bench.  The court isn t crowded: just 
      another day hearing appeals.  Alicia peers back, sees...

      ...KALINDA entering, starting down the aisle toward them when 
    she hears someone calling  Hey, K.!   She turns, sees a clump 
    of cops.  Goes to them.  Two detectives and two uniformed.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Showing support for the home team?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Oh, yeah.  Come on, K., come back 
                    home.

      ALEC SHORES (35).  A suited version of THE SHIELD.  Muscular.  
      Intimidation is attitude, not physical.  He really likes 
      Kalinda: a kindred spirit.  Next to him sits another suited 
      detective, MULLER (38), African-American, a get-along type.

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey, your people fired me.

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Florrick fired you.  Come on, we 
                    miss your accent.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah, tell Mike to stop ticketing 
                    my car for registration violations.

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    That s the way he shows love.  

      Kalinda laughs, crosses to her seat behind Alicia who shoots 
    her a look.  Whispers:

                                  ALICIA
                    Nice time?

                    People of the State of Illinois vs. 
                    Clarence Wilcox.  

    The three robed Illinois AppelateJustices.  Now in their 
      chairs.  Will approaches the lone podium as...

                                  CHIEF JUSTICE (CONT D)
                    Mr. Gardner, we ve read your brief, 
                    and we re now prepared for oral 
                    arguments.  You may begin.

                                  WILL
                    Thank you, Chief Justice.  May it 
                    please the court... six years ago 
                    Clarence Wilcox, a 24-year-old 
                    Chicago man, was arrested for the 
                    murder of a plainclothes officer 
                    during the robbery of a grocery 
                    store in South Chicago.  

    We find Alicia subtly reciting the opening words to herself: 
        a well-rehearsed opening...

                                  WILL (CONT'D)
                    It is our contention that Clarence 
                    Wilcox did not receive a fair 
                    trial.  He has spent the last six 
                    years on death row due to--  

                                  CHIEF JUSTICE
                          (interrupting)
                    Mr. Gardener.  Please explain your 
                     undue publicity  arguments.  

      Will looks up, surprised, as Cary turns to Alicia: fuck yeah.  

                                  WILL
                    Yes, your honor.  It is our 
                    contention that Clarence Wilcox--

                                  CHIEF JUSTICE
                    How is it different from the Scott 
                    Peterson appeal?  That also 
                    involved a TV movie released prior 
                    to jury selection.

      Will nods-- the TV movie argument-- and turns slightly toward 
      Alicia and Cary:-- the closest a partner gets to a shout-out.  

                                  WILL
                    Yes, well, your honor, in that 
                    case, the TV movie didn t show the 
                    Peterson character murdering his 
                    victim.  In COP KILLER, our client 
                    is shown shooting the victim.

    The justices pause.  A surprisingly good point.  Cary lowers 
    his hand below his seat, and Alicia smiles, privately low-
      fives it.  And...

      INT. ILLINOIS APPELATE COURT - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY1111

      ...oral arguments over, Bree, Cary, Alicia, and other lawyers 
      quietly cheer, pat each other on the back as Will nods, 
      collecting his papers: 

                                  WILL
                    Yeah, nice last minute Hail Mary 
                    with the TV movie.  Justices love 
                    novelty in arguments.

                                  BREE
                    Can you get a preview on the 
                    decision?

                                  WILL
                    Let me see what I can find out.  
                    But don t get your hopes up.  95% 
                    of automatic appeals are rejected 
                    out of hand.  But good job.

      Will starts off, followed by teacher s pet, Cary, as Alicia 
      smiles, feels good about the case, collects her papers, 
      briefcase, depos when she finds... 

      ...a woman staring at her.  In the first row of seats.  
      PATRICE WILCOX (34).  African-American.  Voice innocent.  
      Eyes wide.  Overwhelmed.  She holds the hand of her 7-year-
    old daughter.  Norman Rockwell would be proud.

                                  PATRICE
                    Sorry to bother you, but my name s 
                    Patrice Wilcox.
                          (Alicia confused)
                    Clarence s wife.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, of course, I m so sorry.  
                    Alicia Florrick.  

                                  PATRICE
                    Do you know why Clarence wasn t in 
                    court today? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Why?  Well-- During an automatic 
                    appeal, the defendant s not usually 
                    seated.  Didn t anyone tell you?  

    No.  Patrice is at once embarrassed and disappointed.  This 
    is making Alicia uncomfortable.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    10.
      CONTINUED:1111


                                  PATRICE
                    So you re his new lawyers then?

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  Legal Aid didn t have the 
                    staff to argue the appeal, so we re 
                    just on temporarily. 

      Alicia pauses, realizes this sounds officious.  

                                  PATRICE
                    Because you never said anything 
                    about Clarence being innocent.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, unfortunately, that wasn t the 
                    point of this appeal.  It was 
                    whether some mistake was made in 
                    the law.  

                                  PATRICE
                    But isn t it a mistake in the law 
                    if he didn t do it?  If he was with 
                    me that night?

      Alicia stares at her.  A woman more heartbroken than angry.  

                                  PATRICE (CONT D)
                    Have you ever even met him? 
                          (Alicia shakes her head)
                    And you re arguing for his life?

      Alicia feels punched in the stomach.  Patrice reaches into 
    her purse, takes out a photo:

                                  PATRICE (CONT D)
                    I want you to have this.  That s 
                    the last time he held his daughter.  

    She leaves the photo with Alicia and starts up the aisle with 
    her daughter.  Alicia feels naked, standing there, photo in 
    her hand.  She looks down at it.   Clarence on a beach, 
      holding his infant daughter, waving.  Alicia hears... 

      ...a side-door opening.  Looks over, sees Will exiting.  
      Crossing toward the table, stacking up his papers.  

                                  WILL
                    We lost the appeal.

                    Actual innocence?

      Kalinda, her feet up on Alicia s desk, chair leaning back.

                    Yes.

                                  KALINDA
                    We lost the automatic appeal; now 
                    you want to appeal on actual 
                    innocence?

                                  ALICIA
                    I read the trial record.  The 
                    defense never put his wife on the 
                    stand.  She was his alibi, and the 
                    jury never heard from her.

                                  KALINDA
                    Because... wives lie.  I can t 
                    believe I have to be telling you 
                    this.  And she had priors.

                    I read the trial record too.

                    When I worked at the States 
                    Attorney s office, we called these 
                     appeals by hunch.   This guy had 
                    his trial.  An expensive trial.  He 
                    killed a cop...

                    That means  not allegedly.   That 
                    means he killed a cop.  And

      Alicia and Kalinda.  They take a moment staring at each 
      other.  And Alicia starts out.  Kalinda calls after her:  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    I m not helping on this one.  Not a 
                      cop-killer.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAYS - DAY1313

      Alicia turns a corner from the top of the stairs, sees Will 
    in his office, talking with Diane and... Cary.  Cary?  What s 
      that about?  She slows, slows.   Will gestures her in.  

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY1414

                                  WILL
                    Cary wants to take a week on 
                    Clarence Wilcox.  See if there s 
                    any foundation for an evidentiary 
                    appeal.  

      Alicia looks toward Cary: really?  He shrugs: what the hell?

                    On actual innocence.

                                  WILL
                    We think it s a good idea.  For a

                    It s good promotable work.  And, 
                    not to sound too cynical, but it 
                    burns off the hours we owe the pro 
                    bono consortium.

                                  WILL
                    So are you two up to doing this?  

      Cary and Alicia trade a look.

                                  DIANE
                    You did a good job on the Wilcox

      Alicia and Cary start away.  Alicia looks over at him.

                                  CARY
                    What?  It s a good cause.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I m just trying to fit this into 
                    the fuller Cary picture.

                                  CARY
                    Hey, there aren t that many

                    greatest generation, the lost

      Alicia smiles as they stop at the elevators.  

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Look, the truth is, his wife came 
                    up to me yesterday.  With his 
                    daughter.  Really cute, you know.  
                    Gave me this.

    The photo.  Clarence with daughter.  Alicia laughs.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    What?  It meant something to me.

    No, no.  Alicia takes out her photo.  Identical.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Oh, wow.

      Alicia nods-- true-- as they get on the elevator.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    I m kind of liking her more now.

                    for doing this.  Thank you.

    But Alicia just smiles knowingly, takes out one of the 
      pictures of Clarence on the beach.  Then Cary appears behind 
    her with another.  Patrice smiles, unembarrassed.  Dropping 
    the innocent act:

                                  PATRICE (CONT D)
                    Would you have pursued it if I

                    That s what I said.

                                  ALICIA
                    So, what, do you hand these out 
                    like party favors? 

                                  PATRICE
                    Lawyers tend to forget he s a 
                    person.   Look, I love my husband.  
                    He s innocent.  I know he s 
                    innocent.  And I would do anything 
                    for him.  Anything.

      A door opens and JOSH BALDWIN leans out (40 s, a low rent but 
      high energy lawyer).

                    It handled only four or five cases 
                    a year.  So they put all their

    But Alicia takes the kit from him.  Pushes an  on  button on

    Oh.  Alicia takes a second with that, as Baldwin laughs...

      A pile of boxes in a store room.  Cary pulls over a chair, 
      starts to climb it, as Alicia slides the blood pressure cuff *

      INT. HOSPITAL - DAY1717

      A female Doctor on break.  DR. TARA ROTHBART (35), warm, 
      likable, with an infectious laugh, and nothing like her 
      blonde counterpart in the TV movie.  Just the opposite.  

                                  TARA
                    It was awful, wasn t it?  My dad 
                    taped it for me.  
                          (Cary and Alicia chuckle)
                    First of all, I was in there buying 
                    cat food.  And I was alone!  I m *
                    suddenly this blonde co-ed who *

                    Well, I did see him-- Wilcox-- that 
                    was true.  He ran in, fired his 
                    gun, yelled at me to kiss the 
                    floor, but I peered up, and I saw 
                    him kill that police officer. *

      Cary and Alicia pause.  The certainty, and the calm of her 
      certainty, is pretty devastating.

                                  ALICIA

                    the prosecutor s job to stop you.  
                    And it s my job to tell the truth.  

      Alicia and Cary stare at her.  She smiles.  A wonderful

                                  WILL

      It s a video playing on a laptop, Will watching it intensely.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE
                    Just watch.

      JOLIE (38), a serious-- perhaps over-serious-- psychologist.  
      A little brittle, but intent on her work.  Will watches the 
    man look quickly toward the camera then run off.  

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE (CONT D)
                    Okay, the police believe that man 
                    just killed someone, and you are 
                    the only eyewitness.  So...

    She clicks a laptop key and-- blink-- an array of six mugshot 
      photos pop up: front and side views (a six-pack).  Will leans 
    in to study them as do the other occupants of the conference 
      room: Cary, Bree, a few other lawyers.  Only...

      ...Kalinda sits back.  Incredulous, doubtful, impatient.

                    one.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE
                    You re confident?

                    I m confident.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE
                    You re wrong.
                          (Will laughs: you re 
                            kidding)
                    The culprit isn t one of these.  

      Kalinda rolls her eyes.  The easily entertained partners.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE (CONT D)
                    This is when we explain to the jury 
                    about cross-racial identification.  
                    Studies still haven t adequately 
                    explained why, but it s harder for 
                    Caucasians to identify subtle 
                      differences in African-American 
                    faces, and African-Americans in 
                      Caucasians.  

                                  KALINDA
                    And how much do you charge to say 
                    that?

      They all turn to Kalinda.  The blunt Cassandra at the dinner 
      party.

                    Well, we filed an evidentiary 
                    appeal.  We don t know if we have 
                    it yet.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE
                          (to Kalinda)
                    Would you like to try it?

      Kalinda shrugs.  Approaches the laptop.  Jolie clicks a key 
    and another short video plays, this one closer: another 
      culprit.  Caucasian.  Near a playground.  Glimpsed through 
      monkey bars.  He shoots a look toward the camera, then runs 
      off.  A caustic eye:

                                  KALINDA
                    Let me guess: a terrorist?

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE
                    You don t need a story, do you?

      Kalinda doesn t.  She clicks a key.  Another six-pack pops 
    up.  Kalinda scans the photos as Will and Diane shoot a smile 
      toward each other.  Kalinda taking this very seriously.

                                  KALINDA
                    It s none of them.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE
                    You re confident?

      Kalinda shoots her a look: are you serious?  Okay, Jolie 
      takes a second.  Reaches slowly toward a computer key, taps 
    it.  And the third mugshot pops to the front, next to the 
      frozen playground image.

                                  PROFESSOR JOLIE (CONT D)
                    Nope, number three.

      Kalinda.  She s startled for a second.  Looks between the two 
      pictures.  The same person.  She considers it.  And...

      Shores, feet up on his desk, laughing with a circle of suited

                    Yep, it looks that way.

      Shores laughs.  Kalinda perches on the desk, lets her hands 
      rest casually on Shores  ankles, his feet still on the desk. 

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)

                    That was six years ago.

                    Lady came in.  Described the 
                    suspect.  Black man, six foot, mid-
                    20s.  In a Bulls sweat top.  Seemed 
                    pretty certain.  We had Howie do a 
                    sketch.  

      Kalinda pulls a SKETCH from a file under her arm.

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES (CONT D)
                    Yep.  We found your guy.  Matched 
                    the sketch.  Had blood spatter on 
                    his sweat top.  Tried to wash the 
                    blood out, failed.  We put him in a 
                    line-up.  Six guys.  All black.  
                    All the same height, same build.  
                    Lady pointed right at him.

                    What about a six-pick?  Did you 
                    show her a six-pack first?

      Shores pauses.  Only the slightest second.

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Is it in the investigative report?
                          (Kalinda is silent)
                    Then no.  Wow, you ve lost your 
                    sense of humor these days.

      Kalinda smiles.  Humor this.  She lifts his legs, tips him 
      over backward.  Shores hits the floor, laughs, clamors up, 
      watches her go.

      EXT. CHICAGO PD - PARKING LOT - DAY2020

      Kalinda starts toward her car.  Sees Muller leaning against 
    it.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey, Muller, what s up?

    But Muller just passes her, starts off.  That s odd.  Kalinda 
      considers it, sees her driver-side window open just an inch.  

      Uh-oh.  She carefully opens her car door, finds...

      ...a manila folder there.  Oh.  She opens it.  A xeroxed SIX-
      PACK PHOTO ARRAY.  Clarence and five other black men.  
      Kalinda studies it, and immediately swears under her breath.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY2121

      Slap-- Kalinda drops the photo array in front of Alicia.

                                  ALICIA
                    I thought you weren t helping on 
                    this one.  

      Okay, Kalinda reaches to take the folder back, but-- no, no-- 
      Alicia holds onto it, opens it...

                                  KALINDA
                    The eyewitness described him as a 
                    six foot black man, mid-twenties, 
                    in a Bulls sweatshirt.  

      Alicia studies the photos: all black men, all twenties, 
      and... one stands out.  Clarence Wilcox.  Still in his Bulls 
      sweatshirt.

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh my god.

                    Yep, the only one in a Bulls 
                      sweatshirt.  They showed the 
                    eyewitness this six-pack before the

                                  ALICIA
                    Gotta get this to Will.  It s 
                    enough for an evidentiary appeal.

                                  KALINDA
                    Probably.  If you re going all the 
                    way with this, you ll have to talk 
                    to your husband.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    What case?

                                  KALINDA
                    Clarence Wilcox.

      Peter smiles, grins.  A knowing grin.  

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    She s defending the cop-killer?
                          (Kalinda nods)
                    But he did it.  You know he did it.

                                  KALINDA
                    What I know and what I don t have 
                    shifted a bit.  

      Peter.  The gears turning his head.  Realizing something.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    This comes back to Childs.  He was 
                    the top man on that case.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep, he s not happy about the 
                    retrial.

      Peter nods.  Laughs.  Thinking it through.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    This could hurt him.

                                  KALINDA
                    It could.

                    It s an interesting dynamic, isn t 
                    it?  Childs does poorly, voters 
                    start to remember me fondly.   

      Kalinda considers it, smiles.

                                  KALINDA
                    You know what I like about you?
                          (Peter shrugs)
                    You re three months into a ten year 
                    sentence, and you re plotting your 
                    political comeback.

                          (smiles)
                    Hey, politics is just a game of 
                    chutes and ladders.  I m just 
                    starting over at square one.  

      Kalinda smiles.  Peter leans in.  Quieter:

                    Here s the problem.  You see that?

      A small box in the ceiling.  Red light blinking.  Quiet

                    Right, Detective Shores.  Did he 
                    put you in that Bulls sweatshirt?

                                  CLARENCE

                    Didn t they want it for evidence?

                    Yeah, but they wanted to take my 
                    mugshot first.

      Alicia pauses, looks up...

                                  ALICIA
                    They made you keep it on for the

                    No.  I tried to take it off, but 
                    that guy, Shores, said no, keep it 
                    on.  They wanted it in the picture.

      Alicia is actually sitting on a bench behind Will and 
      Clarence at the defense table.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Strange that we have to be ready at 
                    all.  I thought this case was 
                    previously adjudicated.  And yet 
                    the Appellate Court found reason to 
                    reverse my ruling.  

                                  MATAN*
                    Not by our hand, your honor.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    That s right.  Who saw fit to 
                    question my ruling, Mrs. Florrick?

    But Will stands.  The lawyer of record.

                    Your honor, actually we mean no 
                      disrespect.  We believe your honor 
                    was given incorrect information by 
                    those trying the case.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Ah, good.  As long as there s no 
                      disrespect.  And I guess it s better 
                    to be considered a fool than a cheat.  

      Alicia sees Matan dart a look toward the back of the *
      courtroom.  Alicia follows his gaze to... GLENN CHILDS, *
      standing by the door.  Childs nods sharply to Matan: You. *

                                  ALICIA
                    Don t... visit my husband in prison.

      Kalinda stares at her, starts to respond.  Hesitates.  Then:

                                  KALINDA
                    Then youvisit him.  You want to 
                    help Clarence, go visit him.

    But Alicia walks away, disgusted.  Everywhere she fuckin  
      turns is her husband.

      INT. COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #302 - DAY3434

      Cuesta again. Not looking much happier.  Staring down at Will.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Well?

                                  WILL
                    Defense calls Detective Alec Shores 
                    as a witness.

      Startled, Matanjumps up.*



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    33.

                    Objection, your honor.  Detective 
                    Shores isn t on the defense s 
                    witness list.

                                  WILL
                    That s right.  He s on yours.

      Judge Cuesta hides a smile as Matanstarts to argue, stops, *
      looks toward ASA Becker, unsure.  Becker sunsure.*

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Is he in court anyway?  Maybe we 
                    can get something done today.

      Will turns to Alicia on the bench behind him, whispers:

                                  WILL
                    I want you to do this.

    But Alicia shoots a look to a startled Cary...

                                  ALICIA
                    Cary prepped for it.

                                  WILL
                    But you know it?
                          (Alicia nods)
                    Then let s go.

      Alicia shoots an apologetic look to Cary, nods, gets up.  

                                                                    CUT TO LATER:

    The six-pack photo array.  Detective Shores on the stand 
      studies it, unimpressed...

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Yeah.  It was the sweatshirt he was 
                    wearing.  So?

                                  ALICIA
                    You don t think it s prejudicial to 
                    put only one suspect wearing a 
                    Bulls sweatshirt in a photo line-up 
                    intended to find a suspect in a 
                    Bulls sweatshirt?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    I don t know.  It s what he was 
                    wearing.

      Clarence stares at the cop.  Intensely.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    34.

                                  ALICIA
                    And you found bloodstains on this 
                      sweatshirt?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Yes.  He tried to wash the blood 
                    out, but it left a stain.

                                  ALICIA
                    Where was the bloodstain, 
                    detective?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Where?  Here.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    The witness is pointing to the fore-*
                    arm of his right sleeve.*

                                  ALICIA
                    And how did the suspect explain 
                    this stain?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    He said he was in a pick-up game 
                    the night before the murder.  Made 
                    contact.  And got a nose bleed.

                                  ALICIA
                    And did this blood match the 
                    victim s? 

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    The police lab couldn t get a DNA 
                    match. Since he washed the shirt, 
                    it degraded the blood.

                                  ALICIA
                    So that would be a  no ?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    That would be a  no. 

      Shores looks toward Kalinda in the gallery.  No smiles 
      between these old friends now.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Detective, I m curious, if you were 
                    to get a nose bleed in a pick-up 
                    game, what would you do?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    I don t understand your question, 
                    Ma am.

                    What do I do?  Well, I--

      Shores starts to bring his right sleeve up to his nose when 
    he quickly stops.  Shit.

                                  ALICIA
                    Let the record show that Detective 
                    Shores attempted to wipe his nose 
                    the fore-arm of his right sleeve-- *

                    Detective Shores, what were you 
                    preparing to do?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    Your honor, I was preparing to 
                    raise my right hand to my face to 
                    wipe my nose.

      Will frowns.  Fuckin  liar.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Objection sustained.  Continue, 
                    Mrs. Florrick.

    But Cuesta eyes Shores, giving him some slack, but also not 
      sure he s telling the truth. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Detective, isn t it true that the 
                    only reason you arrested Mr. Wilcox 
                    was because he was wearing a Bulls 
                      sweatshirt?

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    No, he matched the physical 
                    description.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #105   "For the Camera"   PINK COLLATED   9/16/09    36.

                    Detective, do you own a Chicago 
                    Bulls sweatshirt?

                                  MATAN*
                    Objection, Your Honor.  What s the 
                    point here?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m trying to show that at the time 
                    of Mr. Wilcox s arrest, Bulls 
                    apparel was quite popular.  And 
                    therefore it wouldn t be unusual to 
                    find a multitude of suspects in 
                    Bulls sweatshirts.  

      Judge Cuesta looks toward Shores.  Considering it, intrigued.  
    For the first time intrigued. 

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Overruled.  Answer the question.

      Shores doesn t like the way this is going.

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    No.  I don t own one of those.

                    You re under oath, Detective Shores.

                                  DETECTIVE SHORES
                    I understand that, your honor.  I m 
                    not a fan.

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Well, I am.  And I have a Bulls 
                      sweatshirt.  Identical to that one.

    She gets up, moves to the small dining table, sits, tries to

                    So it couldn t have been Clarence.  
                    He was in jail.

                    Yeah.  This guy-- nice guy, by the 
                    way-- he was supposed to go to 
                    court to testify, but they didn t 
                    need him-- because the robber 
                    copped a plea.  

      Kalinda nods-- good-- has her phone out already, excited, 
      thinking out loud:

                    Armed robbery.  No injuries.  Money 
                    taken.  He probably got four years.

                    2003?

                    No, no, you know what reward.  Let 
                    me think of some really 
                    embarrassing question.

    But Kalinda just smiles, starts away, into the phone:

                                  KALINDA
                    No, I m looking for an armed

      Silence.  Dark.  Someone lying on the bed.  It s Alicia 
      staring up at the ceiling.  And on the floor beside the 
      bed...

      ...Peter, also staring up.  Pillow under his head.  Blanket 
      over him.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I bet this is the first time this 
                    has happened in here.

      Alicia smiles to herself, doesn t laugh.

                                  ALICIA
                    You okay?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I m great.

                          (turns)
                    Are you joking?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    No, I m serious.  This is the 
                    closest five minutes I ve had to 
                    normalcy in the last eight months.

      Alicia nods, stares up at the ceiling.

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT D)
                    It s like we re at camp.
                          (Alicia laughs)
                    Want me to tell you a story?

      Laughing, Alicia peers over the side at Peter on the ground.  
    He looks toward her expectantly.  She takes a second, 
      considers it.  And not unfriendly...

                                  ALICIA
                    Good night, Peter.

      Peter nods, reaches out a hand toward her.  She looks at it, 
      takes it.  And they both lie back, staring up at the ceiling.  
      Their hands touching for a second.

      INT. COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #302 - DAY4444

      A sidebar.  Judge Cuesta, on his bench, runs a pen down a 
      legal summary, crossing off long swaths of exhibits, 
      witnesses, barely listening to the counselors standing right 
    at his bench.  Matan, Will, Alicia, Becker.  (No whispering: *
      there is no jury.)

                                  MATAN*
                    Your honor, please, this is too 
                    much.  Detective Shores was never 
                    found guilty of planting a gun--  

                                  WILL
                    Because the judge suppressed the 
                    gun evidence and the State s 
                    Attorney declined to prosecute--*

                                  MATAN*
                    Is that what Peter is saying?

    He directs this toward Alicia.  Cuesta shoots a glance toward 
      Alicia too, then returns to his crossing out, as...

                                  WILL*
                    Excuse me, sir.  You can talk to

                    In fact, he even used the same 
                    language from yours.  He yelled for

                    Oh my god.

      INT. COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #302 - DAY4747

    And now Tara is on the stand.  Taking a second.

                                  TARA
                    I am certain.  The man I saw 
                    killing a police officer was not 
                    Clarence Wilcox.

      very still.He looks toward the back of the court where *
      Childs stands.  Sighs.  Then leaves.*

                                  TARA (CONT D)
                    In fact, your honor, can I say 
                    something to Mr. Wilcox?*

      Cuesta nods: go ahead.  Clarence looks up toward her.

                                  TARA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  I don t know what else 
                    to say.  I m just so sorry.

      Clarence, choked up, nods back to her, Patrice behind him 
      blinks away tears, as Alicia watches.

      INT. COOK COUNTY CRIMINAL COURT - COURTROOM #302 - DAY4848

      Minutes later.  The courtroom cleared.  Just six people 
      sitting around one of the tables.  Dwarfed in the expanse.  
      Cuesta, Will, Matan, Alicia, Becker, and a court reporter *
      leaning in to listen...  

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    Here s the thing, Mr. Brody.I *
                    don t like to be reversed.  In 
                    fact, I hate it.  So I have some 
                    advice for youand the good State s *
                      Attorney:keep that from happening.*

                                  MATAN*
                    Your honor, I want to insist--

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    You don t have room to insist.  And 
                    you should be grateful.  I m giving 
                    your officean out as big as the *
                    great outdoors.

                                  MATAN*
                    I don t understand, your honor.

                                  WILL
                    Blame hispredecessor. *

    And they all slightly turn toward Alicia sitting stalk-still. 

                                  JUDGE CUESTA
                    It is not the job of the bench to 
                    offer you advice, Mr. Deputy Chief.  *
                    I am just telling you very clearly: *
                    I want this to go away. 

      Matanstares at him, and...*

      ...a television camera, and a few stray reporters hang 
      listening to Glenn Childs as he continues:

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    The regrettable corruption during 
                    Peter Florrick s term  till infects 
                    my department.  Every step of the 
                    Wilcox case was supervised and 
                    approved by my predecessor, and I m 
                    doing everything in my power to 
                    correct his mistakes.

                    That is why I ve decided to 
                    withdraw charges against Mr. 
                    Clarence Wilcox.  

      Alicia and Will watch.  A cynical eye.   

                                  WILL
                    Are you okay with this?

      Alicia pauses, sees a thrilled Patrice hugging her daughter.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

    And Alicia starts toward Patrice who smiles, seeing her.  

                                  PATRICE
                    They say he s coming out this door.  

      A holding cell door.  The joy in her voice infectious.   
      Alicia smiles, waits with her.  Patrice shoots a look to her:

                                  PATRICE (CONT D)
                    You know, words are hard...

                                  ALICIA
                    I know.

                                  PATRICE
                    No.  It s not like people say.  I 
                    just...
                          (eyes wet)
                    I never expected him to get out.

      Alicia eyes her.  Thinking.  Her own life reflected in this.  
      A loud klang.  The holding room door opens.  And...

      ...they all turn toward the darkness inside.  Expectantly.
