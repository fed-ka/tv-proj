    He stops. Checks quickly -- right, left. Waits. Then WORMS 
    HIS WAY UNDER THE TRAIN. 

      Under the train, Zaf UNZIPS the sportsbag.Removes some 
      TOOLS. And -- working quickly, a small Maglighttorch in his 
      mouth -- he begins to DISMANTLEa HOUSING underneath the 
      train.

      Then, from the bag, he removes THE BOMB. It has a CELL-PHONE 
      DETONATOR. He begins ATTACHING it to the BELLY OF THE TRAIN.

      ASNIK, boarding the train. Carrying the SUITCASE.

      Leaning on a PILLAR, reading an IRANIAN NEWSPAPER, is Adam. 
    He notes Asnik passing. Behind the newspaper, he s holding a 
      CELLPHONE. Sending a TEXT MESSAGE. 


      Adam is listening to this.

      Adam goes to the FIRST CARand gets into the FRONT SEAT.

    Zaf and Asnik running headlong through the woods, the 
      undergrowth. Zaf is holding his CELL-PHONE. 


    Cut between Adam and Scott. Deep in the woods.

      Hunting. Their movements slow, stealthy.


      ADAM pausing. Checking left and right. 

      Scott, out of Adam s line of sight, is edging towards a 
      COPSE. When he HEARS something. Behind him. He whirls. 
      Bringing up his FIREARM...

    On ADAM as he hears TWO RAPID SHOTS. That same BASS 
      SIGNATURE.

    He swears under his breath. Presses his BACK to the tree. 

    And begins, very slowly, to move round the tree...firearm 
        raised...scanning the undergrowth...


    Zaf and Asnik, fording a NARROW STREAM, slipping on the WET 
      ROCKS. 

      Asnik stumbles. Beginning to COUGH.

    Zaf offers his hand. Scanning the trees as he does so. He 
      sees nothing. He s still struggling to operate the cell-
      phone.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              SPOOKS 6: EPISODE ONE: SHOOTING SCRIPT: LILAC: 29.03.0731

      Asnik wheezing, struggling for breath as they plunge 
      forwards, towards the cover of a DENSE WALL of trees.

      A BEEP. Zaf pauses, just a moment -- to see his CELL-PHONE 
      LIGHTING UP. 

                                  ZAF
                    It s self-corrected. Keep moving.

    He urges Asnik onwards, about to dial. 

      Asnik is wracked by coughing - and this time we see blood. He 
    is becoming contagious.

    AS A BULLET SLAMS INTO ZAF S GUTS. 

    Zaf is thrown to the ground. His phone, tumbling through the 
      air...


    On Adam. Still backed-up against the tree. Hearing the 
      GUNSHOT from Zaf s direction.

    He turns to it. Begins to run...

      Adam arrives, at speed. 

      Stops. Sees ZAF S BLOOD in the CRUSHED GRASS. And a TRAIL, 
      leading away. 

      Running, he follows it. Crashing through the woods, the 
      undergrowth, low-branches...

    He breaks through onto A ROAD... 

      Just in time to see a TRANSIT VAN, engine roaring, 
      disappearing round a DISTANT CORNER- 

    He PLANTS HIS FEET. Raises the FIREARM.

      Fires. Once. Twice. Three times. But the van is TOO FAR AWAY. 
      Moving too fast. In moments, it s gone. 


      Waiting -- with two SECURITY GOONSat a safe distance -- is
