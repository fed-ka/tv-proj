A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds
a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.

THE POSTMAN
'Running on Empty'? Tell me about
it.
Tossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of
trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles.
THE POSTMAN
Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147
channels. Everything from Jesus
to 'Jeopardy'.
He steps over, switches on the set.
Nothing happens, but
The Postman pretends just the same.
He mimics static,
then:
THE POSTMAN
'Like sands through the hour-
glass, so are the days of our
lives...'
(switching channels)
'Michael Shields, come on down,
you're the next contestant
on...'The Price is Right'.'
(switching again)
I'll take Domestic Nuclear
Disasters for two hundred
thousand, Alex...
The Postman stops suddenly.
Click.
THE POSTMAN
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program to bring you the
Second Civil War... Well, shit.
The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's
a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service
manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the
carbine.
THE POSTMAN
I don't want any trouble... I bet
you don't either... Let's just
call it a draw, okay?
Sudden MOVEMENT. The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe
dashes out from behind the desk. Scared, it bounds back
and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner.
The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.
THE POSTMAN
Look out, Bill!

The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill.
Bill has a conniption fit.
Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette
machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are
empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's
intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the
machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.
The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of
cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:
THE POSTMAN
I'm rich.

Full of The Postman's earthly possessions. Trick is, how
to save them and his life at the same time. He spies an
old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty
bolts holding the ball in place. An idea begins to take
shape.
LEAD BANDIT (O.S.)
Just you start tossing those
cigarettes down!
BANDITS
There's no answer.
The Bandits eye each other nervously.
BANDIT #20
Maybe he fell asleep.

76 BALL
The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the
last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give...
THE POSTMAN
It's going to take a second.
I
got my stuff bolted in.
BANDITS
The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.
LEAD BANDIT
Put some buckshot through it,
Martin. Just to hurry him up.
HULKING BANDIT
I only got three shells left.
LEAD BANDIT
So use his gun.
The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK.
It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside,
pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb.
76 BALL
Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball,
trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't
budge.
LADDER
The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.
76 BALL
No good.
Time's up.
The Postman starts rocking the pole.
LADDER
The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the
rocking motion. Hangs on.

76 BALL
Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that
instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The
rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in
place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before
going with the pole's tilt.
LADDER
The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking
Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other
Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.
THE POSTMAN
whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.
FIELD
The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a
stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts
apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his
feet.
THE POSTMAN
Bill!
Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the
RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman.
Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before
a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head.
Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge,
quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first.
Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over
Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit
aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights.
He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the
SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and
he's laughing like a hyena!
BANDIT #20
We're rich!

Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in
hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his
reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition
of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure.
He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in.
Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman
doesn't quite know what to do.
BETHLEHEM
(re: the book and
binoculars on the
table)
They're yours. A solitary man,
aren't you? Binoculars. To watch
life from a distance. And
Shakespeare. To read about it
instead of living it.
Bethlehem wants an answer.
The Postman clears his throat.
THE POSTMAN
No offense, General, but you seem
to have read some Shakespeare
yourself.
BETHLEHEM
If he wishes to rise above mere
thuggery, a military commandeer
must be classically educated.
Philosophy, history. Even a sense
of the dramatic.
(a beat)
Do you know what I did before the
war? Do you think I was in the
army? I sold copying machines. I
was a salesman. The talent to
lead men and devise and execute a
battle plan were locked away
inside me.

He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn.
A 20-
year-old self-help book.
BETHLEHEM
If Nathan Holn hadn't come along,
I'd still be selling copying
machines. Can you imagine the
wasted life? Can you imagine the
magnitude of it? But war... War
gives men like me a chance.
He turns to a dog-eared page in the book.
BETHLEHEM
Here... 'The prize is often left
unclaimed. Have the courage to
grasp it. For fortune always
favors the bold.'
(moved)
It always inspires me.
(beat)
I have a design for the future. A
master plan. I'll need able
officers to carry it out. You
have the intelligence. If your
heart matches, you'll go far.
(a beat)
We'll talk more in the weeks to
come. Dismissed.
The Postman leaves.
Idaho stands at the ready.
BETHLEHEM
Issue the binoculars to a scout.
IDAHO
And the book, sir?
BETHLEHEM
Burn it.
Idaho leaves. Bethlehem goes back to his painting. He
considers himself in the mirror. After a long stare-down,
he shouts:
BETHLEHEM
Quit moving.

A freestanding tub has been set up, water "bucketed" in.
The Postman luxuriates in his first hot bath in years and
sings a familiar tune to himself.
THE POSTMAN
'Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute,
Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr.
Postman...'
32

The Postman looks up at a KNOCK. Ford steps in. Like
most kids, he needs a hero. Holding up the uniform, he
just found one.
FORD
(beaming)
Cleaned and pressed, sir.

THE POSTMAN
Thanks. Didn't somebody say
something about dinner?
FORD
Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to
Foster's.
(extending a hand)
My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln
Mercury.
The Postman just nods, hoisting himself out of the tub and
hurriedly wrapping a towel around himself.
FORD
Used to be John Stevens, but I
changed it on account of I want to
drive cars.
Hoping to impress, Ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a
worn, creased flyer for a "Ford Lincoln Mercury"
dealership. Ford finds The Postman just staring at him,
waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand.
Embarrassed, Ford quickly hands it over.
34
35
The townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. They
talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous
applause as Ford and The Postman enter.
The Postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display.
But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the
counter. The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew.
The PEOPLE clear a path for him.
MAN #1
Tell us about the government!
WOMAN #1
Yes, tell us everything!
Startled, The Postman doesn't quite know what to say.
They seat him at a table -- but the food looks miles away.
MAN #2
Is there a President?
THE POSTMAN
Yeah.
WOMAN #2
What's his name?
THE POSTMAN
You know, I'm pretty hungry.
But these people won't be denied.
Finally...

THE POSTMAN
His name is, uh... Richard
Starkey. From Maine. He has a
saying. 'Things are getting
better, getting better all the
time.'
There's warm applause at that.
Several people try the
expression out on each other.
MAN #3
He a Democrat or a Republican?
THE POSTMAN
Parties are over with. The
individual is what counts. You
vote for the best man.
Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The
Postman. Famished, he digs in.
MAN #4
What about Europe? Any word?
The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food.
THE POSTMAN
Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years
old and she still kicks ass.
WOMAN #3
Is Nathan Holn still alive?
THE POSTMAN
(smiles at irony)
He died. Skin cancer.
That's sure good news to everyone.
But...
WOMAN #4
And the Holnists? They're still
out there. What's the government
going to do about them?
The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather
get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important
question of all. He doesn't want to lie.
THE POSTMAN
The government's just getting
started. You're on your own for
at least eighteen months.

MAN #5
What about the Marines Corp?
A clamor of Holnist questions.
ELLEN
Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just
let this man eat?
The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He
catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door.
After a moment, Briscoe leaves.
36

A band plays an odd array of instruments. There's
dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls.
People watch him eat like it was a religious experience.
He pushes back the fifth bowl.
THE POSTMAN
Never thought I'd hear myself say
this, but I can't eat anymore.
He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.
The
kid's looking up, staring intently at something.
THE POSTMAN
What?
The boy just stares.
THE POSTMAN
(re:
the cap)
This?
The boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to
himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head.
THE POSTMAN
Almost fits.
The boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up
1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends,
ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him.
ELLEN
That's not a toy, honey. That's
very important. Give it back.

The boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The
Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her
son away.
The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman
we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman.
ABBY
Would you like to dance?
THE POSTMAN
I don't know if I can, I think I'm
still on duty.
He laughs.
Abby says nothing.
THE POSTMAN
It's been a long time.
Abby holds out her hand like a promise.
ABBY
All you got to do is hold on.
DANCE FLOOR
Abby and The Postman dance.
She keeps looking him over.
THE POSTMAN
Is something wrong?
ABBY
How tall are you?
THE POSTMAN
About six feet.
ABBY
Are you smart?
THE POSTMAN
Smarter than some I guess.
Why?
ABBY
Just wondering. Did you ever have
the bad mumps?
The Postman smiles.
She's odd, but beautiful.
THE POSTMAN
Never had the bad mumps.

ABBY
Have you ever had herpes or
syphilis or anything like that?
He shakes his head "no."
They continue to dance.
ABBY
So as far as you know, you have
good semen?
THE POSTMAN
Is that a trick question?
ABBY
I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only
asking because I want you to make
me pregnant.
Stunned, The Postman stops dancing.
Abby takes this
moment to grab Michael.
THE POSTMAN
(to himself)
It's got to be the uniform.
Abby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly.
ABBY
This is my husband.
Michael.
Michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip.
The Postman doesn't know what to think.
ABBY
We've been trying to have a baby
for three years. We can't on
account of Michael had the bad
mumps when he was twelve. So we
need a body father. We could ask
a man here, but it could cause
trouble. I've seen it happen.
Things go okay until the woman
starts to show. Then it can be
bad. But you'll only be around
once in awhile with the mail.
The Postman just stares at them.
Abby looks to Michael.
ABBY
He hasn't said 'no'.

MICHAEL
(undaunted)
What do you say, mister?
You'd be
doing us a favor.
THE POSTMAN
I'll have to think about it.
The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away,
shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world.
But no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby
and Michael, he's running smack into another group of
well-wishing TOWNIES. Mrs. March is among them. She's
holding an envelope.
TOWNIE #1
Mrs. March wants to give you
something.
(to Mrs. March)
He's right here, Irene.
MRS. MARCH
(re: letter)
It's to my daughter Annie. She
left five years ago. She was only
fifteen. The last I heard, she
was living up north...
The Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the
faces around him, to Mrs. March. She looks blindly back.
How can he lie to her?
THE POSTMAN
Look, Mrs. March, you should know
that...
MRS. MARCH
Know what?
THE POSTMAN
Know that...
But she stops him, grabs for his hand.
MRS. MARCH
I have a feeling about you. I
know you'll do what's right.
Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd.
She's left him with her letter and no choice at all.
THE POSTMAN
I got to get out of here.
49.
37
38
Long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost
holy feel. The Postman wanders in, stops to read the
credo calligraphied on the wall. "Neither snow, nor
rain..." He turns at a SOUND. Ford is here, leaning
against a wall.
FORD
I knew you'd come here.
THE POSTMAN
You did, huh?
Ford nods.
A sage sixteen-year-old.
FORD
How do you get to be a postman,
anyhow?
THE POSTMAN
You have to be in the right place
at the right time.
FORD
How could I do it?
(CONTINUED)

THE POSTMAN
I thought you wanted to drive
cars.
FORD
Not anymore. That was kid's
stuff. This is real. So, where's
the right place?
THE POSTMAN
Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only
another postman can make you a
postman.
FORD
Kinda like vampires, right?
THE POSTMAN
Something like that. You have to
be sworn in.
Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the
oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize.
THE POSTMAN
The organization's kinda shaky.
It might not last.
FORD
What does?
THE POSTMAN
You'd meet a lot of people who
don't believe in you.
FORD
I'll set them straight.
THE POSTMAN
It's a lonely job.
FORD
I've been lonely all my life.
This response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly
Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself.
THE POSTMAN
So have I, Ford. So have I.
The Postman looks up at the creed on the wall.
Finally...

What the hell?
Repeat after me.
POSTMAN/FORD

Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat
nor gloom of night stays these
couriers from the swift completion
of their appointed rounds.
THE POSTMAN
Okay then.
FORD
(repeating)
Okay, then.
THE POSTMAN
No, no, no, I'm saying that. You
just listen... By my authority you
are now empowered to carry the
mail.
(extends a hand)
Congratulations, you're a postman.
They shake hands. The Postman doesn't realize, but this
is the most important moment in Ford's life.
FORD
I want you to know I'd die to get
a letter through.
Ford's intensity takes The Postman back.
But the moment
is broken when...
BRISCOE (O.S.)
Johnny, why don't you run along.
I need to speak to this man.
Ford bristles at "Johnny," looks to The Postman.
FORD
I'll see you around.
THE POSTMAN
Sure thing, Ford.
Ford exits.
BRISCOE
Johnny's real impressed with you.
Whole town's real impressed with
you.

THE POSTMAN
What can I do for you, Sheriff?
BRISCOE
You can clear out. Or I can throw
you out. Either way suits me
fine.
THE POSTMAN
I'm afraid you don't understand,
Sheriff. I'm a government
employee. Authorized by --
BRISCOE
You're not authorized by shit.
You're nothing but a drifter who
found a bag of mail. And I want
you out of my town.
THE POSTMAN
This is going in my report.
BRISCOE
These people don't need dreams,
Mr. Postman. They need something
real. They need help with the
goddamn Holnists. Are you going
to bring them that?
(as The Postman
doesn't answer)
Didn't think so. All you cost us
so far is a few bowls of soup and
maybe later a few broken hearts.
I aim to keep it that way. You
can stay till morning. Then I
don't ever want to see you again.
Briscoe exits, leaves The Postman alone in the post
office.
39

The Postman arrives home. He pushes open the door,
knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved
under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them.
They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on
handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old.

They're brand new.
Shaking his head, he closes the door.
The Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on
the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs,
smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's
trapped in here.

PACKAGE - NIGHT
~from the previous scene.
It's on the table with a
growing stack of mail.
The Postman is in bed, trying to sleep. But it's hard-
coming. He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up
at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the
door.
THE POSTMAN
Just leave it.
There's a pause.
And then, ANOTHER KNOCK.
THE POSTMAN
I said leave it.
The door opens. Surprise. Abby stands in the doorway,
her hair held up by an old red ribbon. He sits up.
THE POSTMAN
Hello, Abby.
ABBY
You'll be leaving tomorrow?
THE POSTMAN

Everybody's up late writing

that, but they're so excited.
THE POSTMAN
How about you?
Do you have a
letter?
ABBY
I don't have anybody to write to.
THE POSTMAN
I'll find you a pen pal. Someone
with interests similar to your
own. Dancing, checking for mumps.
Abby laughs.
The Postman is charmed.
ABBY
You're funny. Hardly anyone's
funny around here.
THE POSTMAN
I guess no one feels much like
laughing.
The two of them just look at each other a moment.
Abby
fingers the ribbon in her hair.
ABBY
Have you decided yet?
THE POSTMAN
Oh, well, I've been thinking about
it.
A beat. Abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then
slides under the sheets alongside him.
THE POSTMAN
Sure.
Why not?
They lie there awkwardly for a moment.
He looks at her.
THE POSTMAN
God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I

closed your eyes.
The Postman closes his eyes. Abby slides her hand away
from his mouth. And as they start to make love...

The Postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was

behind is her red ribbon. Wistful, he picks it up.

Ford is sweeping up. The place looks almost presentable.
He stops when he hears Bethlehem calling once more for the
responsible party.
Ford starts forward.
Suddenly Briscoe is blocking his
way.
BRISCOE
Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay
out of sight.
FORD
I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding
from anyone. I --
Briscoe grabs him by the shirt, hauls him out the back
way.
BRISCOE
You stay out of this, or I'll lock
you up myself damnit.

Mail call. The Postman stands in front of the torn
screen. Hoping for glory by association, the smiling
Mayor stands beside him. The ragged people of Benning
clamor in front. Kids smile up at him as he calls out
names:
THE POSTMAN
Rachel Clark!
(as she's there)
Charlie Sykes!
(as he's there)
Graham Druitt!

G.D. died last winter of flu.

As usual, The Postman is assaulted with questions.
MAN
Tell us about President Starkey!
WOMAN
What about New York City?
Did
they survive the plague?
THE POSTMAN
Survive? They got Broadway up and
running again. There's a kid
doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you
wouldn't believe.
An older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful
news.
MAN #3
How much is it to mail a letter?
THE POSTMAN
(smiles)
A buck seventy-five.
MAN #3
That sounds awful cheap.
THE POSTMAN
The catch is the only currency
recognized are silver American
coins minted before 1964 and two
dollar bills. Look for Thomas
Jefferson. Of course, food is
always acceptable as barter.
The moment is split by a SIREN.

Abby tracks the guard's silhouette through the canvas.
Her eyes search the tent -- land on the cot in the corner
and focus on its heavy, wooden legs.

Abby brings the heavy wooden cot leg down on the
unsuspecting guard's head.

One room. Dirt floor. The WINDOWS RATTLE in the WIND.
Snow falls through a hole in the roof. The wooden DOOR
BURSTS back and Abby enters. Half-frozen, she leads the
horse and the travois right inside.
71
71
A fire has been lit.
The Postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as Abby
washes around his wound. She pulls the shirt back to
clean his chest. The material falls away and Abby stops
short. There -- high on his biceps -- a branded "8." She
stares in disbelief.

The Postman lies on a cot below the window.
He's

Abby brings him a bowl of soup. Very thin soup.

THE POSTMAN
Thank you.
She turns her back on him without a word.
The Postman
tries an exchange just the same.

Dirt? Wood?

A twig garnish?
She goes about her business in silence.
THE POSTMAN
You used to think I was funny.
ABBY
They killed Michael.
THE POSTMAN
I'm sorry.
He takes a spoonful of soup and she comes to him.
ABBY
How sorry are you?
THE POSTMAN
What's that supposed to mean?
Her right hand flashes out, holds a knife up under his
chin.
THE POSTMAN
What's with you?
ABBY
You got the mark of eight on you.
A long beat. Finally, he swallows the soup in his mouth.
The action presses his Adam's apple against the blade.
THE POSTMAN
A mark doesn't mean I'm a --
ABBY
You're a liar.

stab at a joke.
THE POSTMAN

Don't make me use this.
Abby doesn't laugh.
But she does relent.
She steps away.

WIND HOWLING in the b.g. The Postman lies back on his
cot. The little shack has been scoured clean. Abby
stares listlessly at the fire. The silence is torture.
The Postman tries to strike up a conversation.
THE POSTMAN
Wind's come up.
(no response from
Abby)
Getting colder too. Must be
another storm --
Abby gets up and throws a log on the fire.
ABBY
Anything else?
THE POSTMAN
I didn't mean for you to --
ABBY
Your legs are going to rot off if
you don't try to walk.
THE POSTMAN
I'm hurt.
(CONTINUED)

ABBY
You're lazy.
THE POSTMAN
Lazy?! I got a hole in my
stomach. I'm weak. The two big
meals around here are grass and
snow. And we're running out of
grass.
As the two of them glare at each other for a moment.
Abby
starts to put on her coat.
THE POSTMAN
Where are you going?
Abby doesn't answer. She picks up the rifle and starts to
lead the horse outside.
THE POSTMAN
You're not leaving me here, are
you?
Abby is out the door without a word.
75
77
Abby ladles a meager portion of horse meat stew into a
bowl.
(CONTINUED)
77.
77
CONTINUED:

ABBY
This is the last of it.
She walks with the bowl past The Postman -- who sits on
his cot with arms outstretched -- and pointedly sets the
bowl on the table.
THE POSTMAN
(mumbled)
Give me a break...
Abby starts putting on layer after layer of clothing.
ABBY
I'm going to check the pass.
THE POSTMAN
Why are you in such a hurry to get
out of here? I can think of worse
places. And worse company to --
And with the SLAM of the DOOR she is gone.
DISSOLVE TO:
78
78
A few flakes of snow have begun to drift down. The
Postman sits at the window -- starts to play tic-tac-toe
in the frost. But then it dawns on him:
THE POSTMAN
You can't play tic-tac-toe with
yourself.
79
80
The fire is dying. The food untouched. The Postman sits
in bed staring anxiously out the window. The snow has
turned into a blizzard. He runs Abby's red ribbon through
his hands.
78.
81
82
The Postman hears her call.
83
85
Abby sits huddled in blankets. The fire is blazing. The
Postman steps over, sets the once-again-hot bowl of stew
before her.
She considers the food a moment.
ABBY
I told you that's all there was.
THE POSTMAN
That's why you should have it.
ABBY
I knew you could walk.
THE POSTMAN
You're weird, you know that?
79.
86
86
The Postman lies in bed, stares through the hole in the
roof. A full moon is on the rise. Abby lies in her own
makeshift bed, also awake. After a long silence:
THE POSTMAN
We walked on the moon once, Abby.
ABBY
So?
What good is that now?
THE POSTMAN
Obviously you've forgotten Tang
and microwave ovens.
(a beat)
Your face looks pretty.
Abby looks up.
THE POSTMAN
Not so bruised.
ABBY
Look, there's something you'd
better know. You're going to find
out soon enough. I'm pregnant.
(a long beat)
It's Michael's baby. You're just
the body father.
THE POSTMAN
How do you know it's mine and not
Bethlehem's?
ABBY
He tried with me almost every
night. He couldn't do it. So he
beat me. Said it was my fault.
DISSOLVE TO:

The Postman and Ford.
THE POSTMAN
President Starkey? Minneapolis?
Ford knows what to do?
FORD
I thought you were dead.
THE POSTMAN
So? I'm not making the
connection. What's all this then?
FORD
I lied. I told people you were in
contact with me.
THE POSTMAN
Why?
FORD
Because I didn't want it to end.
THE POSTMAN
I don't know how long I can stay,
Ford. President Starkey will send
word one day and I'll have to move
on. Understand?
FORD
Sure. But you'll stay till he
sends word? Right?
The Postman can't answer, just turns and walks out of the
tent.
93
95
An old manual crank printing press is working away. Ford
proudly removes a sheet, shows it to The Postman. A
caricature of eight evil Holnists, forming a figure eight.
Beneath: "Unite Against Holnist Tyrraney!"
THE POSTMAN
You spelled tyranny wrong.
CHUBBY
(low, to Red)
Boy, he's smart.
96
98
The same sun sets on the Holnist camp.
99

Bethlehem once again at his easel with palette in hand.
He's trying another style -- Impressionism -- and it's
worse than the last. He looks over as Getty and Gibbs
approach with a PRISONER.
(CONTINUED)

BETHLEHEM
What do you think, Lieutenant?
GIBBS
Can't tell what it is if you stand
too close. The colors all kinda
run together, don't they?
BETHLEHEM
Yes...
Bethlehem looks away from his painting to see Gibbs and
Getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier. For an
instant, mistakes him for:
BETHLEHEM
Well, if it isn't our old friend
the U.P.S. man.
GIBBS
We captured him on the Oregon
border.
Realizing, Bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side.
BETHLEHEM
Who the hell are you?
CARRIER (PRISONER)
Carrier Twelve. United States,
um, Postal Service.
Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda
onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up.
It's hard to say what he's thinking.
Finally:
BETHLEHEM
I want the camp struck at dawn.
We're moving north.
GIBBS
Yes, sir.
Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve.
BETHLEHEM
(chilling)
You spelled tyranny wrong.

By lantern, Bethlehem and Getty watch as Gibbs sorts
through the contents of the confiscated mailbag.
GIBBS
Births and deaths, the weather,
gossip. There's nothing here.
BETHLEHEM
Nothing? Everything is here.
Am
I the only one who sees that?
(to Gibbs)
Get out!
Gibbs hurries away, leaving Bethlehem and Getty alone.
BETHLEHEM
Give the people back their hope
and their dreams won't be far
behind.
Bethlehem sees Getty waiting.
BETHLEHEM
What is it, Getty?
Getty hands Bethlehem a sheet of paper -- something Gibbs
missed. It's a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of
The Postman leading a few carriers against Bethlehem and
his army -- represented as Hitler and the Nazis. The
caption underneath reads: "Ride Against the Holnist
Tide!"

BETHLEHEM
(crumpling the paper)
A military man, especially a
commander, should keep a journal.
After he's gone, it's the only
real defense against the slander
that arises.

Old George sits hunched over a home-made shortwave radio
with a joint in his mouth. The Postman sits beside him,
listening as STATIC pours from an old car SPEAKER.
THE POSTMAN
Who do you talk to?
OLD GEORGE
Not a soul in seven years of
trying. But I will.
The Postman steps to a telescope pointing up through a
hole in the trailer ceiling.
OLD GEORGE
Go ahead. Take a look.
(offering joint)
Want some?
THE POSTMAN
No. No thanks. Hey, don't let
the kids see that.
George nods and goes on playing with the dials --
searching for a voice in the void.
The Postman focuses on the moon.
OLD GEORGE
I was an aerospace engineer. I
helped design the Galileo space
station.
(scanning sky)
I dream it's orbiting Earth
forever. With a dozen human
skeletons all grinning at each
other. Laughing at us down here.
There's an urgent KNOCKING on the trailer door.
Ford
appears.
THE POSTMAN
What is it?
(CONTINUED)
97.

CONTINUED:
111
FORD
It's Red.
He's overdue.
THE POSTMAN
That makes five. All on Southern
routes.
112
115
As usual, Old George is hunkered down before his short
wave. He looks as the door opens and The Postman enters.
THE POSTMAN
Tell me about the other stuff you
know...
George crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. Inside:
twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. The CROW
CAWS.
116
124
Abby tends to the Bloodied Carrier.
He tries to salute as
The Postman enters the trailer.

Ford and Chubby watch and wait as The Postman goes to the
boy's side.
BLOODIED CARRIER
Bethlehem says...
The Postman motions it's okay as the Carrier struggles.
BLOODIED CARRIER
... he's... headed north. He's
gonna kill ten people in every
town. Then burn it to the ground.
For what you did...
The Postman is puzzled.
But Ford knows what and why.
BLOODIED CARRIER
He said to tell you Pine View's on
his way. He said he'd wait there,
but not for long.
(breaking down)
I was so scared, sir... I thought
they were going to kill me, too...
I wish they would have...
125
136
The Postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope.
He writes "Bethlehem" across the front, starts to write a
second letter. The door opens and Abby enters.
ABBY
Ford thinks you're going to do
something.
THE POSTMAN
I am.
The Postman watches as, outside, the mail carriers begin
to assemble.
THE POSTMAN
If I don't, those kids are going
to keep on getting themselves
killed.
ABBY
Ford doesn't know what it means to
be a kid. He doesn't have your
memories. None of them do. All
they've got is the lousy world we
gave them. And this is the only
decent thing in it.
THE POSTMAN
What? Being a postman? It's all
bullshit, Abby. All of it.
(beat)
I took this uniform off a skeleton
to stay warm. I made up the rest
to stay fed. There is no restored
United States.
ABBY
I knew it was something like that.
The Postman fingers the brim of the cap, softens.
(CONTINUED)
109.

THE POSTMAN
Weird thing is, being a Postman
was almost the best thing that
ever happened to me...
(re: red ribbon)
Remember this? You left it behind
that night.
ABBY
I remember...
THE POSTMAN
I always liked to think you left
it on purpose. But maybe you just
forgot it.
Abby doesn't answer.
She leaves instead.
137
140
A sign prohibits pedestrians, horses and bicycles. The
Postman and Abby ride by. The Postman no longer wears his
uniform. Their gear is packed behind their saddles.
As a family of transients begin to rise from where they're
camped in the breakdown lane:
THE POSTMAN
We can't help you. We're just as
lost as you are.
The Postman rides on. Abby watches over her shoulder as
they slowly begin to sit back down.
141
143
The family of transients are grilled by three Holnist
scouts. One man points the way Abby and Bethlehem rode.
117.

Abby sleeps beside the fire. The Postman, silhouetted
against the flames, heads toward the far tunnel exit.
149
166
Abby, in bed, holding her new baby in her arms. She's
reading a letter. What she reads makes her smile. She
puts the letter down and cuddles her baby.
ABBY
Your daddy wrote to tell you that
he'll be here as soon as he can.
And that he loves you very much.
Abby looks up to see The Postman standing at her door.
She looks at him, smiling with tears in her eyes.

THE POSTMAN
Mail's slow.
I'll have to see
about that.
Abby smiles down at the child in her arms.
ABBY
Your daughter.
Her name is Hope.
The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms.
WOMAN (V.O.)
And so my father returned home
after the Holnists were
defeated...
