      Stock footage of late 50's - early 60 s Manhattan - night-
      time shots of vintage skyscrapers, traffic, and people.



      From the air, we see an elegant modern glass building.  
      Below, the hats on the tops of men's heads swarm like ants 
      through revolving doors.



      An old gothic building.  Next to the revolving door we see a 
      plaque: "Midtown Medical Building".



      The silver blur of train cars passes.  We follow up a window 
      where Don sits nursing a drink, reading the paper.



      Don and a few other trench coated hat wearing businessmen *
      exit the station and run in the light drizzle to the parking 
      lot.



      The car pulls in.  Door opens, Don heads to the front door.  *
      He fumbles with his keys and puts them into the brightly 
      painted red door.



      We pull back from the dimly lit window.  The rain has 
      stopped.  Another car pulls in next door.  A man gets out and *
      heads in.  Houses stretch in the distance.*

                                                                          FADE OUT.
