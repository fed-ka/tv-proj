A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a
loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type.
DANNY (V.O.)
By the late 60's the government
finally cracked down and sent the
whole thing underground.
Bikers
controlled the market for a while.
As the structure explodes.
As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun
is blazing.
The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building
crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major
intersection.
Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light.
DANNY
Where to?
JIMMY
I know a guy.
DANNY
Lead the way.
They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses.
JIMMY
Nice day
DANNY
I hadn't noticed.
(beat)
I've seen you around.
What's your name?
JIMMY
Jimmy.
Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
DANNY
Why's that?
JIMMY
My features. They're Finnish.
DANNY
You don't say.
JIMMY
Finland is a country.
DANNY
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them.
Danny
looks at Jimmy.
DANNY
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Oh ... that.
Ah, he was just juiced.
He wouldn't have did nothin'
WHAP, WHAP! Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches
from Danny's head.
They run like hell.
TIME LAPSE.
The sun plunges down.
The sky turns black.
The moon
races up and down.
The sky lightens.
The sun races up and down.
Night comes again.
Danny waiting in the shadows.
A car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops.
Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the
back seat.
Danny, Tanner and Garcetti outside the car in a deserted park. Danny
pacing.
TANNER
You got a name?
DANNY
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
TANNER
What?
DANNY
Never mind.
Dude had a backfull of
jailhouse tatts.
QUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS.
TANNER
No last name?
DANNY
It was all pretty informal.
Didn't
have a lot of time to exchange
pleasantries.
Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges
over.
GARCETTI
This the guy?
DANNY
It speaks!
The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER".
Bobby's mug shot
glaring.
DANNY
That's him.
He's a lot prettier in
person though.
GARCETTI
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
DANNY
Dude is bugging.
Transparent
spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
GARCETTI
What's he holding?
Back on Danny.
DANNY
Yeah. Pretty sure.
(beat)
Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
TANNER
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
DANNY
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt.
They head back to the car.
DANNY (cont'd)
Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay?
TANNER
Danny, I'm touched.
DANNY
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
GARCETTI
Then why didn't you help the kid when
you were there?
DANNY
Hey, you want me to do all your work
for you, numbnuts?
Garcetti throws Danny up against the car.
Nose-to-nose.
GARCETTI
I'll tell you why you didn't help -
because you're a chickenshit tweaking
snitch.
You're a bottom feader,
Flynne.
DANNY
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off.
DANNY
You're welcome.
A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking
lot.
BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a
Bobby's sheet-covered body.
A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.
One of them suddenly does a graceful
little Tai-Chi gesture.
A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs.
REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.
His expression gives nothing
away.
A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb
and runs into a storm drain.
As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy
water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.
Danny and THE WOMAN FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH sitting on the shore.
Watching
the sunset. She is his wife, LIZ.
Danny playing "SAETA" on his trumpet.
Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by
the falling sun.
A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around
her face.
A dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen.
Danny finishes playing.
Silence.
IMPORTANT: DANNY WILL BE KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.
LIZ
That's so ...
(not finishing the word)
DANNY / TOM
Melancholy?
LIZ
Yes, it hurts my heart.
What a
beautiful composition.
DANNY/TOM
And the performance?
LIZ
(goofing)
A virtuoso rendition.
TOM VAN ALLEN
is nothing short of dazzling in his
interpretation of Miles Davis'
haunting, moody piece.
DANNY/TOM
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
LIZ
And he has a really hot ass with hardly
any hair on it.
DANNY/TOM
Again, I thank you.
LIZ
I was talking about Miles.
Danny playfully tackles her to the ground.
DANNY/TOM
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
LIZ
And you've got wiener breath.
DANNY/TOM
Really?
LIZ
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Danny starts kissing her over and over again.
LIZ
(laughing)
Tom! Gross!
She finally pushes him off.
He rolls off of her and snuggles up next
to her, spooning her in the sand.
DANNY/TOM
You know how I make that song
melancholy when I play it?
I think of what my life would be like
without you.
Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny.
LIZ
Tom, let's spend the night here.
DANNY/TOM
There's no motels around here.
LIZ
No.
Right here on the beach.
Come
on. Let's do it.
Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table.
Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED
DOLLAR BILLS.
Danny watching silently.
Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and
slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it.
The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.
DANNY
You think I'm a Judas?
TANNER
Hard to compare the people you're
taking down with the Lord.
DANNY
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
TANNER
Garcetti thinks everything is shit.
He doesn't even like dolphins.
Danny smiles.
TANNER (cont'd)
I'm serious.
He hates 'em.
You ever
hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?
Tanner shakes his head and smiles.
DANNY
Thanks for not judging me.
TANNER
It's not my place.
DANNY
Don't you wonder why I do it?
TANNER
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself
out of jail? I know the drill.
DANNY
You don't find that repugnant?
TANNER
Just the way the world works.
Look,
as far as tweakers go, you aren't a
bad guy.
You never hurt anyone but
yourself as far as I know.
DANNY
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
TANNER
Bobby laid his own tracks.
He could
have gone quietly but he played the
hard-ass con till the end. And as
far as I'm concerned, he wife and
kid are a hell of a lot better off
without him.
(beat)
Now take the money.
Danny stuffs the money into his jacket.
TANNER (cont'd)
One think I do want to know is how
the hell did you get yourself into
this position to start with?
You
seem like a smart enough guy.
DANNY
It's a long story.
Maybe I'll tell
you all about it some day.
Garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up.
DANNY (cont'd)
Hey, Garcetti ... You ever get
confused and try to flush yourself?
Garcetti
(all business)
You tell him?
TANNER
I was getting to it.
DANNY
(to Tanner)
Tell me what?
GARCETTI
I'll tell him.
DANNY
(worried)
Tell me what?
Garcetti sits down next to Danny. Sighs.
GARCETTI
(mock concern)
Danny, it's really pains me to have to
tell you this, but do you remember
DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us
put away for trafficking a few months back?
DANNY
Yeah.
What about him?
GARCETTI
Turns out he's connected.
DANNY
To who?
GARCETTI
The Mexicali Boys
DANNY
And what does this have to do with me?
Garcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up.
GARCETTI
He knows somebody ratted him.
DANNY
What?!
GARCETTI
And he's making a lot of noise about
having his homies hang a Colombian
necktie on whoever it was.
Garcetti leans in close
GARCETTI (cont'd)
You know that thing where they slit
your throat and pull your tongue out
of the hole.
Danny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up.
Garcetti stalks him.
GARCETTI (cont'd)
Apparently they call it a necktie
because it hangs down about yay long
and looks very similar to a tie.
Isn't that weird, Danny?
Isn't that
weird?
DANNY
Shut up, Garcetti!
Danny turns to Tanner
DANNY
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
TANNER
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's
you.
Domingo was a slinger, he must
have sold to hundreds of different people.
Danny paces back and forth.
TANNER (cont'd)
And if you're that worried about it,
maybe you ought to get out of town.
DANNY
How the hell am I gonna do that?
You
guys are still stringing me a long on
that possession charge.
GARCETTI
(mock surprise)
You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet?
Garcetti chuckles at Danny's fear
DANNY
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this
for almost a year. I've done
everything you guys have asked of me.
GARCETTI
Anyone ever ask you to be such a
disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
TANNER
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
DANNY
When?
TANNER
Soon. I promise.
We'll get the
charges dropped and you can
disappear.
In the mean time, trust
me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone.
A PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny.
Danny stands up.
Dusts his pants off.
The truck stops nearby.
The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside.
Danny approaches.
The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ...
... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and
a rodeo belt.
He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.
This is BUBBA.
An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba
astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela
Anderson-type on the saddle behind him.
DANNY
(checking out the painting)
Ride 'em cowboy)
BUBBA
(southern twang)
You like that?
DANNY
Who wouldn't?
BUBBA
First rate, ain't it?
DANNY
It's downright classy is what it is.
Bubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a
gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster.
DANNY (cont'd)
You consider my presentation?
BUBBA
Get in, hoss.
We'll talk it over.
Danny climbs in.
The window goes back up.
As the care pulls away, we
...
... MOVE back over to the gravestone.
The stone reads: "ELIZABETH VAN ALLEN.
BELOVED WIFE"
A non-descript. cinder block bar.
No windows.
No frills.
Danny walking home.
Sparse traffic on the street. He walks with his
head down and his hands thrust in his pockets.
A RED CAR approaches from the opposite direction. It SLOWS as it passes
Danny.
Danny looks over.
The DRIVER is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight, but it
is obvious that he is staring right at Danny.
Danny plays it cool. Keeps walking.
The red car pulls a SLOW U-TURN.
Danny hauls ass.
The red car catching up.
7Danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a
series of apartment complexes.
The red car follows, slowly prowling the street.
Danny squeezed behind a dumpster, watching.
It is now too dark to see the driver.
The car comes to a stop.
Danny hugging the dumpster tight.
Another car pulls into the tight street, behind the red car.
The
driver of the other car SOUNDS HIS HORN.
The red car speeds off.
Danny walks quickly the other way.
Rows of decaying stucco apartment buildings.
Danny and Jimmy walking
away from one of the structures.
Danny pockets the GLOCK he just purchased.
He also carries a BULLET-
PROOF VEST over this shoulder.
DANNY
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
JIMMY
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
They walk along.
JIMMY
You wanna score some go-fast?
DANNY
Not tonight.
They continue on. Jimmy looks at the vest.
JIMMY
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
DANNY
Personal protection. It's a
dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a
very dangerous world.
A spray painted rusty Chevy Vega belching black smoke.
All of the
lights are broken.
A sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert.
A GUY passes out in the front yard.
A DOG sniffs at him, then starts
pissing on him.
He never moves.
A PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway.
CLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.
It almost
blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more
disconcerting.
He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a
long exhale.
POOH-BEAR
Okay, here we go gentlemen ...
A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the
driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape.
Pooh-Bear working the remote control device.
POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
Zapruder?
A GUY filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera.
GRAINY SUPER 8 FOOTAGE: the pigeons continue along, their stupid eyes
glazed with confusion.
ZAPRUDER
Ready.
POOH-BEAR
Oswald?
ANOTHER GUY sighting a scoped pellet gun.
OSWALD
Roger that.
POOH-BEAR
Grassy knoll?
A THIRD GUY aiming a pellet gun further down and to the right of
"Oswald".
GRASSY KNOLL
Ready
POOH-BEAR
Third shooter?
THE THIRD SHOOTER is also armed with a pellet gun
THIRD SHOOTER
It's a go.
Pooh-Bear watches anxiously.
POOH-BEAR
President Kennedy waving to the
crowd, his lovely wife looking
radiant beside him as they turn into
Dealey Plaza ...
GRAINY FOOTAGE: the car making a turn, the pigeons oblivious.
POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
Stand by, gentlemen.
Stand by ...
(beat, eyes widening)
Steady .... steady ... FIRE!
The three men open up simultaneously.
GRAINY FOOTAGE: a mass of feathers flying as the pigeons are hit.
Pooh-Bear pumps his fist.
POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
Yes!
Yes!
(beat)
Out! That's a wrap.
Good job, boys. Good job.
The car continues rolling past the feet of ...
... Danny and Jimmy, who have been watching the whole thing from the
periphery
POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
(to Danny and Jimmy)
So? What do you think?
DANNY/JIMMY
(ad-libbing)
- Cool.
- Yeah. Interesting.
Pooh-Bear takes the camera from "Zapruder".
POOH-BEAR
(holding up the camera)
I'm gonna get this developed and send
it to the Warren Commission.
DANNY
Um, I think the Warren Commission has
been closed for a while.
POOH-BEAR
No shit?
(thinking)
Fuck it.
I'll send it to Oliver Stone then.
He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
OSWALD (O.S.)
Pooh-Bear! We got a problem.
Oswald is standing over the car, prodding one of the pigeons with his
pellet gun.
OSWALD (cont'd)
J.F.K.'s still alive.
(beat)
Should I finish him off?
Kujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the
path of ...
... an ONCOMING AMBULANCE, which drags him underneath for a good fifty
feet.
Urban blight abounds
Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street.
Garcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out
building.
He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the
mike.
DANNY (O.S.)
(filtered, broken)
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot
of choice.
BUBBA (O.S.)
(filtered)
Get used to it.
You're in a very
tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner.
GARCETTI
You thinking what I'm thinking?
TANNER
Yeah.
This could be the one we're
looking for.
Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner.
Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...
... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.
Danny ducks into a
liquor store and watches from the window.
The red car cruises slowly past.
Danny squinting, trying to make out ...
... THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.
A street light illuminates the tag
momentarily.
A VANITY PLATE: IFORGIV.
Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it.
The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road.
A dilapidated house further up in the hills, lights glowing.
Danny waiting on the corner.
GARCETTI (V.O.)
When is the deal going down?
DANNY (V.O.)
I'm making the small buy tonight ...
if I don't get beaten to death with a
wheelchair or something.
If
everyone is happy, we'll do the big
deal later in the week.
Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.
Jimmy gets out and
hands Danny the keys.
ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU!
Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car,
leaving Jimmy with the sign.
JIMMY
You sure you don't want me to go with you?
Danny burns rubber.
Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE
BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little.
Danny, Garcetti and Tanner.
Tanner doing a chemical test on the meth
with a field kit.
The tester turns a tell-tale blue.
TANNER
We're in business.
GARCETTI
Good work, Flynne.
You're a first-rate rat.
DANNY
That's real sweet, Garcetti.
Thanks.
TANNER
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Tanner produces a print out from an F.B.I criminal computer file.
A
MUG SHOT OF BUBBA.
The name BUFORD "BUBBA" NGUYEN underneath.
TANNER (cont'd)
Nothing local so we ran his prints
through the F.B.I. Believed to be a
major supplier in Texas.
Jumped bail
on a murder rap last April.
DANNY
Murder.
Beautiful.
TANNER
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Danny heaves a sign and plops down on a bench.
DANNY
You know, I'm starting to think I'd
rather take my chances with Domingo
than go through any more of this shit.
GARCETTI
Didn't you hear?
Domingo's dead.
Danny looks up.
TANNER
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
DANNY
Jesus.
TANNER
I thought you'd be happy.
DANNY
Yeah.
He doesn't look happy.
The red car with "IFORGIV" plates parked in the driveway of a modest
Spanish-style house.
Danny's car parked out front.
Jimmy and Danny squinting in the mid-morning sun. They stand face-to-
face.
DANNY
You mad at me, Jimmy?
Jimmy shrugs.
JIMMY
I don't know... a little. I wish you
would have let me in on it from the
beginning.
DANNY
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Danny taps Jimmy's arm.
DANNY
You know you can get that tattoo removed,
don't you.
Jimmy rubs his arm where the tattoo is.
JIMMY
Nah... I want to keep it.
(beat)
Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration
...you know...like when
I detox?
DANNY
Good for you Jimmy.
Danny takes the envelope from his pocket.
DANNY
I really want you to take this.
Danny tries to hive Jimmy the envelope. Jimmy pushes it away.
JIMMY
Wouldn't be a favor if you were
paying me. I'll just take my five
when the deal is done.
DANNY
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Tanner and Garcetti's car parked on the periphery.
Danny watches them drive away. When he is sure that they are gone, he
looks around. Sees...
...A PLUMBER'S TRUCK parked on the other side of the park.
The PLUMBER'S TRUCK enters the underground parking lot.
Danny putting gas in his car, Liz in the passenger's seat reading.
On the other side of the pump, A RED HAIRED MAN with a bad comb-over.
The brightest, reddest hair you've ever seen with a BIG STREAK OF WHITE
RUNNING THROUGH IT.
His back is TURNED. We can't see his face.
His arm and hands resting on top of the pump.
Danny looks at the guy's hand. A GUADY CLASS RING on his finger: EL
CAMINO COLLEGE, CLASS OF '84.
Danny sitting on a bus bench across from the parking lot.
TANNER AND GARCETTI exit the building and head over to their car.
Danny watches from behind a magazine as they drive past him.
DANNY (V.O.)
I swear to God I would have done 'em
right then and there...but I had to
be positive.
And even if Tanner was
involved, I had to be sure about
Garcetti
Danny talking to a MEXICAN DUDE on the corner.
Danny slips the guy some money.
DANNY (V.O.)
So I became Danny Flynne.
The Mexican dude holds up something for Danny to see...
...A DRIVER'S LICENSE. It is him on the photo, but the name reads,
DANIEL FLYNNE.
On Danny's last line, we see TWO CAR BUMPERS COLLIDING AT LOW SPEED.
Tanner and Garcetti in the car that has been rear-ended.
Danny in the offending car, empty beer cans scattered on the front
seat.
Danny spread-eagle over the hood with Garcetti roughly searching him.
DANNY (V.O.)
I dropped myself right in their laps.
Garcetti pulls a baggie of meth from Danny's pocket.
Danny, Garcetti and Tanner at the picnic table, talking.
DANNY (V.O.)
I gave up whoever they asked for,
whenever they wanted. I was a
fucking dream rat. But the whole
time I was sizing them up, looking
for any evidence that they were the
guys who killed my wife.
Danny watching from the shadows as Tanner and Garcetti haul a DOPE
DEALER away in cuffs.
DANNY (V.O.)
But they did everything by the book.
F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY
DANNY
I knew that if these were the guys I
was looking for, I'd have to set up a
deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able
to walk away from it.
TRAHN
That's when he called me. He told me
his story and he pitched me a plan.
DANNY
These guys are smart. I knew they
wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew
all the players. I needed a big buyer.
Tanner and Garcetti watching Battle enter the building.
TRAHN (V.O.)
We had one of our C.I.'s call Tanner
and Garcetti with an "anonymous" tip
about the deal.
TANNER
(the line takes on a whole new meaning)
This could be the one we're looking for.
Colette standing across the street, looking at...
...TWO COPS exiting a patrol car.
Colette is crying her eyes out. She is HOLDING the BAGGIE OF METH that
Danny gave her.
The cops enter the building just as...
... Danny drives by in Jimmy's car, followed by...
... TWO OF THE AGENTS from the conference room. They remain a good
half-block behind him.
Danny pulls into the market.
The agents pull over to the curb, watching.
Danny is in and out in no time. He hustles back into his car and drives
away.
Tanner and Garcetti outside of a car we have never seen before. The
truck is open.
Garcetti putting a phony license plate. Tanner sifting through the
trunk.
IN THE TRUNK - A sawed off SHOTGUN, TWO SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANGUNS, TWO
KNIVES, GLOVES AND SKI -MASKS.

The Vega pulls into the lot of a tumbleweed motel in the middle of
nowhere.
TWO MOTEL MAIDS pushing a cleaning cart.
They are wearing small ear
piece receivers.

MAID ONE
I've got a visual.
AGENT ONE

Red team?
TWO WORKMEN, repairing the motel sign out front.
WORKMAN ONE
He's heading to his room.

Black team?
Tanner pulls the car in behind a rock formation on the bluff.
Trahn pulls into the lot.
He emerges from the car with his briefcase,
looks around, then heads down to the room.
Trahn checks his watch, then KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.
DANNY (O.S.)
It's open.
Tanner scanning with the night vision glasses.
TANNER
Here he comes.
REVEAL that the car is on a bluff above POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND.
Danny pulls up in a rental car.
On the placid sea as DANNY'S HORRIFIC SCREAM resounds from the house in
the distance.
Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop.
He looks like a new
man.
DANNY (V.O.)
Well, I've had some time to think
about it and it's pretty simple after
all.
I guess it's like the man said -
"Man is the measure of all things."
I should know.
I ran the gamut.
Avenging Angel, Judas, loving
husband, prodigal son, prince of
Denmark.
I was all of those things.
(beat)
Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
Good for Tom.
And Danny Flynne? He
got gut-shot for being the low-life
rat that he was.
Sucks for him.
(beat)
But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.
Danny looks through the window of the shop.
Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.
DANNY (cont'd)
But what about this guy? Who is he?
Danny enters the shop.
DANNY (cont'd)
To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.
