      The myriad of vessels JUMP. And as Galactica disappears...

                                  KARA (PRELAP)
                    NOOOOOOO!


      as Lee follows Athena, carrying his bags, into

      THE HANGAR DECK

      and into a total surprise. Everyone s there. Officers, 
      pilots, mechanics, all in DRESS UNIFORM. Lee, dumbfounded, 
      listens to Helo instruct the gathering.

                                  HELO
                    Attention to orders!

      Everyone snaps to attention and salutes. Now Tigh makes the 
      formal introduction.

      CONTINUED:3030

                                  TIGH
                    In recognition of loyal, faithful, 
                    and honorable service, Madam 
                      President, Admiral of The Colonial 
                    Fleet, Ladies and Gentlemen, Major 
                    Lee Adama.  

      SPIRITED APPLAUSE fills the entire hangar deck, followed by 
      CHEERS and WHISTLES.  A SERIES OF SHOTS FOLLOW:

      LEE 

      unspeakably moved, makes his way down a line, shaking hands 
      with our regulars, including Helo, Narcho, Racetrack, Seelix 
      Cally and Gaeta. In an odd coincidence the Final Four, TYROL, 
      ANDERS, TIGH, AND TORY -- stand in sequence in the row. 

      CALLY

      noticing brief eye-contact between Tyrol and Tory...

      DUALLA

      steps forward. She presents Lee with HIS WINGS, mounted and 
      framed. It s a slightly awkward moment for the estranged 
      couple, which Lee tries to defuse. Re: Galactica...

                                  LEE
                    Looks like you got the house.

      Dualla smiles through her silent grief. Hugs him.

                                  DUALLA
                    Good bye, Lee.

      LAURA

      Out of the corner of her eye, she catches Adama s proud, but 
      rueful stare. Laura and Lee exchange a strained smile, the 
      after taste of Baltar s trial still lingering. 

                                  LAURA
                          (extending a hand)
                    Mister Adama.

                                  LEE
                    Madam President.
                          (adding)
                    I m a little surprised to see you 
                    here.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/0743.

      CONTINUED: (2)3030

                                  LAURA
                    I have too much respect for your 
                    father not to be present.
                          (stainless steel)
                    Good luck. On Colonial One.

      Lee almost flinches at the remark.  Helo starts up a chant.

                                  HELO
                    Apollo. Apollo. Apollo...

                                  TYROL
                          (picking it up)
                    Apollo! Apollo! Apollo!

      Now the entire hangar deck is shouting, APOLLO! APOLLO! 
      APOLLO! and over the deafening cheers,

      ADAMA

      stoic. Chin up. Offers his hand.  Lee takes it, but turns the 
      handshake into an embrace.  Whispers into his father s ear.

                                  LEE
                    Watch over her. Please.

      Adama squeezes his eyes closed and clings to his son.  He 
      knows Lee s not talking about Dualla or Laura...


      Kara s Viper, with Adama in it, spits out of GALACTICA.
