      INT. ANDY AND LAURIE S APARTMENT - DAY

      WILL (36, think Dax Shepard), a man child, musician slacker 
      with unanticipated depth and charm, awkwardly holds a squirmy 
      newborn baby. Watching him are ANDY (30s, think Mike White), 
      Will s slacker and thoroughly whipped stay at home dad best 
      friend, and LAURIE (30s, think Sarah Silverman), Andy s P.R. 
      exec wife with the edge of a thousand moms. Wreaking havoc 
      elsewhere are their other kids BEN, (4) and STACY (3).

                                  LAURIE
                    Is this little Angel beautiful or 
                    what?

      Will looks at BABY JONAH S FACE -- not a particularly 
      beautiful baby.

                                  WILL
                    I m going with  what .

                                  LAURIE
                    Smell him, Will. Smell his face. 
                    There s nothing more beautiful than 
                    the smell of baby face.

      Will gingerly leans in a few inches away--

                                  WILL
                    I m getting nothing.

                                  ANDY
                    Honey, he ll smell Jonah later.

                                  WILL
                    I m pretty sure I won t.

                                  LAURIE
                    Get your head in there. Smell our 
                    baby.

      Laurie pushes Will s head right into the baby s face just as 
      the baby throws up on his face!

                                  WILL
                    MOTHER OF GOD! 

      Will starts wiping the throw up off his face using Baby 
      Jonah s onesie.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/132.


                                  LAURIE
                    Stop that! You two need to bond. 
                    You re going to be his Godparent 
                    forever. Until the end of time. 

                                  WILL
                    His Godparent?

                                  ANDY
                    You know, his guardian. In case 
                    anything should ever happen to us.  

      They both look at Will, smiling expectantly. Will considers--

                                  WILL
                    Let s just play this out. Say you 
                    two are on a plane, and the plane 
                    goes down. Mechanical error. 
                    Tragic, of course, and I m sure it 
                    would never, ever, ever happen. But 
                    let s say it did. You go down. You 
                    nose dive into the side of a 
                    mountain which happens all the 
                    time. Or into the side of another 
                    plane, which doesn t happen as 
                    often as you d think. Or into a 
                    cruise ship which never happened 
                    but would be really cool.

                                  ANDY
                    What s your point here, Will?

                                  WILL
                    Either way, no survivors. So. Where 
                    does that put me and Jonah?

                                  LAURIE
                    Where does it PUT you? 

                                  WILL
                    It doesn t mean I d be, like, 
                    his... the guy who... His...

                                  LAURIE
                    Father. You d be his father.

                                  WILL
                          (looks to Andy)
                    Dude, didn t you say we had to--

                                  ANDY
                    Shop. Yes. We ve gotta shop.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/133.


      Andy quickly starts to pack up the kids to get ready for 
      their escape. They start out the door. Laurie explodes.

                                  LAURIE
                    See, Andy? I told you, he s a 
                    terrible choice. He s a child. He s 
                    pathetic. He cares more about his 
                    stupid guitar collection than 
                    people. Go ahead, run away with 
                    your friend. Children!

                                  ANDY
                    Love you, babe. We ll be back soon.

                                  LAURIE
                          (calling after them)
                    FUCKING CHILDREN!

      And they re gone.

                              ACT ONE


      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY

      Ah. Much more peaceful. Will and Andy stroll down one of 
      those beautiful hilly streets in San Francisco. Andy is laden 
      with Jonah in a baby bjorn and Ben and Stacy in a double 
      stroller.  Will holds a shopping bag filled with diapers and 
      other baby products. 

                                  WILL
                    You are living my nightmare. Your 
                    life is my cautionary tale.

                                  ANDY
                    Knowing I play such a critical role 
                    in your life makes me whole. 

                                  WILL
                    Why would you ask me to be a 
                      Godparent? You know me.

                                  ANDY
                    I fought for you. It was you or 
                    Laurie s crazy sister. 

                                  WILL
                    Right, I keep forgetting Laurie s 
                    the sane one in her family. The 
                    point is I don t have room in my 
                    life for another child. I have me.

      Will stops cold as a GORGEOUS WOMAN gets out of a Mini 
      Cooper. This is DAKOTA (30s, think Leslie Mann).

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Hold the phone. Look at that woman. 
                    She s a Goddess. 

                                  ANDY
                    Yeah. Whatever. She s hot.

                    Does your penis remember what life 
                    was like before them?

      Will sees her take a cello out of her car.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Oh my God. A cello? Hot. That s 
                    like a big guitar.

                    I ve gotta get pumped. Chest bump. 
                    Get me pumped. 

                                  ANDY
                    I have a kid on my chest.

                                  WILL
                    Wow, is that not getting me pumped.

      Will rushes over to Dakota.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                          (hello)

                    Hah. I ve never heard that one.

                                  WILL
                    Listen, I m going to be honest with 
                    you right now. I am a cello freak. 
                    Okay? I m obsessed with cellos. So 
                    it s one thing to be the most 
                    beautiful woman ever, but then to 
                    pull a cello out of your car is 
                    just not fair.

                                  DAKOTA
                    That s very nice, but really I m--

                                  WILL
                    You don t believe me.

                                  DAKOTA

                    cellos cause you re gorgeous.

                    No...

      Will starts listing. As he does, Dakota becomes more and more 
      stunned--

                    #2, in G major. Dark, brooding, and 
                      virtuosic. Rubinstein s #2, in D, 
                    Opus 96, why this isn't way better 
                    known, I have no idea. Haydn, D.

                    D'Albert C, Opus 20, lyrical, 
                    mellow, and haunting; another one 
                    whose neglect I cannot understand. 
                    But the greatest of all is the 
                    Dvorak Concerto--

                                  DAKOTA

                    So I say again,  Cello. 

      She cracks up, can only join in--

                    I m Dakota. And I m late.

      She starts toward the building. Will sees the sign on the 
      door, for Single Parents Group. He makes a snap decision.

                                  WILL
                    Me too. I m late too.

                    was not for the faint of heart. One 
                    night, Jonah said to me,  Daddy? 
                    I m sorry I m so sick.  And I 
                    looked at him and said,  Son, you 
                    are the greatest thing that s ever 
                    happened in my life. And I would 
                    gladly give my life to make you 
                    healthy.  

      Every single woman in the room is riveted and tearing up.

                    After six months in Africa we 
                    returned. The doctors examined him 
                    and the cancer was gone. I have him 
                    back. I have my boy back.

      They all walk up to him, gather around him and pull him into 
      a hug. Will looks at Dakota who looks back at him. She wipes 
      away a tear. And BOOM!


      INT. WILL S CONDO - LATER

      Sexy time. Will and Dakota are on the bed. Clothes are a  
      flying. 

                                  DAKOTA
                    I just want to let you know that

                    So I need to schedule me-time 
                    Tuesday and Thursday mornings.

                    I am free every Tuesday and 
                    Thursday forever, so that works.

      More clothes come off! Yea! Then a phone BUZZES.

                    Ooh, that s me. Hold on...

      Will laughs, but then does a double take when Dakota 
        ungracefully rolls off the bed and digs into her bag for her 
      phone.

                                  WILL
                    Are you kidding?

                    I just have to make sure it s not 
                    one of my girls. I m like 
                      umbilically attached. You know what 
                    that s like.

                                  WILL
                    Of course I do, but my umbilical 
                    is, like, wireless.

      Dakota reads her text. Her entire expression changes. She 
      rises, starts to button up.

                                  DAKOTA
                    Oh no. They changed my daughter s 
                    hot lunch menu at school at the 
                    last minute. They tried to give her 
                    Kung Pao chicken.

                                  WILL
                    Too spicy? Cause if you drown it in 
                    soy sauce... 

                                  DAKOTA
                    Kung Pao chicken has peanuts. She 
                    has a nut allergy. She could die.

                                  WILL
                    Oh. OH. 

      Now a little pissed, Dakota walks out. Will realizes--

      EXT. WILL S CONDO - DAY

      Will emerges in his tighty whities and runs past FIONA (late 
      30s, think Minnie Driver) exudes vegan throwback hippie-ness, 
      holding moving boxes. She is not happy to see this half-naked 
      man who apparently is her new neighbor.

                                  FIONA
                    Um, HELLO!?

      Will runs straight to Dakota, who is rushing into her car.

                                  WILL
                    Wait. Dakota. I need your number! 
                    You owe me an orgasm! 

      Fiona is appalled. Watches Will get Dakota s number. Fiona 
      watches as Will charms Dakota, leaning over into the driver s 
      window and kissing her, so that Fiona is staring at his butt.

      Dakota drives away. Will turns, does a little victory dance, 
      waving Dakota s phone number in the air, and comes face to 
      face with Fiona, who looks at him, livid. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)

                    friendly.

                    By the way, if you see a pair like 
                    these in the laundry, they re mine.

      He extends his hand to shake it.

                    when there s less of you flopping 
                    about?

      Fiona goes in her apartment and slams the door. Behind the 
      door, REVEAL MARCUS (11), weird, wearing John Lennon glasses 
      and a hat that belongs on a 70-year-old Frenchman. He stares 
      at Will, fascinated.


      EXT. WILL S BACKYARD - ANOTHER DAY

      Will is in his tiny backyard, barbecuing a steak as he 
      grooves to hip hop. He turns and sees Fiona in her 
      identically small backyard.

                    I was wondering if you could not do

      INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

      Marcus enters the terrifying war zone that is a middle school 
      cafeteria. Everywhere he looks, terror lurks. Dressed in his 
      weird glasses and weird hat and unhip wardrobe, he looks like 
      a complete freak. It turns out a San Francisco public middle 
      school is full of the same terrifying people as the public 
      school in El Segundo -- he passes tables of Jocks, Losers, 
      Developed Girls, Druggies, Nerds. The one unifying 
      characteristic of all of these groups seems to be that they 
      all think Marcus is a freak. He starts to sit at an empty 
      table, but before he can a hand comes into frame and pulls 
      the chair out. He is face to face with DOUG (13), a mean shit 
      head.  Around him, a POSSE of bullies.

                    Don t even think about sitting 
                    here, freak.

      Marcus moves along to another empty table as Doug hurls a 
      milk carton at Marcus, it splatters all over him.

      Marcus sits at a table. Reaches into his lunch bag and opens 
      a container of gluten free pudding. Starts to eat.


      INT. WILL S APARTMENT - ANOTHER EVENING

                    My mom has brown hair too.

      Dakota sees Marcus and completely melts.

                                  DAKOTA
                    Oh my God! You must be Jonah!

      Dakota engulfs a confused Marcus in a hug. OFF Will...

                           ACT TWO


      INT. WILL S CONDO - SECONDS LATER

      Dakota, Will and Marcus are walking in.

                                  WILL
                    Actually, Jonah was just leaving. 
                    He has a friend next door.

                                  DAKOTA
                    Jonah, from everything I ve heard 
                    about you, it s just an honor 
                    meeting you. You are so brave.

                                  MARCUS
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  DAKOTA
                    You re so humble. Tell me what it 
                    was like in Africa.

                                  MARCUS
                    I ve never been to Africa. 

                                  WILL
                    He blocks it out. He s having a 
                    night terror.

                                  DAKOTA
                    It s day time.

                                  WILL
                    Not in Africa.

                                  MARCUS
                    I don t know what you re--

      Will grabs Marcus, pulls his face into his chest and wraps 
      him in a hug--

                                  WILL
                    He just starts shaking and 
                      screaming. The only thing you can 
                    do is hold him. 
                          (looks right at Marcus)
                    Jonah, don t say anything, Jonah. 
                    Don t speak. Just take breaths. 
                    Jonah. Jonah.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1317.


                                  DAKOTA
                    So he doesn t remember anything 
                    about the leukemia? The sweat 
                    lodges? The voodoo?

      Marcus looks at Will. It s all sinking in. This is a huge lie 
      and Will needs Marcus to be part of it. He needs him. Huh, 
        interesting.

                                  MARCUS
                    I think I know what s going on, and 
                    I have to tell you the truth.

      Will looks at Marcus, terrified.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    I would say that if it wasn t for 
                    my father, I would be dead right 
                    now. I owe him my life. Dad...

      Marcus walks to Will and gives him a huge tight hug. Dakota 
      melts. Marcus whispers in Will s ear.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    You owe me. Big.

      OFF Will...


      INT. ANDY AND LAURIE S APARTMENT - LATER

      Andy cooks dinner. Will is helping sort of, chopping onions. 
      Laurie is with the kids, taking care of them.

                                  LAURIE
                    You invented a kid and then you 
                    gave him leukemia. Do you realize 
                    what a sick bastard you are?

                                  WILL
                    But I cured him. I m an imaginary 
                    miracle worker.

                                  ANDY
                    You need to tell her the truth.

                                  WILL
                    I can t. You don t understand. Fake  
                    Will is so much better than real 
                    Will. She is like super into fake 
                    Will. And I am too.  He s awesome!  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1318.


                                  LAURIE
                    She s over twenty-two, isn t that a 
                    little old for you?

                                  WILL
                    I don t judge your boring sex life, 
                    why do you judge my awesome sex 
                    life?

                                  ANDY
                    You judge my boring sex life all 
                    the time. 
                          (to Laurie, realizing)
                    He calls it boring. I call it 
                    reliable.
                          (sees that s a bad choice)
                    Steady... Consistent?

                                  LAURIE
                    Can you not see how badly this is 
                    going to blow up in your face?

                                  WILL
                    You know what? What s the harm in 
                    playing this out? I m a much better 
                    person pretending to be a fake 
                    Will. And Marcus seems to be okay 
                    being fake Jonah.

                                  LAURIE
                    JONAH? You named your fake kid 
                    JONAH?


      INT. WILL S CONDO - DAY

      Will sits there watching TV and there s a knock on the door. 
      He gets up, answers it. It s Marcus. He just walks in.

                                  MARCUS
                    Hey. Got any more of that cheese 
                    left?

      Will watches him walk right into his apartment.

                                  WILL
                    Marcus? I don t want you to get the 
                    wrong idea. I appreciate you 
                    running with me the other day, but 
                    I m not your... We re not going to 
                    be friends.

                                  WILL
                    Well, for one reason I m thirty six 
                    and you re like eight.

                                  MARCUS
                    I m eleven.

                                  WILL
                    Still a pretty wide spread.

                                  MARCUS
                    I think we can become friends. 
                    Honestly, I think we re already 
                    pretty close. And anyway, you owe 
                    me a dinner for what I did for you. 

                                  WILL
                    I didn t say a dinner.

                                  MARCUS
                    I m saying a dinner.

      Marcus just walks past. 


      INT. WILL S CONDO - LATER

      Marcus and Will sit in front of the huge flat screen eating 
      from takeout containers. Marcus drinks straight from a bottle 
      of soda, Will from a bottle of beer. Marcus imitates Will s 
      slouchy couch potato stance on the couch.

      Marcus reaches out for a spare rib.

                                  WILL
                    What are you doing with that?

                                  MARCUS
                    I'm going to eat it.

                                  WILL
                    Don't touch those ribs. Those are 
                    my ribs. You eat the slimy vegan 
                    beans. Do you want your mom to kill 
                    me?

                                  MARCUS
                    I m already drinking soda from the 
                    bottle. We re through the looking 
                    glass.

      Marcus takes a bite of the spare rib. At first just a small 
      bite. He chews. Swallows. Registers it. Then, he takes 
      another bite. And another. Until he eats the entire thing.   ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1320.


      He reaches for another spare rib. Ravishes it. Another one. 
      Another. He s taking a spare rib bath. Will watches. 

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    Okay. That tastes nothing like soy.

      This gets Will to smile. 


      INT. WILL S CONDO - ANOTHER DAY

      Will opens the door. It s Marcus again. Will reluctantly lets 
      him in.


      INT. WILL S CONDO - LATER

      Will grudgingly watches  Rudy  with Marcus on his big flat 
      screen TV. Marcus is totally engrossed in the movie as he 
      munches popcorn. Offers the bowl to Will.

                                  MARCUS
                    Popcorn?

      Will takes it. Eats some. Steals another look at Marcus; he d 
      never admit it but he s kind of getting used to the company.


      INT. WILL S CONDO - ANOTHER DAY

      Will opens the door. Marcus walks in again. Will looks at 
      him. Really? Again?


      INT. WILL S CONDO - GARAGE - DAY

      Will and Marcus play ping pong. 

                                  WILL
                    So one by one, all my friends get 
                    married, they start having kids, 
                    and their lives as they know it are

      INT. WILL S CONDO - ANOTHER DAY

      Will opens the door, Marcus walks in. Will rolls his eyes, 
      but he is getting used to this.


      INT. WILL S CONDO - DAY

      Will and Marcus play chess. Marcus is beating Will. Will 
      thinks long and hard and finally moves his knight. Marcus 
      immediately captures it with a pawn.

                                  WILL
                    Shoot! Can I take that back?

                                  MARCUS
                    Better to lose with dignity.

                                  WILL
                    You re right. More guac?

                                  MARCUS
                    Sure. 

      They get up. As Will goes to the fridge Marcus turns on a 
      synthesizer and starts hitting some keys. 

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    What do you do with this?

                                  WILL
                    That machine turns an ordinary 
                    white man into a brother. Check it 
                    out. 

      Will pokes out a melody on the keyboard.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Pretty lame, right?

                                  MARCUS
                    I like it.

                                  WILL
                    Trust me. It s lame. Okay, now 
                    listen.

      Will codes in a rhythm into the synth, and the same melody 
      plays, but now under a hip hop rhythm. Marcus is totally 
      enchanted.

                    Wow.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1322.


      Will totally dances to the beat. Cracks Marcus up. Then they 
      go to the guac and chips. Marcus wonders whether to bring 
      something up, then--

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    Did you get made fun of at school?

      Will gets that Marcus is going into territory that he s 
      vulnerable about.

                                  WILL
                    A little, I guess. Why? Do you?

                                  MARCUS
                      Constantly. Everyone makes fun of 
                    me. Even the nice kids. I guess I 
                    bring it out in people. 

                                  WILL
                    And those kids that were standing 
                    on the corner the first day you 
                    came over? Were they hassling you?

                                  MARCUS
                    If you call following me home from 
                    school and picking me up and 
                    throwing me headfirst into a trash 
                    bin hassling me, then yes.

                                  WILL
                    You can t let them do that.

                    Thanks. Next time I ll activate my 
                    super powers.

      Will tries to figure out what to say, then... 

                                  WILL

      OFF Will, stuck, we, PRELAP: two voices singing Adele s 
       Someone Like You,  and --


      INT. FIONA S CONDO - ANOTHER NIGHT

      Fiona plays piano. Marcus stands next to her. They sing in 
      two part harmony with complete reverence. They re both really 
      into it, both belting it out. It s super uncool. And super 
      endearing.

                                  FIONA & MARCUS
                    Never mind, I'll find someone like 
                    you/I wish nothing but the best for 
                    you too...

      PAN TO REVEAL: Will watching this remarkably strange sight, a 
      frozen smile glued on. They get to the end of the song. They 
      turn to Will. Will is frozen until he just starts clapping. 

                                  WILL
                    Wow.

                                  FIONA & MARCUS
                    Yeah?

                                  WILL
                    Yeah. Wow. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      DINING ROOM - LATER

      Dinner! Fiona serves Marcus and Will heaping portions.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1324.


                                  FIONA
                    Seitan spare ribs. Delish.

      Marcus and Will exchange a furtive look, they ve had the real 
      thing. Will takes a bite, fights to keep it down. 

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    It was so nice of you to invite 
                    yourself over.

                                  WILL
                    I didn t.

      They both stare at Marcus.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    So, how are you finding San 
                      Francisco?

                                  FIONA
                    Oh, it s wonderful. I mean, the 
                    sights. The Wharf is just 
                      beautiful. And Golden Gate Park. 
                    And the other day I walked all the 
                    way from the Presidio to... the... 
                    the... 

      Fiona just starts to become emotional. Will cannot believe 
      what s happening. Marcus chimes in, tries to lighten the 
      mood.

                                  MARCUS
                    More seitan?

                                  WILL
                    God, no.

                                  FIONA
                          (tearing up)
                    Anyway, as I was saying... I went 
                    to Russian Hill. We never had any 
                    of those shops back home. Where I 
                    was happy. And married....

      And now she is in full blown crying mode. Will wants out. 
      Really bad.

                                  WILL
                    Maybe I should...

                                  MARCUS
                    Don t go. We re having tofu 
                      cheesecake for dessert.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1325.


                                  WILL
                    Well in that case...

                                  FIONA
                          (through tears)
                    I m sorry, I wasn t so sure about 
                    you coming over. I m very sure I 
                    don t want you to see me melting 
                    down.

      She leaves. They hear huge sobs from within. Awkward.

                                  MARCUS
                    I think she just hates that she had 
                    to become a single mom.

      Fiona pops her head in, through her tears--

                                  FIONA
                    Try the quinoa. Really good for you 
                    and really tasty.

                                  WILL
                    You have a snot bubble.

                                  FIONA
                    I know.

      She leaves again. More sobs from within.

                                  MARCUS
                    Wanna see my butterfly collection?

      OFF Will...


      INT. WILL S CONDO - EVENING

      There s a knock on the door. Will opens the door. It s 
      Dakota. She wears a cute dress.

                                  WILL
                    Well, hello.

                    I know we don t have plans, but I 
                    have a crazy idea.

                                  WILL
                    I think I know where this is going.

      Will suddenly grabs her, kisses her, twists her, grinds into 
      her against the door, grabs her ass.   ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1326.


                                  DAKOTA
                    Whoa, that s not what I... Will! 

      Will turns and sees Dakota s daughters MAKALA (10) and EDEN 
      (6) standing in front of the car holding groceries.

                                  EDEN
                    He s touching your butt.

      Will removes his hand.

                                  DAKOTA
                    Makala s going to middle school 
                    next year and my crazy idea is we 
                    all have dinner and maybe Jonah 
                    could tell Makala a little bit 
                    about life at Oakwood.

                                  WILL
                    That is a crazy idea. But Jonah 
                    just has a ton of homework. The 
                    poor kid s under water--

                                  DAKOTA
                    Well, we came all this way, at 
                    least let us say hello...

      Dakota and the girls start to walk in...

                                  WILL
                    Let me see if I can tear Jonah away 
                    from what he s doing.

      EXT. FIONA S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

      Will stands on top of a tool shack and urgently raps on

      INT. WILL S CONDO - LATER

      Marcus and Will look miserable, wearing tiaras and having a 
      tea party with Makala and Eden. Will looks back over to the 
      kitchen, smiles at Dakota. She smiles back. It s all worth 
      it.

                                  MAKALA
                    Okay, time to play dress up!

      Marcus pulls Will aside.

                                  MARCUS
                    No way I m getting into a dress.

                                  WILL
                    I ll get you ribs.

                                  MARCUS
                    Half rack and two sides.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, but not potatoes and rice,

                    Deal.

      Will looks over at the kitchen to get one more look at 
      Dakota. But she isn t there. She s in the backyard, putting 
      steaks on the grill. They sizzle. Noooo! 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Hold on!

      Fiona appears--

                    She may be a crazy vegan but she is 
                    not a bitch. Not always anyway.

      But then Marcus comes out in a tiara, shoving a big piece of 
      salami in his mouth.

                    isn t you. You never wanted to care 
                    about anybody who isn t you.

      Andy walks away to focus on his kids, leaving Will stunned. 
      Will watches his best friend with his children -- it s a 
      sweet moment of Andy just loving his kids. Soaking them in. 

      Will reaches into his jacket pocket, and finds the crumpled 
      up flyer from Marcus s talent show. He looks at it. Alarm 
      building. 

      We see what he s looking at: a flyer for the Oakwood Middle 
      School talent show. And listed as one of the featured 
      performers is: MARCUS BOWA, PERFORMING ADELE S  SOMEONE LIKE 
      YOU.  A CAPELLA. 

                                  WILL
                    Oh no. Oh no. 

      Then he sees the date on the flyer: September 14th, 11:30 AM. 
      He looks at his watch. He looks at his watch: 11:14!

      EXT. OAKWOOD MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

      Will and Andy, kids in tow, sprint through the front 
      entrance. 


      INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

      A middle school JAZZ QUARTET plays. The back door opens and 
      Will and Andy enter along with Andy s three kids.   ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1332.


      Every seat in the house is filled with students and parents. 
      Will takes a look around. Mean girls. Jocks. The BULLIES that 
      Will saw on the corner the first day Marcus came over. This 
      is a disaster waiting to happen. Fiona sees him, strides up.

                                  FIONA
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  WILL
                    You need to stop Marcus from doing 
                    this. It will be humiliating for 
                    him.

                                  FIONA
                    As opposed to putting him in a 
                    tiara? You are the most selfish and 
                      insensitive person I ve ever met 
                    and now you re telling me how to 
                    parent my son? Marcus really looked 
                    up to you and all you did was force 
                    feed him dead animal and break his 
                    heart.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, I m tired of being called 
                      insensitive and selfish. You 
                    dragged your son to a new town and 
                    are too busy crying over your ex-
                    husband to notice that he s being 
                    bullied at school.

                                  FIONA
                    What?

                                  WILL
                    And it will get insanely worse if 
                    you let him do this. It s social 
                    suicide. And for the record, I 
                    didn t force him to eat meat. He 
                    likes meat. He loves it. He s a 
                      carnivore. You don t want to be in 
                    a plane crash in the Andes if 
                    Marcus is on board. And if you re 
                    not going to stop this, I will.

      He starts down the aisle.

                                  ANDY
                          (to Fiona)

      Andy follows Will. But Will stops, seeing Dakota in the 
      audience with her daughters.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Hey. Listen, about the other day...

                                  DAKOTA
                    Do not talk to me. Don t ever talk 
                    to me.

      They continue down the aisle.

                                  ANDY
                    Are there any women here you 
                    haven t pissed off?


      INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

      The rest of the acts are all groups, but Marcus stands alone. 
      Will runs up to him. 

                                  WILL
                    Marcus.

                                  MARCUS
                    What are you doing here?

      On stage the EMCEE announces--

                                  EMCEE
                    And now, performing Adele s 
                     Someone Like You,  Marcus Bowa.

                                  WILL
                    Look, Marcus, I don t think this is 
                    a good idea.

                                  MARCUS
                    You won t be my mom s friend and my 
                    singing makes her happy. 

      The Emcee turns to Marcus...

                                  EMCEE
                    Marcus!

                                  WILL
                    Don t go out there. 

                                  MARCUS
                    So just walk away from it. Figures 
                    that would be your advice.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1334.


                                  WILL
                    Listen, I m sorry if I was harsh 
                    the other day, but I m not nearly 
                    as harsh as middle schoolers. They 
                    suck. They re cruel and mean and 
                    they have long memories. Do not go 
                    out there, Marcus. I m serious.

                                  MARCUS
                    You re talking to me like we re 
                    friends. We re not friends. 
                    Remember?

      Will watches helplessly as Marcus walks out to the stage. 
      There s a single spotlight on him. Even before he opens his 
      mouth there are giggles from the audience. 

      Marcus looks at Will backstage, then turns back to the 
      audience. 

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    This is dedicated to my best 
                    friend. My Mom.

      Will cringes. This couldn t get any worse. Until he starts to 
      sing.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    I heard that you re settled down. 
                    That you found a girl and you re 
                    married now...

      At first, the audience watches with stunned open mouthed 
        expressions. But as Marcus continues, the giggling increases. 

      Hearing the giggles, Marcus realizes he is going down in a 
      blaze of glory. Nothing else to do, he just digs deeper and 
      sings even louder. The laughter grows. The BULLIES throw 
      heckles out from the darkness.

      ON WILL -- he can t let this happen. Looks to Andy, who has 
      just arrived--

                                  WILL
                    We ve got to do something.

      He turns and sees a synthesizer set up for one of the acts. 

      IN THE AUDIENCE

      Fiona watches, pained, as the entire school laughs at her 
      child. Will was right.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1335.


      Dakota watches, feeling for Marcus. As one of her daughters 
      lets out a giggle, she sternly shushes her.

                                  MARCUS
                    I hate to turn up out of the blue 
                      uninvited/But I couldn't stay away, 
                      I couldn't fight it./I had hoped 
                    you'd see my face and that you'd be 
                      reminded/That for me it isn't over.

      Then suddenly, the stage goes black. It s totally dark. 
      Confusion in the audience. 

      Then, a HIP HOP BEAT comes from the darkness. The same beat 
      that Will played earlier. 

      ON MARCUS in the darkness, is that the beat he recognizes?

      AT THE LIGHT BOARD - Andy hands a PIMPLY KID a twenty, and he 
      punches some keys and the stage lights come up with a sexy 
      blue glow.

      ON STAGE

      Marcus, as confused as everyone, turns and sees next to him 
      on stage - WILL! The synthesizer is in front of him.

      Will looks at Marcus, smiles. Marcus looks at him, still 
      completely confused, but moved to see Will come to his aid.

                                  WILL
                    Two, three, four...

      Marcus and Will start singing the chorus together to the 
      syncopated hip hop beat. 

                                  WILL AND MARCUS
                    Never mind, I'll find someone like 
                    you/I wish nothing but the best for 
                    you too...

      The Audience starts to get into it. With the hip hop beat and 
      the lights, Will has turned this into something cool. Well, 
      cooler than it was.

                                  WILL AND MARCUS (CONT D)
                    Don't forget me, I beg/I remember 
                    you said/Sometimes it lasts in love 
                    but sometimes it hurts instead/ 
                    Sometimes it lasts in love but 
                    sometimes it hurts instead.  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1336.


      We watch as the crowd comes around, getting into it. And the 
      more they do, the more Will gets into it. Maybe this isn t 
      just all for Marcus, it seems pretty cathartic for Will too.

      In the audience, Fiona watches, seeing her son embraced by 
      the entire school. 

      Dakota watches -- clearly moved by Will and what he has done.

      Andy dances with his kids and sings along under his breath.

      As they near the final chorus... Fiona wipes a tear from her 
      eye. 

      They finish the song. As they take their bows.

                                  WILL
                    Friends?

                                  MARCUS
                    Double rack of ribs and a 
                      cheeseburger for dessert.

                                  WILL
                    No way. Double cheeseburger.


      On Will and Marcus, arm in arm, taking their bows...

                      END OF ACT THREE  ABOUT A BOY NETWORK DRAFT - 1/9/1337.

      INT. ANDY AND LAURIE S APARTMENT - DAY

      Will holds Baby Jonah in their makeshift godparent ceremony 
      as Andy videotapes. Laurie mouths along, as Will reads a 
      speech that Laurie clearly wrote.

                                  WILL
                    I vow to be there for you. And I

                    more mature person so I can be a 
                    better Godparent to you.

      Will looks at Laurie, gives her the stink eye. Laurie nods, 
      keep reading.
