The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.
The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.
FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.
The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.
The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.
She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;
DEATH LIST FIVE
On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.
The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.
The second name on the list is;
VERNITA GREEN
COBRA
The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

END OF MUSIC MONTAGE
POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.
The Bride STOPS the truck.
Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.
She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.
She
smiles.
If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it
as a sign
that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But
as it is
there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on
The Bride
and her bloody intentions.
She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.
CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.
Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...
She HITS SOMETHING HARD.
She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.
She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.
Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.
We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.
The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A
fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.
1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,
1 SMALL KEY attached to a "DEALY VIPERS" KEY CHAIN.
She rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag, and drives off.
The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...

satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.
The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.
The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

about ready to make a clean getaway...
WHEN...
Yuki yells to the figure across the street.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa!
We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa.
(pause)
Yuki?
YUKI (ENGLISH)
Bingo!
THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.
The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Can I help you?
YUKI (JAPANESE)
You can kill yourself.
Yuki giggles.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
Taking a trip?
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I was.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
You still are. One way.
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I know you feel you must avenge
your sister. But I beg you...walk
away.
Yuki giggles.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
You call that begging? You can beg
better than that.
Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.
YUKI
(JAPANESE)
Can I see your
face? I've heard
your beauty is
exquisite. I would
like to see for
myself.
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Sure.
Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.
THE BRIDE
Domo.
YUKI
(JAPANESE)
Your face is so
pretty, I just want
to put both of
my palms against
your cheeks and
give you little
tiny kisses.
Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
How do I look?
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Very pretty.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
You're just saying that 'cause I
told you how pretty you are.
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yuki, you're gorgeous.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
Really? Is that how you'd describe
me to somebody if I wasn't here?
Yuki's gorgeous?
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
You bet.
Yuki giggles.
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't make me kill you.
YUKI (ENGLISH)
Okay.
Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.
The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.
The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...
Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...
The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.
Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...
The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.
Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.
Yuki yells to her in English;
YUKI (ENGLISH)
You think you're safe! I say; Ha!
She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.
The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...
She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.
She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.
WHEN...
Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.
Both women see the other.
Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.
The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.
When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...
She jerks the wheel...
SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.
SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...
SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...
BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.
In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.
Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.
She gets ready to make a third pass.
Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.
The Bride yells at them;
THE BRIDE
Stay in your house and stay down on
the floor!
Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.
The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.
She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.
Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;
YUKI (JAPANESE)
Time for the rabbit to come out of
her hole!
She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.
The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.
Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.
Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.
Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...
The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...
WHEN...
Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.
The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.
Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.
The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.
Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.
The Bride fires...
The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.
THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Gotcha!
Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;
YUKI (JAPANESE)
You fucking bitch! You shot me in
my breast! They're not fully
developed yet, you fucking asshole!
Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!
The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
Piss me off!
She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.
When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;
THE BRIDE
(JAPANESE)
Yuki, in about two
minutes there's
going to be an army
of police here.
So if you're gonna
kill me, now's
the time.
From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.
THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
So what's it gonna be bitch?
Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.
YUKI (JAPANESE)
That fucking does it!
Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the
Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.
The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.
The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.
Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.
Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.
The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.
Yuki's face, dead,
eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's
not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform
is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the
direction of the Bride...
The Bride sees this and can't believe it...
They lock eyes...
...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...
She charges up the steps at the Bride.
The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...
Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...
The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.
Yuki chargin...
The Bride cocks back the hammer...
...Yuki charging, getting closer...
The Bride FIRES
Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...
The Bride fires again...
Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...
They struggle for a moment...
...TILL...
...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.
THE BRIDE
Goddamn, what a wildcat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;
BUDD
Great day in the morning. Brother
Bill livin up to his familia
obligation.
BILL
How ya doin' Budd?
BUDD
Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
mad rush of wild parties and
wealthy women.
Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.
BUDD
Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
Viking bitch in the passenger seat?
BILL
It's Elle. Want to say hello?
BUDD
Never said "bye," can't seem to
think of a reason to say, "hi."
The
My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.
His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,
out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when
they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the
front, and he climbs out of the automobile.
A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.
The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.
As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.
He passes by The Bride's
new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After
he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn
the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the
dark.
Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.
Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.
The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...
Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.
The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai
sword.
She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.
She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...
THEN...
...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...
THEN...
Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.
THEN...
On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.
THEN...
Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.
The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.
From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.
From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.
The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.
The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.
The curtain closes again.
The needle is placed back on the phonograph.
CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.
...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.
She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on
a table.
Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.
Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.
She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...
QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --
EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.
She flings the front door open...
The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.
SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.
Both barrels BLAST in our face.
The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.
Landing hard on her back in the dirt.
Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.
Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.
BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.
Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.
BUDD
Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
like a bitch.
More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.
BUDD
You done got a double dose of rock
salt, right in the ole tit.
Now not havin tits as fine or as
big as yours, I can't even imagine
how bad that shit stings...
He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.
BUDD
...But I don't wont to neather.
The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.
Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.
BUDD
Now I know when it
comes to a rock
salt burn, you're
feelin pretty
much like a expert
bout now. But
truth be told, you
ain't felt all
rock salt's got to
offer till you
took a double dose
in your
backside.
With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.
SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.
The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!
BUDD
That gentled ya down, didn't it?
Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
two barrels of rock salt dug deep
in their backyard.
THEN...
Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.
THEN...
Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.
We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed
of Budd's pickup.
The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.
A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.
She has no idea where she is.
She turns her head to the left and sees,
Back window and Cab of truck.
She turns her head to the right and sees,
Hatch Gate to flatbed.
She listens...she hears,
Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...
THEN...
She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...
The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...
THEN...
We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.
BOOM...They set it down.
She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...
TILL...
With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.
BUDD
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.
The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.
She FALLS to the dirt HARD.
Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of
"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."
Budd and Ernie stand over her.
The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.
Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;
BUDD (SPANISH)
Look at those eyes. This bitch is
furious. You grab her feet, I'll
get her head.
(ENGLISH)
Got anything to say?
The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.
BUDD (SPANISH)
In America white women call this
the silent treatment.
(laughing)
And we let 'em think, we don't like
it.
The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.
BUDD
Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
this.
He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.
BUDD
Looky here bitch, this is a can of
mace. Now you're goin underground
tonight, and that's all there is to
it. But, when I bury ya, I was
gonna bury you with this.
He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.
BUDD
But if
you're gonna act like
a
horse's
ass, I'll spray this
whole
Goddamn
can in your eyeballs.
Then
you'll
be blind, burnin, and
buried
alive.
So what's it gonna be
sister?
Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.
BUDD
You may be stupid, but at least you
ain't bloody stupid.
The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.
Budd puts the flashlight inside.
He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...
WHEN...
...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...
...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,
THEN...
...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.
THEN...
...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.
The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.
Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...
Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.
We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:
"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"
A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;
BILL (V.O.)
Once upon a time in China, some
believe around the year, one-double
knot-three.
As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."
BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
...head priest of The White Lotus
Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
road, contemplating whatever a man
with Pai Mei's infinite power would
contemplate -- Which is another way
of saying, who knows. When, a
Shaolin monk appeared on the road
traveling in the opposite
direction. As the monk and the
priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity, gave the
monk the slightest of nods. The
nod, was not returned. Was it the
intention of the Shaolin monk to
insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
fail to see the generous social
gesture?
The motives of the monk, remain,
unknown. What is known, were the
consequences. The next morning Pai
Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
and demanded that the temple's head
Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
repay the insult. The Abbot, at
first, tried to console Pai Mei,
only to find, Pai Mei was
inconsolable. So began, the
massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
all sixty of the monks inside, at
the fists of the White Lotus. And
so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
Technique.
THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
exploding heart technique?
BILL (V.O.)
Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
all of the martial arts. He hits
you with his fingertips, at ten
different pressure points on your
body. And then, he lets you walk
away. But once you've taken five
steps, your heart explodes inside
your body, and you fall to the
floor dead.
We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then
fall to the floor dead.
Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.
THE BRIDE
Did he teach you that?
BILL
No. He teaches no one the ten-point
palm - exploding heart technique.
But he is Nietzsche's psalm
personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
kill you, he will make you
stronger. Now one of the things I
always liked about you, Kiddo, is
you appear wise beyond your years.
Then allow me to impart, a word to
the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
him - even for an instant - a
defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
And if you throw any American sass
his way, he will snap your back and
your neck like they were twigs, and
that will be the story of you.
The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.
For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.
A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.
BILL
He'll accept you as his student.
THE BRIDE
Caught him in a good mood, aye?
BILL
More like a sadistic one.
She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.
Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.
BILL
Just seeing those steps again makes
me ache. You're gonna have plenty
of fun carrying buckets of water up
and down that fucker.
THE BRIDE
Why did he accept me?
BILL
Because he's a very very very old
man. And like all rotten bastards,
when they get old, they become
lonely. Not that that has any
effect on their disposition. But
they do learn the value of company.
THE BRIDE
When will I see you again?
BILL
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the Seventies.
THE BRIDE
What?
BILL
Nothing. When he tells me you're
done.
THE BRIDE
When do you think that might be?
BILL
That my dearest, all depends on
you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
sarcasm.
Least not for the first year.
You're going to have to let him
warm up for you. He hates
Caucasians, despises Americans, and
has nothing but contempt for women,
so in your case, that may take a
little while. Adios.
ZOOM...
The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.
She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.
Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.
The Bride stands behind him, watching.
He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.
He turns to the new student;
PAI MEI *
Since your arm now belongs to me, I
want it strong. Can you do that?
THE BRIDE *
I can, but not that close.
PAI MEI *
Then you can't do it.
THE BRIDE *
I can put my hand through that at
six inches.
PAI MEI *
And you could shoot a man from a
rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
if you so desired, but this is not
what I asked. What if your enemy is
three inches in front of you, what
do you do then? Curl into a ball?
Or do you put your fist through
him.
He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.
PAI MEI *
Now begin.
The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....
Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).
PAI MEI *
In that pit, is a rat.
We see one lone rat in the huge pit.
PAI MEI *
In the sky, is a bird.
Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.
A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.
PAI MEI *
You are to go into that pit, and
catch that rat, with your bare
hands. If you catch the rat, I will
deem you the victor, and tonight
you will dine on bird. But, if you
can't catch the rat by sundown,
I'll deem the victor the rat. And
because of the disgrace to my
student, I will be forced to kill
it. And then I will force you, to
consume his body. Because to be my
student, you must develop a taste
for victory.
She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.
The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.
MORE wall....
At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.
Trying to catch the rat to no avail.
WHEN...
A golden arrow kills the rat.
She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.
She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.
She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.
THE BRIDE *
I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
this rat. However, I will not eat
this filthy vermin. What I will
do...
(she RIPS the rat open
like a pomegranate)
...is consume his victorious heart.
(she snatches the tiny
heart from the rodent's
carcass. Holding it
between her fingers.)
But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.
She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.
Pai Mei looking down on her, says;
PAI MEI *
How does victory taste?
THE BRIDE *
Bitter.
We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.
The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.
THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Wow!
A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the
tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.
WHEN...
The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.
Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.
DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.
SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.
The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.
The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.
BUDD
Want some breakfast?
Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.
She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....
WHEN...
...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...
ELLE'S POV:

red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

PLAYS ON SOUNDTRACK.
CU ELLE
her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see
the dead walk, she sees the dead behind two tons of metal
coming at her at 100 MPH...
CRASH
The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.
The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.
She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.
Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.
A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.
The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.
The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.
A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.
ELLE
Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
alacky had got the best of you.
THE BRIDE
You thought wrong.
The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.
Elle does the same.
ELLE
(referring to the sword)
What's that?
THE BRIDE
Budd's Hanzo sword.
ELLE
He said he pawned it.
THE BRIDE
Guess that makes him a liar, don't
it?
Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.
THE BRIDE
(question)
Elle?
ELLE
(answer)
Bea.
THE BRIDE
I was wondering, just 'tween us
girls, what did you say to Pai Mei
for him to snatch out your eye?
FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
of Pai Mei SNATCHING out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw.
ELLE
I called him a bastard.
THE BRIDE
Oooh, not so good.
ELLE
Were I to do it over again, I'd
bite my tongue.
THE BRIDE

ELLE
Shoot.
THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?
ELLE

Elle nods her head 'yes.'
THE BRIDE
You wouldn't lie to me now?
ELLE
Why lie?
Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.
The Bride raises up her sword.
THE BRIDE
I saw what you did to that little
Mamba in there. Want to try that on
somebody your own size?
ELLE
I intend to.
The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.
THE BRIDE
Oh
Elle,
I
should warn
you
before
we get started. Hattori Hanzo
swords are extremely sharp. They
can
take
a
little
getting
used
to.
Careful not to cut your own arm
off.
ELLE
I don't rattle, bitch!
The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.
THE BRIDE
You're gonna bleed though, you're
gonna bleed a lot.
THEN...
SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...
ELLE,
BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.
Elle drops the Bride's sword.
As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.
The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.
Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....
...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.
The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.
Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.
Between them the dawn sky breaks.

Did she go to sleep easy?
THE BRIDE
It took her a little bit. She was
excited. She's quite the little
chatterbox.
BILL
Well, if she doesn't like you, you
got to kill her to say hello. But
if she likes you, you can't shut
her up. She's a chip off the ole
blonde in that regards.
He holds up the bottle of vino.
BILL
Red wine?
She shakes her blonde head, no.
BILL
C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
fun with a couple glasses of wine
in ya.
She gives him a look.
BILL
(pointing towards the
beach)
We're going to go out there and
have at it, aren't we?
She shakes her blonde head, yes.
BILL
Well, I've already had
a glass. So
unless you want to win
by an unfair
advantage, you should
have a glass
of wine. So we're both
on the same
footing wine wise.
She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.
BILL
You know, there's an old man down
here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
He was a pimp. I knew him when I
was a child. He was a friend of my
mother's. I told him about you.
When I showed him your picture he
smiles and said;
(imitating his accent)
"Yesss, I see the attraction." He
told me a story about taking me to
the movies when I was five. It was
a movie which had Lana Turner in
it. And whenever she would appear
on screen, he said I would stick my
thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
an obscure amount. And he knew
right then, this boy will be a fool
for blondes.
THE BRIDE
Who would of ever thought you'd be
such a good father?
BILL
Well not you, that's for damn sure.
She gives him another look.
THE BRIDE
Must we have to endure your little
zingers?
BILL
No we mustn't. But if you're going
to say sentences like that, in the
future, I will resist the
temptation.
THE BRIDE
Baby, you don't have a future.
Bill drinks some wine.
BILL
I sent you to L.A. and you never
came back. I thought you'd been
killed. Do you know how cruel it is
to make someone think someone they
love is dead? I mourned you. Then
in the third month of my mourning,
I track you down. I wasn't trying
to track you down, I was trying to
track down - the fucking assholes -
who I thought killed you. And when
I find you, what to I find? Not
only are you not dead, you're
getting married - to some fuckin
jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
you expect me to react?
THE BRIDE
Why do you think I hid?
BILL
Why did you leave in the first
place? You have cold eyes towards
me now. I understand their
temperature, but they were warm the
second to the last time I saw them,
or was that just my imagination?
THE BRIDE
No.
The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.
To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
You sent me to L.A. to kill that
lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.
Bill interrupts her.
BILL (ENGLISH)
You are you talking in Japanese?
The Bride explodes;
THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?
BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.
THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.
BILL
But you never did.
THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.
BILL
My apologies, please continue.
THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to
kill me in my hotel room. As I was
dancing in euphoria, the killer
came down the hall.
There's a knock on the hotel room door.
The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.
PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.
The Bride says through the door;
THE BRIDE
Hello, can I help you?
HOTEL WOMAN
Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
hospitality manager of the hotel. I
have a welcome gift from the
management.
Seeing it through the peephole.
THE BRIDE
Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
busy at this second, could you
possibly come back later?
As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...
WHEN...
A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.
Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.
The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.
Karen aims the shotgun down at her.
With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.
It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.
The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.
Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.
The Bride DIVES out of the way.
The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.
The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...
Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.
The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.
KAREN
So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
to kill you.
She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...
THE BRIDE
Wait a second!
Karen stops.
THE BRIDE
Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
come here to kill your sister. But
I'm not gonna do that now.
KAREN
Oh, I know you're not --
THE BRIDE
- listen to me! I just found out,
right now - not two minutes before
you blew a hole in the door, I'm
pregnant.
Karen looks at her, "what?".
THE BRIDE
On that table is the
home pregnancy
kit. On the floor by
the door is
the strip that says
I'm pregnant.
I'm telling you the
truth, I don't
want to and I won't
kill your
sister. I just want
to go home.
KAREN
What is this, bullshit story number
twelve in the female assassin's
handbook?
THE BRIDE
Any other time you'd be a hundred
percent right. But this time you're
a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
deadliest woman in the world, but
right now I'm scared shitless for
my baby. Please, you hafta believe
me. Look at the strip, it's on the
floor.
Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.
KAREN
Sit down on that bed and put your
hands behind your head.
The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.
THE BRIDE
Blue means pregnant.
KAREN
I'll read it myself, thank you.
It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.
KAREN
Okay, say I were to believe you,
what then?
THE BRIDE
Just go home. I'll do the same.
Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;
KAREN
You fucked with the Wong sisters.
BACK ON THE PORCH
THE BRIDE
Facing Karen Wong, was the most
frightening moment I have ever
experienced. And that includes
three years with that evil bastard
Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
blue, I was a woman, I was your
woman. I was a killer, who killed
for you. Before that strip turned
blue, I would have jumped a
motorcycle on to a speeding train
...for you. But once that strip
turned blue, I could no longer do
any of those things. Not anymore.
Because now I was a mother. A
mother who only had one thought on
her mind. Please don't harm my
baby. Can you understand that?
BILL
Yes. But why tell me now, and not
then?
THE BRIDE
You wouldn't have let me go.
Specially once you found out I was
pregnant. You would've tried to
talk me out of it. It would have
been a big scene. I just said fuck
it.
Starting to get mad.
BILL
Fuck who?
THE BRIDE
Bill, you couldn't know I was
pregnant, once you knew, you'd
claim it, and I didn't want that.
BILL
That's not your decision to make.
THE BRIDE
Yes, but it's the right decision.
And I made it for my daughter.
Everybody on this earth deserves to
start with a clean slate. But with
us - my daughter would be born into
a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
her of the one thing everybody
deserves. She would be born with
blood stains. I had to choose. I
chose her.
She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.
THE BRIDE
You know five years ago, if I had
to make a list of impossible things
that could never happen.
You performing a coup de grace on
me by bustin a cap in my crown,
would be right at the top of the
list.
(beat)
I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?
Bill listens stoney, then;
BILL
I'm sorry was that a question? Of
impossible things that could never
happen - yes in this instance you
would have been wrong.
The Bride listens stoney, then;
THE BRIDE
Well?
BILL
Well what?
THE BRIDE
Explain yourself.
BILL
I already have. When I told you the
story of when I thought you were
dead. Didn't you get how badly I
felt?
THE BRIDE
You call that an explanation?
BILL
Well if that's too cryptic let's
get literal.
(beat)
There are consequences to breaking
the heart of a murdering bastard.
You experienced some of them.
That's his explanation.
She hears it.
They both understand one another.
THE BRIDE
You and I have unfinished business.
BILL
Baby, you ain't kidding.
They both laugh.
BILL
You know how proud I am of you,
don't you?
THE BRIDE
Yes.
BILL
You know I was rooting for you,
don't you?
THE BRIDE
I figured.
BILL
You know on that beach out there I
want you to be the victor?
She nods her head, yes.
BILL
You also know you're going to have
to defeat me. I can't just give it
to you, even though I want to.
THE BRIDE
It won't be necessary for you to
give me anything. I've surpassed
you. I'll take it.
BILL
Well, as they say in Missouri, show
me.
As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.
The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.
BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.
WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.
The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right
empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me.
She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.
He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.
BILL
(to himself)
That's my girl.
He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...
She stands motionless...
Unblinking...
Watching him coming...
No fear....
No expression...
We go back and forth, close, wide, low.
TILL...
They meet...
Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.
Their faces are very close...
The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.
BILL
He taught you the ten point palm
exploding heart technique?
THE BRIDE
Of course he did.
BILL
Why didn't you tell me?
She doesn't have an answer.
She looks at him apologetically;
THE BRIDE
I don't know...Because...I'm
a...bad person.
He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;
BILL
No. You're not a bad person. You're
a terrific person. You're my
favorite person. But every once in
awhile...you can be a real cunt.
They smile at each other.
Then...
Bill turns his back to her...
And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...
It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...
He falls to the beach...dead.
The Bride walks over to his body.
She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.
Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.
She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.
She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.
She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.
The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.
Beatrix, in a moment
of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed
for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her
MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she
will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.
EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.
EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.
The blade disappears inside the sheath.
The teardrop falls of her chin.
Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.
The Bride exits the beach.
Bill doesn't.
