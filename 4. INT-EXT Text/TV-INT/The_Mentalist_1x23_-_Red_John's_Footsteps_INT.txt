      Jane, Lisbon and Hardy meet Arden and NOAH, (both 50's). 

      Arden's a Diane Lane type with a drinking problem.  Noah is a 
      Bill Hurt type with a beard, pious spectacles, and a songlike 
      calm that hovers on the edge of irritating. 

                                  ARDEN
                    Maya, where's Maya?  Is Maya 
                    alright?  Where is she?

                                  LISBON
                    We don't know as yet, ma'am.  
                    But every effort is --

                                  ARDEN
                    -- Where is she?  Where is she?!

      Noah takes Arden's hand, tries to calm her.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    6.

                                  NOAH
                    Arden, they don't know where she 
                    is.  We must let them do their 
                    jobs.

      He helps her sit down, where she subsides into quiet sobbing.

                                  JANE
                    There's a brother, isn't there?  
                    Where's he?

                                  NOAH
                    On his way here.  He lives up in 
                      Parkersville.

                                  JANE 
                    Can we see the girls' bedroom?

                                  NOAH
                    Uh, sure.  Of course.


      Noah leads Jane and Lisbon into a large room with two beds 
      one at either end.

                                  NOAH
                    ...We tried having them sleep in 
                    separate bedrooms, but it never 
                    took.  They prefer to be together.

      From the doorway, Jane and Lisbon look around the room.  A 
      typical teenage girl's room, doubled.

                                  NOAH (CONT'D)
                    In your professional judgment, do 
                    you think that Maya is dead also?

                                  JANE
                    Yes. 

      Lisbon shoots him an admonishing glance.

                                  LISBON
                    We keep an open mind and assume 
                    she s alive.  There's always hope.

                                  JANE
                    Not much.

                                  NOAH
                    I see.  Thank you for your candor.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Footsteps"    GREEN 4/03/09    7.

      Beat.

                                  LISBON
                    Perhaps your wife needs you with 
                    her, Mr. Plaskett.

      Noah perceives Lisbon's meaning -- she'd rather they look 
      around the room without his presence.

                                  NOAH
                    Yes of course.

      Noah exits.  Jane and Lisbon move around the room, gently 
      scanning the contents by touch and sight.  The following 
      dialogue covers that scanning -- PHOTOS, sports trophies, pop 
      stars, cuddly toys.  (The distinctions are very subtle, but 
      Emma is the darker, risk-taking twin.  Maya more sunny and 
        conventional...)    

                                  LISBON
                    Why so cruel?  And since when do 
                    you care about statistics?

                                  JANE
                      Statistically, it's Dad that did 
                    it.  I wanted to raise his pulse a 
                    little.  

                                  LISBON
                    Hold on.  This is a Red John case 
                    now.  The cutting style, the 
                    painted toenails, the skywriting, 
                    put them together, it s hard to 
                    dismiss.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, it s Red John alright.  But   
                    someone else is involved.  Else why 
                    has he changed his MO so radically?  
                      Skywriting? 

                                  LISBON
                    He wanted to be sure that the CBI, 
                    that you would be on the case.  
                    He's luring you into some kind of 
                    trap, obviously. 

      Jane seems to think that's a good thing.

                                  JANE 
                    Yes, that's part of it.  But why 
                    take them from a car, instead of 
                    catching them home alone like he s 
                    always done before?  And why two 
                    victims at once?  Why twins?  Why 
                    break pattern?

                                  LISBON
                    He broke pattern once before.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  He broke pattern because it 
                    was personal.  He wanted to punish 
                    me.  
                          (beat)
                    I don't think these girls are 
                    random targets.  I think there's 
                    something personal behind this.

                    Red John knows them or someone

      Jane and Lisbon with Hardy and the Plasketts.  All seated 
      except Jane.  Arden's calmer now, but holds Noah's hand tight 
      for support.

                    You last saw them when?

                                  NOAH
                    Just after dark last night.  They 
                    went to see a movie.  They were due 
                    home by eleven.  But they never 
                    came home.

                          (apropos her own thoughts)
                    They were going East to college in 
                    the fall.  They took a year off to 
                    chill, they called it.  We must

                      office...?

                                  NOAH
                    Yes dear.

                                  LISBON
                    Have they ever been out all night 
                    before?  

                                  NOAH
                    Oh sure.  Sleep-overs.  School

      The tiniest hesitation.  Both Jane and Lisbon pick it up.

                    No.  Nobody right now.  It can be 
                    hard for boys to stand a chance.

                    A suite is a box.  You have a small

                    we need all the information you

                    We can get a warrant, but it takes 
                    time and time is of the essence.

      Guthrie seated, cuffed, restless.  Jane enters, pulls up a 
      chair, sits down.  Jane studies Guthrie for a moment.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    What?

                                  JANE
                    Emma and Maya Plaskett.

      Guthrie looks wary all of a sudden.  

                                    GUTHRIE
                    What about them?

                                  JANE
                    You didn't hear?  It's all over the 
                    TV news.  

                                    GUTHRIE

                                  JANE
                    Emma was found horribly murdered 
                    this morning.  Maya's missing. 

      Guthrie reacts with horrified surprise.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    Oh no.  Oh God.

                                  JANE
                    Were you in a sexual relationship 
                    with either of them?

                                    GUTHRIE
                    No.  No.

                    Really.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    No.  Never.  Maybe hung with them a 
                    couple or so times.  That's it. 

      Jane studies him.

                    Mace, I see that you cared for Emma 
                    and Maya, and I see that you're 
                    lying to me.  That's a bad idea.  

                                    GUTHRIE
                    I got nothing to do with this.

                                  JANE
                    Please understand something.        
                    I have a deeply personal interest 
                    in this case.  I will do whatever 
                    it takes.  I will have you framed 
                    for murder, I will torture you,    
                    I will kill you myself.  Whatever 
                    it takes.   

      Guthrie's taken aback.  Unseen by Guthrie, Jane wags a finger 
      for the benefit of those in the observation room.  "I'm just 
      kidding."


      Lisbon and MINELLI watching Jane and Guthrie.

                                    MINELLI
                    Ah geez, Lisbon.  Come on.  This is 
                    on tape.  Control your man there. 

                                  LISBON
                    Give him some slack.  He's playing 
                    the guy.  Doesn't mean it.

                                    MINELLI
                    Doesn t he?  You know what Red John 
                    does to him.  He can't think 
                    straight.  He would do all that he 
                    said, and more, if you let him.  

                                  LISBON
                    I won't let him.


      Guthrie decides to tell the truth.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    Emma and me had a thing.  She ah, I 
                    don't know what she saw in me, but 
                    she liked me, you know?  Both those 
                    girls have a way about 'em.  They

                                    GUTHRIE
                    So me and Emma had been hooking up 
                    for a month or so, and I get a 
                    phone call.  Some guy I don't know 
                    says stay away from her or else, 
                    and hangs up before I can tell him 
                    to eat it. 

                                  JANE
                    Describe his voice.

                                    GUTHRIE
                    Soft.  Quiet.  

                                  JANE
                    Did you do what he said?

                                    GUTHRIE
                    No.  Course not.  I kept on seeing 
                    her.  
                          (beat)
                    But then one morning couple weeks 
                    ago, I wake up, there's a freakin' 
                    pig's head on the pillow next to 
                    me.  I lock and bolt the doors at 
                    night.  There s no way someone gets 
                    in.  But they did.  Mental, yeah?  
                    Spooked the hell out of me.  I'm 
                    into Emma and all, but I've been 
                    staying away from her since then.       

                                  JANE
                    Any theories as to who it was?

                                    GUTHRIE
                    No.  Thing is, me and Emma were on 
                    the down low.  Nobody knew.  She 
                    insisted on that.  So how did he 
                    know?  He must have been spying on 
                    her real close. 
                          (beat, thinks)
                    How did you people know?

      Lisbon, Jane with Noah, Arden, and Drake...

                    Around a month ago, I'd say, I was 
                    staying the weekend, and I 
                    overheard the girls talking, Maya 
                    telling Emma that this Guthrie 
                    character was dangerous and she 
                    should be careful.  Naturally, I 
                    was very concerned.  I told my 
                    parents. 

                                  NOAH
                    And we decided to confront Emma 
                    about it.

                                  LISBON
                    I see.  If we can sit down and take 
                      a statement from you, Drake, that 
                    would be helpful.

                                  DRAKE

      Jane enters.  Jane stands still and gazes about for a long

      starts roaming the room, humming gently as searches.

                                  DRAKE
                    Single.  Mother says I'm too picky.   

      He glances upstairs off footsteps.  Is he nervous?


      Jane sits down at a large and cluttered vanity table, that 
      serves as a kind of general work station for the girls.  Jane 
      looks at himself in the mirror, looks up.  Sees something.  

      POV -- On top of the wall moulding, something that glints.   

      He uses the chair to climb up onto the table, and looks 
      closer.  He reaches up and feels around and pulls a tiny 
      CAMERA and MICROPHONE UNIT from concealment.   

                                  JANE
                    Lisbon!

      There's a very thin wire attached.  Jane pulls on the wire 
      and follows it around the room, peeling it away off the top 
      of the wall moulding until it disappears behind a heavy 
      wardrobe. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Lisbon!

      Jane pushes the wardrobe away from the wall.  The camera wire 
      goes into a hole in the skirting board, a section of which 
      seems loose.  He levers the skirting board away from the 
      wall, and using the wire, lifts out a very small TRANSMITTER. 
      Lisbon and the Plaskett family enter.  Jane holds up what 
      he s found.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Camera, microphone, and 
                      transmitter. 

      Jane pokes out his tongue at the little camera and pulls the 
      wire out of the transmitter.

      Arden groans with disgust and horror.

                                  NOAH
                    Someone was spying on our 
                      daughters?  

                                  LISBON
                    Who had access to the room?  

                                  ARDEN
                    Nobody.  Just us.  And Janine, the 
                      housekeeper.

                                  NOAH
                    No.  Nobody.

      Beat.  Jane and Lisbon settle their gaze on Drake.

                                  JANE
                    Drake, how are your electronics 
                    skills?

                                  DRAKE
                    You're accusing me of this?  

                                  JANE
                    No need to sound so outraged. 
                    Let's be fair, you are the 
                    likeliest suspect.  You can see 
                    that.

                    doesn't make you clean.

      Lisbon's PHONE RINGS.

      Rigsby on the phone.  Cho in BG.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We got the warrant and we're about 
                    to open the mail box.  Jane said he 
                    wanted to be on the line when we 
                    opened it.
                          (listens)
                    Okay.
                          (to Cho)
                    One minute.

      Cho nods.  They wait.  The Store Owner enters from back of 
      store, gives Cho a PHOTO.  Cho takes it very reluctantly.

                                  STORE OWNER
                    My niece.  Beautiful like a movie 
                    star.  Only well behaved.

      Cho's actually kind of struck by the photo.  Rigsby has a 
      look at her too, and is impressed.

                                  CHO
                    Yes.  She's attractive.   

                                  RIGSBY
                    Go for it, man.  

      Cho hands back the photo.

                                  CHO
                    I'm not looking to get married at 
                    this time, ma'am.  Thank you 
                    though. 

      Behind Cho's back, still with phone to ear, Rigsby pantomimes 
      his intention to give the Store Owner Cho's name and number, 
      then speaks into phone...

                          (to the Store Owner)
                    Open up.

      The Store Owner selects a master key from the dozen or so 
      around her neck.  Opens the box.  Rigsby peers inside.

                          (to phone)
                    There's an envelope.

      Rigsby takes the letter out (using gloves etc.) and we look 
      at it.  A white envelope, typewritten.  Christmas stamps.  

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                          (to phone)

                    Christmas stamps.  Addressed to 
                    Roy Tagliaferro.  

      Rigsby carefully opens the envelope, unfolds a letter, also 
        typewritten.  


      CBI car moving through idyllic countryside toward the 
      mountains.  Lisbon driving, Jane alongside, looking at a 
      transcript of the letter...

                                  ROSALIND (V.O.)
                    Dear Roy, I found this address on a 
                    business card of yours that I 
                      discovered down the back of the 
                    sofa.  And so I write to you today 
                    in the faint hope that this letter 
                    may find you.  If it does, and you 
                    are reading this, I just want to 
                    say that I still love you very much 
                    despite the very cruel way you 
                    treated me, and I hope you will 
                    come back to me one day.  With all 
                    my heart, Rosalind. 

      Jane folds the letter transcript up.

                    It's him.  I know it.  This Roy 
                      Tagliaferro is Red John. 

                                  LISBON
                    We don't know that.

                    The skywriter got the order from

                    that we'd find the letter.  It's

                    I'm a good judge of human nature.  
                    I need to be.  I know Roy very 
                    well, I know him intimately. 
                    And I'm sure, as sure as this floor 
                    is underneath me -- 
                          (stamps her foot)
                    -- I know that Roy Tagliaferro is a 
                    good man.  

      Beat.

                    I believe you.  We must have made a 
                    mistake.  I'm sorry. 

                                  ROSALIND
                    That's okay.  Everybody makes 
                    mistakes.  God knows.  

                                  JANE
                    Maybe what it is, Red John is using 
                    Roy's identity somehow, as a cover.  
                    If we could find Roy, he might help 
                    us find Red John. 

      Rosalind thinks about that.


      Refusing help, Rosalind brings tea and cookies out for Jane 
      and Lisbon.  Jane examines the actual BUSINESS CARD that 
      Rosalind found.  INSERT - ON The card -- Roy Tagliaferro,

                    Roy came to the door one day when 
                    his car broke down up the road, and 
                    he needed to use the telephone.

                    He was in my life for five months.  
                    He would come and go as he pleased. 
                    He said he was doing business in

                                  ROSALIND
                    He didn't say.

                    And you didn't ask?  You weren't

                                  ROSALIND
                    No.  I didn't care.  I don't live 
                    in your world.  I live here.  I was

                    Very cruel.  He left one day and he 
                    just never came back.  Never told

                    Just vanished.  It's been nearly

                                  JANE
                    Describe him. 

                                  ROSALIND
                    Just under six feet tall.  Not 
                    muscular, but not soft either. 
                    Short straight hair.  A gentle 
                    voice.  Rough strong hands.  He 
                    smelt of pine and nails and earth.  
                    He liked to listen to me play the 
                    piano.  

                                  JANE
                    What was his favorite music?

                                  ROSALIND
                    Bach.  He admired his rigor.

                                  LISBON
                    Did anyone else ever see him?  The 
                    mailman, a cleaning lady?

                                  ROSALIND
                    No.  I lead a fairly solitary life. 

                                  LISBON
                    Did he mention any of his friends?  
                    People he worked with?  

                                  ROSALIND
                    No.  But he did bring a friend of 
                    his over once.  For Thanksgiving. 
                    Dumar.

                    Just Dumar.  Somewhat of a rube, 
                    but amiable.  Couldn't believe a

                    He smoked a lot.  Said he was 
                    trying to quit, but he smoked so 
                    much he had to run out to the store

                          (smiles)
                    When he came back, he'd bought a 
                    stuffed toy elephant as a gift for me.  
                          (beat, recalling)
                    That was a good day.  Roy came a

                    was a break-in at the Plaskett 
                    House.  The camera probably went in 
                    then.  But they got no prints, no

      Jane and Hardy move through the empty and derelict house.  
      Jane finds a LOCKED DOOR.  Tries to open it.  He's pushing 
      and shoving and kicking at the door when...

                                    SHERIFF HARDY
                    Hey, Jane, look...

      Hardy points to a ROUGHLY CONCEALED HATCH cut into the floor.  
      Hardy and Jane pry the hatch open.  A roughly made set of 
      stairs descend to a dark room.  Jane goes first.


      Van Pelt on the phone...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Following up a lead I gave them.  
                    Why?  What's wrong?


      Jane and Hardy climb through the hatch, down rough wooden 
      stairs into the sparsely furnished room.  Jane finds a LIGHT 
      SWITCH.

      A chair and a table, a sofa, a fridge.  A basin and faucet in 
      one corner.  A couple of shelves with power tools, knives, 
      rope, folded plastic sheets, cleaning materials.

      On the far wall, a heavy door with a padlock on it, and a 
      little viewing hole with a screen, like a prison cell.  
      There's a key hanging on a nail in the wall next to the door.  

      Jane peers into the viewing hole...


      JANE'S POV -- A bare room.  Nothing in it, but a bed, and a 
      toilet.  MAYA PLASKETT sits on the bed, terrified, staring at 
      the door.  She must have heard them enter...


      Jane turns around...

                                  JANE
                    Maya Plaskett's alive!  She...

      Hardy points the shotgun at Jane.

                    What are you doing?

                    No.  You never have really.  Do you 
                    recall a man named Orval Tanner?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  He was Red John's accomplice 
                    on his first killing.  Got caught.  
                    Died in jail ten years ago.

                    Red John's not using me.  He gave

                    Love is cruel.  She's safe at 
                    least.  Not like out there with all 
                    the degenerates.  She'll grow to 
                      appreciate that security I'm giving 
                    her.  And she'll come to love me 
                    like I love her.

                                  JANE
                      I wouldn't bet on that.

                    whole.  I'm happy for the first

                    happen.  So don't go telling me 
                    he's no friend of mine.

      flashlights up.

      The once locked room is open, the door wide.  Inside we can 
      see that the TV is off.

      Hardy lies unconscious and cuffed on the floor, bleeding from 
      a head wound.

      Maya's staring at the door eyes wide, but her eyes go wider

      Maya stares at them.  She stands up slowly and moves toward 
      them and Lisbon goes to her -- they come together in an 
      awkward, but heartfelt embrace.  


      Jane and Lisbon alone for a moment.  Outside, the noise and 
      bustle of Cops and Forensics arriving.

                    want you to stop it!

                                  JANE
                    I wish I could.  Some things can't 
                    be fixed, you know?  Some things 
                    are broken for good.  You can't be 
                    angry.  It's just the way of the 
                    world.

      Beat.

                                  LISBON
                          (backing off the anger)
                    We still have Hardy.  He'll talk.  
                    He'll give us Red John.  

      Jane feels bad for criticizing Lisbon so fiercely, and backs 
      off a little.   

                                  JANE
                    You're right.  We have Hardy.  Yes. 

                                  LISBON
                    And we saved a life.

                                  JANE
                    Yes we did.  Hooray for us.

      Lisbon wants to say more, but Two Forensics Techs in WHITE 
      JUMPSUITS and masks go up through the hatch, carrying amongst 
      other evidence, Hardy's SHOTGUN.  Lisbon follows them out 
      to...


      MOS -- Lisbon and Maya sit in the backseat.  Jane sits in the 
      front passenger seat.  All lost in their own thoughts.

      A CHP OFFICER gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.
