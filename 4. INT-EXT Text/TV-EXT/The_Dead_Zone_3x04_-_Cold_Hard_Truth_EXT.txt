          A familiar Jeep rolls down the highway between Cleaves
          Mills and Bangor.  Over this idyllic vista we HEAR a radio
          being tuned - bits of news, sports, oldies - regional AM
          Radio chatter - finally landing on...

                                        MALE DJ (RADIO)
                        ...and you're back with Jack
                          Jericho, the man you love to hate,
                        here on "THE COLD HARD TRUTH"...


  22E.C.U. A CIGARETTE BEING LIT

          Exhaled smoke swirling around a microphone.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        ...Charles from Cleaves Mills,
                        you're on the air...

          A hand, still holding the cigarette, punches a blinking
          call button.



          Several CONSTRUCTION WORKERS stand around a pickup truck
          drinking coffee, listening to their radio.

                                        CHARLES (RADIO)
                        Yeah, I just want to say, I've
                        been a mail carrier for fifteen
                        years and I don't appreciate the
                        way you run down my fellow postal
                          workers.


  44E.C.U. A CUP OF COFFEE

          Being sweetened with a slug of scotch by the unseen
          Jericho.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        Charles... far be it from me to
                          disparage the U.S. Mail Service,
                        my daily dose of hate mail arrives
                        through rain or sleet or Anthrax
                          scares...



          Several LOCALS pump gas, the DJ's voice echoing around
          them.

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        ...I was only wondering aloud why
                        your fellow postal employees go
                        crazy and kill each other with
                        such regularity that we had to
                        come up with a new verb, "going
                          postal."  I mean, just what is so
                          stressful about making us all
                        wait in line endlessly for bad
                          service?


  66E.C.U. A HAND

          Punches the call button, sending Charles to oblivion,
          then punches the next blinking call.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        "Tiny" you're on the air.



          A row of Harley's in front of a scary looking dive. 
          Several BIKERS loiter menacingly, listening to the radio
          as their Leader "TINY" talks into a cell phone.

                                        TINY
                        Yeah bro, this is Tiny from the
                          Penobscot chapter of the Vipers,
                        I just want to say we all dig
                        your show and remind your listeners
                        that our local "LOVE RALLY" is
                          happening tomorrow, so if they
                        want to donate any toys for
                          disadvantaged kids they can still
                        drop them off at the clubhouse.          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - TEASER - 11/20/03 - WHITE  3.


  88E.C.U. A WORN PAIR OF SNAKESKIN BOOTS

          Resting on the edge of the control board.  The boots slide
          off to the ground as Jericho (still unseen) leans in to
          the mic.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        Thanks for the public service
                          announcement "Tiny".  It's really
                          touching how you guys take time
                        off your busy schedule of drinking
                        and dealing crank to spread the
                        love.


  99TINY - AT THE CLUBHOUSE

          Not taking this well.

                                        TINY
                        Hey.  It's for the kids you...


  1010BANG!  TIGHT ON A CALL BUTTON

          As another caller is silenced.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        Yeah right.  More like it's for
                          court-ordered community service.

          A hand stubs out an unfiltered Camel and throws open a
          newspaper.

                                        JERICHO (O.S.)
                        Let's give the phones a rest and
                        check today's big stories.  Hmmm...
                        Any good plane crashes?  ... Here's
                          something...


  1111E.C.U. NEWSPAPER PHOTO

          A car being winched out of the water by a tow truck. 
          Inset tabloid style is a photo of Johnny Smith.

                        My favorite local celebrity is in
                        the news again.  Maine's own Johnny
                        Smith is up to his old headline
                          grabbing tricks -- this time
                        supposedly saving a drowned little
                        girl from a sunken car... oh
                        really?          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - TEASER - 11/20/03 - WHITE  4.


  1212ANOTHER HAND PUNCHES A BUTTON

          Pull back to reveal:



          Raking up the side of the roughly ten story building, an
          old fashioned radio tower dominating the roof.



          Johnny's Jeep angle-parked out front, along with several
          other cars.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                                (resonant DJ voice)
                        And welcome back, ladies and
                        gentlemen, to WPOV, where you are
                        riffin' with Da Kid...



          FLASHING LIGHTS strobe the restaurant exterior as a
            sheriff's deputy stuffs Charles into the back of a cruiser. 
          PULLING BACK to find Jericho being helped across the street
          by Johnny and Bruce.  He sounds less than grateful (and
          still very drunk).

                                        JERICHO
                        You guys stalking me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told you I had a vision.  That
                        big mouth of yours is going to
                        get you killed.

                                        JERICHO
                                (slurred)
                        Not that again.  Why don't you
                        predict something useful, like
                        what pony to bet on in the fourth
                        race tomorrow?

          Johnny sighs.  They find JERICHO'S CAR -- a beat-up sedan
          with a WPOV BUMPER STICKER advertising his show -- parked
          in front of the station, its tires slashed.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let me guess, another one of your
                        loyal fans expressing their
                        gratitude.

                                        JERICHO
                        At least I know they're listening.

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon, we'll give you a ride.



          An old building in a run-down neighborhood.  The Jeep
          lurches to a stop.  Johnny and Bruce turn to look at
          Jericho.  He's passed out.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Can't we just leave him by the
                        curb?  Tomorrow's trash day.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (getting out)
                        Just give me a hand.



          CLOSE ON A STREAM OF COFFEE as it hits a mug.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        You still take yours black?

          And as we pull back and he turns, we reveal his guest: 
          Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah...
                                (rueful)
                        Guess some things don't change.

          Johnny brings her the mug, eyeing her thoughtfully.  She's
          come here for a reason, but she hasn't disclosed it yet.

                                        SARAH
                        Thanks.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (picking up his own
                                  half-full mug)
                        Everything okay?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  No.  I'm worried about
                        J.J. and I just needed someone to
                        talk to.  I can't seem to talk to
                        Walt about anything anymore without
                        it turning into a fight.

          They each sip their coffee.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know Walt's crazy in love
                        with you.

                                        SARAH
                        Is he?  Lately it's been hard to
                        tell.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's J.J. taking all this?

                        you about... He finally told me
                        why he got into that fight. 
                          Apparently, some kids were teasing
                        him about something they heard on
                        the radio...

          Johnny closes his eyes.  He was afraid of this.

          Johnny opens his eyes, and now there's anger in them.

                        I can't believe people let their

                          Unfortunately, yes.  His name is
                        Jack Jericho.  He's been using me
                        for comic fodder since my arrest.

                        But you were cleared.

                        Doesn't matter.  I'm in the public
                        eye.  That makes me fair game. 
                          Unfortunately, he didn't stop
                        there.

                        No, but it's only a matter of
                        time.  The facts are out there --

          PRELAP:  ROARING HARLEYS


  3333OMITTED



          A half dozen GRIZZLED BIKERS led by Tiny, his "old lady"
          perched behind him holding a BOOMBOX, pull up on their
          hogs.

                          ...Who's this I see coming?  Looks
                        like Tiny and the "Love Riders."

          As Johnny also pulls up in his Jeep, amidst what's
            beginning to look like an angry biker convention.  As he
          gets out, a meaty hand lands on his shoulder.

                                        TINY (O.S.)
                        Hey bro...


    38A38AVISION - LOW ANGLE - JERICHO

          Is being lifted off the ground by two massive tattooed
          arms, the same tattooed arms from the first vision --
          Tiny's arms.  We're looking up at both of their faces
          from below, nothing but blue sky framing them, as Tiny
          shoves Jericho out of frame. 


    38B38BRESUME

          Johnny turns to find himself staring up at man-mountain
          Tiny, and those tattooed arms.

                                        TINY
                        What floor is the radio station
                        on?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I'm just here to see my
                          dentist.

          And with that he rushes off into the building.          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT TWO - 12/9/03 YELLOW  23A.



          Johnny bangs through a fire door, only to find the roof
          empty.  Hearing a COMMOTION -- muffled shouts and curses
          from below -- he rushes to the ledge, looks over and sees:


          POV FROM ROOF

          Jericho being choked by Tiny ten stories below.



          As Tiny lifts Jericho then heaves him.  JERICHO flies
          like a rag doll and bounces off a car, smacking his head. 
          A scrum of bikers converge on him, ready for a good old-
            fashioned beat-down.  They're stopped by a shout.

                                        TINY
                        No!  That's enough.

          As they all turn to him, surprised.

                                        TINY
                        Don't descend to his level.  We've
                        got a Love Rally to get to.

          Amid various snorts of assent, they begin mounting up.

          JOHNNY rushes out in time to see the bikers roaring off,
          then finds Jericho lying by the curb, groggy and groaning.

                                        MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hmm.  Looks like a minor
                          concussion.



          The dormer window protrudes over the steeply sloping roof. 
          Holding onto the window frame, Johnny looks around to the
          side... and sees J.J. sitting on the roof, knees tucked
          under his chin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, J.J.

                                        J.J.
                        Hey, Mister Smith.

          Jericho pokes his head out the window too.

                                        JERICHO
                        You mean he's been up there all
                        along?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Guess so.

          Johnny climbs out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This seat taken?

                                        J.J.
                                (shrugs)
                          I should've figured you'd find
                        me.  Who's your friend?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Long story.  And he's not my
                        friend.

                        This is your secret spot, huh?
                                (another shrug)
                        Guess we've all got our secret
                        places.  I've got one too.

                                        J.J.
                        You do?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yup.

                                        J.J.
                        Is it on your roof?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, if I told you, it wouldn't
                        be a secret anymore, would it?

          A beat, then J.J. starts to open up a little.

                        Are my mom and dad mad?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but they were pretty worried.

                                        J.J.
                        I heard them looking for me.  But
                        I just wanted to be by myself for
                        a while... to think, you know?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you thinking about?

                        Can you really tell the future?

                        Sometimes.  Why?

                                        J.J.
                        Are my parents going to get a
                          divorce?

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a long beat)
                        The truth is J.J.... that's not
                          something I can predict... only
                        your mom and dad can answer that. 
                        But there is something I know for
                        sure.  No matter what happens,
                        your mom and dad love you, and
                        that's never going to change.

          J.J. nods, a little comforted.  But just a little.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Think you're ready to come back
                        down?

          A beat, then J.J. nods again.  Johnny helps him back to
          the window.



          Johnny's Jeep parked out front.          DEAD ZONE: COLD HARD TRUTH - ACT THREE - 11/20/03 - WHITE  36.



          A modest two-story affair.  The piano music stops.  A
          long beat, then the door opens and MARGARET JERICHO, older
          now and careworn, ushers out a ten-year old girl carrying
          music books.  As he gets out of the Jeep, Johnny watches
          Margaret bend to zip the girl's jacket a little tighter,
          then stroke her hair.  We can see the affection in the
            gestures, and the loneliness.

          MOVING WITH JOHNNY as he heads up the front walk, calling
          to Margaret as she's about to close the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ms. Jericho?  Hi, my name is John
                        Smith.

                                        MARGARET
                        And my last name isn't Jericho
                        any more.  What do you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was hoping I could talk to you
                        about your ex-husband, Jack.

          She's taken aback by the mention of his name.

                                        MARGARET
                        I'm sorry.  That was a long time
                        ago.  It's not something I want
                        to discuss.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I understand.  If you won't talk
                        to me, maybe you could give him a
                        call.  He's in a kind of bad way
                        and could really use a friend.

                                        MARGARET
                          I haven't talked to Jack in years
                        and I'm not about to start, no
                        matter what kind of trouble he's
                        in.  I'm sorry you wasted your
                        time.  Goodbye.

          She shuts the door and locks it.  Defeated, Johnny takes
          a few steps down the walk... then goes back, reaches out
          and touches the door with his fingertips.  A Dead Zone

          quietly.  Camera lingers on her a beat, then reverses its

            realizing there's clearly still some deep connection
          between Jericho and his ex-wife.  But that doesn't make
          it any easier to reach her.  He takes a CARD for the radio
          station from his wallet, slips it under the door.


    6262INTERCUT:  ANGLE INSIDE THE DOOR

          as it slips under.  Margaret, still crying, looks down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ms. Jericho, if you change your
                        mind, you can reach him through
                        the radio station.  I'm sorry I
                          bothered you.

          As he walks away, camera lingers a beat on Margaret, still
          looking at the card but making no move to pick it up.



          Johnny pulls up to find J.J. playing STREET HOCKEY with
          TWO FRIENDS out front.  Johnny gets out and approaches.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, J.J.

          J.J. shakes his head as he passes the ball to a friend.

                        She had a job interview, she'll

                        Why do you want to see her?

                        Just wanted to tell her something.

          He picks up a hockey stick lying on the curb.

          Phone to his ear, Bruce is pushing through a crowd of

          CLOSE ON A PORTABLE RADIO, sitting on a ledge, nothing
          but sky and a hazy cityscape beyond it.  A pair of faded
            snakeskin cowboy boots step over it.

          As we reveal Jericho pacing on the ledge, talking on his

          Darkness is falling as Johnny pushes his way through a
          small but growing crowd, all looking up.  Many people are
            listening to headphones or portable radios; a few aim
          videocams.  A DAD holds up his SON, who points to the
          roof.  Walt and Bruce are waiting to usher Johnny inside.

                        Looks like your friend really
                        went off the deep end.  He's been

                        He's demanding that you get your
                        ass on the air... his words.

          Johnny reacts as Walt holds a door open, telling Bruce:

                                        WALT
                        Stick with John.  I'll be up on
                        the roof.



          Jericho is still pacing on the ledge, Walt and his deputies
          keeping their distance, remaining in the rooftop doorway.

                                        JERICHO
                        John!  Glad you could make the
                        party.  I was just about to blow
                        out the candles.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (takes a breath)
                        Jack--

                                        JERICHO
                                (rapid fire)
                          --"Jack, you don't have to do
                        it!"  "You've got so much to live
                        for!"  "Think about your loved
                        ones!"  Please, John, don't demean
                          yourself.  I didn't ask you here
                        to "talk me down."

                                        JOHNNY
                        No?  Then why?

                                        JERICHO
                        To bear witness to the fulfillment
                        of your prophecy, of course! 
                        That's right, folks, we all owe
                        this hugely entertaining spectacle
                        to the one and only Man From
                        Cleaves Mills.
                                (to Johnny)
                        When you told me how you saw me
                        going out -- not with a bang or a
                        whimper but after achieving my
                        own personal terminal velocity --
                        I gotta admit, it struck a chord.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nobody wants you to do this, Jack.

                                        JERICHO
                        Let's just see about that, shall
                        we?  All right, campers, it's
                        time for another "Cold Hard Truth"
                        poll!  Do I stay or do I go? 
                        Suicide jump or suicide chump? 
                        Next ten callers decide.  Go ahead
                        and spin a record, Johnny, while
                        the folks at home make up their
                        minds.

          And indeed Bruce cues up a record (in an ideal world, The
          Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go?"), to Johnny's
          disbelief.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you doing?

                                        BRUCE
                        Buying us some time.  I've worked
                        enough suicide hotlines to know
                        he's not joking.  Our call board's
                        already filling up with unfriendly
                        voices.  We need a plan.

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        C'mon, John, I know those calls
                        are coming in.  Punch a button,
                        let's hear one.

          Johnny's feeling the pressure, knowing he can't talk
          Jericho down unless he understands clearly what got him
          up there.  Then his eyes fall on...


          THE PACKING BOXES MARKED "JERICHO"

          They trigger a desperate hope.


          JOHNNY

          grabs one of the boxes, then punches the first of a row
          of blinking call buttons.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Umm, okay, we have, um...

          Bruce holds up a piece of paper for him to read.

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...Thelma in Bangor.  You're on
                        the air.

                                        TIPSY YOUNG WOMAN
                        Yeah, I've been listening to this
                        guy for a year and all he does is
                        trash people day in, day out.  I
                        think he should jump.

          As Johnny tears open the box...

                                        JERICHO (RADIO)
                        Thank you Thelma from Bangor. 
                        That's it people, don't hold back. 
                        Keep 'em coming, John.

          CLOSE ANGLE - ONE OF THE BOXES

          Office supplies, old calendars and files, yellow pads,
          souvenirs, miscellaneous junk.  Johnny paws through it as
          he punches another button...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bill from Plymouth:  you're on
                        the air.

                                        GRUFF GUY
                          I called in from my body shop,
                        and Jericho made me sound like a
                          schmuck.  The guys all laughed
                        their heads off.  I hope he lands
                        on his head.

          Meanwhile, John rips open the second box, finding more of
          the same bric-a-brac.  Johnny's frustration is growing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess that's a vote for "jump." 
                        Who's next?

                                        EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hi, my name's Marie, and I abhor
                          violence of any kind -- but in
                        this case...

          Johnny angrily dumps the contents of the box on the floor. 
          He stands over the mess, at a loss, then something catches
          his eye: a flash of color in an unsealed envelope.  It's
            a child's birthday card.  As Johnny picks it up --



          Jericho standing quietly now on the ledge, listening to
          his radio, staring out at the twinkling cityscape.

                                        FRAT GUY (RADIO)
                        Hey, man, my whole fraternity
                        took a vote, and we say he takes
                        the dive, so does that count for
                        more than one?

                                        BRUCE (RADIO)
                        Not a lot of love in that house,
                        is there Brad?

                                        FRAT GUY (RADIO)
                        Hey, if the guy wants to take a
                        header off a building, that's his
                          business.  We just want to watch
                        it on the tube, right dudes?
                                (laughter)

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        At least we know you're not doing
                        it for them.

          Jericho turns to see Johnny approaching, Walt hanging a
          little distance behind him, holding Johnny's cane.

                                        JERICHO
                        John?  You abandoned your post.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just wanted to talk to you,
                        face to face.

                                        JERICHO
                        That's close enough.  I'm serious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you are.  I think I also
                        know why.

          Johnny steps onto the ledge, a few yards from Jericho.

                                        JERICHO
                        John, I'm warning you, back the
                        hell off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell me about Aaron...

          He holds out the card.  Jericho recognizes the card and
          reacts, suddenly weary, as if the very word "Aaron" sapped
          him of his strength.


          CLOSE ON - THE CARD HELD OUT IN THE AIR BETWEEN THEM

          as Jericho's hand, almost unwilled, comes up to grasp the
          other edge of it.  And as he does so, camera does a 180
          around Johnny, who now finds himself in --



          CLOSE ON ONE OF JERICHO'S HEELS as it inches out over the
          edge, the abyss yawning on all sides.

                        going to tell us the cold hard
                        truth?  Think of your fans.  They
                        won't have anyone to hate.

                                        JERICHO
                        You're kidding right?

                        I had to try something.

                        I'm going to miss having you to
                        kick around, Johnny.
                                (to phone)
                        C'mon Bruce, last call.

          Johnny's cell rings.  As he answers, we hear a subtle
          Dead Zone WHOOSH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce?



          People scatter, screaming, as Jericho SMASHES into the
          roof of a parked car, blowing out the windows and setting
          off the alarm.


  8686RESUME ROOFTOP - JOHNNY

          Still staring aghast, the alarm echoing up from the street. 
          Walt grips his shoulder.

                                        WALT
                        It's over.

          And indeed it is... the vision, that is... as the scene
          now resets itself and Johnny once again finds himself
          with his phone to his ear as he eyes Jericho.  This time,
          he makes a different decision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait.  Bruce, put her on the air.

          A beat, then Margaret's voice comes over Jericho's radio.

                                        TENTATIVE WOMAN'S VOICE (RADIO)
                        Jack?  Can you hear me?
                                (beat)
                        Jack, it's me, Margaret.

          And this time, Jericho is caught unawares by a voice he
          hasn't heard in years.  For a moment, he doesn't think,
          just reacts.  Seeing this, Johnny presses him gently.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go ahead.  Take the call.

          And after a beat, Jericho slowly raises his cell phone.

                                        JERICHO
                          Margaret...



          The crowd, emotionally drained, starts to break up, a few
          people glancing up at the roof as police usher them away.



          Johnny pockets his phone, is about to leave...

                                        JERICHO
                        John...

          He's lowered his own phone for a moment... means to say
            something to Johnny but now words just fail him.  Johnny
            understands.

          A long look and a nod between the two men, then Johnny
          heads for the rooftop door as we...
