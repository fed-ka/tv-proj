    The girl, AUBREY, walks laden with an awkward array of 
      possessions followed by FREDERIC, a young intellectual, 
      carrying her big suitcase. Up the winding stairs they walk in 
      silence until arriving at the even more cramped hallway and 
      maid s room.  Frederic puts the suitcase down though there s 
      little space for it, the music dipping for dialog:

                                  FREDERIC
                    This is not bad.  People kill 
                    [keel] to have these. 
                          (looking out)
                    You can even see Montmartre from 
                    the view.

      Aubrey knows the view.

                                  AUBREY
                          (almost too upset to talk)
                    But, to cook, I can still use the 
                    kitchen--

                                  FREDERIC
                    No -- the locataires are to arrive 
                    at any moment. They have paid for 
                    the use of the entire apartment. 
                    All I could do was nothing. 

      Though Frederic s situation is obnoxious he is not: the charm 
      and likability which attracted Aubrey remains.  He steps over 
      to the tiny counter area hunching slightly so as not to bump 
      his head on the sloping roof.                                                                                      2.


                                  FREDERIC (CONT D)
                    Here you have the warm plate, the 
                    boiling pot, the water from the 
                    faucet.

    He turns the knob -- water does come out.  Tight on the 
      splashing water, then cut to:


      WATER CURLING BEFORE THE PROW OF A BOAT ON THE SEINE



    A late afternoon in July: Hal at a table with his work spread 
    out before him.  A waiter replaces his empty espresso cup 
      with a glass and a range of Bloody Mary ingredients.

    ON SCREEN: Three Summers Earlier

                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    ...I let myself be tricked. 
                    Although I took plenty of work to 
                    keep busy during the inevitable 
                    wait -- it s impossible to 
                    anticipate how late Fritz s really 
                    going to be.

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    Oh brother -- yeah.

    Hal looks up and around to wonder where Fritz could be --  
    the old-style cafe is a beehive of activity.                                                                                       7.


                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    Of course Fritz had again lost his 
                     mobile  [pronounced the French 
                    way] and my number with it, so had 
                    no way to call.

    A waiter comes to his table.

                                  WAITER
                    Monsieur, telephone.

    He nods to where the matronly proprietress  station at a high 
      desk by the stairs: she holds the phone.

                                  HAL (V.O.)
                    It s strange they could identify 
                    me.

                                  WODDY (V.O.)
                    Oh, yes...



    Hal walks over; the proprietress gives him the receiver.

                                  MME PROPRIETAIRE
                    Pour vous, Monsieur.

                                  HAL (IN CAFE)
                    Hello?  Hello?  Oh... Where are 
                    you? 
                          (incredulous)
                    Versailles?!                                                                                      8.



      Fritz and Hal ride in the back, the muscular driver looks 
      like he could be packing heat.                                                                                      9.


                                  FRITZ
                    Ariel s ex-Mossad.  

      ARIEL acknowledges this with a nod -- he looks very tough.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Sorry -- got tied up with a girl in 
                    Versailles -- some problem with the 
                    baby sitter. This whole thing of 
                    women with children:  I don t see 
                    the point -- why bother?  Just a 
                    nuisance.

                                  HAL
                    No, I think it s nice when women 
                    have kids.

      Fritz looks incredulous.

                                  FRITZ
                    What are you, a pedophile?  There 
                    are plenty of great women who don t 
                    have kids, why torture yourself 
                    with one who does?

    The car enters the circle at Porte Maillot.  Fritz suddenly 
      sees something:

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Arr te! Arr te! Stop...

      Ariel doesn t respond immediately.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Ariel -- stop here.

      Ariel pulls the car over; Fritz jumps out and approaches a 
      pretty dark haired young woman at the curb.



      Fritz scrambles back in the car.                                                                                    10.


                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    Well, he did get the girl s number 
                    and dated her for a while. 

    ON WODDY:

                                  WODDY
                    So.  Anyone can do that.

      BACK TO THE CAR, as it leaves town.

                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    We were heading to a dinner party 
                    at his friend Rufo s house in 
                    Nanterre--

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    There are  houses  in Nanterre?

                                  WODDY (O.S.)
                    There are people named  Rufo? 



    The waiter carries the tray out to serves Aubrey.

                                  AUBREY
                      ...Everything was wonderful until I 
                    got in Paris.  Then he found he 
                    couldn t write with anyone in the 
                    apartment.  

                                  JIMMY
                    What s his name?

                                  AUBREY
                    Frederic [pronounced the French 
                    way].  First he asked me to use the 
                     chambre de service  during the day 
                    -- because he has such trouble 
                    concentrating--

      Aubrey stops abruptly as if about to cry again; she takes a 
    sip of the kir.  Jimmy fills in the pause:

                                  JIMMY
                    I ve had that -- not being able to 
                    work when someone s in the 
                    apartment.  The problem is, I can t 
                    work when there s no one either.

                                  WODDY
                    Have you thought of getting a 
                    rabbit?

                                  JIMMY
                    No.  But I ll consider it.

    Hal sees that Aubrey seems to have recovered.

                                  HAL
                    So you re just killing time until 
                    Frederic finishes his writing 
                    day...                                                                                    14.


                                  AUBREY
                    No.  

    She again stops as if to avoid crying and takes another sip.

                                  WODDY
                    Good, right?

      Aubrey nods.  Woddy signals the waiter for another round.

                                  JIMMY
                    When you say it  was wonderful  
                    with Frederic, when was that?

                                  WODDY
                    No, she said it  had been 
                      wonderful. 

                                  JIMMY
                    Okay, but when was that -- the 
                    wonderful part.  Because I think I 
                    missed it.

                                  AUBREY
                    In Miami.  We met at Art Basel -- 
                    it was wonderful.  Frederic 
                      immediately wanted me to move to 
                    Paris to live with him; I d just 
                    broken up with my boyfriend so 
                    getting away seemed like a good 
                    idea.

    The waiter comes with a round of drinks and a dish of olives.

                                  JIMMY
                    I think that s true -- when you 
                    have a serious break up, putting 
                    the Atlantic Ocean between you can 
                    be very helpful.

                                  WODDY
                    What about the Pacific?

      Jimmy thinks a moment.

                                  JIMMY
                    Don t know.  Never tried it.

                                  HAL
                          (to Aubrey)
                    I m sorry, you were telling us what 
                    happened.

      Aubrey takes a sip, collects her thoughts and continues:                                                                                    15.


                                  AUBREY
                    Well, for weeks after I got here we 
                    were like that with me mostly 
                    upstairs -- but still together.  
                    Then this week Frederic said he d 
                    be away several months, a project 
                    in Lyons, and subletting his 
                    apartment.  

                                  HAL
                    What?  Out of the blue?

      Aubrey nods.

                                  AUBREY
                    I asked if I could still use the 
                    kitchen since I m taking the 
                    Escoffier course but he said no. 

    She can t go on.  She takes some sips of the kir.

                                  JIMMY
                    What a creep.

                                  AUBREY
                    He s not.

                                  WODDY
                    Hal got dumped too -- now he just 
                    mopes around listening to Al Green 
                    songs.

                                  AUBREY
                          (offended)
                    I wasn t  dumped.   Frederic just 
                    isn t used to living with anyone.

    Hal gets a text message -- he reads it.

                                  JIMMY
                    Clemence?

    Hal nods.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    I thought her break-up ethos was 
                    never to initiate communication, 
                    only the occasional painfully 
                    laconic reply--

                                  HAL
                          (quietly)
                    She was replying.                                                                                    16.


                                  WODDY
                    You sent her a text?

    Hal nods.

                                  WODDY (CONT D)
                    Sap.

                                  JIMMY
                    Omigosh!  Forget her!

                                  WODDY
                    That s not going to happen.

                                  JIMMY
                     Madame Cauchemar. 

                                  AUBREY
                    What s that?

                                  JIMMY
                     Mrs. Nightmare  -- Hal s ex, she s 
                    very pretty but completely 
                    unstable.

                                  HAL
                    Not completely.

                                  JIMMY
                    That kind of relationship?  It 
                    could kill you... That happens.  
                    People die.  

                                  WODDY
                    I don t understand it: she s very 
                    skinny.

    A phone rings -- Hal s.  He stares at the number, then 
      answers French style:

                                  HAL
                    Allo, Hal a l appareil.

      Woddy laughs.  From the phone a faint voice shouts.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    Yes, Fritz -- speaking of the 
                    devil...  
                          (to the others)
                    Party tonight --  Ten-thirty... 
                    Better, eleven.  Maybe dessert. 
                          (to phone)
                    So, we re your second class 
                    friends, invited after dinner?
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                          (to the others)
                     No, third class. 
                          (to phone)
                    Would it be okay if we brought a 
                    beautiful American girl along?...
                          (he smiles, nods)
                    Okay,   bient t...

    Hal hangs up.

      PONT DE NEUILLY METRO STATION:

      [Location scout: shown in this YouTube video, from the 7.40 
      point to 8.20:]

              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BVOruJjI2A

                                  HAL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    He said to get off near the end of 
                    the train.



      Hal, Aubrey, Woddy & Jimmy -- all pretty well dressed -- exit 
    the train and walk along the platform.  Jimmy and Hal carry 
      plastic bags with bottles of red wine; Woddy brings 
      champagne.

                                  AUBREY
                    Gosh, from all you ve said about 
                    Fritz, I m kind of scared.

                                  HAL
                    Well -- you should be.



    The four enter the party, somewhat disoriented by the semi-
      aristo European-ness of it all: A number of guests linger at 
    the dinner table, others act up in the kitchen and while a 
    few put on music in the salon.

                                  HAL
                    Bonsoir, bonsoir...  Et Fritz?

      Fritz appears; he seems surprised to see them.

                                  FRITZ
                    I didn t know you were bringing so 
                    many people.

    An awkward moment of unwelcome; Hal looks to his entourage.

                                  HAL
                    We re not so many.  This is Aubrey.                                                                                    19.


      Fritz doesn t mind pretty Americans:

                                  FRITZ
                    Enchanted -- I ll take that.

    He helps Aubrey with her raincoat.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Aubrey -- isn t that a boy s name?   

      Fritz disappears with her coat; as Aubrey enters the party 
      others notice her including a tall Frenchman with dyed black 
      hair.  Down the hall Jimmy spots someone:

                                  JIMMY
                    Omigosh, Gold Coat Girl s here.

    Hal cranes his neck to see.

                                  HAL
                    She knows Fritz?

                                  AUBREY
                    Who?

                                  HAL
                    Gold Coat Girl.

      They look down the hall where a very fashionable young woman, 
      slightly older than Aubrey, carrying a coat, is saying her 
      good-byes.

                                  AUBREY
                    Her coat s not gold.

                                  HAL
                    Well, when we met her she was 
                    wearing an amazing gold coat.

                                  AUBREY
                    What was amazing about it?

                                  HAL
                    It just was... incredibly stylish 
                    and fashionable. For a while we 
                    didn t know her name so she became 
                     Gold Coat Girl. 

      Gold Coat Girl approaches them, putting on her non-gold coat, 
    as she heads toward the door.

                                  JIMMY
                    Vicky -- you re going already?                                                                                    20.


      VICKY (aka  Gold Coat Girl ) stops, giving Jimmy a bit of a 
      blank stare.  Then, noticing Hal, she starts to place them.

                                  VICKY
                    Yeah I m meeting some people.

                                  JIMMY
                    Vicky, this is our friend Aubrey 
                    who s just arrived.

      Vicky sees Aubrey and seems impressed with her clumsy beauty.

                                  AUBREY
                    No, I ve been here six weeks.

                                  VICKY
                          (smiles)
                    What are you doing with these guys?  
                    I ll get your number, we should 
                    talk.

      Vicky walks off and out the door in style, the others left 
      gaping.

                                  AUBREY
                    Wow -- she s great.  Aren t all you 
                    guys after her?

      Jimmy s a bit incredulous:

                                  JIMMY
                    No. Gold Coat Girl?  We wouldn t 
                    stand a chance with her.  And... 
                    we re in Paris -- why would we 
                    chase an American woman?  That d be 
                    -- ridiculous.  Absurd.



      The last comment having sunk Aubrey further she heads down 
      the hall, her eyes watering. Hal catches up.

                                  HAL
                    Don t take that seriously.

      Aubrey turns around.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    People say things like that -- but 
                    it s not serious.  If someone likes 
                    someone who doesn t conform to 
                    their  plan,  of course they d 
                    change it.                                                                                    21.



    Hal returns to the kitchen where Fritz is giving a quick wash 
    to some glasses.

                                  FRITZ
                    Why d you bring that guy?

                                  HAL
                    Jimmy?

                                  FRITZ
                    No, of course not: the Dutchman.

                                  HAL
                    It d have been awkward not to: we 
                    were together when you called... 
                    Woddy s not such a bad sort.

                                  FRITZ
                    He sort of is a bad sort.  You 
                    know, he s not well regarded in 
                    Paris.  Not at all. Being seen in 
                    his company isn t good for your 
                      reputation.

      Hal, a little amazed, laughs.

                                  HAL
                     Not well regarded in Paris!   Uh, 
                    if I were worried about my 
                      reputation, wouldn t it be you I 
                    should avoid?

                                  FRITZ
                    No, I m well-liked. I m  colorful --

                                  HAL
                    A reprobate.

                                  FRITZ
                    Yes, of course, but everyone knows 
                    you re just visiting the circus; 
                    you re not personally implicated. 
                    Constantly being in the company of 
                    someone odious like Woddy you are.

                                  HAL
                    Odious?

      Woddy enters the kitchen with an empty glass.                                                                                    22.


                                  FRITZ
                          (very polite)
                    Oh, hello -- might I get you 
                    something?  

                                  WODDY
                          (looking around)
                    I brought a bottle of champagne...

                                  FRITZ
                    Of course.  I m opening more.

      Fritz opens the fridge revealing an assortment champagne 
      bottles of different brands; he grabs two to open.



      Walking into the salon Jimmy is suddenly transfixed; across 
      the room is the most beautiful Frenchwoman imaginable, 
      delicate golden hair framing her lovely face.



      Jimmy finds Fritz outside the salon collecting glasses.

                                  JIMMY
                    Omigosh, what an angel!  I m having 
                    a heart attack.
                          (clutches his heart)
                    French women are so lovely and 
                    beautiful -- it s mind boggling!

                                  FRITZ
                    Who?

      Jimmy nods in her direction: Fritz looks through the salon 
      doorway to see the  angel. 

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                     She might look like an angel -- 
                    but she s not one. 

      Fritz takes the used glasses back toward the pantry.

                                  JIMMY
                          (worried)
                    What do you mean?

                                  FRITZ
                    Nothing -- was just fun to say.                                                                                    23.


                                  JIMMY
                    Could you introduce me?

                                  FRITZ
                    Just talk to her.

      Jimmy follows Fritz as he goes back to the pantry.



                                  JIMMY
                            (brainstorming)
                    Actually, at Alliance Francaise our 
                    prof taught us some approaches in 
                    very correct French.

                                  FRITZ
                    That s what you re learning at 
                    Alliance --  pick up  lines?

                                  JIMMY
                    Yes. We practiced the "puis-je" 
                    form which is considered very good 
                    French:  Le Francais soutenu. 

                                  FRITZ
                    Oh the  pui-je  [pronounced 
                      correctly] form!  That ll knock her 
                    socks off! 

                                  JIMMY
                    You re mocking me.

      Fritz opens another bottle of champagne:

                                  FRITZ
                    No.  Puis-je  pour you another?

    He does so when the doorbell sounds; Fritz disappears to 
      answer it. Jimmy sips his drink and returns to the salon.

      TIGHT ON THE LOVELY FRENCH WOMAN AS JIMMY CONCLUDES HIS  PUIS-
    JE  APPROACH

    She laughs.

                                  LOVELY FRENCH WOMAN
                     Puis-je?   How nice.

    Her English is strangely unaccented.                                                                                    24.



                                  LOVELY FRENCH WOMAN
                    Where d you learn that? Berlitz or 
                    Alliance?

      Jimmy is perplexed; the LOVELY FRENCH WOMAN doesn t sound 
      French.

                                  JIMMY
                      Alliance...  Et vous?  Vous venez 
                    de quelle part?

                                  LOVELY WOMAN
                    Quel endroit? 

                                  JIMMY
                    Oui, quel endroit.

                                  LOVELY WOMAN
                    Vancouver.

                                  JIMMY
                            (pronouncing in French)
                    Vancouver, France?



      Jimmy returns as Fritz goes about his chores.

                                  JIMMY
                    She s not French!

                                  FRITZ
                    Yes. Aware of that.

                                  JIMMY
                    Why didn t you tell me?

                                  FRITZ
                    What would the entertainment be in 
                    that?

                                  JIMMY
                    Oh, I m entertainment for you!

                                  FRITZ
                    Not much, but some: The comical 
                    bigotry of France-obsessed Yanks, 
                    gushing over everything here while 
                      denigrating everything at home.                                                                                    25.


                                  JIMMY
                    She s not from home; she s from 
                    Vancouver.

      TIGHT ON: BRANDY POURING INTO A GLASS



    In an easy chair Fritz, finally relaxing, sips from a large 
      brandy; Camille can be glimpsed in conversation with a fellow 
    in the salon.

                                  FRITZ
                    Camille [Camy] -- she s lived here 
                    a long time -- married a French guy 
                    but they broke up... Well, they re 
                    still in the same apartment but not 
                       together. 

                                  JIMMY
                    So many of the women we know here 
                    have early marriages gone awry or 
                    crazy living arrangements of some 
                    kind.  As if they were all 
                    strangely prone to making bad 
                    choices.

                                  FRITZ
                    I know. It s great.

                                  JIMMY
                          (laughs)
                    What?

                                  FRITZ
                    Well, if they re prone to making 
                    bad choices, there s hope for us.

    He takes another sip.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    If they weren t, what chance would 
                    we have?  We probably wouldn t even 
                    know them.  They d be back in... 
                    Wilton, Connecticut...or 
                      Vancouver... happily married and 
                    with some boring kids.  Uh!  Far 
                    better to have them here, in Paris, 
                    making bad choices... for our 
                      delectation.

    A sad Al Green song starts to play.                                                                                    26.



    Hal and Woddy sit near each other, Woddy already a little 
      drunk.  He notices the sentimental ballad:

                                  WODDY
                    Oh no -- who put that on?

      Hal, eyes watering, stands up and walks away.

                                  FRENCH GIRL
                          (very concerned)
                    What?  What is the matter?

                                  WODDY
                    Al Green.  

                                  FRENCH GIRL
                    Algreen?

                                  WODDY
                    His music makes my friend sad.

      The French girl starts listening to the song attentively.  



      The Becker apartment -- their family residence -- is a warren 
      of rooms and hallways on two levels.  Hal wanders through 
      them, looking sad.  As his eyes start to water he steps out 
      to the balcony over the street.



      JUSTINE, a tall brunette resembling an aristo Paula Prentiss 
      (viz.  The World of Henry Orient ), sits in one Louis XVI 
      chair and Hal in another as if at a job interview.                                                                                    29.


                                  JUSTINE
                    ...My first husband was American -- 
                    a Thorpe from Middleburg, Virginia -
                    - Virginia horse country.

    Hal seems strangely callow in the company of such a worldly 
      young woman. 

                                  HAL
                    You seem too young to have had a 
                     first husband. 

                                  JUSTINE
                    In that world there are many young 
                      marriages.
                          (changing topics)
                    Which Paris hotel do you prefer? 

                                  HAL
                    Hotel?

                                  JUSTINE
                    Yes, do you prefer the Plaza 
                    Athenee, George Cinq or Bristol?

    Hal is stumped.

                                  HAL
                    I actually haven t stayed in any.  
                    Judging from the public areas... 
                    the Bristol s pretty great.

                                  JUSTINE
                     Pretty great?   What does that 
                    mean?  Is there an  ugly  great?

    Hal realizes he s in trouble.

                                  HAL
                    It s a manner of speech.  The 
                    English language.

                                    JUSTINE
                    No, I don t think so.  I know the 
                    English language.  I think it s 
                    something you made up.



      Fritz and Hal walk down the hall.

                                  HAL
                    What was that about?                                                                                    30.


                                  FRITZ
                    She s really attractive, don t you 
                    think?

                                  HAL
                    But what exactly was that?  It felt 
                    like a job interview.

                                  FRITZ
                          (laughs)
                    I think it was. 

                                  HAL
                    What do you mean?

                                  FRITZ
                    Well...  You can t mope around 
                    about Clemence forever. Time to 
                    find another distraction.

                                  HAL
                    Distraction?

                                  FRITZ
                    Justine has, ostensibly, a stable 
                    marriage, young children et cetera.  
                    She wouldn t want to upset 
                    everything with a divorce -- all 
                    the odium that comes with an open 
                    split...



      From the foyer Fritz points out someone in the salon.

                                  FRITZ
                    The fellow with the dyed black 
                    hair...  

      Fritz indicates the man just approaching Aubrey.



    In the salon the man with dyed black hair, ANTON -- tall and 
      bony -- offers Aubrey champagne.

                                  ANTON
                      Voulez-vous encore du champagne?

      Aubrey smiles shyly and holds out the glass.                                                                                    31.


                                  AUBREY
                    Oui, merci.

      Anton detects her accent and shifts to English; not perfect 
    but pleasant:

                                  ANTON
                    I m Anton, what s your name?

      There s something stiff about him -- he s no  smooth 
      operator. 

                                  AUBREY
                    Aubrey.

                                  ANTON
                          (getting it wrong)
                    Audrey -- a lovely name. 

                                  AUBREY
                    Aubrey.

                                  ANTON
                    Yes, Audrey, Audrey Hepburn -- you 
                    know, you resemble her.

      This cheers Aubrey up; she gives up on correcting him:

                                  AUBREY
                    Really?  You think so?

                                  ANTON
                    Surely everyone tells you so.

                                  AUBREY
                    No.  Not really.  Not everyone.

                                  ANTON
                    In-credible!

    He says it in a nice way.



      Fritz and Hal look toward Anton in the Salon.

                                  FRITZ
                     Good provider,  et cetera, a bit 
                    stiff, but pays the bills.  

                                  HAL
                    He s French?                                                                                    32.


                                  FRITZ
                    Yes... I don t think Justine s just 
                    gone off on some tangent.  There s 
                    some sort of understanding between 
                    them. 

    Hal is shocked.

                                  HAL
                    Gosh.  How decadent.

      Fritz smiles:

                                  FRITZ
                    You d turn that down?  Afternoons 
                    with a beautiful woman?  

                                  HAL
                    I m far too involved with Clemence.

                                  FRITZ
                    That s too bad -- because I don t 
                    think Clemence s involved with you.

                                  HAL
                    I couldn t just plunge into some 
                    decadent affair. 

                                  FRITZ
                    It doesn t have to be decadent:  
                    You could go hiking.

    Hal is too maudlin to take a joke.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    That s okay.  I don t think she 
                    liked you anyway.



      Anton is still in conversation with  Audrey. 

                                  AUBREY
                    The opera Bastille?

                                  ANTON
                    Oh, no -- that ter-rible concrete 
                    bunker?  No, the Op ra Garnier -- 
                    the beautiful, Belle Epoque palace 
                    at the Place de l Op ra.                                                                                      33.


                                  AUBREY
                    Oh, yes -- I ve seen it -- near 
                    Starbucks.

                                  ANTON
                    You must see the inside which is 
                      extraordinary.  I have tickets for 
                    this week if you might want to 
                    come.

      LATER, THE LIGHTS ARE MOSTLY OFF AND THE MUSIC WAY UP:



    A dance song plays -- a small group has started dancing 
      including Anton with  Audrey.  Jimmy tries to get up his 
      nerve to approach Camille. Woddy looks on, then bolts for the 
      foyer when the doorbell sounds. Fritz follows.



      Fritz arrives as Woddy hands some large Euro bills to the 
       banlieusards  (young French-Algerian guys from the projects 
    in this case) at the door.

                                  FRITZ
                    What are you doing?  What are you 
                    doing here?

                                  WODDY
                    They d like to come in.  Join the 
                    party.

                                  FRITZ
                    No.
                          (to the banlieusards)
                    Ca va?  Bonsoir.

      Fritz nods, bows then closes and locks the door. He turns to 
      Woddy:

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    What were they doing here?                                                                                    34.


                                  WODDY
                    Thought it might liven things up.

      Woddy holds up a small packet.

                                  FRITZ
                    You called them?

      Woddy nods.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    You cited dealers here?  At my 
                    mother s apartment?

                                  WODDY
                    They re just kids, harmless...  
                    I ve dealt with them before.

                                  FRITZ
                    You re out of your mind!

      Others approach to see what the discord is about.  

                                  WODDY
                    Oh come on.  Here.

    He dangles the packet, offering it to Woody.

                                  WODDY (CONT D)
                    C est pas grave.

    The less apologetic Woddy stays, the more excited Fritz gets.

                                  FRITZ
                    No...  Get out... You weren t 
                    invited, now you cite criminals at 
                    my family s apartment?  Go.  Now.

      Woddy is taken aback. 

                                  WODDY
                    You re joking.

                                  FRITZ
                    No, get whatever jacket, umbrella 
                    or whatnot you have, and leave!

    The others stand nearby, all a little shocked. 

                                  JIMMY
                    Gosh, Fritz--                                                                                    35.


                                  FRITZ
                    No. Your pal -- this jerk -- calls 
                    up drug dealers to come here where 
                    my family lives.  
                          (to Woddy)
                    You re out of your mind.

                                  WODDY
                    C est pas grave.

                                  FRITZ
                    Shut up.   C est pas grave!  -- the 
                    motto of morons.  Get out! 

      Woddy, intimidated, steps back, in so doing knocking a 
      porcelain off the side table -- it falls and smashes.  For a 
      moment everyone is silent, looking at the destruction. Fritz 
      takes the drug packets from Woddy s hand.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Okay, I will take these.  You can 
                    go.

                                  HAL
                    Come on, Fritz.

                                  FRITZ
                    No. Goodbye.

                                  JIMMY
                    What have we done?

                                  FRITZ
                    Doesn t matter.

                                  JIMMY
                    Why punish the rest of us?  I d 
                    really like to stay.

                                  FRITZ
                    The Lord works in mysterious ways.  

                                  JIMMY
                    What does that mean?

                                  FRITZ
                    You re weak on theology.  Go.  I 
                    don t want to see you.

      Fritz, turning to walk away, notices Aubrey.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Uh... the girl -- Aubrey-Audrey -- 
                    can stay.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    36.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                          (to Aubrey)
                    You should stay.

      Fritz walks away.



      The music continues as Aubrey, Jimmy and Woddy ride in the 
      back of a speeding cab; then a view of the streets they race 
      through while the camera rises over the city as the credits 
      roll.
