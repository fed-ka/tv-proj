LATE MODEL CAR - SAME
CHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind
the wheel.
He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street
that leads to the wharf.
OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
I never got close to him, nobody
did.
But by the time we made Tampa,
I was sure I knew who he was, that I
understood what he saw, what
nourished his soul and tested his
faith...
CAR - DAY
Chuck sits in the drivers seat.
Middy is in the back.
Charles slams the trunk and gets in.
Before Chuck turns
the ignition...
CHARLES
Now just take it easy.
We're not
going to a fire.
Chuck reacts.
OUTSIDE
Will watches as the car pulls away.
CAR - MOVING
The Giegs drive in silence.
Middy reads from a brochure.
MIDDY
Honey, did you know that the
Albatross was captured by the
Germans during World War II?
CHUCK
No, I didn't.
MIDDY
It says she was originally Schooner
rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned
her into a brigantine.
I think
square rigs look so much more
romantic.
CHUCK
Me too.
CHARLES
Appearances aren't everything.
Keep
your mind on the road.
Chuck pulls over to the side of the road.
CHARLES
What are you doing?
Chuck hands him the keys.
CHUCK
I don't feel like driving.
Okay?
Charles regards him oddly.
PLANE - DAY
Chuck settles into his seat next to the window.
He
watches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the
707.
CAR - SAME
The boys are jammed inside with their things.
In addition
to Chuck, Rick and Tod, is CHARLIE STRATTON, also sixteen.
TOD
Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no,
it's sweet to be back in the world
of rum and honey.
RICK
I gotta admit I never thought you'd
be back after the great "Bowsprit
Affair".
TOD
Me and Skipper had a meeting of the
minds.
CHARLIE
How's that?
TOD
I begged.
CHUCK
(warming a little)
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
RICK
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch
and managed to sweet talk one of the
local girls to have a go in the
bowsprit.
TOD
Not just any 'local' girl.
RICK
The 'local' mayor's 'local'
daughter.
Tod smiles, reminiscing.
CHARLIE
Thing is, the net in the basket
isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o
wraps them up in the jib.
After the
deed was done...
RICK
He says they did the deed...
TOD
Trust me, we did the deed.
CHARLIE
After the "alleged" deed was done,
they fell asleep.
Big Daddy Lawford
comes on deck at four bells and
hears Casanova sawing logs.
TOD
Believe me, I needed the rest...
CHARLIE
He gets the whole crew on deck, gets
us on the halyard, and orders the
old "heave ho...".
RICK
Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o
and the mayor's daughter, naked as
pilot whales...
CHARLIE
(to Tod)
I don't know who was more surprised,
you or Big Daddy.
TOD
To tell you the truth, I think it
was her father.
At the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view.
RICK
Well gentlemen, there she is.
The cab stops.
Besides many colorful fishing boats, is
the ALBATROSS.
At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything
in the harbor.
Her white hull glows like ivory and her
twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck.
Breathtaking.
CHARLIE
Home sweet hell on the water.
MAIN CABIN - DAY
Chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main
cabin.
Other crew members are already unpacking.
The sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of
bunks on each side of the cabin.
In the middle of the
room is a gimbaled table.
This is where the crew will eat
and study.
RICK
Listen up.
This is Chuck Gieg.
Among the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub
with soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and
rodent-like.
Robin approaches with a hand extended.
He carries a 8x10
photo of a young man in a football uniform.
ROBIN
I'm Robin.
Chuck regards the photo.
ROBIN
(flat)
That's my brother.
He's dead.
Apprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk.
Robin tacks up the picture above his bunk.
Terry unpacks
in front of one of the lower berths.
A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around.
A duffel bag lies
at the bottom of the companionway.
A large imposing
figure climbs into the cabin.
This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad.
His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full
day's growth of bread on his face.
Compared to the
others, he looks all man.
Everybody clears from his path.
He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk)
and drops his bag.
JOHN
I'll take this one.
TERRY
You probably didn't notice, but this
bunk has been taken.
John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things
onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it
into the remaining upper berth.
Terry watches,
intimidated.
JOHN
Anybody gotta problem with that?
RICK
(beat)
Absolutely not.
John climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes.
Bill
enters, followed by several adults.
DR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is
ship's surgeon and Skipper's wife.
Lawford appears with
GEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit.
BILL
Alright, listen up.
This is Dr.
Alice Sheldrake.
The guys stumble over only half listening.
ALICE
I'm ship's surgeon.
I'm in charge
of aches, pains, biology, math and
science.
BILL
George Pascal here is ship's cook.
GEORGE
If you want to keep all your
fingers, stay the hell out of my
galley unless you're invited.
BILL
Some of you already know Mr.
Lawford.
LAWFORD
I have been charged with the dubious
task of insuring your literary
education.
Lawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder.
LAWFORD
Bill Butler is your first mate.
But
don't let his size fool you.
Bill gives a half reluctant wave.
MIKE
So when the hell do we get to meet
El Capitan?
Snickering.
TERRY
(aside)
Maybe he's getting his wooden leg
waxed.
Laughter.
A sound stops the laughter.
Almost on cue, the
sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above
them.
Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking
the light.
Ominous.
They all notice and look up.
LAWFORD
(mysterious)
You'll meet him.
Soon enough.
MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE
Dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin.
The
only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber.
Suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.
LAWFORD (O.S.)
Arise, Arise, Arise...
Chuck wakes, disoriented.
Terry bolts upright and hits
his head on the low ceiling.
Ouch.
Tod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly.
Lawford's voice
echoes through the ship.
LAWFORD (O.S.)
Exultation is the going/ Of an
inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/
Past the headlands/ Into deep
Eternity/ Bred as we, among the
mountains/ Can the sailor
understand/ the divine intoxication/
of the first league out from land?
(pause)
But I suppose we'll answer that
question soon enough gentlemen.
Soon enough.
TERRY
What question?
Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.
Robin swings
his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look.
John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.
ROBIN
(foggy)
What the hell is going on?
CHUCK
Maybe it's an air raid.
In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps
through the aft bulkhead.
He raises a bowswain's
whistle
and blows.
OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!
Chuck and Robin grab their
ears.
It's a nightmare.
Terry jumps and hits his head
again.
BILL
Roll out sailors!
All hands on
deck!
Sixty seconds.
Sixty
seconds.
He blows the whistle again.
This time it brings even John
to his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.
Bill
looks up and casually notices him.
BILL
You gotta problem Goodall?
JOHN
You blow that thing again I'll shove
it so far up your ass, you're gonna
need dental floss to get it out.
BILL
Just get on deck.
Bill turns and disappears topside.
MAIN CABIN - DAY
The boys devour a hearty breakfast.
Tod is the 'galley
slave' and fills glasses with orange juice.
TOD
Chow down boys.
The milk and eggs
are the first things to go once we
put out.
John enters balancing two plates heaped with food.
RICK
You know we gotta dumbwaiter for
that.
John looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall.
RICK
Not that one.
Tod-o here.
The guys groan.
TOD
Har, har, har...
John approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry who
doesn't notice him.
Finally he looks up, startled.
TERRY
I'm done.
I'm finished...
He scrambles to get up and clear his plate.
John sits
down without a word.
The others notice the two plates of
food.
RICK
Hungry, Goodall?
He just grunts and starts eating.
Robin watches him.
JOHN
What's your problem?
ROBIN
Why'd you jump?
JOHN
Because I felt like it.
(sharp)
What do you care?
ROBIN
(aside)
I couldn't do it.
JOHN
Well, as soon as you grow some
balls, let me know.
Robin bristles.
ROBIN
Screw you!
CHARLIE
He's right.
It was a stupid stunt.
JOHN
Excuse me?
CHARLIE
You heard me.
John grabs Charlie by his private parts and hoists him
into the air.
Charlie gasps, the air sucked from his
lungs.
JOHN
Don't ever call me stupid.
ROBIN
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
John shoves Robin to the floor with his free arm.
JOHN
Let me tell you girls something.
I
do what I wanna do.
When I wanna do
it.
And I don't give a shit what
old Ahab up there thinks either.
Any questions?
John releases Charlie who crumples to the floor.
John
resumes eating.
Bill enters and reads the duty roster.
BILL
Okay, here's the duty.
Gieg,
Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart:
scrape and paint.
Corry and
Stricklin have the brass.
Robinson,
you're the Galley slave.
March
you're on chain gang with Barnes.
Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
TOD
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
BILL
You came back, Tod.
You came back.
John continues to eat.
When he realizes his name hasn't
been called, he looks up to meet Bill's eyes.
HEAD
Pissed, John tries to figure out the head.
Pumps going
in, pumps going out.
OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
We were all thirteen individuals.
We'd arrived the sum total of our
limited experiences and the result
of our parents' best, if not narrow,
expectations...
John pulls back on the lever, belching "water de le
toilet" all over him.
CHART HOUSE - DAY
Lawford addresses some of the crew.
Chuck, Robin and John
are among them.
John glares at Lawford.
The guys giggle.
LAWFORD
That's not a satisfactory answer.
JOHN
Look, save it for somebody else will
ya.
This ancient shit doesn't have
anything to do with me.
Lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes
theatrically.
LAWFORD
Shit?!!!
He slams a text book into John's hands.
LAWFORD
Read for me please the words of Mr.
Keats at the bottom of the page.
John stares back, simmering.
Robin interrupts the
potential confrontation and reaches for the book.
ROBIN
I'll read it.
I mean I don't mind.
JOHN
Shut up donut.
John pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for a
moment.
He begins reading but struggles with the cadence.
JOHN
(reading)
Much have I traveled in realms of
gold/ And many goodly states and
kingdoms seen/ Round many western
islands have I been/ Which bards in
fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one
wide expanse had I been told/ That
deep-browed Homer ruled as his
demesne.
LAWFORD
You know what he is talking about
here?
Blank faces.
LAWFORD
(ranting)
Awe.
Humility.
He's telling you
that he has traveled the seas as
Homer did.
As Ulysses had before
him as he tried to find his way home
to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars.
"That deep browed Homer"...
He points to his head.
LAWFORD
Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the
mind; "... ruled as his demesne."
He commands the voyage of the
imagination, like a god.
(pause)
That is what one of the greatest
literary minds of modern times, Mr.
Boutillier, has to say about Homer.
He snatches the book back.
LAWFORD
You think the Odyssey is dull?
I'll
tell you something, it's about each
one of you -- right now.
Doubt and
expectation.
Friendship, community,
self sacrifice and accountability.
He holds up the text.
LAWFORD
This isn't just a story!!
It's
history made allegory.
It is a
philosophical handbook for life!
It
holds the secret of this very
voyage.
JOHN
What is it... the secret?
Lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh.
JOHN
(confused)
What?
LAWFORD
If it were only that simple, my
young friend.
Read on, gentlemen.
Read on.
CHART HOUSE - DUSK
The chart house is the communication and navigation center
for the boat.
It also serves as the officers dining room.
Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sit
around the small table sipping coffee.
SKIPPER
We're awfully quiet tonight.
The group remains silent.
Lawford and George exchange a
glance.
Skipper catches it.
SKIPPER
Something on your mind, George?
George looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin.
GEORGE
I think you were too hard on
Weathers.
SKIPPER
You do?
GEORGE
Yes.
I do.
Skipper nods.
SKIPPER
I need to know what I'm working
with; what their boundaries are.
Their lives depend on it, and for
that matter so does yours.
We've
got to bring them together.
Make
them a crew.
We're as strong as our
weakest link and I don't want to
find that out the hard way.
So, I
will challenge them and they will
come together.
GEORGE
(sarcastic)
Yes sir.
SKIPPER
You know the best thing about being
a Skipper is the worst thing.
It's
all my responsibility.
So I'll tell
you what George, you stay off of my
bridge, and I'll stay out of your
galley.
We'll get along that way.
Everyone's quiet, but clear.
Skipper and Alice exit.
GEORGE
Fucking bastard.
Lawford lets out a belly laugh.
LAWFORD
I've seen him snatch the tail of the
tempest and stuff it, screaming,
into a bottle.
The bilges are full
of them.
GEORGE
What do you mean?
LAWFORD
He's been beyond the reach.
To the
edge of the abyss and back.
He'll
do well by us all George.
He's a
real salt.
There's no malice in him
and there's nothing more dear to him
than his boys.
So sleep well my
friend.
Lawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars,
passes one to George and winks.
GALLEY - DUSK
Robin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching
through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the
horizon.
Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of
food.
CHUCK
How ya doing?
ROBIN
(without turning)
Fine.
CHUCK
Good.
ROBIN
Look, I appreciate, you know, the
concern and all, but like he said, I
can take care of myself.
CHUCK
I just brought you something to eat.
Robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods.
They
stand silently.
It's awkward.
CHUCK
I feel like I got you into this.
ROBIN
Forget it.
CHUCK
I'm used to spending a lot of time
alone.
I guess that's what I
thought it would be out here.
But,
it's not is it?
ROBIN
(beat)
I'm sorry I left you hanging up
there.
CHUCK
It doesn't matter.
Really.
I'm
just sorry you got chewed out.
Robin nods.
They both stare out at the rising moon.
ROBIN
My brother and I used to climb to
the top of this old beech tree in
the back yard and watch the moon
come up just like this.
My parents
would fight all the time so we'd
sneak out there where we couldn't
hear 'em and recite scenes from our
favorite movies.
Robin grows quiet.
ROBIN
Would you believe I miss it?
The
middle of paradise and I'm homesick.
Chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back.
CHUCK
(ironic)
Well, I wouldn't worry.
It'll all
be there when we get back.
SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY
Skipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in
front of him.
There's a knock on the door.
SKIPPER
Come in.
BILL
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much
doing group boot over the side.
SKIPPER
Well, that's all part of it.
BILL
We've got weather moving in from the
west.
Skipper looks up.
SKIPPER
That's part of it, too.
MAIN CABIN - SAME
It's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks.
Pots
crash, books and personals go flying.
The guys are
scared.
ON DECK
The main and jib sheets tighten.
Skipper looks at Chuck
and Bill.
It all comes down to moments like these and he
loves it.
Suddenly, there is a loud CRACK!
A violent flapping
noise.
Skipper leaps to the port and looks forward.
Tod
comes running back.
TOD
We blew the inner!
ALICE
I'll go.
SKIPPER
Bring it down and run up the storm
jib.
We'll fix it later.
Stay out
of reach of the blocks!
Tod and Alice disappear.
SKIPPER
(with a twinkle)
Well, we're in it now.
Chuck studies him, frightened, but reassured.
LONG BOAT - SAME
Chuck gazes across the strange landscape.
As the boats
dock, the crew pile out and scatter.
Local children
follow them wherever they go.
Chuck, Robin and John find
themselves alone.
Most of the buildings are primitive.
They wander over to a shop.
ROBIN
What do you say?
Cokes?
I'm
buying.
CHUCK & JOHN
Sure.
CABIN - NIGHT
Robin thrashes in his bunk calling out.
Sweat glistens on
his face.
Chuck stumbles out to his bunk with Rick and
some of the others.
RICK
Hey man, wake up.
Wake up!
They shake him.
Robin wakes, disoriented, eyes filled
with tears.
ROBIN
I was falling...
Phil grumbles from his bunk.
PHIL
Hey, shut up will ya?
CHUCK
It was a bad dream...
ROBIN
It was so real...
CHUCK
Here's the thing; whenever you're
having a nightmare, all you have to
do is say 1-2-3 wake up!
You'll be
out of it.
You'll wake up.
Phil rolls over in his bunk trying to go back to sleep.
ROBIN
Who told you that?
CHUCK
My dad.
ROBIN
It works?
CHUCK
Swear to God.
Only good advice he
ever gave me.
Now, go back to
sleep.
He pats Robin on the leg.
The guys return to their bunks.
Favor Phil, listening.
CHUCK
(lingering)
You okay now?
Robin stares at the photo of his brother.
ROBIN
That's how he died you know.
CHUCK
Who?
ROBIN
My brother.
He fell out of the old
beech tree.
Broke his neck.
I was
on a camp out.
They started going
at it, throwin' things, a real knock
down...
(beat)
They didn't find him 'till the next
morning.
They didn't even know why
he was up there.
CHUCK
Jesus, you never told them?
ROBIN
I couldn't.
Phil stares at the ceiling, affected by what he has
overheard.
Someone creeps down the companionway and
whispers.
MIKE
(hushed)
Hey you guys, come on!
Shuffling in the darkness.
Phil suddenly realizes, he's
alone.
GALLEY - SAME
George is asleep with a book in his lap.
Mike and Chris
slip inside.
The door squeaks, George stirs.
Mike opens
a cabinet and removes a fifth of rum.
Silently, Mike passes the bottle to Chris who passes it to
Tod who passes it to Charlie who drops it down to Robin
who stands in the lowered dory with Chuck.
PHIL (O.S.)
What do you think you're doing?
Startled, Mike and Rick share a look.
Busted.
Phil turns
and runs into John, wearing a broad smile, who shakes his
head.
No way.
PHIL
Forget it.
Count me out!
The crew descend and drag Phil, struggling, into the dory.
They raise a crude sailing rig and silently move off.
A figure stands on top of the chart house, back lit by the
moon.
It's Skipper.
Watching it all.
Letting it unfold.
GALLEY - NIGHT
Skipper hovers over George, sawing logs.
He tosses a pot
on the floor.
GEORGE
(bolting up)
What?!
What's happening?!!
SKIPPER
You're officer of the watch, George.
GEORGE
I'm sorry, Skip.
It's this damned
book.
Lawford gave it to me.
The book is "Kafka".
Skipper motions to the empty
cabinet.
GEORGE
Son-of-a-bitch.
SKIPPER
We're short one long boat too.
Come
on.
AFT CABIN - DAY
John makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the
head.
Robin follows.
Chuck drops down the aft
companionway, intercepting John.
CHUCK
Where you going?
JOHN
To take a piss.
ROBIN
Really?
John turns around, surprised, sandwiched.
JOHN
Yeah, that's right.
You wanna come
in and shake it for me?
CHUCK
If you're gonna cheat, you might as
well copy off somebody who's gonna
get the answer right.
JOHN
You've gotta be kidding.
Get the
fuck outta my way!
Chuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove John
inside.
JOHN
What the hell!!!
Chuck manages to pin John.
Robin checks his pockets and
comes up with the crib notes.
Chuck lets go.
John
snatches them, ashamed.
CHUCK
Takin' a piss?
John turns away.
ROBIN
Why, man?
JOHN
I don't have to listen to this.
CHUCK
Yes you do, stupid.
Because if you
don't, I'm gonna go right up there
and have a heart to heart with
Skipper and you'll be on the first
plane back to idiotville.
John lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.
Robin
leaps on top of John.
ROBIN
Cut it out man!!
Stop it!!!
What's
the matter with you?
If Phil had
caught you he'd have ratted you out
in a second.
You get caught
cheating, you'll get kicked off the
boat.
John explodes, tears flowing.
JOHN
I cheated to get on the boat!!!
All
right?!
CHUCK
What?
He lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his
emotions.
JOHN
I doctored my grades so I'd make the
cut.
I'm a moron, okay?
You
satisfied?!
CHUCK
You're not a moron.
JOHN
Wanna bet?
Takes me half a day to
get through one chapter of Lawford
and I still don't have any idea what
the hell he's talkin' about.
You
know why it takes me so long to
write papers?
because I can't
spell.
While everybody else is
sleeping, I'm in the rack with a
flashlight and a dictionary.
John chokes back a sob.
JOHN
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo-
tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide
rule.
PHIL
I can show you how to use a slide
rule.
The three turn around, startled.
ROBIN
How long you been standing there?
PHIL
Long enough.
John looks down, resigned.
JOHN
They were gonna put me into special-
ed this year.
I stole a copy of my
transcript, changed all the grades.
Shit, who am I kidding.
I'll never
pass the boards.
CHUCK
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll
make sure you get the grades.
We'll
start a private study group.
Nobody
knows.
You'll ace that test.
ROBIN
I'm in.
They turn and look to Phil, who still shows the tell-tail
signs of their fight.
PHIL
Me, too.
JOHN
Why would you do that?
CHUCK
Because we believe in you.
(beat)
Because we're your friends.
MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
The crew is getting ready for a farewell party.
Each
member is primping.
CHUCK
Bregitta.
Do you believe it?
JOHN
Believe what?
CHUCK
Her name.
(savoring the sound)
Bregitta.
It's poetry.
TERRY
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
TOD
Don't mind him, Chucky.
You're
talking to a guy whose idea of big
romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
TERRY
Screw you, Valentino.
I haven't
seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Tod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket.
It's a pair of girls' cotton underwear.
TOD
That's because I'm discrete, moron.
The guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him.
Just
then Skipper descends the companionway.
SKIPPER
Alright, gentlemen, we sail with the
tide.
Twenty-three hundred.
Sharp.
I'm not waiting.
Have a good time
tonight but be back on time.
The crew cheer.
This means the trip goes on.
MAIN CABIN - SAME
Chuck and John hold Phil still as Robin picks shards of
glass out of his feet.
Phil clenches his jaw, but his
eyes are dry.
CHART HOUSE - SAME
Skipper and Alice have paperwork spread out in front of
them.
A knock.
SKIPPER
Come.
Chuck enters, awkward.
SKIPPER
What's on your mind?
CHUCK
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Skipper looks up.
SKIPPER
Well, spit it out.
CHUCK
The fact is... We'd like you to give
Phil another chance.
Alice raises her eyebrows, surprised.
SKIPPER
Can't do it.
CHUCK
Sir...?
SKIPPER
Close the door.
Sit down.
Chuck does as he is told.
SKIPPER
Why do you think I'm sending him
home?
CHUCK
He killed the dolphin.
Skipper looks at Chuck for a moment.
SKIPPER
The Dolphin was a symptom.
CHUCK
Of what?
SKIPPER
Of a fight he can't win out here.
CHUCK
It's his father sir.
He's
suffocating him.
We've all seen
it...
Suddenly it's as if Chuck is talking about his own life.
CHUCK
I mean he has all these expectations
and he doesn't even know who his own
kid is.
What right did then have to
show up here?
SKIPPER
They have every right Chuck.
CHUCK
They send us because they want us to
change, or grow up or something and
then they try to keep us the same.
Skipper sits up and studies Chuck for a moment.
SKIPPER
Let me tell you something about
Phil's father, and your's too.
How
do you think you got here?
You
think this is all free, that they
owe you something?
You think they
enjoy riding subways and commuter
trains, driving buses or pulling
lobster traps?
Work fifty weeks a
year to keep you in tennis shoes and
private school?
Look around at how
the rest of the world lives Chuck.
We're the luckiest people alive,
every one of us.
They gave it up
for you and Phil, and me too my
friend.
Chuck chews on it.
SKIPPER
There are ground rules in families
just like on this boat.
If you and
Phil don't like it, I'm sorry.
Someday you'll understand that, and
if you're lucky, you'll come home
and find your best friend has been
there all along waiting for you to
forgive him for being a father.
It'll be the way it used to be,
when you were ten and your dad was a
giant.
Now it's Skipper who is talking about himself.
SKIPPER
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
CHUCK
I don't know.
SKIPPER
You should tell him.
That's
something he can take with him.
Chuck nods and leaves.
CHART HOUSE - SAME
Skipper returns to his paperwork but can feel Alice
watching him.
He senses it.
SKIPPER
I'm all ears.
Alice smiles.
ALICE
You may not like what you hear.
SKIPPER
I can take it.
ALICE
They've become what you wanted.
They're a crew.
That's why he came.
Skipper puts a loving hand on Alice's shoulder.
SKIPPER
Why did we begin this?
ALICE
We were idealists.
SKIPPER
Because we believed we could make an
impact out here.
Self reliance and
community through the disciplines of
sailing.
ALICE
I haven't forgotten.
SKIPPER
Phil, he's not looking inside.
He's
just striking out at the world.
ALICE
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
SKIPPER
Well, he better learn to own it.
Actions have consequences.
(beat)
It's not what happens here Alice,
it's what they take away with them.
Alice runs her hands across his face.
ALICE
You're still an idealist.
Skipper turns and slips into her arms.
SKIPPER
Oh hell...
CABIN - SAME
Tod exits the head with a worried look on his face.
He
grabs Chuck by the arm and pulls him aside.
Morale is
extremely low.
TOD
Listen man, I think I have a
problem.
CHUCK
We all have problems.
TOD
I'm pissin' fire man.
Chuck reacts.
SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY
Tight on Alice.
Pull back to reveal Tod standing in front
of her with his shorts down around his ankles.
Mortified.
ALICE
Have a nice time in Curacao, did you
Tod?
Alice gets up and moves to her medicine chest.
Tod starts
to pull up his shorts.
ALICE
Not so fast.
She pulls out a menacingly large looking hypodermic
needle.
Tod's embarrassment turns to alarm.
CABIN - DAY
Laundry, books and mementos go flying as each boy
scrambles to dig up his passport.
Terry sits among his
things, dazed.
Bill notices.
BILL
What's wrong?
MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
The sounds of slumber fill the cabin.
All seems well with
the world.
Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.
A huge
bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a
trident in his hand.
Chuck wakes with a start.
He bolts upright to see the
horrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering
before him.
He tries to scream, but hands cover his
mouth.
He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.
MAIN CABIN - DAWN
The crew sleep in their bunks.
Lawford's voice rumbles
down the companionway.
LAWFORD
A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A
wind that follows fast, And fills
the white and rushing sail, And
bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise
you salty dogs.
The watch is on.
Chuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out.
The dumb waiter
clatters down from the galley with the morning's
breakfast.
Skipper and some of the crew are already
eating.
MAIN CABIN - SAME
Robin, Chris, Bill, Mike and Rick are seated at the table
finishing breakfast as the ship starts to go.
They all
share growing alarm as they watch the table reach it's
maximum angle.
Dishes start sliding off.
BILL
Get out!!
Everybody out!!
SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME
Alice struggles towards the door.
The book case tears out
of the wall and strikes her.
She drops to her knees.
The
door swings open in front of her.
She reels for a moment
and then loses consciousness.
FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME
Lawford, Charlie and George are all hurled out of their
bunks.
The world is suddenly sideways.
Lawford leaps up,
pushing the others towards the companionway ladder.
LAWFORD
GO, GO, GO!!!
TOPSIDE!!!
Come on
Charlie!
George, get them out!!
George disappears into the main cabin.
Lawford manages to
get Charlie out.
As Lawford reaches the top of the ladder
sea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back
into the bowels of the ship.
MAIN CABIN - SAME
Robin is through the companionway in the chart house with
Mike right behind him.
But instead of exiting, he holds
the door open against the sea so that Mike can escape.
Mike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it
closed, pinning Robin's arm.
He struggles to push
through.
SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME
Skipper's face is pressed hard against the skylight.
His
muffled voice penetrates the cabin.
Alice stirs.
She
looks around, delirious.
SKIPPER
Alice, get up!!
Come on girl!!
He pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the
planks, fingers bleeding.
Alice looks up confused but
calm and finds Skipper's eyes.
ON THE DECK
Panicked for the first time in his life Slipper swings the
ax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of
splinters into the water.
SKIPPER
Get out!!
Get out!!
Jesus Christ,
please God, Alice get out!!!
But after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip
beneath the sea.
MAIN CABIN - SAME
Water thunders in from every possible exit.
Chris and
Rick push Bill towards the dumbwaiter.
RICK
Bill, you go.
We'll be right behind
you.
Before he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the
tiny shaft.
Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser
smashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious.
But the
pressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the
galley and out onto the deck.
FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME
Eerie silence.
Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket.
Debris float around.
He begins to panic as the water
around him rises.
LAWFORD
My God!!
Oh God I'm dying!!!
He takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.
Then
suddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure
within.
ON THE SURFACE
Lawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the
surface.
CABIN - SAME
Curled up on the floor next to his bunk is Skipper.
A
look of shock comes over Chuck's face.
Skipper has come
completely unglued, sobbing deeply.
CHUCK
(tentative)
Skipper?
Skipper turns slowly, looking up.
His eyes are red and
his face streaked with tears.
He looks at Chuck almost as
if he doesn't know who he is.
Lost.
SKIPPER
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Chuck reels.
It sounds more like a confession than an
outpouring of sadness.
Chuck closes the door.
CUSTOMS HUT - SAME
Skipper is whisked inside.
The Coast Guard Officers lock
the doors behind them.
OFFICER
Sit down Captain.
We'll have a car
here in a few minutes.
Can I get
you a cup of coffee?
SKIPPER
No, thank you.
Skipper sits.
The wails of family members can be heard as
they see the list outside.
Flash bulbs and faces press
against the windows shouting questions.
He just stares at
the floor.
OUTSIDE
From above we can see the group swarm around the the booth
like angry hornets.
The crew are fractured and pulled
apart from each other.
Charles, fights his way through
the crowd.
CHARLES
Chuck!
Chuck!!!
Chuck tries to get to him.
CHUCK
Dad!
They embrace.
Flash bulbs explode all around them.
CHUCK
Where's Mom?
CHARLES
I couldn't bring her down here until
I knew you were safe.
A WOMAN
Stands, staring at the empty ramp.
Lost.
A man comes up
behind her and leads her away.
A reporter shoves a microphone in Chuck's face.
REPORTER #5
Was it the Skipper's fault?
And is
it true drinking was permitted on
board?
Why did the ship really go
down?
Charles grabs the guy and shoves him back into the crowd.
Chuck strains to see his crew mates but they have been
swept away.
CHARLES
Come on.
Charles puts his arm around Chuck, still barefoot, and
together, they walk away.
Photographers trail after them,
popping off a few last photos.
Chuck turns and looks
back.
CAR MOVING - DOWNTOWN - DAY
A ride reminiscent of the one Chuck and his father took
before the journey began.
There is a gulf of silence
between them.
Charles breaks it.
CHARLES
I thought we'd find a store, get you
fixed up and then get you some
lunch.
That sound good?
CHUCK
Yeah, sure.
Chuck stares out the window at the traffic and congestion.
A car in front of them runs a red light.
Charles slams on
the brakes.
Chuck is shaken up.
Charles notices.
CHARLES
I'm sorry, son.
Are you okay?
Chuck manages a nod.
DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
Lavish and conspicuous by Chuck's recent standards, the
store is crowded and jammed with merchandise.
Claustrophobic.
Cash registers ring and MUZAK drifts in
from above.
Chuck follows as Charles pulls things off of
hangers and piles them into Chuck's arms.
CHARLES
Why don't you go and try some of
that on?
CHUCK
Okay.
DRESSING ROOM - SAME
Chuck is curled up in the floor of the tiny booth.
Still
dressed in the clothes from the Gran Rio, perspiration
beads on his skin.
CHUCK
(calling out)
Okay.
Tears stream down his face.
He looks up and sees himself
in the mirror.
The eyes that look back are eyes of the
ages.
Involuntary sobs.
He begins to shake.
The tiny
booth suddenly like a crypt.
Tight, with no air.
Chuck
lets out a gasp.
CHUCK
Oh God...
Someone pulls open the curtain.
A MAN, from the next
booth, fat and middle aged stands before Chuck in a pair
of pants still sporting the price tags.
He looks down.
MAN
You okay, kid?
Chuck is suddenly in the throws of a full-on anxiety
attack.
He leaps up and pushes past the man.
COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
Skipper sits across from a Coast Guard Officer, TYLER, 60.
Tyler pulls out a file and lays it on the table.
TYLER
There are allegations questioning
your competence with regard to the
command of the Albatross.
I have
been instructed to convene a formal
tribunal to determine whether or not
negligence played a part in the
sinking.
SKIPPER
I understand.
TYLER
May I ask you something?
Skipper nods.
TYLER
How'd you manage to piss off a guy
as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
SKIPPER
It wasn't hard.
TYLER
I used to helm a school ship.
A
long time ago.
SKIPPER
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.
She never
lost a race while you were Skipper.
Tyler is taken aback by Skipper's knowledge.
TYLER
That's right, we didn't.
I miss it
sometimes.
But, there are other
things a Skipper can do.
Tyler removes his glasses and studies Skipper.
TYLER
The families... want your ticket.
Turn it in, we forget the whole
thing.
Everybody goes home.
SKIPPER
... Absolutely not.
TYLER
The papers are going to eat you
alive.
Even if you beat it, you'll
never get another commission.
(beat)
They want someone to be accountable.
SKIPPER
I am accountable.
HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Standard fare.
Two beds and a T.V.
Chuck's lacing a new
pair of sneakers.
Charles is in the shower.
There is a
knock at the door.
Chuck cracks the door.
It's Charlie.
CHARLIE
We gotta talk.
BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
The crew stand by the bulkhead.
Bill tosses down a
newspaper.
The headline reads:
INVESTIGATION TO PROBE
SCHOOL SHIP TRAGEDY.
BILL
We're all going to have to testify.
They're going to try to take his
license.
TOM
Why?
CHUCK
They need it to be simple.
They
need a reason.
TOM
Who?
CHUCK
All of them.
Everybody waiting on
that dock.
TIM
So what are we supposed to do?
TOD
Just tell 'em what we know and be
done with it.
That's what he'd
want.
TERRY
Easy for you to say.
TOD
What's that supposed to mean?!
TERRY
Everybody knows why she went over
Tod.
You jibed the boat.
TOD
I was trying to get her up wind!
That's what you do when you're hit
a-beam.
Or maybe you're too stupid
to know that!
TERRY
That's not what Skipper thought.
He
was trying to spill air from the
main!
BILL
It was coming four points off the
bow, Terry.
He never could have
gotten her around.
TERRY
Were you on deck?
I was standing
right there and all I know is, he...
(indicates Tod)
... disobeyed an order, twice, and
the boat went over.
TOD
It didn't go over 'til I turned her
starboard!
BILL
It was an act of God for Christ's
sake.
TERRY
It was an act of stupidity.
Tod lunges at Terry.
Bill and Charlie pull them apart.
TOD
(screaming)
Was it my fault we were running all
that sail?!
Was it my fault she
wasn't dogged down?!!
HUH?!!
I
couldn't help that the ballast
shifted...!
You son of a bitch!!
It wasn't my fault!!
it wasn't.
Tod breaks down, sodding on his knees.
BILL
It's okay, Tod.
Terry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt.
TERRY
Then whose?
Tod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused.
TERRY
After the lightning strike, we tried
to go aloft to drop sail.
We'd done
it a thousand times.
We didn't have
to wait for an order.
But Skipper
called us down.
CHARLIE
If the foremast had taken a strike,
everyone in the rigging would've
been fried.
What would you have
done?
TERRY
We would have scalloped the squares
from the deck.
Right Bill?
Bill turns and stares into the water, troubled.
TOD
That's right, that's right!
Bleed
the sails from the deck and she
could've taken a hurricane!
It's a strong argument.
Even Charlie is troubled by the
implication.
There is a long moment of silence between
them.
CHUCK
This is crazy.
Nothing could have
prevented what happened.
MIKE
You guys are missing the point.
This is all because of Phil.
Phil
and his dear old dad.
BILL
What?
MIKE
How do you think they got this
together so fast?
He's been laying
for Skipper since the first day.
CHARLIE
Come on.
Like he's got a vendetta
or some such shit?
MIKE
You got it.
(to Chuck)
I told you he was a turn coat the
day we kicked him off the boat.
Chuck frowns, troubled.
CHUCK
No.
You're wrong.
MIKE
I'm telling you, the only way to
change this is to get Phil to call
off his old man.
And that ain't
gonna happen.
So the way I see it,
it's Skipper or us.
The guys react.
It's a no win situation.
HEARING ROOM - DAY
A small courtroom.
The room is filled with the crew
members and their families, including the parents of the
victims, as well as the media.
Phil sits with his father
and dodges Chuck's eyes.
Coast Guard Officers Tyler,
DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings.
TYLER
The United States Coast Guard has
been asked to conduct this maritime
hearing to consider the revocation
of Captain Richard Sheldrake's U.S.
Master Seaman's Certificate.
HEARING ROOM - LATER
Bill sits at the table with his parents as questions are
leveled at him.
Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing
ask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the
proceedings.
SANDERS
Why didn't you drop any sail?
BILL
Skipper called us out of the
rigging.
SANDERS
But your instinct was to lose sail?
BILL
My instinct was to not get
electrocuted.
SANDERS
How old are you, son?
BILL
(hesitating)
Fifteen.
SANDERS
Thank you.
LATER
Phil is at the table with Francis.
Sanders asks the
questions.
SANDERS
Philip, why were you discharged from
the Albatross?
Phil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers.
PHIL
Skipper thought I was a challenge to
authority.
SANDERS
Were you?
PHIL
I don't know.
LATER
FRANCIS
Captain Sheldrake exhibited an
arrogant, controlling attitude in my
presence on more than one occasion.
I believe he had a personality
conflict with my son from the start.
SANDERS
Well, if you don't mind my asking,
sir, why did you let your son stay?
Francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly.
FRANCIS
It was his dream to go.
I could
hardly stand in the way of that,
could I?
Phil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode.
HEARING ROOM - LATER
It is Skipper's turn at the table.
SANDERS
Is it true that you forced Robin
Weathers to climb the mast when it
was clear that he was acrophobic.
SKIPPER
He climbed when he was ready.
SANDERS
Were you aware that his brother was
killed in a fall.
Chuck and the others look up astonished.
Mike shoots a
look towards Phil.
MIKE
He did it man.
He sang like a bird.
Skipper hesitates.
SKIPPER
Yes, I was.
Whispers fill the room.
SANDERS
Sir, were you aware at any time of
the use of alcohol among the crew.
SKIPPER
Yes, I was.
TYLER
And you didn't do anything about it?
SKIPPER
(beat)
No.
I didn't.
Again the crew members are struck.
Charlie turns to
Chuck.
CHARLIE
They're twisting it all around.
Why
doesn't he say something?
SANDERS
Had you ever seen a "White Squall"
before this incident?
SKIPPER
No.
SANDERS
What makes you so sure it was one?
SKIPPER
I can't be sure.
SANDERS
You really felt that your crew were
up for the conditions.
SKIPPER
We'd come twelve thousand miles
together, through every kind of seas
imaginable...
SANDERS
Except, a "White Squall".
(beat)
With all due respect Captain
Sheldrake, they're only boys...
SKIPPER
They are much more than that, sir.
SANDERS
Is it true that the reason you
expelled Philip Boutillier...
SKIPPER
(cutting him off)
For killing a dolphin.
SANDERS
... and that you invited him to
strike you?
To fight it out on the
deck of your ship?!
Skipper looks over at Francis.
Phil stares at the floor.
Skipper manages an ironic smile.
SKIPPER
Yes, that's true.
SANDERS
Do you think this is funny?
Some
kind of joke?
You lost six people
out there.
SKIPPER
(white hot)
I don't think one second of this is
funny, sir.
Skipper stares down Sanders.
He turns to Tyler.
SANDERS
I have no more questions at this
time.
He turns to sit down, then stops.
SANDERS
Oh, one last thing... Isn't true
that your father was a sea Captain?
Skipper bristles.
SKIPPER
Yes.
SANDERS
Isn't also true that his vessel went
down off of Nantucket?
Lost
everyone on board.
In fair weather
no less.
Skipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage.
Tyler
sees it and tries to intercept.
TYLER
What does this have to do with
anything Mr. Sanders?
SANDERS
(smug)
Oh, nothing.
I was just curious.
SKIPPER
My father, was more seaman, more of
a man, than you might ever hope to
be.
Sanders returns to his seat, rattled.
Tyler pounds his
gavel.
TYLER
We'll take a brief recess.
