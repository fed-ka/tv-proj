    a Cop heading down the hall.  Puzzled, Lois trails after him  (X)
    and comes upon STAR.  The Cop continues on to an open

                   You _do_ have an alibi for where
                   you were last night.

                                    LOIS
                   Alibi?  Why do I need an alibi?

                   That lady with the cop?  Michelle 
                   Sitkowitz's sister, Louise.  She 
                   lives cross town and the
                   Sitkowitz's were supposed to be at 
                   her place for poker last night.  
                   They play poker every Thursday...

                   _never_ _made_ _it_.

                                    LOIS
                   So?  Maybe they did something else
                   last night.

                                    STAR
                   Michelle and Louise are very close.
                   Michelle woulda called.  Anyway, 
                   Louise got worried, so she came 
                   over _here_ late last night.  The 
                   Sitkowitz's never came home.

    Stricken, he can only stare as a second tube is wheeled from 
    the shadows.  Arnold is wrestled into the tube, locked into 
    the braces, and a clear panel slid shut.  A blue mist begins 
    filling the tube.  Stepping into the foreground is a 
    silhouetted shape, just head and a shoulder.  Arnold 
    notices, stares, his eyes filling with utter astonishment.

                   Awww, this is where they slept.
                   Arnold probably sat in that
                   chair... Happy he came here.

                   Michelle sat at this desk... Scared 
                   of something and writing her sister 
                   about it.

    Lois stares at the desktop, runs her hand over it.

                   Look how soft the wood is, you can 
                   see imprints of... years of writing.
                        (an idea)
                   Clark... Think you could separate 
                   out Michelle's handwriting from all 
                   the others... Using your vision 
                   gizmo?

    She fishes the letter from her purse.

                   Lois, 'vision gizmo' doesn't sound
                   particularly... cool.  You know?

    But he lowers his glasses, stares first at Michelle's
    letter, then at the desk, and:

    Layers and layers of at first meaningless scribble jump and
    shimmer, turning from distinct forms to translucent grays
    until the inprint of Michelle's letter, starting "Dear
    Louise," is very distinct.

    The room is rustic, lodge-like, with huge bookcases on one 
    wall.  Appreciative chuckles from the couples seated all 
    around, cross-legged, on the floor.  Larry, in baseball cap, 
    is seated in an easy chair on a low platform, behind him is 
    the portrait.  Attendants move about the room, setting out
    refreshments, making name badges, etc.

                   Whoa!  Hear that?  The phone!

    The phone hasn't rung, but everyone assures Larry they heard 
    it: "oh yes!" "Loud and clear, Larry," etc.  Larry rushes 
    to the phone, answers it.

                                                      CUT TO:



    Lois, in one of Clark's t-shirts, lies in bed.

                                    LOIS
                   Scared to death.  I just mentioned 
                   the Sitkowitz's names, Kathy went 
                   white as a sheet.

    PAN TO Clark, in cut-off sweatshirt, draped between two 
    wicker chairs, looking miserable.

                                    CLARK
                   Well, I scanned the place, and no 
                   sign, no sound of 'em.  Either 
                   they're not here, or they're in a 
                   lead-lined room...

                                    LOIS
                        (soberly)
                   Or they're dead.

    Clark shifts, tries to get comfortable, leaps up in a frenzy 
    of blankets and pillows, points accusingly at the chairs.

                                    CLARK
                   This is not a bed!

                                    LOIS
                        (pleasantly)
                   No, this is a bed.

                                    CLARK
                   A... kind of large bed, actually.

                                    LOIS
                   And this is business.

                                    CLARK
                   Okay, fine.  You think I can't
                   handle this?  I can handle this.

    And he stretches out in thin air as if climbing into an 
    upper bunk.  Lois sits up, stares.  He puts his hands behind 
    his head, floating, comfy.

                                    LOIS
                        (flopping back)
                   Your life is so strange.

                                    CLARK
                   And getting stranger by the minute.
                        (facing her)
                   Lois, for me flying is a piece of 
                   cake.  I've been doing it since 
                   high school.  If I screw up, what's 
                   the worst that can happen?  Lose a 
                   little altitude?
                        (he demonstrates a bit of
                         drop)
                   But being in a relationship is new.
                   If I blow it with you... I lose
                   everything.

                                    LOIS
                        (softening)
                   Look, Clark... I'm actually not as
                   good at romance as I might look...

                                    CLARK
                        (stifles a smile)
                   Really?

                                    LOIS
                   I mean, my life's basically been 
                   about work.  So I'm trying to 
                   figure this out, just like you are.

    He smiles, floats a little nearer.

                                    CLARK
                   So we'll... help each other...

                                    LOIS
                   I know I don't always respond
                   appropriately...

                                    CLARK
                        (floating closer)
                   Hey, me neither...

                                    LOIS
                   ... I don't always know how to
                   express how I feel...

                                    CLARK
                        (floating closer)
                   ... I get so tongue tied sometimes!

    It's heating up; but before she completely thaws:

                                    LOIS
                   But I do know you broke my heart.

    He suddenly halts, mid-air, as she looks over at him.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   And you have to let me work that
                   through.  And not expect me to just
                   snap out of it.

    He floats back over by the chairs.

                                    CLARK
                        (softly)
                   I will.  And I don't.
                        (beat)
                   Good night, Lois.

                                    LOIS
                   'night, Clark.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


    Lois and Clark are both asleep. Clark floats by the open
    window.  A breeze WHISTLES through the trees, the curtains
    flutter.  It pushes Clark toward the bed until he is
    floating directly over Lois.  Clark turns in his sleep onto
    his stomach; he is now directly facing Lois.  She stirs in
    her sleep, her eyes open, she finds herself face-to-face
    with a floating man.

                                    LOIS
                   Aaaah!!!

    Clark wakes with a start.

                                    CLARK
                   Whaaaa....!!

    Startled, he falls out of the air and onto Lois.  Much
    thrashing of limbs and blankets as:

                                    LOIS
                   What're you doing?!

    A rock flies through the window, sends a lamp SMASHING to 
    the floor.  Lois screams again.

                                    CLARK

                   Well, there has to be a reason
                   Kathy wanted us to see it.
                        (shines light on books)
                   Which one do you think it came
                   from?

    Clark does an instant scan of the books.

                   None of 'em; they're all too new.              (X)

                                    LOIS
                   What next room?

    Clark gives a bookshelf a tug and it opens to reveal a small
    anteroom hidden on the other side.

    Lois and Clark step into the gloomy room which features a 
    collection of musty, ancient books and a desk stacked in 
    file folders and other papers.  Lois looks at the clutter 
    while Clark examines the books.

                                    LOIS
                   Smiley must work in here.  Look, 
                   these files are divided into piles 
                   marked 'rejected' and 'candidates.'
                   Candidates for what?
                        (looks closer)
                   Clark, we're in the 'rejected'
                   pile!

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, don't you think that's
                   probably a good thing?

                                    LOIS
                   But I like to at least feel wanted.

                   Smiley says we're not compatible!  
                   He says I don't trust you or 
                   respect you and doesn't know _why_
                   you put up with me... !

                   Of course I trust you!  I respect 
                   you more than anyone I ever met!
                   And if I get angry, it's just 
                   because I never opened up to anyone 
                   so totally in my whole life and I 
                   get hurt if I think that trust 
                   isn't returned!  And you put up 
                   with me for the same reason I put 
                   up with you..!  Because I love you 
                   completely!

    She's breathing hard, realizing all she's just said.

                        (emotionally)
                   Hello, Mama.

    Lois and Jimmy shrink back, scared.



    Lights are low. As Clark stares, Star begins rocking back
    and forth.  She swings her head back and forth, then          (X)
    suddenly it goes rigid and her eyes fly open.                 (X)

                                    STAR
                        (somber and dramatic)
                   I am the citizen Landicus,
                   philosopher and prophet.  Who
                   seeketh me?

                                    CLARK
                   Uh... I do.

                                    STAR
                        (as prophet)
                   Seeker, surely thou hast summoned
                   me because thou art a thinker and
                   prophet also, eager for an exchange
                   of thought and prophecy?

                                    CLARK
                   Well no, actually, I wanted you to
                   read this piece of paper.

    Star just looks at him, deadpan.



    They hurry back along the curtained platform, round a corner
    and stare at the storage area of plastic tubes in which have
    been placed several people, among them the Sitkowitz's.
    Lois and Jimmy stagger forward, moving through the tubes,
    when:

                                    JIMMY
                   Lois!

    She's stunned to see Perry White, suspended in his tube.

                                    SMILEY
                   Alright, look lively, folks!  Load
                   "em up!!

    The Attendants jump up.


61  LOIS AND JIMMY                                              61   

    Look at each other in fright as we hear APPROACHING FEET.

                                    LOIS
                   They're coming.

    He makes adjustments to his machine, and outside there is
    THUNDER and LIGHTNING.  Now he smiles as Attendants start
    wheeling tubes toward the ramp up to the arc. Suddenly:

                                    SMILEY
                   Hold it.

    Scowling, he approaches the tubes.

                                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
                   Here's a couple of 'Chosen Ones'               (X)
                   who didn't make the cut.                       (X)

    reveals Jimmy and Lois, "hiding" in plastic tubes.  They
    glance at each other.  Smiley opens a port in the tube and:

                                    SMILEY
                   Female Hawk, I distinctly recall
                   eliminatin' you from the New Dawn.

                                    LOIS
                   You're right.  Sorry. I'm really
                   not worthy.  Let's go, Jimmy.

                                    SMILEY
                   I can see I gotta do a little
                   better job of eliminatin'.



    Clark holds the scrap of paper before Star's face.

                   The language is ancient.  Aramaic.
                   It is a passage... from what you
                   call The Dead Sea Scrolls.
                        (reads)
                   'The end of all flesh is come
                   before me; for the earth is filled
                   with violence through them; and
                   behold, I will destroy them from
                   the earth.  They entered the ark,
                   male and female, and the Lord shut
                   them in...'

                                    CLARK
                   Isn't that the story of Noah and
                   the Ark?

                                    STAR

                        (with growing alarm)
                   Smiley's nabbing couples... 'Two               (X)
                   of every kind,' that guy said...               (X)
                   Oh man, he thinks he's Noah.

    Outside, a huge hit of THUNDER and LIGHTNING. Clark stares.


65  SMILEY                                                      65   

    Smiley holds a hand microphone.  He cranks a wheel on the 
    machine and the SOUND INTENSIFIES.

                                    SMILEY
                   This storm's the daddy of 'em all,
                   my friends!



    The Attendants have once again begun wheeling the tubes,
    which are now all clustered at the base of the ramp.  Smiley
    is looking joyfully about, when:

                                    SUPERMAN (O.S.)
                   Alright, Smiley.  Shut it off.


73  NEW ANGLE                                                   73   

    As Smiley spins, spots Superman hovering near the beam.       (X)

                                    SMILEY
                   You can't stop this!  This day has
                   been foretold!

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Only by you, Smiley.  And that's
                   not enough.

    Superman flies into the beam, forcing it back down toward
    the machine.  Smiley tries turning up the power and the       (X)
    NOISE INTENSIFIES, but Superman continues forcing the beam    (X)
    down into the device, which suddenly EXPLODES in a shower of
    sparks and smoke, its THROBBING SOUND winding down to a dull
    THUD.  Outside, the THUNDER and LIGHTNING ends.  Lois and
    Jimmy rush in from outside.

                                    SMILEY
                   Just brilliant!  You've ruined
                   everything!  That machine was the
                   source of all power in the New
                   Dawn!
                        (indicates tubes)
                   It was going to bring them back!               (X)
                   Now they'll all die!                           (X)

    He rushes to the foot of his mother's tube.

                                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
                        (emotionally)
                   Mama, forgive me.                              (X)

74  SUPERMAN, ROOM - VARIOUS ANGLES                             74   

    Superman pans his eyes from cylinder to cylinder, his HEAT
    VISION making each glow with a faint HISS.  The occupants of
    each tube slowly open their eyes, begin to stretch and move.
    Finally, we come to Perry White.

                                    PERRY
                        (groggy)
                   Olsen! Late edition get put to
                   bed?
                        (then)
                   Alice?  Honey?  You alright?  No,
                   don't try to talk...

    WIDEN to include Alice's tube, her face and part of her body
    hidden by a pile of crates.  One of her hands reaches out
    toward Perry, touches the side of her tube.  He smiles.


75  SMILEY                                                      75   

    He looks up to see his mother glaring down at him.

                                    CASSANDRA
                   Lawrence.  You've been a very                  (X)
                   naughty boy.

                                                      CUT TO:



    Superman and Lois float down to the window, step inside.
    She turns to face Superman, smiles shyly.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Smiley had pretty much given up on
                   people finding happiness together.
                   I haven't.  Have you?

                                    LOIS
                        (gently touches his face)
                   No.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   But we do seem to keep messing up.
                   Why is that?

                                    LOIS
                   Well, first of all, people mess up.
                   But I think adjusting to this whole
                   idea of marriage on top of...
                   everything else we're adjusting
                   to... is making us both a little
                   nuts.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   So...

                                    LOIS
                   So maybe we should just take a 
                   little break from the idea of 
                   marriage.  Not even say the 'M' 
                   word.  And just be in love.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I can do that.

                                    LOIS
                   It's a lot of pressure... That
                   'forever' thing...

                                    SUPERMAN

                   What?

                                    SUPERMAN
                   It's not the 'M' word that makes it
                   forever for me.
                        (beat)
                   My love's forever because... It
                   just is.

    She stares at him, swept away.  He kisses her and FLOATS off 
    into the night.

                                    LOIS
                   Wow.
