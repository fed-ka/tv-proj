  11EXT. BANGOR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY


  22INT. AIRPORT ARRIVALS/BAGGAGE AREA - DAY

          A SIGN reads "TRAVEL SMART.  FLY THROUGH BANGOR."  Tilting
          down to find a few LIMO DRIVERS all holding up cardboard
          signs for their respective clients.  One says "LEWIS,"
          and we REVEAL JOHNNY holding it, trying to keep a poker
          face as he sees BRUCE approaching, a small duffel slung
          over his shoulder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mister Lewis?  Mister Lewis?

          Bruce sees him, does a double-take.

                                        BRUCE
                        What the...?  John?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your limo awaits, sir.

                                        BRUCE
                        Right, my "limo."  More like a
                        busted-ass Jeep.
                                (smiles)
                        But I'll take it.

          They hug warmly, then move toward a LUGGAGE CONVEYOR to
          wait for Bruce's suitcase.


  2A2AEXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

          As Johnny and Bruce exit the terminal, Johnny's attention's 
          drawn to a MAN signing some autographs as a newspaper
            PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures and TWO REPORTERS take notes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who's that?

                                        BRUCE
                        Danny Avila, boxer who's fighting
                        Darryl Tibbs up here on Friday.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tibbs?  Isn't he the...?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - TEASER - 6/16/03 - BLUE-2  1A.

    2ACONTINUED: (2)2A

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, it's a regular Rocky story. 
                        This fight is his big shot.

          Avila sees Bruce and waves.  Bruce waves back and Avila
          starts toward them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know him?

                                        BRUCE
                          I helped Danny rehab his knee a
                        while back.  Nice guy.


          ANGLE ON DANNY AVILA

          He's a trim middle-weight in his late 30s.  He's trailed
          by his three-months-pregnant wife HELENA, 30, as well as
          the photographer and reporters.

                                        AVILA
                        Hey, man, long time, no see.

                                        BRUCE
                        In my business, that's a good
                        thing.
                                (they bump fists)

                                        AVILA
                        Honey, you remember Bruce Lewis...

                                        HELENA
                                (smiling)
                        Of course.

                                        AVILA*
                        Hey man, guess what, I'm going to*
                        be a dad...*

                                        BRUCE
                          Congratulations!*
                                (then to Helena)*
                          I thought you had a glow about*
                        you.  Danny, Helena, this is my*
                        friend, Johnny Smith.

          Johnny hangs back slightly, and has picked up one of
          Bruce's bags, avoiding a handshake.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice to meet you.

          One of the reporters notices Johnny and Avila together,
          and whispers to his photographer who lifts the camera --



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - TEASER - 6/16/03 - BLUE-2  2A.

                                        REPORTER
                        Hey Johnny, how 'bout a picture
                        with the contender?

          Johnny tries to back out, but the Reporter is already
          nudging Avila next to him, squeezing Bruce and Helena
          aside.

    2ACONTINUED: (4)2A

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...Look, I uh...

                                        REPORTER
                        C'mon, a coupla local heroes...
                        just take a sec...

          Avila shrugs, it's okay with him, and Johnny shoots Bruce
          a look, but he's trapped; it'd be rude not to oblige. 
          Avila steps beside him and Johnny smiles gamely as the
            photographer snaps a couple of shots.  Then:

                                        AVILA
                        Hey wait, get one like this.

          He playfully pretends to punch Johnny in the jaw.  Only
          on the light contact, we RAMP TO JOHNNY'S JAW and...


  33INT. LEWISTON ARENA - RING (VISION)

          A GLOVED FIST CONNECTS WITH AVILA'S JAW.  WHAM! 

          Then WIDER, dozens of cameras flashing now as DARRYL TIBBS,
            a powerfully built black fighter, bulls a bloodied Avila
          across the ring with punishing body blows, the thudding
          impacts all but overwhelmed by the roar of a crowd brought
          to its feet by the sense that a knock-out is imminent. 
          Avila defends but A FINAL COMBINATION catches him flat-
          footed:  a series of blows ending with a haymaker that
          sends him falling, suddenly in SLOW-MO, out of frame --
            REVEALING JOHNNY standing in the ring, watching.


  44CLOSE ANGLE ON AVILA - STILL IN SLOW-MO

          as he hits the canvas, bounces slightly then lies there,
          his muscles slack, eyes staring open dully, lifelessly.


  55BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny's still in his post-vision fog as Avila moves off
          with his wife, calling back to Bruce.

                                        AVILA
                        Gotta run.  Come see the fight.

                                        BRUCE
                        You bet.  Take care of that knee.

          Johnny eyes Avila as he walks off, press trailing, along
          with a few more autograph seekers.  Then quietly to Bruce:



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - TEASER - 6/12/03 - YELLOW  4.


    5CONTINUED:5

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's gonna get killed.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's a long shot, but I wouldn't
                        go that far.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I just did.  He's going to
                        die in that fight.

          And as Bruce turns to look at him...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  7A7AEXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  7B7BINT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          STARTING CLOSE ON A BANGOR DAILY NEWS in Bruce's hands. 
          The front page has a photo of Johnny and Avila with the
          teasing head:  "Johnny Sees Bright Future for Local Boxer."

                                        BRUCE
                                (reading)
                        "Johnny Sees Bright Future for
                        Local Boxer."
                                (then)
                        "Bright Future"?  Man, how can
                        they just make up stuff like that?

          They're headed for the front door, Johnny gathering his
          car keys, anxious to get going.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't want this to turn into
                        another media circus.  We've gotta
                        handle this quietly, give Avila a
                        chance to hear us out in private. 
                        It could help that he knows you.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, I know him all right.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        I know he's been fighting a long
                        time and this is his first title
                        shot.  It's a big deal for him,
                        John.  He's not gonna like hearing
                        what we've got to say.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He doesn't have to like it, just
                        believe it.

          And they're out the door...


  88INT. BOXING GYM - DAY - STARTING CLOSE ON A BOXER'S FISTS

          buzzing a speed bag, the sound melding with HIP HOP music
          from a boom box.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT ONE - 6/13/03 - GREEN  6.


    8CONTINUED:8

          Then more quick CLOSE-UPS:  a boxer's feet lightly skipping
          rope; another boxer's gloves pounding a heavy bag; then
          glimpses of Avila's determined eyes, visible through his
          headgear as he trades blows with a heavier black SPARRING
          PARTNER (CARL), all the sounds adding up to a timeless
          rhythmic symphony.

          Cutting away to a battered TIMEX with a broken band. 
          It's being used as a stopwatch by Avila's trainer, VIC
          MURPHY, a wizened Irish ex-pug in his 70s.


  99WIDER - WITH JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          as they enter, take in the rough-hewn gym.  SEVERAL YOUNG
            FIGHTERS, Latinos mostly, train in the open area in front,
          where HEAVY BAGS dangle, one of them firing punches at
          the target mitts held up by a beefy black assistant
          trainer.  Bruce sees Avila sparring in the RING in back,
          nods to Johnny and they start toward him.  Vic sees them
          coming, reacts with annoyance.

                                        VIC
                        Time.
                                (moving to intercept)
                        Sorry, guys, no press allowed the
                        week of the fight.

                                        BRUCE
                        We're not press, we're friends of
                          Danny's.

                                        VIC
                        Yeah, you're all friends of
                          Danny's.  Now I'm asking you nice --

                                        AVILA (O.S.)
                        Yo, Vic, it's okay.  I know 'em.

          He's leaning on the ropes... indicates Bruce.

                                        AVILA
                        That's Bruce Lewis, did the P.T.
                        on my knee.  And the dude with
                        the cane there is Johnny Smith,
                        man who predicted my very "bright
                          future."

                                        VIC
                        Right, the "psychic."

          And if Avila sounds like he's already taken the rosy
          prediction to heart, Vic sounds like it irritates and
          worries him.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT ONE - 6/13/03 - GREEN  7.

          But he lets Johnny and Bruce follow him back to the ring.                               

                                        VIC
                        Okay, take ten minutes.  But then
                        I want you to work his body like
                        I been telling you.

          As the fighters climb down, Avila grabbing a towel and
          Carl heading for a water cooler...

                                        AVILA
                        Tibbs wants to bang, I'll bang.

                        Sure, you can punch, but you go
                        for the head against a headhunter,
                        guess whose ass winds up in the
                        pot?  Remember what I told you
                        from the beginning, chop the...

                        "Chop the trunk and the branches
                        will fall."  Yeah, I remember,
                        Vic.  I remember everything you
                        tell me.  But right now I wanna
                        hear from Johnny here.

          He turns to Johnny, throws some playful mock punches.

                                        AVILA
                        Just tell me when he's going down,
                        man.  I'll do the rest.

          Johnny glances around at the other fighters, all of whom
          seem to have one ear cocked as they continue training.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can we talk in private?

                                        AVILA
                        Yeah, sure.  Step into my office.

          He leads them around to the back of the ring.  Vic follows,
          still eyeing Johnny uneasily.

                        No, I did, actually, but... um...

                        Danny, to be honest, I didn't see
                        you winning.  In fact, I saw you
                        getting hurt, badly hurt.

                        No.  I want to understand him.

                                (beat)
                        I saw Darryl Tibbs hitting you...
                        I saw you fall... and then I saw
                        you lying in the ring.
                                (beat)
                        You were dead, Danny.

          And there it is.  Avila stares at him like he can't quite
          process it; instead he just disbelievingly repeats...

                        Okay, who sent you?

          And he jabs Johnny with his index finger, sparking --

          Pulling back to find Johnny watching from ringside, behind
          a seated row of sportswriters and JUDGES.  The chaotic
          scene FREEZES.  Looking for clues as to when or how this
          will happen, Johnny focuses on the nearest judge's --


            SCORECARD

          It's for the twelfth and final round (and so far it's

                        Is it worth your life?

          But Avila just gives Bruce a disgusted, betrayed look,
          then walks away as the other fighters gather around
          menacingly.  Vic's voice is now ice cold with fury.

          Johnny and Bruce, realizing it's hopeless, start moving
          toward the door.  As they exit, Johnny and Avila exchange
          a final look.


  1212INT. JOHNNY'S JEEP - MOMENTS LATER

          As the doors slam shut and both men just sit for a moment.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, I guess that could've gone
                        better.

                        I'm not giving up yet.  There
                        must be somebody who can stop
                        this fight.

          And as Bruce considers this too...

          seen earlier in Johnny's vision, eyes Johnny and Bruce.

                                        JENKINS
                        Not that it matters.  This
                        commission isn't about to overlook
                          a concern about a fighter, no
                        matter what the source.

                        This isn't just a "concern," sir.

                                        JENKINS
                        Yes, I understand it may seem
                        very real to you.  But you should
                          understand, there are limits to
                        what we can do based on... this

                        Avila may be an underdog, but you
                        can't claim it's a total
                          mismatch... He's passed all his

                        you can do.

          And as Jenkins and Kowalski share a look, the door bursts
          open and boxing promoter JIMMY D, 40 -- a man whose
          flamboyance masks a ruthless obsession with the bottom
          line -- enters trailed by a young assistant, ANDREW.

                        Well, well, looks like my sources
                        were correct.  Closed door

                        we have proof of conspiracy.

          And as Andrew whips out a tiny digital camera and takes a
          picture of the flabbergasted foursome...

                                        JENKINS
                          Conspiracy?  I assure you, Mister

                        Thank you.  And please don't have

                        Which are ridiculous on their

          A moment of silence follows as Jimmy D, normally the

                        He's saying Darryl's going to kill
                        the sorry son-of-a-bitch?

                        Now of course this is highly
                          unusual, but I suppose we can
                        require additional medical tests...
                        maybe even an MRI...

                        I'm afraid it's the best we can
                        do.  We can't just stop a fight
                        based on a psychic's "vision."

                                        JIMMY D
                        That doesn't mean we can just
                        ignore this kind of information.

          And now the others react as Jimmy D does an about-face
          and drops his act, his concern seeming very genuine.

                                        JIMMY D
                        Mister Smith, I apologize.  I'm a
                          businessman and I thought you
                        were playing some kind of angle
                        here, trying to hurt Darryl
                          somehow.  But if you're sincere...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir, if we don't stop this fight,
                        a man's going to die.  And that
                        will be a tragedy for Darryl Tibbs
                        as well as for Danny Avila.

                                        JIMMY D
                        Then I guess we'll have to make
                        sure that doesn't happen.  Which
                        means, if you'll excuse us for a
                        few minutes, these gentlemen and
                        I will have to seriously reconsider
                        our options.

          As Jenkins and Kowalski react, Johnny and Bruce exchange
            guardedly relieved looks on their way out...

                        Mister D has called a press
                        conference for nine a.m. tomorow
                        morning and he'd like you to
                        attend, Mister Smith.  You are
                        available, aren't you?

                          Absolutely.  They're calling off
                        the fight?

                        don't be late.

          Andrew leads Johnny and Bruce through a mob of press into

          already underway, Jimmy D holding forth, seated between
          Avila and a glowering Tibbs, who in turn are flanked by
          their trainers, all facing a mob of press.

                        But now, information has come to
                        light which threatens this historic
                        bout.

          A knot is forming in Johnny's gut.

                        That's right, Mister Smith, I see
                        you lurking there in the shadows,
                        like some prophet of doom and
                        gloom afraid to face the light. 
                        But I'm sorry to disappoint you
                        and say that your dire prediction

                          Prediction?  What's he saying?

          And as Johnny realizes he's been set-up, the photographers
          and TV cameramen are already swinging their lenses around.

                                        JIMMY D
                        That's right, Maine's very own
                        Johnny Smith has made a psychic
                        prediction that Danny Avila will
                        not only lose the bout on Friday,
                        but will lose his life.  Does
                        that prospect frighten you, Mister
                        Avila?

                        ...and I'm gonna make it come

                        And how about you, Mister Tibbs?

                        I'm gonna put him down, and I'm
                        gonna put him down hard.  He ain't
                        dead, he's gonna wish he was.

                        Whoo!  There you go, folks, call
                        it a grudge match, or call it a
                        death match, but whatever you
                        call it, don't miss Friday night's
                        fight, 'cause you're gonna wanna
                        see how this one ends.

            Meanwhile reporters are mobbing a stunned Johnny.  "Is it
          true, Johnny?", "What'd you see?"  etc.  Bruce pulls Johnny
          away, elbowing his way through the mob of press.

                          skyrocketing, along with ticket

                          Danny... I didn't expect to see

                        Nice crib.  Guess being a psychic
                        must pay pretty good.

                          Actually, my last paying job was
                        as a teacher.  This was my parents'
                          house... it still is, I suppose...
                        it's held in a trust.

          And Johnny's admitting this partly out of awkwardness,
          but also because he can feel Avila's suspicion and doesn't
          want to give him any grounds to distrust him.

                        this up for me?  You got any idea
                        what this fight could mean?  For
                        me?  For my family?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You mean money?

                                        AVILA
                        Screw the money.  This is a title
                        fight.  A championship fight.  I
                        worked for this!  You understand
                        that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not trying to hurt your career,
                        I'm trying to save your life.

                                        AVILA
                        This is my life, and you're gonna
                        stop messing with it!

          And Johnny eyes him, realizing Avila's deeper concern.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why?  Because you're starting to
                        believe me?

          And now he's really hit a nerve, Avila's anger ratcheting.

                                        AVILA
                        You hear what I just said?!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Were you hoping I'd admit it was
                        just a lie, a scam, a curse I can
                        take back?

                                        AVILA
                        I'm telling you to shut up!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because I can't take it back...

          And now with a shout of rage and frustration, Avila grabs
          Johnny and throws him up against the stairwell.           DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT TWO - 6/12/03 - YELLOW  20.


    2121SUDDENLY - (IN A VISION)

          THE BANISTER SUPPORTS BECOME ROPES, AND NOW JOHNNY'S BEING
          HELD AGAINST THE RING APRON IN...


          INT. ARENA - NIGHT (VISION - CONTINUOUS)

          On the other side of the ropes, Doc Kowalski and Vic Murphy
          are trying to revive the dead future Avila as Tibbs prances
          around the ring, arms raised, and the crowd roars.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...just like I can't stop what
                        I'm seeing... what I'm seeing
                        right now...

                                        AVILA
                                (pulling back a fist)
                        Shut up!  Just shut the hell up! 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're lying on the canvas.  Vic's
                        trying to revive you but he can't,
                        because you're already dead.


  2222IN THE STAIRWELL

          Avila can't resist glancing through the banister supports,
            imagining the grim scene that Johnny's describing.  Then,
          even angrier, he turns back, ready to throw that punch...


  2323INT. ARENA

          More people entering the ring now...  PARAMEDICS
            administering CPR... but it's clearly hopeless...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You want to change the future? 
                        You want to live?  Then quit. 
                        Walk away.

          And somehow these words defuse Avila's anger, leaving
          disgust instead.  He releases Johnny and the VISION ENDS.

          Bruce and Johnny approach a bench in some T.B.D. scenic
          locale.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure this is the spot?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're early.

                                        BRUCE
                        Next question:  Why are we here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because it occurred to me -- while
                        Danny Avila was pinning my head against
                        my stairwell -- that maybe we're going
                        about this the wrong way.  If we can't
                        stop the fight, maybe we can arrange
                          a different ending.

          Bruce senses where he's going.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're thinking of trying to use
                        your abilities to help him win?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd settle for helping him
                          survive.  But I can't help him if
                        I can't get near him.

                        He won't talk to me anymore and
                        his trainer's already thrown us
                        out of his gym.  Which is why we
                        need somebody who can talk to
                        him, somebody he trusts.

          And he turns as we see Helena Avila walking toward them,
          carrying a store-bought lunch, wearing a wary expression.


  2828EXT. CITY PARK - LATER

          Tracking in front of Johnny, Bruce and Helena as they
          walk along, Johnny finishing up his story, Helena pensive,
            fingering A SMALL CRUCIFIX PENDANT.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it must be hard to
                        believe... hard for anyone to
                        believe...

                                        HELENA
                        No, it's not.
                                (eyeing Johnny)
                        I think things happen to people
                        for a reason.  Things like your
                          accident.  Like your meeting Danny.
                                (beat, forthright)
                        To me you are an angel, Mister
                        Smith, sent to protect my husband.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think he'd probably disagree
                        with you.

                                        HELENA
                        You have to understand boxers. 
                        They think if they admit their
                        fear, they're finished.  But I
                        know my husband, and he is afraid.

                                        BRUCE
                        Anyone would be afraid of dying.

                                        HELENA
                        Maybe it's that, or maybe it's
                          something that scares him just as
                        much.  Failure... the end of his
                        hopes and dreams... I don't know. 
                        What I do know is he'll never
                        quit.

                        change the future.  Your husband's

          We approach the back, where Avila's hitting Tyrell's target

                        What the hell you doing bringing

                        to help.

                                        VIC
                        Yeah.  Help him into a coffin.

                                        HELENA
                                (strong)
                        That's not true.
                                (to Avila, re: Johnny)
                        I want you to listen to what he
                        has to say.
                                (he's about to object)
                        Please, Danny.  If not for
                          yourself, then for me.

          Avila shakes his head... eyes Johnny skeptically.

                                        AVILA
                          I already told you, I ain't

                        By using my abilities... to guide

                                (to Helena)
                        Okay, I listened.  Now get him
                        out.

          But now Bruce quickly steps forward.

                                        BRUCE
                        You watched Tibbs' fight tapes,
                        didn't you?

          Avila shrugs.  Vic eyes Bruce guardedly.

                                        VIC
                        Sure, we always watch tapes to
                        see what a guy does.

                                        BRUCE
                        You mean to see what he did.  In
                        the past.  Well what if Johnny
                        could show you "fight tapes" from
                        the future so you can see what
                        Tibbs is gonna do, in that ring,
                        Friday night?

          Avila's grudgingly impressed; he hadn't considered the
            ramifications of Johnny's putative powers.  He eyes him.

                                        AVILA
                        Okay, say I'm just assuming you're
                        not entirely full of it, you can
                        really do that?

          And Johnny glances at Bruce, who may just have oversold
          his abilities, but he hides his uncertainty and nods.

                          Possibly.  You need every edge
                        you can get and I can be that

                                        BRUCE
                        Trust him, Danny.  I've seen him
                        do amazing things.

          And Avila's not quite ready to trust him, but then his
          skepticism is also competing with his fear, and his hope. 
          He glances at Vic, who's similarly conflicted, protective
          of his fighter but also superstitious.  He shrugs.

                                        VIC
                        We got three days left.  This is
                        all about your head now.  It's
                        your fight kid.

          A beat, then Avila takes a couple of steps closer to
          Johnny, looks him in the eye.

                                        AVILA
                        You know there's no second place
                        here.  You're on my team, you
                        fight to win, just like me.  You
                        down with that?

          A beat, then Johnny nods.  Avila holds out his taped hand,
          but as Johnny takes it, we RAMP TO HIS FACE.


  3030INT. ARENA RING - EXTREME ON AVILA'S GLASSY EYES (VISION)

          As we pull up, revealing Avila lying dead on the canvas,
          Vic and the Doctor beside him.  And now Johnny's there
          too, wearing an Avila team jacket, no longer an observer
          but part of this grim scene.

          Then we continue pulling up until their figures become
          tiny and insignificant, framed in the slowly rotating
          square of the ring.  THE VISION ENDS.


  3131RESUME ON JOHNNY

          still holding Avila's hand and forcing a smile, never
          feeling more like the Grim Reaper come to visit as he says:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  I'm down with that.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

  3232INT. ARENA - RING - NIGHT (VISION)

          Once again it's the twelfth round and the crowd ROARS as
          Tibbs bulls Avila across the ring with a series of
            punishing body blows, then slams that first left hook
          into his already battered face, the force of the blow
          closing Avila's eyes (which will be significant later)
          and sending droplets of sweat and blood -- the latter
          from a cut over Avila's right eye -- flying.  Only now -- 


          THE ENTIRE SCENE FREEZES

          And we WIDEN to show Johnny walking into frame (sans cane)
          as he studies the fighters.  He moves closer, observes
          Avila's cut, and the droplets of sweat and blood NOW
            SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR.  Then he turns to Tibbs, runs a
          hand along the man's hooking punching arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A left hook.  That's how it starts.

                                                                                SMASH TO:


  3333TIGHT ON JOHNNY'S LEFT HAND GRIPPING AVILA'S RIGHT WRIST

          as they face each other, and as we tilt up we see that
          Avila looks a little unnerved.  They're standing in --


          INT. AVILA'S GYM - PRACTICE RING - DAY

          Vic and Tyrell observing from outside the ropes, Bruce
          beside them.  In the b.g., some of the other fighters
          have stopped training to watch the odd scene as well. 
          Vic's expression is decidedly skeptical.

                                        VIC
                        That's how what starts?


  3434INT. ARENA - RING (VISION) 

          Johnny's still eyeing the two frozen fighters. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That last combination... in the
                        twelfth round.  It's always the
                        same.          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT THREE - 6/12/03 - YELLOW  28.


  3535INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS

          Vic and Tyrell exchange looks.  Vic decides to go along
          with this for now and challenges Johnny.

                                        VIC
                        Okay, a left hook.  Then what?


  3636INT. ARENA RING (VISION)

          The CROWD ROAR RESUMING as Tibbs throws a second punch --
          a straight right that rotates his body into a southpaw
          stance -- and once again the ACTION FREEZES at the moment
          of impact.  Johnny steps alongside Tibbs' frozen figure,
          starts to repeat the punch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A right... a straight right, I'd
                        guess you'd call it...


  3737INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS

          As Johnny now rotates his body, pulling Avila toward him
          with his left hand, while his right fist stops just short
          of his jaw.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only he rotates his body as he
                        throws it... like this.

          And Avila finds himself staring into Johnny's eyes, eyes
          that clearly aren't even seeing him, and he's spooked.

                                        VIC (O.S.)
                          A "Fitzsimmons Shift."

          And Avila and the others turn to Vic, who's now eyeing
          Johnny with surprise, this last move provoking a memory,
          which in turn prompts the boxing historian in him.

                                        VIC
                        Bob "Ruby Robert" Fitzsimmons,
                        first triple world champ.  He'd
                        use his right to switch to a
                          southpaw stance, then throw a big
                        left hook to the solar plexus. 
                          Devastating.

          He's engaged now, or at least curious.

                                        VIC
                        All right, what's he throw next?

          And again Johnny turns to the fight only he can see as...          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT THREE - 6/16/03 - GOLD  29.


  3838INT. ARENA - THE FIGHT RESUMES

          But just for a moment as Tibbs again freezes as he indeed
          connects with a big left hook to Avila's body.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, it's a left to the body...

          And now the fight resumes, in a sort of STOP-MOTION, Johnny
            narrating as each punch lands, briefly freezing the
            action... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then another right, an uppercut...
                        Then a left hook to the head...

          Once again the final haymaker sends Avila crashing to the
          canvas like a felled tree.  Camera follows him, then pulls
          back and up to a CLOSE-UP of Johnny looking down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That last left hook blind-sides
                        you on the temple.

          As camera now PANS TO:


  3939INT. PRACTICE RING - AVILA'S UNSETTLED FACE

          As he also looks down, seeing only empty canvas but now
            imagining the rest.  He winces as he feels --


          JOHNNY'S HAND

          now gripping his wrist so hard it's shaking.  Unnerved,
          Avila jerks his wrist away, and Johnny reacts as he comes
          out of the vision.

          VIC is now considering it all thoughtfully.

                                        VIC
                          Assuming this ain't just a circus
                        act, it's the shift that sets it
                        all up.  I ain't seen a guy use
                        it for years...
                                (beat)
                        ...but I know Tibbs' trainer, and
                        he's the kinda guy who might just
                        dust it off, see if they catch us
                          napping.

          He eyes Johnny, reappraising him, then:





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT THREE - 6/16/03 - GOLD  30.

                                        VIC
                        Mister Smith, you can step out of
                        the ring...

          Then he turns to Avila's sparring partner, Carl.

                                        VIC
                        Carl, get your ass in there, we've
                        got work to do.


  4040INT. GYM - LATER - CLOSE ON VIC'S BATTERED TIMEX

          The second hand sweeping past the 12, then revealing Vic,
          glancing down at it as he watches Avila and Carl sparring
          in the ring.  Avila isn't throwing any punches, just
          blocking as Carl whales on him, Vic egging him on.

                                        VIC
                        That's it, beat on him like you
                        just found him screwin' your wife.
                                (to Avila)
                          Remember, kid, this happens, it's
                        gonna be after twelve long rounds
                        with the toughest middleweight
                        out there.
                                (glances at his watch
                                  again, then)
                        Now!

          And Carl throws the COMBO, tagging Avila with a left and
          a straight right, shifting his stance, then throwing the
          left to the solar plexus that follows the shift.  Avila
          drops his gloves in response to the body blow, leaving
          himself open for the right uppercut and left hook to the
          head, knocking him back on the ropes.  As Avila shakes it
          off and dances away, we find --


          BRUCE AND JOHNNY

          watching from ringside as Vic now offers some reassurance
          and advice.

                                        VIC
                        That's okay, that's okay. 
                          Remember: When you see the shift
                        you drop your right -- the right
                        elbow -- and block that body shot
                        'cause that's the killer.  Then
                        you've got to get you gloves back
                        up before that uppercut or you'll
                        be wide open for the left hook. 
                        Got it?
                                        (MORE)

                                        VIC (CONT'D)
                                (Avila nods)
                        Then do it.


  4141TIME CUT - NEW ANGLE

          Avila and Carl sparring again, Avila getting tired.

                                        VIC
                        Now!

          Once again, Carl nails him with the right.  But this time
          after the "shift," Avila drops his elbow, neatly blocking
          the left hook to the body, then jabs with his other hand
          to get clear.  He smiles through his mouthpiece at Vic.

                                        AVILA
                        Piece of cake, Vic.

          Johnny and Bruce exchange encouraged looks, but Vic's not
          satisfied.

                                        VIC
                        Sure, when you know it's coming.
                                (to Carl)
                        This time, you pick the moment.

          Carl nods, and the two men resume sparring.  As Johnny
          and Bruce continue to watch, Carl throws the combo again,
          and once again Avila blocks it, lowering his elbow to
          block the body blow, then getting his glove back up in
          time to deflect the left hook to the head.

                                        AVILA
                        Like I said, I can handle it.

                                        VIC
                        You're still late getting that
                        glove back up after dropping the
                        elbow.  When Tibbs throws this
                        combo at you, it's going to be
                        like trying to catch a bullet
                        with your teeth -- any doubt, the
                          slightest hesitation and your
                        dead.

          Avila exchanges a determined look with Johnny, then...


  41A41AINT. AVILA'S GYM - AVILA'S LEFT THUDS INTO A HEAVY BAG
            (FORMERLY SCENE 48)

          Pulling back to show Vic stopping him to again demonstrate

    41ACONTINUED:41A

          the elbow drop, then the follow-up defensive jab, Johnny
          and Bruce watching, as we begin a --


    41B41BTRAINING MONTAGE (FORMERLY SCENE 49)

          Series of shots of Avila being run through exercises
          designed to break down the combination into its component
          parts, then defend against those parts.

          A CLOSE ANGLE highlights AVILA'S FEET, as he's taught to
          shift his weight back in response to the Fitzsimmons shift.

          Vic demonstrates how to anticipate the move, drawing a
          line of sight from Danny's eyes to his own hips as he
          rotates them to deliver the right.

          Another angle shows Avila dropping his right elbow,
            absorbing the follow-up left with increasing success.

          A flurry of left hooks to the head, Avila doing a better
          job blocking them with each successive punch.

          Johnny and Bruce both participate as well, Bruce assisting
          by holding a heavy bag, and Johnny again demonstrating
          some of the punches he saw in his vision: a hook followed
          by an upper cut, etc.  The sequence culminates in --


          THE PRACTICE RING

          as Avila now consistently defends against Carl's attack,
          Johnny and Bruce standing with Vic watching, all of them
          encouraged.

                                        VIC
                        That's it kid.  Thought and action
                        become one thing.  No hesitation,
                        that's the key.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'd say he's got it licked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure hope you're right.

          But he sounds more hopeful than convinced...


  41C41CINT. AVILA'S GYM - LATER (FORMERLY SCENE 50)

          The rest of the boxers are long gone.  Johnny and Bruce
          watch Vic gesturing to Avila as he reviews some moves. 
          Avila nods dutifully, wiping his face with a towel.

          As they approach, they catch the end of a Vic pep talk.

                                        VIC
                        Okay, weigh-in's tomorrow, so go
                        home, rest up and think happy
                          thoughts about killing the bastard.
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        You satisfied?

          Johnny smiles, then nods to Avila.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You looked good, man.

                                        AVILA
                        I feel good... I'm ready...

          Avila picks up on Johnny's concern.

                                        AVILA
                        What's the matter, you don't
                        believe me?  Go ahead, see for
                          yourself...

          Avila raises a fist up to Johnny, who hesitates to touch
          it.  Bruce and Vic watch, all of them afraid of what Johnny
          might see.

                                        VIC
                        You're ready kid.  You said so
                          yourself.  Leave it at that.

                                        AVILA
                        I'm not afraid.  Not anymore.

          Avila reaches out, his fist gently connecting with Johnny's
          chin, triggering...

          too, and the sight is at once weird and almost comic; a

          As DARRYL TIBBS' GLOVED FISTS smash into a sparring
            partner's headgear and exposed face.  Tibbs continues the
          savage assault until the man falls, one arm tangled in
          the ropes.  It's an intimidating performance, especially
          since it's just a rehearsal for the bout to come.

                                        TIBBS
                        Get up, bitch!  Get your ass up!

          The other fighter weakly waves him off.  Tibbs fumes,
          calls out to his TRAINER as the groggy man is helped down.

                        who can hit.

          The Trainer gestures to another fighter, who approaches
          with a touch of trepidation.  (NOTE:  This gym is a
          spiffier redress of Avila's, the staff more neatly garbed
          and better equipped.  Tibbs' trainer uses a DIGITAL
            STOPWATCH as opposed to Vic's strapless Timex.)

                        Yo, Jimmy.

          He's leaning over the ropes, gesturing Jimmy over.  Jimmy
          tosses his cell to Andrew as he backs toward him.

                        Just got a call from one of my
                        "contacts" in the Avila camp.
                        Seems our friend Mister Smith is
                          sleeping with the enemy.  They
                        must really be running scared if

                          I checked with the lawyers and
                        there's no problem.  So you just

          Tibbs nods, reassured, then pounds his gloves together

                        No it isn't. I've made a self-
                        fulfilling prophecy.  You heard
                        his trainer.  One bit of doubt,
                        one bit of hesitation and he's
                        dead.  And who planted that doubt

                          believes in me... in my
                          prediction... more than he believes
                        in himself...
                                (an idea forming)
                        ...So if this is a self-fulfilling
                          prophecy -- maybe it's the prophecy
                        that needs to change.

                        You mean lie to him about what

                        he's going to win?

          And it's apparent this doesn't sit too well with him, but
          Johnny doesn't see another choice.

                        Maybe believing in a lie is better
                        than knowing the truth.

          WIDENING TO REVEAL

          Johnny and Bruce standing at the edge of a crowd of press
          gathered in front of the ring and empty arena seats. 
          Tibbs is here too, naturally, along with officials
            including Kowalksi and Jenkins; Vic, Jimmy D and Tibbs'
          trainer; plus cops and security personnel.

          JIMMY D catches Johnny's eye and smiles.  Johnny smiles
          back, then turns to watch...

          TIBBS takes off his robe, then deliberately bumps Avila
          as he steps off the scale.

                                        TIBBS
                        Watch where you're going, bitch.
                                (when Avila glares)
                        Yeah, you bad.  Better get measured
                        for your box, 'cause I'm gonna
                        put you in it.

          Avila tenses.  Vic puts a hand on his shoulder.

                        Save it for the ring.

          But Tibbs, intent on provoking him, overhears this and
          turns it into even more incendiary fodder.

                                        TIBBS
                        I'm gonna save it for your wife,
                        'cause I know she's gonna need
                        consoling.

          And that does it.  Avila goes after him and a MELEE ensues
          as both men are barely held away from each other.

          JOHNNY has been watching this and now, with a glance at
          Bruce, he charges into the middle of the fracas and puts
          his hands on both fighters as he tries to keep them apart.

          But he can't get to him through the crowd, though his

                        No... Tibbs.  Darryl Tibbs.

          And as the reporters scribble notes, we see Jimmy D
          reacting -- is this real or what?  He tries to regain
          control of the situation...

          But he's drowned out by the flurry of questions shouted
          at Johnny.

          And then we see Johnny's true target audience:  Danny
          Avila.  He looks stunned, reacting to this surprising
          turn, not sure at first what to make of it, but we can
          see it already working on him as we:

          A PAIR OF PARAMEDICS roll a medical gurney down an aisle,
          accompanied by TWO DOCTORS in white coats, carrying medical
          bags.  PULLING BACK to find a TV CAMERA panning to follow
          them as they go by as we hear:

                                        JOE TESSITORE (V.O.)
                        Two teams of paramedics, plus
                          Boston's top cardiologist and
                          neurosurgeon...

            REVEALING Jimmy D being interviewed by ESPN2 COMMENTATORS
          JOE TESSITORE and TEDDY ATLAS while ANOTHER TV CAMERA
          films them.  The ring can be seen behind them, along with
            a boisterous crowd filling the arena.

                                        TESSITORE (CONT'D)
                          ...isn't that going a little
                        overboard, Jimmy?

                        Well, I admit the gentleman's
                            prognostications have proven a
                        tad capricious, but I'm not about
                        to risk the health of either of
                        these two brave gladiators.

                        Any "prognostications" of your
                        own, Jimmy?

                        Only that I think we're in for
                        one hell of a scrap.  And now if
                        you'll excuse me, I'm gonna wish
                        my fighter good luck.

  6464INT. AVILA'S DRESSING ROOM

          Where a JUDGE finishes signing one of Avila's hand wraps
          while Vic smears VASELINE on Avila's scarred brows.  Vic,
          Johnny, Bruce and Helena look on, Johnny glancing at the
            assistant trainer, who's somberly assembling his BAG OF
          CUT MEDICATION.

                                        VIC
                          Remember to keep your right up,
                        or you'll end up as ugly as me.

                        You mean as handsome, don't you?

          Avila throws a fast combo as the Judge exits.

                                        AVILA
                        Man, I can't wait to get it on.
                                (to Johnny)
                        So'd you see how it's gonna happen?

          Johnny smiles, encouraged by Avila's upbeat attitude.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just saw him going down, but

                        him there.

          Avila begins shadowboxing, throwing hooks and combos.

                                        AVILA

          Rattled but maintaining his composure as Helena exits,
          only Bruce noticing his unease.

                                        AVILA
                        Hey Vic, we got jackets for these

                        On the table.

          Avila grabs two TEAM JACKETS with his name emblazoned on
          them and hands them to Bruce and Johnny.

                                        AVILA
                        You're in my corner, you gotta
                        look sharp.

                                        BRUCE
                        Thanks.

          But as Johnny accepts his, we RAMP TO HIS FACE AGAIN.

          WEARING THE TEAM JACKET AND FACING THE O.S. RING, AS HE
          REACTS TO SOMETHING AWFUL, HIS EYES CLOSING


  6868RESUME

          Johnny now hanging onto that smile for dear life as he
          sets the jacket down, and this time Avila's eyes narrow. 
          A beat, then he speaks with deliberate casualness.

                                        AVILA
                        Hey, how about everyone give me a
                        minute with my medicine man here?

          Vic eyes Johnny suspiciously, but nods.

                                        VIC
                        Keep warmin' up.

          Avila nods and smiles obligingly as Vic and the others
          file out, Bruce glancing back worriedly at Johnny.

          But when the door closes, Avila's expression changes.

                                        AVILA
                        It's all a crock, ain't it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        AVILA
                        You didn't see me taking him down. 
                        You still think I'm gonna die in
                        that ring.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Danny, I told you what I saw.

                                        AVILA
                        Yeah?  Well, tell me again.  'Cause
                        I want to know what you see right
                        now.

          And he holds out his taped hands.  And now realizing he
          has no choice, Johnny reaches out and grips them.  And as
          he does, camera spins around them and they become Avila
          and Tibbs locked in combat as Johnny experiences --

          Tibbs hitting Avila with the combination punches; Avila
          falling, hitting the canvas.  -- Then Avila dead, eyes
          open.

          As Johnny releases Avila's hands and now puts on his best
          poker face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's just like I said.  You hit
                        him, he goes down.
                                (then, off his dubious
                                look, more forcefully)
                        My visions have changed, Danny. 
                        And that's because the future's
                          changed.  I see you're going to
                        do this.  I see it's going to
                        happen.  Believe me.

          Avila eyes him, wanting to believe him but still unsure.

    70CONTINUED:70

          Finally, he nods.  And then the door opens and Vic and
          other team members (not Bruce) come back in.

                                        VIC
                        Five minutes.  Time to get your
                        gloves on.

          Johnny starts to go, but Avila calls after him.

                                        AVILA
                        Hey, don't forget the jacket.

          And when Johnny turns, there's a hint of both a challenge
          and a plea in Avila's voice, as Vic helps him on with his
          gloves.

                                        AVILA
                        Like I said, you're in my corner,
                        you gotta look sharp.

          Johnny reaches to pick up the jacket again, as though
          half afraid of getting another vision, but nothing happens. 
          He gives Avila a last encouraging smile, then exits.

                        I lied to him.  I touched him,
                        then lied right to his face.

                          I thought that was the game plan.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only it isn't working.  Nothing's
                        changed yet.  He must not believe

                        do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Believe what, Bruce?  I made it
                        up, remember?  It's a lie.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's not a lie, it's a hope.  And
                        my Dad used to say, what makes a
                        hope reality is faith.

          As Johnny meanwhile is distracted by...


  71A71AA SILHOUETTED FIGURE (FUTURE MAN)

          standing at the end of the hall, one hand in his pocket,
          backlit by the light of the Arena beyond (which needn't
          be seen).  Johnny has an unsettling flash of recognition.

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        John...


    71B71BJOHNNY

          looks back at Bruce, and when he glances back down the
          hall, THE FIGURE IS GONE.  He shakes off the seeming
          vision.

                                        BRUCE
                        You've done everything you can,
                        so why not just have some faith? 
                        In yourself, in Danny Avila, even
                        in your visions.  They didn't
                        lead you here just to watch a man
                        die.

          As they reach the end of the corridor, which opens to the
          crowded arena and the empty ring, glowing like a blank
          page under the lights.  Johnny eyes it as though he can
          already see the future that will be written there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For Danny's sake, I hope you're
                        right.

          And as he eyes the ring, a BELL sounds, taking us to --          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/16/03 - GOLD  45A.

          Avila charging in, scoring body shots with his left hook,
          but getting repeatedly stung by Tibbs' jab.  His face is
          swollen, and he's working much harder than Tibbs, who
          dances to keep Avila in range of that punishing jab.

                        An impressive performance by Avila
                        so far, but after five rounds,
                        Tibbs' jab is taking its toll.

                        He's still landing that left hook
                        to the body, but he's getting
                          hammered each time he rushes in. 
                        And if you look at the CompuBox
                          numbers, Tibbs is outpunching him
                        two to one.


    7373REVEALING JOHNNY

          watching near Bruce, Vic and Tyrell in Avila's corner. 
          He winces as Avila absorbs a left-right combo, then ties
          Tibbs up.  Turning away, Johnny sees:


  7474HELENA

          also looking pained.  She's sitting with a slightly older
          woman, her SISTER.  Contrasting her anxiety with:


  7575JIMMY D

          who smiles broadly as he watches the fight and Andrew
          lights his cigar.  Then:


  7676THE CROWD

          excited and vocal, and perhaps there's no more blood lust
          than usual but that's not how it seems to Johnny.  He
          turns back to the ring just in time to see --


  7777AVILA GETTING KNOCKED DOWN BY A TIBBS LEFT HOOK

          He's up quickly, takes the standing eight, a CUT bleeding
          over his right eye.  During which we hear:

                                        TESSITORE
                        And a big left from Tibbs knocks
                        Avila down!  He bounces back up,
                        taking the standing eight, but
                        that was no slip and what's more
                        it looks like Tibbs has opened a
                        nasty cut over his right eye.

          The BELL rings.          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/16/03 - BLUE-2  47.


  7878AVILA'S CORNER - ON THE CUT MAN (ASSISTANT MANAGER)

          working hard to stop the bleeding, and it's not pretty in
            close-up.  Vic is sponging down Avila's heaving chest,
          shouting M.O.S. instructions to "Keep up the right" which
          we barely hear over the crowd noise and because we're
          watching from Johnny's perspective, seeing him now as he
          hands the Cut Man some medications, his face grim.


  7979BEGIN MONTAGE - THE FIGHT CONTINUES

          NOTE:  And working with our technical consultant, and
          perhaps professional announcers, we'll flesh out a bit
          more of the fight and add snatches of appropriate voice
          over (SEE ADDENDUM A for additional dialogue for Tessitore*
          and Atlas), but the shots we'll see will include:*

          A.) Avila hanging in there but increasingly rocked by
          Tibbs big punches.


  8080B.) A RING GIRL HOTTIE

          struts with a CARD for Round Six.


  8181C.) AVILA

          on the ropes, wincing as Tibbs pounds his body, then re-
          opens the cut with a savage hook.


  8282D.) ALL INTERCUTTING WITH JOHNNY

            watching, our focus on his reactions to Avila's
            increasingly desperate battle, as another round passes,
          another ring girl holds a card for Round Eight; then more
          fighting and Avila is knocked down again, getting more
          slowly this time, as we continue to PUSH CLOSER on Johnny,
          until another BELL sounds.


  8383AVILA'S CORNER - CLOSE ANGLE

          as Bruce throws up the stool and Avila sits heavily, his
          face a mess, taking in heaving breaths.


  8484THE COMMENTATORS TALK EXCITEDLY INTO THEIR MICS

                                        ATLAS
                        One round to go and frankly it's
                        amazing Avila's still standing
                        with all the punishment he's been
                        taking.

    84CONTINUED:84

                                        TESSITORE
                          Terrible punishment from Tibbs'
                          powerful jab and right hand, and
                        at this point you've gotta wonder
                        if Avila's trainer, Vic Murphy,
                        isn't tempted to throw in the
                        towel and maybe save his fighter
                        even worse punishment...

          And as he says this last line, we're already looking at...


  8585JOHNNY

          who sees ANOTHER RING GIRL about to climb into the ring
          with the card for Round 12, and he turns to Bruce --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Twelfth round.

          And at this point Bruce doesn't know what to say anymore;
          he's as worried as Johnny as he hands a water bottle up
          to...


  8686VIC

          He's also watching the ring girl, now strutting with the
          card, and then turns to Avila, who winces as Tyrell again
          tries to close the cut, the eye under it red and swollen.

                                        VIC
                        How you feeling?

                                        AVILA
                                (breathing heavily)
                        All right.  I'm all right.  Just
                        need that second wind.

                                        VIC
                                (to Tyrell)
                        How's that cut look?

          Tyrell just shakes his head.  Vic eyes Johnny, who's again
          helping Tyrell, his face a mask, then makes a tough
            decision.

                                        VIC
                        I'm callin' in the doc.

                                        AVILA
                        What?  No!




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/12/03 - YELLOW  49.


    86CONTINUED:86

                                        VIC
                        That cut's bad.  You could be
                        risking the eye.

          But Avila can tell that isn't Vic's real concern.  The
            trainer's remembering Johnny's original prediction, his
            superstitious nature abetting his concern for Danny.

                                        AVILA
                        No way.  No way you're taking me
                        out.

                                        VIC
                        You fought a great fight, kid,
                        but it's still just one fight.

                                        AVILA
                        No!

          And now Avila looks to Johnny, his pained eyes asking a
            question.  And as we push in on Johnny's troubled face,
          and on Avila's, our shots isolate them, in SLOW MOTION
          and perhaps shallow focus as well, so that for an extended
          moment they seem like the only two people in this arena.


  8787MEMORY FLASHES OF AVILA

          From Johnny's encounters with him throughout the show:

          POSING WITH JOHNNY AT THE AIRPORT


  8888WAVING JOHNNY INTO HIS GYM...


  8989CONFRONTING HIM ANGRILY AT JOHNNY'S HOUSE...


    9090TRAINING AT HIS GYM

          getting knocked down, and getting up for more...


  9191HOLDING OUT HIS FISTS,

          challenging Johnny to touch him in the dressing room:  a
          portrait of a man at once vulnerable and resolute.            DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/13/03 - GREEN  50.


  9292CLOSER ON JOHNNY... THEN --


  9393ANOTHER FLASH

          This time of Johnny's devastating earlier vision of Avila
          dead on the canvas, eyes staring up vacantly...


  9494RESUME - CLOSE ON JOHNNY, A BALANCE BEING WEIGHED

          And finally he just gives in to his gut -- his empathy
          for this man, his hope or belief or faith or whatever you
          want to call it -- and he just nods slightly.  And...


          AVILA

          receives this small gesture like an infusion of pure manna,
          Gatoraid for the soul, and now he finds that second wind,
          turning back to Vic...

                                        AVILA
                        Give me the mouth piece.  Give it
                        to me!

          Vic does.  The BELL rings and Avila charges into the ring.


  9595ROUND TWELVE - VARIOUS ANGLES

          Avila and Tibbs go toe-to-toe, Tibbs at first surprised
          by Avila's new tenacity, then turning on his own juice.

                                        TESSITORE
                        And Avila is just a different man
                        this round... really giving it
                          everything... and --

                                        ATLAS
                        Now Tibbs is connecting with a
                        series of shots to the body...
                        driving Avila across the ring...

          And indeed Tibbs is now bulling Avila across the ring
          with punishing body blows, the preamble to the COMBO.


          JOHNNY TENSES AS HE RECOGNIZES THE MOMENT








                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/16/03 - GOLD  51.


    95CONTINUED:95

          THE CROWD SENSES IT TOO, RISING TO ITS FEET, ROARING AS...


  9696TIBBS

          lands the opening left hook of the combo and TIME SLOWS


  9797ANGLE - JOHNNY'S HANDS GRIP THE EDGE OF THE CANVAS
          APRON...


  9898AVILA - SLOW-MOTION

          As he absorbs the first blow of the combo.


          TIBBS' FEET AND HIPS - STILL SLOW-MO

          starting to slowly come around with his right hand.


          AVILA ADJUSTS - SLOW-MO

          his weight shifting back, so that when Tibbs' second blow --
          the right that initiates the "Fitzsimmons Shift" --
            connects, it's off by a fraction of an inch, and Avila
          rolls with it, shedding some of its force.


          AVILA DROPS HIS RIGHT ELBOW - SLOW-MO

          Deflecting the body blow.


          THE UPPERCUT - SLOW-MO

          Lands on his chin, raising his head, setting him up for
          the final blow...


          AVILA RAISES HIS RIGHT - SLOW-MO

          His glove rises toward the incoming left hook, but the
          instant before contact...


  98A98ATHE COMBINATION REPEATS

          IN REAL TIME, and it all happens so quickly that it looks
          very much like the sequence we've seen repeatedly in
          Johnny's visions.  And so when it ends the same way, with
          Avila going down hard, we can understand why --          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/16/03 - BLUE-2  51A.


  9999JOHNNY REACTS

          as if this is indeed the tragedy he's foreseen, while...


    100100HELENA

          rises from her seat, hands flying to her mouth just as
          Johnny saw in his flash in the dressing room.  And now....          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/12/03 - YELLOW  52.


  101101A HUSH

          falls over the entire arena, as the crowd, which has been
          morbidly teasing themselves with the prospect of psychic-
            predicted death, is now faced with the seeming reality.


  102102THE REFEREE

          begins counting over Avila's still form as we intercut
          with:


  103103BRUCE


  104104VIC


    105105HELENA


  106106JIMMY D

          and finally...


    107107JOHNNY

          who CLOSES HIS EYES, again in a repeat of his other
          dressing room flash.  And indeed it looks as though just
          what he was afraid his visions were showing him has indeed
          come to pass.  Only now --


          A ROAR FROM THE CROWD

          opens his eyes and he reacts as he sees --


  108108AVILA

          rolling onto his side, then climbing to his feet just in
          time to beat the count.  The Ref holds his gloves, asks
          him a question we can't hear, and Avila nods that he's
          okay.


    109109HELENA

          is already crying with relief, the crowd CHEERING WILDLY
          as --          DEAD ZONE: THE COMBINATION - ACT FOUR - 6/16/03 - BLUE-2  53.


  110110AVILA

          now takes the fight to Tibbs, finding a still deeper
          reserve as he rains lefts and rights that have Tibbs
          sagging on the ropes when the final BELL sounds.  And now
          Tibbs slumps down, tangled in the ropes.  It's too late
          to be ruled a knockdown or a knockout, but as the ref
          pulls Avila away the crowd goes nuts.  (NOTE:  And this
          final fight action may be accompanied by shards of relevant
            voiceover commentary -- again see ADDENDUM A)*

          Avila drops to his knees, spent, and his corner empties
          into the ring, other people crowding in too, all except
          for...


    111111JOHNNY

          who hangs back, weary with relief.  He sees Jimmy D looking
          at him, wondering perhaps if somehow Johnny's engineered
          this.  And Johnny just smiles at him.


  112112INT. ARENA - LATER

          Empty now, except for A CLEANING CREW sweeping up the
          refuse.


          BRUCE AND JOHNNY

          Their team coats exchanged for their own, stand near one
          of the aisle exits.

                                        BRUCE
                        So what do you think was the
                        turning point?

                        Well, it could've been at the
                          weigh-in, or even before the fight,
                        in the dressing room.  The flashes
                        I had there, they seem to
                        correspond with what ended up
                        happening.

                        Do you think sometimes that one
                        detail can just be you, and what
                        you're willing to believe, have
                        faith in?

                                        BRUCE
                          Maybe... if that belief touches
                        someone else.

          And he nods down to the ring, where a solitary figure is
          stepping through the ropes, a small gym bag in one hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll meet you outside, okay.

          Bruce nods and we stay on him for a beat as he watches
          Johnny head toward the ring.  And then he smiles ruefully,
          heads through the exit.


  113113INT. ARENA - RING

          Danny Avila, his cuts stitched and taped, stands in the
          empty ring.

                        I lost, 'case you didn't notice. 
                          'Course, I also didn't die... or
                        knock the guy out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No?  Looked to me like he was
                        saved by the bell.

          And Avila smiles; he's still not sure if Johnny was
            bullshitting him about his visions, but he also knows
          what Johnny's support and faith did for him.

                                        AVILA
                        Yeah, you can argue that.  But I
                        still don't think this is going
                        to help your career as a psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        Now that would be a tragedy,
                          wouldn't it?

          He holds up the rope for Avila.  We watch from the ring
          as they head back up the aisle, and perhaps we again hear
          the ROAR of the crowd, from fights past or fights still
          to come.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
