          A two lane road snakes along a rocky coastline.  The crash
          of the assaulting surf overpowering.  We may see oyster
          boats docked in the background.

          Bruce's PT Cruiser winds up along the coast.  We hear the
          strains of Rock N' Roll as it drives by...



          The PT Cruiser zips by the camera, which whips to reveal

          The PT Cruiser enters the picturesque town center, which
          is lined with old-fashioned brick and wood buildings.  A
          flag pole stands in the square, Old Glory at half mast. 
          (The ocean might be visible in the background; this is a
          remote oyster village.)

          The town square is awfully empty and quiet for mid-day.

          Bruce parks across the street from a diner.



          Johnny stands among an ANGRY MOB during the ROAR of the
          crowd.  He looks around him, at the SCREAMING FACES, some
          of whom we recognize - the waitress (Linda), the hefty
          man (Bert) at the counter.  Johnny looks to the focus of
          their fury, only to see --

          HIMSELF, TIED TO A TREE, A MAKESHIFT PYRE OF BRANCHES AND
          LEAVES AT HIS FEET.  Johnny sputters as GASOLINE is
          splashed on his face.  Someone near him cracks open an
            emergency FLARE, then tosses it onto the pyre, IGNITING
          IT IN A HOWLING FIRE. 



          Johnny exits the diner, foam take-out container clutched
          under his arm.  Bruce follows. 

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell you in a few miles.   

          Across the street, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER is now parked next
          to the PT.  A uniformed officer, DEPUTY NANCY SIMMONS, is
          taking down the license plate number.  Bruce hurries up. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, no.  Is this a red zone?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        We were just leaving.

          Deputy Simmons, mid-thirties, no make-up, hair pulled
          back into a disciplined bun, sizes up Bruce, then Johnny.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        You fellas have identification? 

          Behind them, a couple of the LOCALS have stepped out of
          the diner to watch.  They reach for their drivers' licenses
          and, as the dialogue continues, hand them to her...  Up
          ahead, trucks from a caravan are parking along the curb,
            TOWNSFOLK disembarking.  Three or four to a truck.  They
          look tired as they begin to greet people walking out of
          stores to talk to them... they glance over at Johnny and
          Bruce with curiosity... 

                                        BRUCE
                        Is there a problem, officer?

          She glances at the names on the licenses...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                                  (correcting)
                        Deputy.  Simmons.
                                (looking up)
                        Guess you haven't heard, huh...

          Johnny and Bruce react, heard what?, take note of the
          caravan people...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS (CONT'D)
                        We had a double homicide last
                        night.  Mother and her eight year
                        old daughter out in the woods. 

                                        BRUCE
                                (reacts)
                        Oh, man...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Second daughter is still missing. 
                          Thirteen years old.  This town's
                        been walking the woods all night. 
                        We're hoping she's still alive.

          Bruce makes the most natural assumption based on everything
          he knows about Johnny Smith...

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, if she is... 
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        John, maybe you could...

          But he stops as he sees Johnny's discomfort... Bruce has 
          no idea what's going on... it's an awkward moment and the
          deputy picks up on it...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Could what...?

          And there's really no escape now...

                                        BRUCE
                                (still confused by
                                  Johnny's reaction)
                        My friend has helped the police
                        up in Maine now and then...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Helped how...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess you'd call me a psychic.

          Deputy Simmons studies Johnny long and hard.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        A psychic.  Like with supernatural
                        powers?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I just sense things sometimes.

          And the crowd is getting curious and Simmons glances at

          them and doesn't want to continue this outside... she
          smiles pleasantly...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Look, we... we sure could use any
                        help we can get, psychic or
                        otherwise.  Why don't you come on
                        inside and we can talk about it?

          Johnny glances at the people from the caravan... it's not
          that he wouldn't help under any other circumstance... but
          here he hesitates and off that hesitation, the deputy
            reacts...

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Unless you...
                                ('have something more
                                  important')

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  No.  That's fine.

          Bruce knows it's not fine but doesn't know why and it's
          all very uncomfortable as the deputy leads these two across
          the street to the station house... past the TOWNSFOLK
          from the search party, who have formed an unintentional
            roadblock of bodies across the street.  Most talking, but
          some looking down this way.



          PULL OUT of a matching footprint in the mud.  We tilt up
          to see a GIRL RUNNING AWAY from us.  Finding Johnny there
          in the forest, sitting at the interrogation table, the
          sneaker in his hands.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She runs a lot.  JV girl's track.


          CUTTING BRANCHES OF A TREE

          ANGLE - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - FOREST FLOOR

          The branches arranged as a pentagram.  Near-by is a TREE
          STUMP.   



          A sheriff' vehicle pulls around a corner into the town
          square, revealing a LARGE CROWD assembled in the square,
          like you might find on the 4th of July.  This is the bulk
          force of the MANHUNT assembled to find Cathy Reed. 

          The sheriff car turns on its lights and gives a WHOOP!  A
          path is cleared for it, PEOPLE looking in the windows. 
          In the front seat:  Sheriff Danforth and Deputy Simmons. 
          In the back:  Gabriel Barnes and Johnny Smith. 

          Johnny looks out at the locals, as they look in.  Meeting
          their now accusatory stares.  Gabe notices this, too,
          thinks about what Johnny said.     

          Johnny suddenly spots the man wearing a RED FLANNEL JACKET
          and RED WORK PANTS, right from his "Bloody Bruce" vision. 
          The man is sitting on the trunk of an Olds '88, as are
          two others.  Their clothes show that they have been
          trekking through the woods; muddy boots, leaves on coats.

          The car stops in front of the COUNTY COURTHOUSE.  Johnny
          gets out, igniting murmurs from the crowd.  And then...

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        WHERE IS CATHY?

          EDDIE is tall and wiry.  His voice is clear and loud.  A
          few random SHOUTS compliment his outburst. 

          Then, a patch of the crowd falls QUIET and parts to let
          the distraught father, TOM REED, step forward.  He stares
          at Johnny with a blank expression.  A hand or two reaches
          out to rub Tom's shoulder for comfort.   

          Johnny's eyes meet Tom's for a beat, and then he is ushered
          into the COURTHOUSE.

          The last face he sees is Bruce's... and Johnny reacts
          with dismay... but Bruce just shrugs and says with a look
          that he couldn't leave... overlapping from next scene --

          With Maine license plates, pulling to a stop behind the
          virtual barricade of townie cars clogging the square.

          DANA BRIGHT steps out, takes in the gathering, surprised
          to see such a hubbub.  She shakes her head.

                                        DANA

          She heads to the courthouse, shaking her head.



          The assembled crowd stares at Bruce as he moves across
          the street to Dana's car, gets in and starts the engine...

          As he drives away, pan to find the Man In Red leaning

          Dana spots TOM REED, smoking a cigarette near a candlelit
          shrine to Mary and Susan, replete with photos.  TOWN-FOLK
          are holding a vigil for Cathy Reed... she approaches him...

                        I have nothing to say.

          He stamps on his cigarette... goes back inside the
            courthouse... Dana frowns... Moving to find Sheriff
          Danforth scanning the crowd, worry lines deepening.  He
          reaches into his car, WHOOPS the siren, then keys his
          loud speaker.

                        you can't stay here.

          They break up but not really... moving away from the
          steps... but still milling... Wolcott and other more
          headstrong folks move into the diner... Dana goes back
            inside...

          Bruce drives Dana's car past the "Welcome to Hobbs Landing"
          sign.  As soon as he passes it, he exhales a sigh of
          relief.  Drives for two more beats.  Then suddenly grits
          his teeth and slams the brakes, skidding to a halt.

          He sits in the road, then guns a U-turn and heads back to
          town.  Loyalty, doubt, guilt, or a little of all three.

          Rounding the corner up ahead is the Olds '88.  It swerves
          into the ONCOMING lane.  Bruce tenses, swerves into the
          other lane.

          The Olds MATCHES him, forcing a game of chicken.  Bruce
          SWERVES BACK, the Olds CALLS.

          Bruce wrenches the wheel left to avoid a head-on, and
          BARRELS off road, then stopping.

          The Olds smokes to a halt.  Sits there, idling.

          Bruce gets out of the Sebring, royally pissed.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man, this wasn't even my car!

          He looks up at the Olds, as four men hop out.  Bruce
          freezes when he sees the Man in Red approaching.  The
          four shadows of the men stretch out over the pavement,
          encroaching on Bruce's feet.

          Bruce freezes, realizes too late, that he's in trouble...

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, why don't we just calm down
                        and...

          One of the men SUCKER-PUNCHES him.  But then, Bruce moves
            LIGHTNING-FAST, and we realize we've never really seen
          Bruce MOVE before.

          He BLOCKS the fist, TRAPS the arm, and then THROWS DOWN a
          hundred and seventy three pounds of asshole.

          Then the other three pounce.

          Bruce holds his own for a few rounds, but then takes a
          bad crack to the temple and gut at the same time.  He
          stumbles down, and we cut way...

          WAY BACK to view the beating from a distance, framed by
          the giant coastal pine trees.  Twilight is falling.

          As the assemblage pours out of the courthouse... and once
          again the courthouse steps are filled with people...
          Danforth moves out of his office to see what the commotion

          Dana moves to him...

                                        DANA
                          Sheriff, I'm a reporter from Johnny
                        Smith's home town.  He just told
                        me he thinks the missing girl may
                        be on a boat.  Have you searched
                        the harbor?

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                                (shakes his head)
                        We've been looking in the woods
                        all day.

                        This sounds an awful lot like a
                        confession to me...

                                (sharp, to Simmons)
                        You just don't get it, do you?
                                (to Danforth)
                        I've seen more of Johnny Smith's
                        powers than anyone in this town.. 
                        Call it witchcraft or anything
                        else you want to... but I'd sure
                        as hell start searching boats if
                        I were you...

          The Sheriff doesn't need a lot of prompting...

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                                (to the deputy)
                        You hold down the fort here...

          Dana follows the sheriff.



          A tight group of TEN MEN, led by Eddie Wolcott, marches
          across the square.  A more nebulous contingent of Locals
          follows their lead.  They walk right up to Deputy Simmons,
          who is standing in front of the court doors.

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        We want to have a word with John
                        Smith.

                                        DEPUTY SIMMONS
                        Go home, Eddie.  All of you.

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        Nancy, you brought him in, he
                        lied to your face, and you had
                        him arrested.  You did the right
                        thing then, you'll do it now.

          Nancy about to open her mouth, when someone shouts --

                                        BERT
                        He knows where Cathy is!

          Multiple CRIES of agreement rise up.  Deputy Simmons is
          scared.  What's worse, she agrees with them.

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        We just want to talk to the man.

          Off Nancy Simmons, a thousand eyes on her...          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT FOUR - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  44.



          Johnny is dragged out of the courthouse... Eddie Wolcott
          in the lead...

          And during the sequence as hands grab at him... we --

                                                                                INTERCUT:

          -- GASOLINE is splashed on his face.  

          -- Someone near him cracks open an emergency FLARE...

          All these are intercut with the crowd action...

          Those gathered in the square look up.  Some cheer.  Some
          stand numb.  Some quickly depart, wanting no part of this.

          Eddie pulls Johnny's head back, to see the crowd. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT FOUR - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  45.

          Much walla... cries of "murderer", "tell us where she
          is"...

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        Now, what "psychic motivation" do
                        you need to say where Cathy is? 

          Johnny looks at the man.  There's no reasoning with this
          one, with any of them.  He needs to know where she is.  

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shaken)
                        I need to go to the crime scene.

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        Yeah.  Figured you would.  Isn't
                        that what they say - you always
                        return to the scene of the crime...   

          Eddie drags him toward his car.  The MOB FOLLOWS, now
          with a rising yell.  A couple of KIDS run up alongside
          the adults, almost leaping with excitement. 

          TOM REED enters frame, looking at the Mob, panic creeping
          into his shell-shocked eyes...



          All kinds of boats here... Danforth gives directions to
          some harbor security guys... as well as his own deputy...

                        He used to look after the
                        Vandenheim yacht over at dock
                        five when the family's not here
                        on vacation.

          Angle on THE TRUNK as the Olds '88 takes off, passing the
          empty Sebring on the side of the road. 



          Moving with the mob to the head of the pack, where Johnny
          is prodded along.

          Voice by voice dies to a solemn quiet as they all reach
          the yellow tape that cordons off the crime scene.

          The PENTAGRAM, made of branches, is still there (minus
          one branch), bracketing the TREE STUMP.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT FOUR - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  47.


    54CONTINUED:54

          The tape pleads "DO NOT CROSS" but no one listens, although
          people stop short of the pentagram, divert around it so
          they can still see, forming a circle in the process. 

          A circle of people enclosing Johnny, the pentagram, the
          tree stump. 

          Johnny looks around at them.  Not all have been to this
          place.  Some are so scared, they shudder.  Others look on
          him with open hatred.  

          Tom Reed, looking at the scene with mute anticipation, as
          if he knows something terrible is going to happen which
          he cannot stop, but he cannot look away. 

          Johnny knows that look.  He's wearing it now.  Wolcott
          pushes him and Johnny is thrown to the ground... as he
          touches the earth...

                        Enough games.  You're gonna tell
                        us where she is, right now.  Clark,

          as Simmons finger switches off the power... moving from
          her... to -- Johnny is being fastened to the tree, just
          like in his vision.  He looks around, sees the FACES he
          saw before, now cheering, screaming.      

          GASOLINE splashes in his face, thrown by the Man in Red
          and Excited Guy.  They lay it on the makeshift pyre of
          twigs and branches at his feet. 

          Eddie Wolcott steps forward, holding an EMERGENCY FLARE.

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        Here's how we do this.  You tell
                        us where the girl is, or we send
                        you straight back to hell. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (desperate, to Tom
                                Reed)
                        You can stop this. 

          Eddie realizes he's being ignored.  Tom looks at Johnny.

                                        EDDIE WOLCOTT
                        Hey!  

          Eddie IGNITES the flare to get Johnny's attention.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can tell them the truth.

                                        TOM REED
                        Shut up!

          Tom Reed suddenly runs forward, a pitiful cry escapes his
          lips.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: HERE...BE MONSTERS - ACT FOUR - 5/30/02 - WHT-2  52.

          He grabs the FLARE from Eddie's hand and rushes Johnny,
          to destroy the unbearable truth...

          A GUNSHOT!  The Mob STARTLES, Tom Reed drops the flare,
          it lands dangerously close to the pyre.

          SHERIFF DANFORTH steps into the clearing, FIRING his
          shotgun a second time.  Gabe runs up and STOMPS OUT the
          flare.  Eddie backs up, putting his hands in the air. 

                                        SHERIFF DANFORTH
                          Everybody's under arrest, dammit! 
                        Everybody!  Holy, Judas, mother
                        of God.  What have you you people
                        done.  What have you done...

          He glowers at Deputy Simmons, now just one of the Mob. 
          She lowers her head in shame.  Others look around,
          bewildered, like they just woke up.  A few others rabbit
          off into the night in different directions.   

          Then, out of the forest, Dana Bright walks Cathy Reed
          into the clearing.  Johnny sees her, sags in relief. 
          Cathy runs to Tom and into his arms. 

                                        CATHY
                        I tried to stay quiet, Daddy, but
                        they busted in...

          Tom just stands there, a weak man, letting his crying
          daughter hug his shell.  The Mob, the hundred or so PEOPLE
          from Hobbs Landing who were about to burn a man alive,
          stand like silent statues. 

          The only ones who move are Gabe, and Bruce, who move
          quickly to the tree to untie Johnny Smith. 

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          The town that time forgot.  A Norman Rockwell portrait. 
          Except this one has no people. 

          An empty square.  Old Glory at half mast.

          Maybe they'll come out when they can explain what happened.

          Moving to find Johnny and Bruce and Dana at the PT Cruiser
          with Gabe...

                                (to Dana)
                        I'll see to it that your car is
                          repaired...

                                        DANA
                        No offense, but I'd just as soon
                        not contribute to the economy of
                        this town.  My auto club and the
                          Reverand Mr. Purdy is handling
                        it.

          Gabe nods, he doesn't blame her... turns to Johnny...

                                        GABE
                        'I'm sorry' doesn't begin to cover
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (thanking him)
                        At least one man was willing to
                        stand by me.    

                                        GABE
                        This town... my father grew up
                        here... my father's father... we
                        go all the way back to the American
                          Revolution... this town has always
                        been a place of ideals and
                          principles...

          They get into the car and drive out of town... and as we
          pull back --
