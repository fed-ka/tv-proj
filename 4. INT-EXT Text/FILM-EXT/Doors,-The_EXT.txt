The blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert, so barren, so hot it
stings to look at. An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the yellow-
orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling with
ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as the
MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock --
the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM.
DOORS SONG
Riders on the storm (2)
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
CREDITS ROLL, OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE
JIM VOICE
(continues over imagery)
...me and my mother and father and
grandmother and grandfather were
driving through the desert at dawn
and a truckload of Indian workers
had either hit another car or just --
I don't know what happened... Indians
were scattered all over the highway
bleeding to death.
SUBTITLE READS: ARIZONA DESERT, 1963. CREDITS CONTINUE TO
ROLL.
Panning up the black chino pants to JIM MORRISON, now 20,
steel seaman's suitcase in hand, thumbing a ride, the road
sign behind him saying "Los angeles 370 miles"
SONG
The world on you depends
Our life will never end
Girl you gotta love your man
A LARGE LIZARD in the dust cocks its head, blinks, as the
boots walk by to the car pulling over.
SUBTITLE READS: VENICE, CALIFORNIA 1965
CREDITS continue to their conclusion as we segue into the
BLUENESS of VENICE, CALIFORNIA, 1965 -- the dawn of a new
age. All was possible.
Individual SHOTS of the BOARDWALK throbbing with a feast of
HIPPIES, head shops, ARTISTS drawing psychedelic murals, POT
SMOKERS, MUSCLE BUILDERS, tambourines accompanying the
transister radios on the Beach Boys and "I Got You Babe",
dogs chasing frisbees, BIKINI BODIES on the beach, LSD sold
over the counter... set to the upbeat chords of HELLO I LOVE
YOU
DOORS SONG
Hello I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello I love you
Let me jump in your game
She's walking down the street
Blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?
JIM, in torn black chinos, no shirt, walking real slow past
it all, carrying a notebook of his own and a paperback of
Baudelaire, his eyes settling on...
A YOUNG BEAUTY and her yellow labrador -- a fashionable thin,
long, red-haired "20th century fox" in jeans moving through
the crowd...
He thinks about it -- a fraction of eternity -- and he's
off... after her.
She moves along its banks, as if the universe moved to her
rhythm, turning once to look back. Jim caught in her eyes.
They're alone. Now he's the one seized by doubt. He slows,
pretends to take another interest.
DOORS SONG
She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked
And her legs are long
When she moves
My brain screams out this song
As she turns into another street, he resumes following her.
She gets to a house, goes in. There's a group of people
partying. He stops, watches.
DOORS SONG
Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you, fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?
The two story house has a quaint run-down charm. Friends
have dropped by, people smoking joints, beers.
She's on the upstairs balcony -- talking with a YOUNG MAN
(professor type) in his 30's, who passes her a joint.
JIM lurks in the shadows of the trees; he's been standing
outside watching... The MUSIC shifts to the quieter LOVE
STREET.
DOORS SONG
She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens
The YOUNG MAN gestures, and goes back inside the house. She's
alone now on the balcony, sitting on a kitchen table...
It's now or never. Jim scales the tree alongside the house
with the agility of a gymnast.
DOORS SONG
She has robes and she has monkeys
Lazy diamond studded flunkies
She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you
The girl's grinding up pot in an old shoebox with a spoon
and kitchen strainer. She looks up and sees his crotch three
feet from her face, balanced there effortlessly on the railing
like a highwire act, opens her mouth in surprise.
Jim drops softly to the balcony, a smile of disarming
gentleness.
JIM
Hi...
GIRL
Wow! Hi...
(looking at the tree)
You have a problem with doors?
JIM
Waste of time...
His head cocked slightly onto his left shoulder, he drawls,
southern gentleman, polite, slow, thoughtful as if he had
all the time in the world, as if the guy would never come
back.
JIM
I followed you... from the beach...
GIRL
(impressed)
Wow! You followed me? Why?
JIM
...cause... you're the one...
He moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips.
GIRL
(mesmerized, awkward)
Wow... neat...
(looks back)
...maybe you should meet my old man?
JIM
Later. You got a name?
He looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big
round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his
intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time.
The YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees
him.
As he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree --
looks back once.
JIM
Mine's Jim.
A moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot.
GIRL
Pam...
The ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles.
JIM
Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim...
He vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a
vision.
YOUNG MAN
Who the hell was that?
PAMELA
(everything's cool)
That's Jim. My new friend.
JIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of "GLORIA"
blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely
college crowd circa '65.
TRICK
(to Jim)
Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar?
BONES
You can't quit, you gotta voice.
People can't dig cause they don't
understand yet.
JACK
If you're an individual, if you're
too good, they wanna cut your dick
off. Look what happened to Orson
Wells.
TRICK
You quit now, they'll yank your
deferment in no time and they'll get
you for Vietnam man. Three more months
you graduate.
BONES
Be cool, you never learned fuckin
patience Morrison, you want everything
at once.
NICK
They didn't get it. So make your
films and fuck what they think.
JIM
You know what I think?
He slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls.
BONES
Yeah whadday you think?
JIM
You really want to know what I think?
The cronies wait, anticipating something inescapably evil to
escape his lips.
BONES
Yeah yeah, whatddaya think?
JIM
I think we gotta get really ripped!
SPECIAL EFFECT: JIM's head six inches from pavement moving
at 60 mph through heavy traffic. Screaming, laughing like a
maniac. Beeping horns all over the place.
JIM
DEATH OLD FRIEND!!
In the car, madness, raging chaos, the four boys pulling him
in.
Night. Shadows. A tree. A figure moving.
JIM
(SONG)
Awake!
Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child my sweet one
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity the first thing you see
Jim slides her upstairs' door open, crawls in next to her
bed. She's asleep with her boyfriend. He touches her toe.
She awakes, startled.
JIM
Come on, come out for a walk, it's a
pretty night.
PAM
You're crazy!
JIM and PAMELA moving along the byways. A clear starry
California night.
JIM
(SONG)
A vast radiant beach
And a cool jewelled moon
Couples naked, race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft mad children
There's a crash. They turn bristling.
A COYOTE lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp, pulling
its head from an overstuffed garbage can, looking back at
them.
Fires on the boardwalk. Hippies, Bums, Older People. JIM and
PAM move through talking, skipping, touching like children.
JIM
(SONG)
...smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us
Choose, they croon, the ancient ones
The time has come again
The two of them race down by its side, slowing to a walk.
His [...] loved orphan voice.
JIM
Can I stay with you tonight? We could
talk 'till dawn. I just don't want
to be alone.
PAM
(hesitant)
Okay... just talk though. No funny
stuff.
JIM
Okay. I promise.
PAM
I've been real upset. I lost my car
on the freeway yesterday. I left it
somewhere and I can't remember where
and when I went back it was gone. My
sister...
JIM
I bet you never expected life could
be this hard.
(strokes her hair
affectionately)
And you're still so young.
She breaks into sobs, seeking his arms. He hugs her.
JIM
I wonder where we'll be ten years
from now?
PAM
I really don't want to know
JIM
Come on.
JIM
(SONG)
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances
Their silhouettes mount the fire escape of a jagged old
structure overlooking the boardwalk.
PAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his
sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking
moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television
antennas. Fires burn from the beach.
In the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we
see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic
William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere --
panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud,
mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen
ideas.
PAM
(reading, looking)
These are like beautiful! I never
read much poetry in school. I hated
it. What's a "shaman"?
(mispronounces)
JIM
He's the medicine man who starts in
a peyote trance. And he gets everyone
in the tribe going and they share in
his vision and it heals them. It's
the same in all cultures -- Greeks,
Jesus. Some Indians say the first
shaman invented sex. He's the one
who makes you crazy.
PAM
Are you a "shaman"?
JIM
Uh
(pause)
no. I just write about it. What turns
you on?
PAM
I don't know. Experience. Freedom.
Love... Now. Peyote's like love.
When it's given it's blessed. When
it's sold it's damned. I like peyote.
I like acid, it's easier to get. I
like the spiritual voyage. The first
time I did acid I saw God. I did. I
had a friend who was Christ. And he
was Judas too. I suddenly knew the
secret of everything -- that we're
all one, the universe is one. And
that everything is beautiful.
JIM
Is it? I don't know. I think you're
alive by confronting death -- by
experiencing pain.
PAM
I think you're alive by recognizing
beauty -- seeing truth because when
you discover truth you discover what
love is... we're all saying the same
thing. It's "love me and I'll love
you."
JIM
(looks at her, ironic)
It's only thru death that you know
life. Jesus, medicine men heal people
by sacrificing their own life.
PAM
Do you love Death?
JIM
I think life hurts a lot more than
death. When you die the pain is over.
Pam shivers, a strange thought.
PAM
Why do I look at you... and see my
death?
(pause, shrugs)
No, that's ridiculous.
JIM
I bet your dad's a school teacher.
PAM
How did you know!
JIM
I don't know.
PAM
What was your father?
JIM
Military
PAM
I bet you moved around a lot.
JIM
Yeah, about 8 times.
PAM
How many sisters and brothers?
JIM
Two.
PAM
One... she's the pretty one... I
love your neck.
(she gets in his lap)
He runs his fingers thru her hair, kissing her gently.
JIM
"...but one, the most beautiful one
of all dances in a ring of fire and
throws off the challenge with a shrug"
PAM
That's beautiful. Who did you write
it for?
JIM
I wrote it for you.
The panties coming off. Rousseau dangling from the Venice
moon. He moves a little over excited, nervous, more awkward
than we might expect.
PAM
...take your time, Jim... there's no
hurry, I'm all you have to do
tonight...
DOORS SONG
Well the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now...
As we depart the rooftop.
Your fingers weak with minarets
Speaking secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget
DISSOLVE TO:
Possibly we hear the soft backbeat of MOONLIGHT DRIVE without
lyrics.
RAY MANZAREK is meditating in yoga posture, longer hair as
well, in his post-graduate phase, sandals, colorful hippie
shirt. But the meditation is not going well. He's shaking
his head at himself, frowning.
RAY
Om om... No bliss! No bliss!
Jim has approached closer, amused, looking down.
JIM
Hey Ray, try acid man, it's
guaranteed.
Ray opening his eyes -- his POV -- Jim, slouched, jacket
over his shoulder, sun behind him.
RAY
(surprised)
Morrison... Aw shit. Last trip I
thought I was going through hell's
digestive system. Something painted
by Hieronymus Bosch.
JIM
I never had a bummer on acid.
RAY
I like naturally high man.
JIM
Whatever works. Making movies at MGM
yet?
RAY
Well I saw the head of production
and I said Godard doesn't use scripts,
he improvises with his camera and he
said, "great who's Godard?"
JIM
(laughs)
We gotta take the planet back,
reinvent the Gods, make new myths.
RAY
Right on. I thought you went to New
York?
JIM
Never got there. Went out to the
desert and uh... got lost y'know.
Days. I been living on Trick's
rooftop. Got stuck on this chick...
RAY
Whatcha been doing?
JIM
Writing. Poems. Songs.
RAY
Songs? Lemme hear one.
JIM
I can't sing.
RAY
So neither can Dylan. "Johnny's in
the basement mixing up the medicine,
I'm on the pavement thinking about
the government". But he's got the
words man. That's what they want.
JIM
(suddenly sings)
Let's swim to the moon un hunh
Let's climb thru the tide
Penetrate the evening
That the city sleeps to hide
Jim has crouched, digging his hand in the sand. As the grains
spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed.
Ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand. All of a sudden
we're in RAY'S POV -- a mystical moment. Jim singing, no
sound, then pure song, unadulterated by atmosphere.
JIM
Let's swim out tonight love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Jim stops, shrugs. Ray looks at him a long beat. Intense
eyes, the manner of a man who knows what he wants and cannot
be stopped.
RAY
Wow!... Y'know man those are hot
lyrics -- really hot!
JIM
(pleased)
...could you write the music for
that down, if we went over to your
place, could you write that on your
organ?
RAY
Are you kidding! I could fly. You
wrote that? You got others?
JIM
A bunch. It's like I'm taking notes
at a rock concert going on inside my
head. I actually hear the music --
the spirit of the wine y'know,
intoxication.
RAY
(slaps him on the
knee)
Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker --
haunted! What the hell happened to
you in the desert? Let's get a rock
and roll band together man and make
a million bucks.
JIM
...be great wouldn't it?
RAY
(walking JIM)
It's the perfect time man! Two of
the guys outta my band are really
into this. I meditate with them. You
know them... Robbie and John. We
could have it in the can in three
weeks.
JIM
Hey why not, I could write the songs
with you guys.
RAY
The Stones did it outta the London
School of Economics for Chrissake.
Things are about to explode man. You
can feel it in the air.
(points out over the
ocean)
Vietnam's right out there. Sides are
being chosen. People wanna fight or
fuck, love or kill, everything's
gonna flame. The planet's screaming
for change, Morrison. Make the myths
man!!
Jim laughs, loves Ray's ardor as they move along the ocean
side.
JIM
There oughta be great orgies man.
Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece,
he made all the women mad, leaving
their homes and dancing off in the
mountains. Great golden copulations
in the streets of LA.
(looks at a passing
girl)
Hey, do you know her?
RAY
What do we call ourselves. "Dionysus"?
JIM
I got a name.
RAY
What?
JIM
The Doors.
RAY
The Doors?
(facial distaste)
That's the most ridiculous...
(then)
...you mean the doors in your mind?
Like the Huxley book.
JIM
"The Doors of Perception"? Acid...
RAY
Yeah sure mescaline experiments --
reducing the sugar flow to the brain.
Great book.
JIM
It's from William Blake actually,
the line -- "when the doors of
perception are cleansed -- things
will appear as they truly are..."
RAY
(finishes)
-- infinite". It's great, Jim.
JIM
So where do we start? How do we start?
Where are the girls?
RAY
Rehearsing. You're moving off the
rooftop and in with me and Dorothy.
As they walk off, the two of them along the edge of the
Pacific. A dog jumping for a frisbee. The music of MOONLIGHT
DRIVE now riffs over the real song now.
DOORS SONG
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb thru the tide
Penetrate the evening
That the city sleeps to hide...
DISSOLVING TO:
As they go out, JIM hugging ROBBIE's head to his shoulder as
they feel the excitement of a new song.
JOHN
(irritated at Ray)
Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin'
people around! I thought we were
equals!
JIM
Aren't we?
(to Robbie)
That was great Robbie. Whaddaya
thinking about when you play?
ROBBIE
Don't know. Mostly the fish in my
fish tank.
JIM
(laughs)
Hey whadya say we take some of that
Tijuana acid and see what kinda
trouble we can get into tonight?
ROBBIE
The chicks always go for you man. I
get the dogs.
JIM
Then we'll start a religion or plan
a murder or go to Tijuana.
JOHN
Whatsamatter with you man, what about
Pam, you got the morals of a coyote.
JIM
Why you wanna sleep with her John,
just to bug me?
JOHN
Hell NO!
JIM
...means "hell yes". She likes you
man, she really does and y'all should.
What's a rock and roll band for man,
if you can't party all night and do
bad things?
RAY
(yelling from the
house)
I GOT IT I GOT IT... GET IN HERE.
HURRY.
JOHN
Sieg Heil!
As they head back.
A row of NIGHTCLUBS glisten off the hoods of passing traffic.
Marquees announce: THE BYRDS, RED ROOSTER, LOVE, THE HERD,
TURTLES, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART. The CLUBS are PANDORA'S BOX, THE
TRIP, CIRO'S, BIDO LITO'S, GAZZARRI'S, THE EXPERIENCE... .
Headlights and neon intercut with:
DOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS,
running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting
kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up
their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE
carries over the montage.
DOORS SONG
You know that it would be untrue etc.
JIM VOICE
(last session)
The music was new black polished
chrome and came over the summer like
liquid night.
"THE DOORS -- BAND FROM VENICE" on the marquee... moving
down to a motley crew of TEENAGE GIRLS, underage, trying to
get past the BOUNCER. The sounds of BREAK ON THROUGH carry
past when the doors open and close admitting a SAILOR.
GIRL GROUPIE
(approaching, to 2nd
girl)
Is that horny motherfucker in the
black pants here tonight?
BOUNCER
IDs! IDs! Can't get in without an
I.D..
GIRL 2
Oh please. I forgot my I.D.. I'm on
the list.
BOUNCER
I forgot my list.
CU moving down -- the "LOVE" is on the marquee at the famous
WHISKY A GO GO as we move down to see JIM, PAM, and the DOORS.
Jim jumps through the TEEMING TRAFFIC (horns, anger) right
in front of a COP CAR, crossing to a long line of teenage
FANS dying to get into the club.
JIM
(to Ray, innocently)
Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted
to fuck me, I could feel it for the
first time!
RAY
Right on stud. But you better watch
out for the guys.
JIM
(to the band)
Guys, I'm serious about the desert,
we still gotta deepen man, we gotta
take some peyote -- all of us
together, we got one more stage to
go...
ROBBIE
I don't know man, fucks up my playing.
I been playing music for 10 years
man and this is the first time in my
whole damned life I ever played it.
JIM
Are you satisfied?
JOHN
Will you get off my case! I'm never
doing acid again. Too many bad trips
man.
JIM
It's not acid John, it's peyote.
It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to
be more... more... more...
JOHN
I'm into TM man. I promised my guru...
PAM
I want to! I want to! I'm ready.
Let's go to the desert... do the
peyote, the good peyote.
JIM
(to girl in line)
Who's on now?
GIRL 1
(withering look, very
hip)
"Love".
JIM
Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool.
GIRL 1
They're the best... better'n the
Beatles.
JIM
You mean the Marx Brothers of music,
we could blow 'em away.
The GIRLS looking at each other like who is this jerk.
GIRL 2
And who are you?
JIM
The Doors... We're up the street at
the Fog.
Laughter from the GIRLS.
GIRL 1
(contempt)
The Doors. I heard of you. That's
the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to
the Fog if you paid me.
JIM
Oh yeah what would you do for money?
PAM
Let's go Jim, come on.
Meanwhile DENSMORE is hitting up on GIRL 2.
JOHN
So you don't have a phone number?
What do you mean you don't have a
phone number?
GIRL 2
I don't have a phone number. So give
me your number then.
JOHN
I don't have a phone.
Robbie is doing his imitation of a shrimp for ANOTHER GIRL
who's laughing.
GIRL 1
(intrigued, to Jim)
Well, would you leave my name at the
door?
JIM
Well I don't know. What's your name?
GIRL 1
Caprice.
JIM
Caprice? That's the dumbest name I
ever heard.
A look between Jim and Caprice. Pamela pulling Jim away,
gives the girl a look.
JIM
Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do
Anything! Raise your hands if you
understand! Alive, any of you alive --
let's take a poll -- how many of you
know you're really alive!!
The crowd giggles. Jim climbs a pole, yells.
JIM
No one? Raise your hands c'mon man...
let's go.
On the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile.
We IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE
IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote.
JIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears --
a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the
car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum
beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in.
A dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping
up dustdevils.
They're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere
on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent
rocks and cacti...
A football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the
four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the
peyote.
PAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort
her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune.
JIM
Everybody having a good time?
They hug. She throws up again.
JIM
...awright, pretty good, it gets
better.
Jim holds his head. Feels the ride.
JIM
WOA!! It's fast.
JUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows.
Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird.
"Hawk! Hawk!" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune.
Abruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense
torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces,
their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their
teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part.
JIM
When the serpent appears, his head
is ten feet long and five feet wide.
He has one red eye and one green
eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles
long. As he moves -- on his scales
is written all the history of the
world, all people, all actions, all
of us our little pictures on the
scales, God it's big! -- and it's
eating as it moves all the time,
devouring, digesting consciousness,
power, a monster of energy!
John shutters -- as does Robbie and Ray. Jim seems possessed.
JIM
We must kiss the snake on the tongue,
if it senses our fear, it will eat
us instantly. But if we kiss it
without fear, the snake will take us
through the garden and out the gate.
To our freedom -we must ride this
snake. To the end of time.
Pause. He has instilled a flux of fear in the group.
JOHN
I think I'm fucked up. I'm not
thinking right.
JIM
You're fucked up John. Go with it,
confusion is the sound of creation.
JOHN
You should see your eyes right now,
you're death. Look at your eyes --
you're crazy man, you look crazy.
You scare me.
JIM
No no no John John. God is crazy
too. God is part insane as well as
sane. Not in control all the time.
Dionysus was the God of the wine. He
made ecstasy but he also made madness.
Madness is all right. That's what
you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's
that joint?
ROBBIE
(crying)
I get scared thinking of all the
choices inside. I could go. I could
stay. I can live anywhere. I could
die now if I wanted. It's limitless
choice... and no one cares.
JIM
Die Robbie.
JOHN
What the fuck!
PAM
(wandering in)
I don't know what I am. I'm on the
cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn.
Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn
domestic and safe, so I don't know
which one to be.
Jim looking at her, smiles.
JIM
I love you.
DOROTHY
(into the same lens)
Oh my God, the light, it's so
beautiful Ray. Can you see it...
it's all one... honey?
Ray has his head buried in his hands.
RAY
I'm in pain man. I want something
from the peyote. I feel the universe
functioning perfectly but I'm still
perfectly locked inside myself.
Instead of Oneness, I feel total
Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain...
Jim, all I feel is pain.
JIM
Pain makes me feel more alive Ray.
Pain is meant to wake us up. People
try to hide their pain but they're
wrong.
JOHN
I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything
I can, and I know it will never be
enough.
JIM
(whispers)
Pam wants you.
(normal)
You're a good Catholic John, you
want it so you can feel guilty about
it... Fuck death away John.
ROBBIE
I feel Fear... so bad I just numb
out all my feelings. I'm afraid of
my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I
wish I could play my guitar.
JIM
Maybe you should kill your father
Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill
him!
ROBBIE
I'm so fucking scared.
JIM
But you're Alive! It's beautiful!
Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know
all our feelings before we can come
out the other side free men. Don't
feel ashamed of yourselves, don't
let society destroy your reality.
Our freedom's the only thing worth
dying for, it's the only thing worth
living for!
He takes Ray and Robbie's hands, his voice calming them,
reform the circle. John hesitant. Not all will enter the
gates at evening.
JOHN
(cold sweats)
I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared
Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is
coming on.
JIM
Then use us John, use our strength,
it's us four now, a tribe of warriors,
everything we have comes from the
same source, the great Creator of
Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the
snake. . . I promise you I will be
with you till the end of time.
Pulling John into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk
to the desert floor, Jim making wild Indian sounds, deep-
throated "shoooh... shoooh"... now humming a song from the
desert.
JIM
My wild love went riding... mmmmmm.
She rode all the day. She ride to
the devil. And ask for him to pay...
shooo shoooo
The OTHERS join in his chant, the four rising and falling
like a collective breath.
JIM
(ad lib)
...she went to the desert she went
to the sea Joseph we did see...
Suddenly Jim breaks and rises out of the circle. Ray, Robbie,
John, all looking at him. The same need. Pamela, the
desperation of her eyes.
JIM
(to himself)
...I'm lying to you. I am scared.
He goes, his boots in the sand.
JOHN
Jim, where are you going.
JIM
(looking back)
I'll be back. I gotta go alone.
Pamela calling from another dune, far away.
PAM
Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't
go away.
His POV -- of her, receding. She screams for him. He's in
pain. Cannot help her.
A BIRD of prey in the sky.
Jim moving across a lunar landscape. SPECIAL EFFECT: The sun
is black like night or else white in a black sky. Voices in
the distance. "Jim, where are you going?" A mother's voice,
a father's voice.
DOORS SONG
Can you picture what will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate
land
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children are
insane: waiting for the summer rain
FLASHBACKS
An OLD WOMAN is beckoning to him from an opening in the face
of the mountain... then she's gone.
JIM bounds towards the crevice.
JIM exits the cave.
MATCH CUT TO:
The DOORS go sailing out, followed by one of their drums,
JOHN and ROBBIE restraining Jim from going back in.
JIM
TAKE A LONG LOOK OLD MAN. WE ARE THE
FUTURE. WE ARE THINGS TO COME.
JERRY
FUCK YOU... YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD!
Wanting to come after Jim but restrained now by the RECORD
MOGULS, HOLZMAN and ROTHCHILD.
PAUL
Come on Jerry, cool it, cool it...
he's a kid, it's a song about dying,
changing...
JAC HOLZMAN pushing past to Ray. Pamela separating Jim
visually from Jerry.
JOHN
(to RAY and ROBBIE)
We'll never work again man. The Mafia
controls all these clubs.
HOLZMAN
(to Ray and Robbie)
Quite a night! Hi, I'm Jac Holzman.
I own Elektra Records.
RAY
(knows the name)
Oh sure, hi.
Holzman pauses, a dramatic presence, six foot two, impeccably
dressed, he knows the weight of his words.
HOLZMAN
Listen... I think if you could just
put what you did in there on record,
we could really have something...
and we could make a lot of money...
It hangs there. Impossible words.
RAY
Yeah?
John and Robbie sharing looks.
HOLZMAN
(pointing to ROTHCHILD
coming up)
Yeah... and Rothchild here was born
to be your producer.
ROBBIE
(recognizing Paul)
Hey, the guy that did Butterfield!
PAUL
Bertold Brecht, cabaret and rock.
Give me a fucking break. You guys
are amazing! Let's go make a record.
JIM
(to Ray, pointing
back at Jerry)
Hey, is that asshole gonna pay us?
HOLZMAN
(amused)
Why don't you go inside and ask him
Jim?
Strains of LIGHT MY FIRE cross the cut.
DAY (1967)
LIGHT MY FIRE continues.
DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of the "Human Be-In", the "Summer of
Love" -- swarming FLOWER CHILDREN, WAR PROTESTORS.
A staged 16mm. grainy shot of JIM and PAMELA, RAY and DOROTHY,
JOHN, ROBBIE and their TWO NEW GIRLFRIENDS wandering thru
the CROWD sharing the spirit. Pam and Jim fool around --
laughing -- tickling each other for the home movie camera
shot by Ray... Pam is goofy, makes funny faces, teases him
running a flower under his nose, thru his hair, then trips
him. He chases her across the lawn.
Screaming FANS chase the DOORS to a commercial airplane,
scribbling autographs. One of the GIRLS smacking JIM on the
lips as he laughs, her cameras clicking. PAMELA shooting a
home movie of it, pushed aside by the crowd, rescued by ROBBIE
and the new young manager, BILL SIDDONS...
DOORS SONG
Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why
The City as seen by:
A LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the Ed Sullivan Marquee.
The sidewalk is mobbed with FANS, mostly YOUNG GIRLS.
DOORS SONG
Oh moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good ol mama
We must have whiskey oh you know why
SNOW on the streets... a group of DRUGGIES staggering in the
snowbanks, throwing snowballs, stupid giggling, wheezing
puffs of cold air...
Jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on
it.
IRIS SHOTS continue -- PAMELA laughing battily with TOM BAKER
who's putting the make on her... The COUNT is on heroin.
JIM passing a vodka bottle back and forth with NICO hitting
a stash of ups. They fall in the snow, mad Russian winter.
DOORS SONG
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone
(SONG REPEATS OVER)
JIM is wrestled across the lot, pinned to the car and
handcuffed, punched and thrown into the car, yelling.
Journalists try to intercede, one is also arrested.
JIM
YOU'RE SLAVES. YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF
SLAVES. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING TO ME
MAN, THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU!!!
A SNOWBALL smashes against the glass. COPS coming out with
sticks.
A RIOT brewing. A HUNDRED TEENAGERS sallying back and forth
on the sidewalk, taunting the cops. A dozen of them have
already been arrested.
KIDS
LET JIM GO!!! MORRISON! MORRISON! WE
WANT MORRISON!
COPS
GET OUTTA HERE! GO HOME. GO ON NOW!
COPS chase the KIDS with sticks. But just as it looks like
it's going to get out of hand, JIM appears at the doors of
the station, stepping out between RAY and the DOORS and
SIDDONS. He signals his freedom, arms in the air.
CROWD
MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON! MOR-RI-SON!
Jim waves, does a small pained victory jig in front of the
thwarted Gestapo, ribcage and spleen hurting.
CROWD
JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM JIM...
RAY
(aside to Robbie)
He could go all the way man! In five
years he could be in the White House.
Another JFK.
Robbie's look tells us he thinks Ray is as much caught up in
his dreams as Jim.
CUT TO:
FLASHBULBS hits us full frame as:
JIM walks the dawn streets. Classic image -- jeans, boots,
jacket, the sun starting to rise on the smog and translucent
pink light along Santa Monica Boulevard outside the cheap
Alta Cienega Motel where he lives... PEACE FROG shoots us
through.
DOORS SONG
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
The bloody red sun of phantastic L.A.
Over the SONG, a MONTAGE of the 60's passing to its darker
side.
DOCUMENTARY IMAGES
MARTIN LUTHER KING assassinated, BOBBY KENNEDY gunned down,
PEGGY FLEMMING ice skating at the Olympics; A QUAKER burns
himself to death protesting the war in Vietnam; B-52 bombs
dropped on CAMBODIA; KENT STATE erupts; CHARLES MANSON is
arrested.
JIM, loose, wanders right into the traffic, waving to anybody,
trying to hitch a ride. DOG and the OTHERS going after him.
Jim seen slipping a tablet from his pocket into his mouth.
JIM
(to no one in
particular)
I LOVE L.A. -- the best neon. City
of Night! City of Light... why are
you going to work? You're not slaves,
you're free, cars, you're free...
TOM catching up to him.
TOM
Awright shaddup Morrison, just cause
you don't gotta work.
(going into his pocket)
Give me some of your money, asshole,
and I'll yell anything you fucking
want.
MIKE
(coming up)
What was that speckled motherfucker
you just took? Give me some!
JIM
(yielding, to Tom)
You gotta fail to succeed Tom, gotta
surrender to the waiting tides.
Moving through traffic. Horns honking, incessant insanity.
RAY and DOROTHY take their vows in front of a HIPPIE PRIEST.
ROBBIE and JOHN and their WIVES-TO-BE, and OTHERS from the
BAND look on.
PAMELA is all decked out in her best, wedding clothes, red
satins from Morocco, five-inch clog heels, flowers in her
hair. Looking around pissed as:
HIPPIE PRIEST
(ad lib)
Awright, the vibrations are right
now, I feel peace and love here today,
I feel a grooviness coming on, do
you Ray Manzarek take your lady
love... (etc.) fill the white wings
of death, scatter your ashes
forever...
JIM slinks up through the trees, alone, quiet, changing faces
to face them as SUMMER'S ALMOST GONE plays sinuously.
DOORS SONG
Summer's almost gone
Where will we be
When the summer's gone?
RAY
(aside)
Where the fuck you been man?
JIM
Man, I been here all the time...
over there watching. I'm really happy
for you Ray you found life...
He smiles innocently. Ray, a beat, turns away. Pam coming
over, squeezes his hand, sweetly, no fights today, she's his
lady.
PAM and JIM and the labrador SAGE trudge up a hill carrying
the groceries to their modest little house tucked into a
hill of dangling eucaplyptus trees. We sense a community of
artists, hippies, Volkswagens.
PAM
It's only another $95,000 but I could
get the best clothes. From India,
Morocco Jim, clothes you can't find
anywhere, we could get the richest
people to come, Miles Davis, Cher,
the Stones, it's gonna be the best
boutique on La Cienega Jim... why
are we walking, how come we don't
have a car?
JIM
...cause you lost it. It's fun to
walk, isn't it.
PAM
...that was months ago. We got another
car.
JIM
Which car?
PAM
The red one with the black interior.
Remember it was a shift and I didn't
like it. What happened to it?
JIM
Oh yeah... I wrecked it.
PAM
Oh Jim! Damn! Where's the Gravy Train?
Whatsamatter? What are you on? You
promised you wouldn't drink today.
JIM
No Ma I ain't drinking.
PAM
You're not gonna drink any more are
you Jim.
JIM
No Ma I ain't.
PAM
And you're gonna change those stinky
leathers you been wearing for three
weeks.
JIM
I don't know 'bout that.
PAM
What the hell are you on?
JIM
Uh -- just some low grade acid. It's
not heavy.
(whispers)
Pam, read my mind.
PAM
Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I
made the duck! People are coming!
Ray and Dorothy think we're flaky
enough and I... you said you'd wait
till after, you're going to peak
before me.
JIM
Hey it's okay, it's okay... come on,
we'll trip and then eat our feast.
PAM
Yeah sure.
Putting down the bags at their porch, pausing. He moves to
her, kisses her, conciliatory and gentle.
JIM
Come on baby, y'know it's a good
thing for Ray and Dorothy I think
women are such noble creatures --
they carry on your name with dignity
after you die.
(spawning like minnows)
PAM
What are you saying? You wanna marry
me Jim?
JIM
(elusively)
I think women basically have a comic
approach to life -- I mean how can
they not when they look up in the
dark and see a dangling penis, seeking
entry. It looks like a face y'know --
little beard "Hi mom"
(Pam giggling now)
I wanna get inside you. Look around.
(humming)
"Do the funky chicken, do dah, dah,
funky chicken do da da "love my girl" --
She's cracking up now. As he takes the acid out, holds it in
front of her like a sacrament.
JIM
Let's go wild child, let's get out
there Romeo and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe
and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam,
rock and roll
(a poem)
...all the poetry has wolves in it,
but one Pam -- the most beautiful
one of all -- dances in a ring of
fire and throws off the challenge
with a shrug
As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows.
PAM
(romantic)
I like it when you sing to me
JIM
'cause I'm the poet and you're my
muse
Strains of YOU'RE LOST, LITTLE GIRL drift in, setting a more
ominous tone.
THOUSANDS OF FANS roaring "DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!"
VOICE
(loudspeaker)
Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles
California -- The DOORS!
SIDDONS
(in crush)
Jim! Your Mom's here with your
brother. What do you want me to do
with 'em?
JIM
(shakes his head)
HIDE ME!!!
HARD CUT TO:
Madness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried.
As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and
does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style,
one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle.
The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting
giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and
short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards
in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim
to communicate with his audience.
JIM & DOORS
There's been a slaughter here
Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town we're going
on the run
And you're the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do
But run, run, run
Let's run, let's run...
SIDDONS yelling at MIKE, the roadie.
SIDDONS
Vice Squad says one more "fuck or
shit" they're gonna close us down
man.
MIKE
Stick my dick in their ear!
Jim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening
for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman-like state,
weird spiralling chords carrying over the following MONTAGE
of hallucinatory insanity.
JIM & DOORS
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still...
A POV up at the house -- into which JIM enters. The lights
are on. Sage at the door sniffing.
Jim's struggling to break through the barrier of cops.
JIM
(yelling)
The mansion is warm at the top of
the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts
there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
You won't know a thing till you get
inside
BACK TO:
PAM runs out into Laurel Canyon like a terrified doe running
from a forest fire. SONG beat NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH
continues.
Jim and Mike driving drunk, fucking TWO BLACK CHICKS. Mike
in the back seat. Jim drives the car up onto the grass of a
Police Station and plows right into it.
Knowing who's inside, sufficient be it to see the blue Shelby
Mustang plow into a telephone pole on Santa Monica Blvd.
JIM & THE DOORS
Dead President's corpse in the
driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very
far
To the East to meet the Czar...
JIM, mind totally gone into his trance, spreading his arms
like wings, hopping from one foot to the other like a shaman
around his microphone, whirling, yelling out great rewards
for the tribe. Plentiful antelope, healthy corn.
The kids are going wild -- writhing like maenads in his
intoxicating embrace. Embers from an enormous BONFIRE drift
past the stadium lights into the night. But the KIDS,
increasingly frustrated by a barrage of COPS, cannot see
their leader and now push against the cops with the very
result the authorities seek to repress.
JIM & DOORS
Who lives in a well by the side of
the road
Wake up girl! We're almost home
We shall see the gates by morning
We shall be inside by evening
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Moon, moon, moon!
RAY, gone into his own trance, happening to look up from his
keyboard. His eyes widen.
His POV -- an INDIAN SHAMAN hovers over the microphone.
Cloaked in hides, his face obscured by a horned headdress
with colored tails and feathers streaming down his shoulders,
rattles in each fist, the BONFIRE glowing...
JIM & DOORS
I will GET YOU
Soon -- soooooooon... SOOOOOOONNNN...
The COPS can't hold. TEENAGE SHOCK TROOPS hitting the stage,
clambering up. The stage becoming a riot. Cops wading in
with sticks. ROADIES and BODYGUARDS yanking the MUSICIANS
from their places...
JIM
(indifferent, to
himself)
I am the Lizard King I can do anything
As DOG hauls the shaman king off in a bearhug, smiling stoned,
immaculate.
PAM's mascara is running from her eyes, begging to get in.
The BLACK MAID cleaning the adjacent room overheard,
unsurprised.
PAM
Jim, I gotta talk! Let me in please.
I gotta talk.
JIM
Now Pam sweetheart, I'm busy.
Pamela listening at the door. She's on the second story of a
cheap motel overlooking a boring parking lot on the edge of
La Cienega.
PAM
Jim, I know there's someone in there,
I can't believe you're doing this
again. You're disgusting.
INTERCUTS TO:
PLANE taxiing up. TWO POLICE CARS, red lights revolving, are
waiting.
ANITA BRYANT & JACKIE GLEASON at the NATIONAL DECENCY RALLY.
A large CROWD in the vicinity of 100,000. NIXON addressing
them.
JIM & DOORS SONG
(OVER)
The face in the mirror won't stop
The girl in the window won't stop
A feast of friends alive she cried
Waiting for me
Outside!
MONTAGE -- NEWSPAPER HEADLINES SPIN OUT:
JIMMI HENDRIX OVERDOSES IN LONDON.
JANIS JOPLIN OVERDOSES IN LOS ANGELES.
A ROLLING STONE WANTED POSTER ON JIM -- "In the County of
Dade/Dead -- Did He Or Didn't He?".
JIM & DOORS SONG
(OVER)
Before I sink into the big sleep
I want to hear
The scream of the butterfly
Come back baby
Back into my arms
TWO HUNDRED PERSONS are gathered on the lawn outside, banners
decrying the Doors. A MIDDLE AGED SPEAKER, clean cut, squarely
dressed, expresses his outrage.
SPEAKER
(bullhorn)
...endorsed by President Richard
Nixon!
(cheers)
The immoral conduct of degenerates
such as Jim Morrison is an
unacceptable insult to this country
and the principles for which it
stands...
JIM & DOORS
(OVER)
We're getting tired of hanging around
Waiting around with our heads to the ground
I hear the gentle sound
Very near yet very far
Very soft, yeah, very clear
Come today, come today
JIM
Well uh, it's designed to wear you
down y'know... when that rap sheet
says the "United States of America
versus You" it takes you down day by
day, specially when no one really
gives a shit about, y'know, the First
Amendment that's on trial here...
Nobody says anything about that,
it's just uh did you take your pants
off y'know, I mean that's not what
it's about, it's about freedom, that's
what it's about... but who cares,
right? Freedom exists in a schoolbook.
REPORTER 1
(disinterested)
...but the promoters are cancelling
your shows, will this affect the way
you play?
JIM
Well, I can only open doors, M'am. I
can't drag people thru 'em. I'm no
savior.
REPORTER 2
But you've called yourself a shaman?
JIM
(beat, pained)
Did I? Well, I'll tell ya, my words
stand a far better chance of being
around a hundred years from now than
my waistline.
As he goes into the courtroom, a dolled up REPORTER 1, the
local anchor-lady turns to her camera.
ANCHORLADY
The question that will be answered
today: Did Jim Morrison or did he
not take off his pants last March?
This is...
JIM dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the
20th floor rooftop -- wind blowing thru his wild hair, the
card zooming by like racer lights on Sunset below. The song
LA WOMAN continues born from this renewed feeling of danger.
JIM & DOORS
Well I just got into town 'bout an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
PAM screaming for him to come back from the edge as TOM BAKER
and MIKE and DOG and a CAMERAMAN film in 16mm.
PAM
JIM! PLEASE GODDAMIT!! COME BACK IN
PLEASE!!
JIM yelling back, as he drinks from a pint of whiskey,
enjoying himself enormously.
JIM
Whatcha worried about? I like it out
here.
He feigns a fall.
PAM
NOOOOOO!!
RAY and SIDDONS arrive, terrified, looking for him.
JIM
(laughing at Pam)
Life on the edge baby. Come get me
if you love me baby.
PAM
PLEASE GODDAMIT JIM MORRISON I'M NOT
GONNA KILL MYSELF FOR YOU. GET IN
HERE.
Jim cracking up with laughter. BAKER, drunk and the FILM
CREW love it, swishpanning with a cheap sungun.
MIKE
(dancing)
We got it man! Keep going. Great get
a two shot.
BAKER
GO ON GET OUT THERE PAM.
Pam is sufficiently cracked on her own set of drugs to start
climbing out onto the ledge, skirts blowing in the wind.
PAM
JIM MORRISON GODDAMIT I LOVE YOU I
WANT YOU I NEED YOU.
Jim moving further along the ledge.
JIM
(raw)
YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S BULLSHIT! YOU LOVE
ME THEN COME AND GET ME.
JIM & DOORS
(OVER)
LA Woman (X2)
LA Woman Sunday afternoon (X3)
Drive thru your suburbs
Into your blues (X2)
Into your blue-blue
Blues
Into your blues
Siddons and Ray terrified. Is this the night it's finally
going to end in a suicide plunge? Ray trying to stop Pam,
too late.
RAY
Pam!! Oh shit... get the ambulances
man...
Pam's moving shakily along the ledge, cracked on downers.
Jim watching her come, amazed at her risk.
RAY
(yelling down)
JIM! HELP HER. She's gonna fall.
TOM
Jump!
He watches, does nothing.
JIM
Come on baby, come on.
RAY
(trying another tack)
Jim we gotta finish "LA Woman".
JIM
Don't have an ending Ray.
Reaches his hand out. She is closer. But shaky.
RAY
(white)
They're both gonna die... ARE YOU
HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!!
Ray goes after Tom Baker and the Film Crew. A scuffle.
Yelling, shouting, but down below in the intimacy of the
ledge, blowing out on the edge, the wind and the world and
death. Two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of
the Chateau reach their hands out for each other.
JIM
Come on baby, come on
PAM
(quoting him)
"...but one, the most beautiful one
of all -- dances in a ring of fire --
"
JIM
(raw singing)
"I see your hair is burning. If they
say I never loved you, you know they
are a liar!"
PAM
"...and throws off the challenge
with a shrug"
JIM
All the poetry has wolves in it Pam!!!
She has never been so concentrated, inching closer to him.
Her heels overhanging oblivion.
PAM
I don't wanna die with you Jim
Morrison, I don't wanna die!
JIM & DOORS
Never saw a woman
So alone (X2)
So alone -- lone lone
JIM
C'mon Pam, this is it! We'll do it
right here! Right now! You and me!
Ray, Tom, Siddons, Mike, Dog, they all watch in horror,
sensing it will happen. They have even stopped filming.
Inches... inches.
He dodges her touch, confused... to the last possible second.
Then SHE'S THERE -- in his arms. Her arms latch around him
and she hugs him with all her wiry soul.
PAM
Jim -- let's go, let's leave this
town! You and me! Never come back.
JIM
(demonic)
We can. Right now. Just one more
step...
PAM
No Jim. I want to LIVE with you. I
want to LIVE with you.
The two lovers huddled together on the ledge. He slips his
head down on her lap, looking up into her eyes with the
strangest tears in his eyes.
JIM
(a poem)
There was preserved in her the fresh
miracle of surprise... clothed in
sunlight restless in wanting dying
of fever married to doubt how it has
changed you how slowly estranged you
solely arranged you beg for your
mercy -- OR -- ...but all will pass
lie down in green grass and smile
and muse and gaze upon her smooth
resemblance to the mating-Queen who
it seems is in love with the horseman
Tomorrow we enter the tomb of my
birth I want to be ready.
On her face -- moved. Pause. LA WOMAN floods in on his smile,
an upbeat surge.
Upstairs, the ONLOOKERS relax. HOTEL MANAGEMENT and COPS are
now rushing up in background.
JIM & DOORS
Mr. Mojo Rising
Mr. Mojo Risin' (X2)
DISSOLVE TO:
There's music rocking from the inside. Cables and baffles
run from the second story down to the rehearsal room on the
first.
JIM & DOORS
Keep on risin'
Got to keep on risin'
Risin' Risin' (X8)
MONTAGE: Moving, moving, moving -- all the POVS from fast-
moving CARS travelling with the pace of L.A. Song of freedom,
of escape -- the STRIP, the cars, the freeway, the
BILLBOARDS... farewell L.A.
JIM drives up in his beaten GTO MUSTANG, top down, bags all
over the place, hops out. Carrying his bulk with grace, knocks
and rings. RIDERS ON THE STORM starting to play over.
He spots them, crossing to the YARD where a CHILDREN'S
BIRTHDAY is in progress -- TWO DOZEN KIDS, a CLOWN acting
out for them. A few parents and friends -- ROBBIE and LYNNE,
their kid, JOHN and his RECENT LADY, their kid...
When the KIDS spot JIM they light up.
JIM
Hey -- am I late or is this the cool
remnant of a dream?
KIDS
(rushing to him)
Eee! Jim! It's Uncle Jim... Come
on... what did you bring me Jim...
JIM
(picks up Robin)
How's my girl! And how's my boy!
They stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head. A
bearded Santa Claus now engulfed with kids, though puffy,
body gone, a literal physical wreck, yet a gentle pathos
about him and still a charisma that the children react to
without thinking. He gives out the presents all over.
JIM
(ad libs)
For you... Pancho gets this one...
Melanie -- yours... Hey Dorothy don't
grab now... open that one, that's
yours... keep your paws off that
now...
As RAY and ROBBIE and JOHN and the others circle him.
JIM
(to Robin, a 5 year
old)
...and to you, princess, from your
Royal servant, James Douglas Morrison
(bows)
As ROBIN, the cutest of them all, a bow in her hair, takes
the package, opens it.
RAY
You wanna hear the new mixes on "LA
WOMAN?"...
JIM
No, I gotta plane to catch.
JOHN
Won't take long man, it's the best
one since "Days".
ROBBIE
We added rain to "Riders", come on.
Jim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner
room, his eyes on ROBIN opening the gift -- a beautiful,
ANTIQUE DOLL of an 19th century poet -- rock star, stuffed,
velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be Byron
or it could be Jim Morrison -- in fact the hair is perfectly
weaved to resemble Jim in his young lion phase -- an ironic
gift, meant from the heart. It stops everybody -- they all
look. A haunted quality to the doll.
KID
Ugh! What's that!
ROBIN
(to Jim)
It's you.
JIM
Forever young...
She kisses him.
ROBIN
Oh it's beautiful... Thank you Uncle
Jim.
JIM, a bearded Santa Claus with the birthday hat on his head,
surrounded by the GIRLS and BOYS and DOROTHY shooting a home
movie. They're eating birthday cake but UNCLE JIM is drinking
straight from the cognac bottle -- a strange sight.
JIM
(to Robin)
So what are you gonna be when you
grow up?
ROBIN
I wanna be your wife
He laughs, looks at Dorothy who's shooting him with the Super
8.
JIM
I don't know, can I afford you? Pam
kinda wiped me out with her dress
store y'know...
ROBIN
I'll make my own dresses and you'll
see, I'll be the best wife.
DOROTHY
(nodding)
You'll never be alone Jim.
JIM
(to Dorothy)
You know I've never been happier.
Not as much of a rush as I used to
be in y'know... this is the strangest
life I've ever known.
His eyes on a LITTLE BOY who's walking into the party, sitting
down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on
his head. Clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems
familiar. Jim is not sure, woozy from the cognac. As he fades.
We saw the Boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in
the Arizona desert.
Jim's head falling gently into his folded arms on the table,
the cognac bottle at his elbow, merlin hat on, beard, the
kids laughing, pulling his ears and nose -- he doesn't wake
up.
TIME CUT TO:
As Ray comes over now, rouses him gently.
RAY
Gotta plane to catch man?
Jim coming awake in that instant alert way of his, but
obviously hung over.
JIM
O?... splittling headache from which
the future is made.
Puzzling remark, He gets up, shaky, exits, kids tearing at
him. Goodbyes.
The beach is behind them, the last of the frisbee players
and dogs, the skaters go by, as we continue to hear RIDERS
from within.
RAY
Is Pam really there in Paris waiting?
JIM
(ironic, head hurts)
Sure. The Count's there so where
else would she be? Gotta try to start
over, without all the hassles, y'know.
I think we can.
RAY
I never knew what you saw in that
nightmare chick man.
JIM
Well she is kinda flakey -- like me.
I mean she's just so vulnerable about
everything. It makes me sad man.
(pause)
But she's always kinda believed in
something about me y'know -- her
little picture of me as the unsung
poet -- and it's a fantasy I kinda
dig y'know, 'stead of the one I live.
RAY
I don't know man, I don't wanna sound
like your old man but you're only
27, you're living like you gotta get
it all in, you gotta slow down man,
you did it, you broke thru to the
other side.
JIM
We didn't break thru Ray, we just
pushed things a little. When you
really break thru, there's nothing
left. No music, no Doors, no God,
nothing -- only a will to power.
RAY
I don't believe that. You were an
American prince, man -- with overbred
genes --
(Jim scoffs, laughs)
No! What could've been Jim? You
could've been President.
(Jim cracks up)
No man! What could've been Jim? We
stood here on this beach on the edge
of the Pacific that crazy summer day
in '65 -- and we knew, you and I, we
knew we were at the edge of the mind.
we were there, man. One planet, one
globe, one mind. Consciousness, we
raised it, we were there.
Jim, not the sentimental type, climbs in his car, amused.
JIM
And now what?
RAY
Now?
(smiles, lethally
sweet)
You've made me into Ishmael. I am
the last survivor of the Pequod. And
I exist only to tell the story of
Ahab who fought the black whale.
JIM
(loves it, laughs)
It was white Ray. You gotta stop
harpin' on that day. I was so ripped
I can hardly remember it.
Ignites engine. Ray leans in, lightening up.
RAY
Hey, what was that poem you once
wrote about two chicks on the pier?
JIM
Come on man, I gotta fly.
RAY
Come on. Just once.
JIM
(VOICE OVER, pulling
out the car)
In that year we had a great
Visitation of energy
Back in those days
Everything was simpler and more
confused
One summer night, going to the pier
I ran into two young girls
The blonde was called Freedom
The dark one Enterprise
We talked
And they told me this story.
As he departs, waving.
RAY
(OVER)
What was the story?
His point of view -- Jim receding into the sun in his mustang --
making a shakey, screeching curve at the bend of the beach.
And he's gone. An ominous ROAR of an AIRPLANE above RAY. --
flying away.
The PLANE flies off into the setting ball of red sun.
His face etching into a perfect Alexandrine bust of physical
beauty. The camera moving to reveal, a wintry day, leaves
blowing, the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery, the
crumbling tombs, the flowers fresh and dead around Jim's
tomb, the graffiti, wine bottles, Wilde, Bizet, Piaf, Chopin,
Morrison...
JIM
(OVER)
No more money, no more fancy dress
this other kingdom seems by far the
best until its other jaw reveals
incest and loose obedience to a
vegetable law. I will not go I prefer
a feast of friends to the giant
family...
The MUSIC rolling up on:
