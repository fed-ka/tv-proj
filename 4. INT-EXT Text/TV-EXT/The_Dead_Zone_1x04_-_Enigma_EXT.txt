          Johnny in workout clothes is surveying a half-dozen large
          plants in huge pots.  He's got a pair of gardening shears
          in one hand, but doesn't really know what he's doing.  He
          inexpertly clips off a browned and unhealthy looking leaf,
          then keeps moves to the next plant.  SARAH appears from
          around the side of the house, having just arrived.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.

          She moves up next to him as he clips another few leaves.

                                        SARAH
                                (re: his big date)
                        So?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (feigns ignorance)
                        "So?"

                                        SARAH
                                (insinuating)
                        So...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (mock lascivious)
                        So.

                                        SARAH
                                (amazed)
                        No.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (admitting)
                        No.

          Sarah suddenly turns to leave -- as if that's all she
          wanted to know.

                                        SARAH
                        See ya!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where are you going?

          Sarah mock scowls and turns back to him.

                                        SARAH
                        Did you like her or not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's not to like?

                                        SARAH
                        Are you going to call her again?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I hadn't planned on it.

          Sarah is taken aback.

                                        SARAH
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because I can pull back the veils
                        of space and time, remember?

                                        SARAH
                                  (realizing)
                        You saw the future.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And it wasn't pretty.

          Sarah is peeved.

                                        SARAH
                        You mean she wasn't pretty?  You
                        saw her old and gray and past her
                        prime and you panicked--

                                        JOHNNY
                          --Finished? 
                                (beat)
                        Thanks.

          Sarah reconsiders.

                                        SARAH
                        All relationships hit speed bumps. 
                        Maybe you just had a vision of a
                        speed bump.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  It was a brick wall.

                                        SARAH
                        Then jump over.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you so eager to pair me
                        off?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - TEASER - REV. 4/15/02 - GOLD   8.

          Sarah is completely genuine.

                                        SARAH
                        So I don't have to think of you
                        as "available" anymore.

          Johnny is taken aback.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh.  Is that how you think of me
                        now?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.

          The moment between them is suddenly interrupted by the
          arrival of BRUCE and ARTHUR -- who is in his seventies,
          with white-hair and old-style, wire-rimmed glasses.  Both
          wear workout clothes.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi, Sarah.
                                (to Johnny)
                        How'd it go last night?

          Johnny and Sarah both shoot him a "don't ask" look.

                                        BRUCE
                        What a surprise.
                                (re: Arthur)
                        Johnny Smith, this is Arthur Allen,
                        your new gym partner.

          Johnny raises an eyebrow -- what is Bruce up to?



          Johnny and Arthur are doing slow, methodical "walking
          lunges" as Bruce follows along side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't help you.

                                        BRUCE
                        Just like I tried to tell--

                                        ARTHUR
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir...

                                        ARTHUR
                          --Arthur.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Arthur.  It doesn't sound like
                        you saw a real person.  You
                          might've had a kind of waking
                        dream or a memory or something--

          Arthur stops lunging and Johnny follows suit.

                                        ARTHUR
                        --I'm not crazy.

                        The mind plays tricks.

          Bruce is eager to dissuade Arthur from his obsession.

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen to the man.  Man's got the
                          trickiest mind ever.  He knows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right.

                                        BRUCE

                        It's not possible to see a woman
                        who disappeared on you fifty-five
                        years ago--

                                        ARTHUR

                          --Midtown Manhattan, getting into
                        a cab.  She hadn't aged a day--

                          --Plastic surgery couldn't even
                        do that.  Maybe voodoo--

                        nothing else to talk about in

                                        ARTHUR
                        I like it here.

                        So do I.  But there's not a lot
                        happening.

                                        ARTHUR
                        You just don't know where to go.

          Johnny is suddenly exasperated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Arthur, maybe you can show Bruce
                        exactly where to go.

          He heads off toward the house.  Bruce catches up.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sotto)
                        Since when do I have a "your

                        porch?

                                (sotto)
                        He insisted.  And I thought maybe
                        you could find a way to put his
                        mind at ease.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Really.  He's looking for the
                        lost love of his life?

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        He isn't going to find it in some
                        fantasy about the past.

          Johnny suddenly catches himself -- that description could
          just as well fit him, and Bruce knows it.  Johnny glances
          back at Arthur, standing forlornly on the grass.  Johnny
          sighs and moves back to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, Arthur.  I'm sorry I
                          couldn't do anything for you.

                                        ARTHUR
                                  (disappointed)
                        Don't worry about it.

          Arthur puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder, which sends Johnny
          into a vision.



          Johnny is in the SLOW MOTION scene, watching as elderly
          Arthur, standing beneath a street clock in the middle of
          a Manhattan street, a paper cup of coffee in his hand,
          stares in surprise toward a taxicab.  Getting into the
          taxi, her face only partly glimpsed, is a stunningly lovely
          young woman.  The taxi door closes, taking her from view;
          the coffee cup falls from Arthur's hands, and hits the
          street.  Johnny stares at the look of absolute shock on
          his face.  Then he looks once again at the tantalizing
          profile of the young woman as the cab pulls away.  The
          vision ends.



          Johnny's hand falls away from Arthur's shoulder.  He stares
          at the old man, reacting to the intensity of emotions in
          the vision he just saw.  And the mystery of the young
          woman.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          of a beautiful young woman circa 1945.  The resemblance
          to the face of the girl glimpsed by Johnny in his previous
          vision is unmistakable.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Is this her?

          REVEAL we are:



          Johnny, small travel bag over his shoulder, is walking
          with Sarah toward her SUV parked at the curb.

                                        SARAH
                          I thought you didn't do ghosts.

                        She's not a "ghost."  And I'm not
                        "doing" her.

                                        SARAH
                        Then what is she?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Probably a combination of his
                        memory and his imagination.

                                        SARAH
                        Might as well be a ghost.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or maybe his old sweetheart is
                        back in the City.  But when he
                        saw her as a seventy-five year
                        old woman, he didn't recognize
                        her.  Not consciously anyway.

                                        SARAH
                        So his unconscious mind showed
                        him the next best thing?   

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shrugs)
                        Maybe.  The least I can do is go
                        to the scene of the crime and see
                        what I see.
                                (beat)
                          Besides, I can lose myself in New
                        York.

                                        SARAH
                        Tired of being Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tired of everybody knowing I'm
                        Johnny.  As if they know what to
                        expect.

                                        SARAH
                          I certainly didn't expect you to
                        go to New York chasing after a
                        ghost.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me neither.

          They get into the SUV, Sarah hands Johnny a small wrapped
          gift resting on the front seat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the occasion?

                                        SARAH
                        "Going Away From Sarah Day."
                                (beat)
                        Open it when you get there.

          They exchange a smile -- at once too easy and too
            uncomfortable.





          A narrow street Mid-Town, with a standing street clock on
          the sidewalk in the middle of the block -- just where it
          has stood for most of the last century.  Johnny is beneath
          it, staring at the faces of the passersby.

                                                            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

          As the hours pass, and Johnny waits and watches -- but
          sees no "Abby."  Until the SOUND of a musical JINGLE
          interrupts his mission -- the source is his own travel
          bag.  Puzzled, Johnny locates the wrapped gift Sarah left
          him -- it's jingling.  He opens it, revealing a cell
          phone.  The jingling stops.  A beat, then it starts again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?

          Sarah is watering the pots, talking on her own cell as
          she goes.

                        I think you mean, "thanks for the

                        plants.  How's the clock?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Lonesome.  No sign of Arthur's
                        girl.

          Sarah considers.

                                        SARAH
                        Could she have any friends left
                        in New York?

                                        JOHNNY
                        From the old days?  Probably dead
                        or moved away by now...

          He suddenly stops, his mind working.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quickly)

          She hangs up.  Then her smile fades and a pensive look
          crosses her face -- plain and simply, she still loves him
          too much.

          Johnny punches a number into the cell phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me them all please.

          As he fumbles for a notepad and pen...





          Johnny is wandering, lost and frustrated, finding nothing
          that looks like his vision from the photo.  He's tired,
          disheveled, still lugging the travel bag, but his
          fascination with this "case" -- and Abby -- seems to be
          increasing.

          He spots a nearby bench that wasn't there in 1945, now
          occupied by an elderly, well-dressed man who is feeding
          the birds from a bag of seed.  Johnny sits down on the
          bench next to him and is in a vision.



            Johnny/Tommy, in uniform as always, is standing with Abby,
          who is wearing a different dress from the one seen in the
          photo.  This is another day, and neither Artie nor Rosie
          are anywhere to be seen.

                                        ABBY
                                (anxious)
                        Tommy, I don't understand what
                        you want.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        I want what you want.

                                        ABBY
                        I could lose Artie... my job at
                        the Canteen... I want you to leave
                        me alone.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        If I believed that, I wouldn't be
                        here.  Neither would you.

          At this, Abby is on the move, walking quickly away. 
            Johnny/Tommy catches up to her, taking her arm.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT TWO - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  31.

          There's a charged moment between them -- maybe it's the
          War, maybe her own youth, maybe just his uniform, but
          whatever it is, she surrenders to it.  And they kiss with
          great passion.  She finally breaks it off, they are both
            breathing quickly.

                                        ABBY
                        I have to go.

          This time, Johnny/Tommy doesn't follow.  He watches, his
          own emotions in turmoil -- he's a Ladies' Man, falling in
          love is the last thing he expected.  He sits down on the
          bench.  The vision ends.



          Johnny reacts, amazed at what he's just experienced. 
          There is a sudden MUSICAL JINGLE. 

                                                                                INTERCUT:



          Johnny is beneath it as before, staring at the passing
          faces.  He's pacing, a bit agitated and impatient, far
          more invested in the search than he was only hours ago.

          Then it happens: a TAXI pulls up to the curb.  A lovely
          young woman appears from around a corner, heading quickly
          for the cab.  It's Abby.

          Or maybe it's Abby.  The angle is off, the contemporary
          clothes jarring, but that profile...

          Johnny moves as quickly as possible toward the taxi, but
          he still can't get a clear view.  They reach the door of
          the vehicle simultaneously, and Johnny takes advantage of
          the moment, touching her shoulder with one hand while
          opening the door of the cab with the other, trying to get
          a look at her face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me get that for you.

          And as she turns toward him, as her profile comes into
          view -- he is in a vision.



          The young woman turning toward him is indeed Abby --
          because this is 1945.  Johnny/Tommy has just opened the
          door to a period taxicab for her, and he follows her
          inside.



          Johnny is still standing by the cab, but in the last few
          seconds, "Abby" -- if that's who it was -- has slipped
          into the back seat.  The door slams behind her.  Johnny
          tries to get a closer look through the window, but the
          cab takes off, disappearing up the street.  Johnny watches
          it go.  Then he fumbles for his cell phone, dials.

          FADE IN:


            Establishing.



            Establish the same hotel entrance Johnny saw in the vintage
            newspaper ad.  The sign for the "Swan Song Hotel" is long
          gone, the place is shabby and tired.



          Johnny is staring at the locked grate blocking a stairway
          heading down under the street level.  Trash and broken
          bottles are strewn across the steps.  He considers the
          scene, spotting a commemorative bronze plaque on the wall. 
          He moves to read it:

          DURING ALL THE COMBAT DAYS OF THE WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED
          NATIONS AND THE AXIS POWERS, THE AMERICAN THEATER WING
          STAGE DOOR CANTEEN OCCUPIED THIS SITE.

          Johnny puts his hand on the plaque, then on the wall.  No
          vision.  Frustrated, he turns toward the street and leans
          his back against the stone.  He is in a vision.



            Johnny/Tommy is standing in exactly the same spot against
          the wall as Johnny was.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  44.


    46CONTINUED:46

          Only now there is a globe-shaped light instead of a bronze
          plaque, and it glows with the words "Stage Door Canteen." 
            Johnny/Tommy looks like he's trying to psych himself up
          for a confrontation, as he straightens his tie, brushes
          down his uniform, and turns to descend a set of stairs to
          the Canteen.



            Johnny/Tommy emerges up the stairway, a broken man.  He
          pauses at the top of the stairs, glances up at the glowing
          lantern proclaiming "Stage Door Canteen."  The vision
          ends.



          Johnny comes out of his vision, still wracked by the
            emotions.  He looks dazed.  His cell phone vibrates in
          his pocket.  He pulls it out.

          Sarah gets out of the SUV in front of her house, slamming
          the door shut.  She's on the cell phone, her voice excited.

                                        SARAH
                        -- Apparently, she was.  Which
                        means "Abigail Travers" was
                          probably her stage name.

          OFF Johnny's reaction as this sinks in.



          Johnny and Arthur step out of the cab.  Johnny's wearing
          a change of clothes, Arthur has his best suit on.

                                        ARTHUR
                        I'm a little... nervous.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's understandable.

                                        ARTHUR
                        Maybe I can't do this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good enough.  Let's go back to
                        Maine.


    5656ARTHUR'S P.O.V. -- THE STANDING STREET CLOCK

          With the graciously aged Abigail already waiting there.


          BACK TO SCENE

          Arthur smiles hugely -- recognizing her instantly.

                                        ARTHUR
                        I'll take over from here, Johnny.

          Arthur moves toward Abigail.  Johnny watches as they shake

          hands with each other... which turns into a close hug.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER (O.S.)
                        How long is this going to take?


          INCLUDE GRANDDAUGHTER

          Johnny turns to see Abby's beautiful granddaughter, waiting
            impatiently, as before.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        A half hour?  What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Does it matter?

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                                (re: Abigail)
                        I got stuck granny-watching this
                        week because my mother's out of
                        town.

          Apparently, the "personality" gene didn't get passed down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't we just leave them alone
                        for a hour and come back?

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                                (resigned)
                          Whatever.

          If Johnny entertained any thoughts of getting together
          with this woman -- which he did -- they are fast
            evaporating.  But he can't help but say it anyway:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't suppose you'd be up for a
                        walk in the Park?

          She just looks at him.  Not a chance.

          Johnny is walking alone through now familiar territory.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  55.

          He reaches the bench where he had his visions, and sits
          down next to the usual occupant -- the elegant old man
          feeding his birds.  Johnny glances over at him, and is in
            a vision.



            Johnny/Tommy is wearing his uniform, now decorated with
          medals -- this is after the war.  He is seated on the
          bench, a bag of seeds next to him.  He tosses the feed to
          the gathering birds, far too young to be doing this.  The
          vision ends.



          Johnny comes out of the vision.  He looks again at the
          old man sitting next to him, and realizes:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tommy Peterson?

                                        TOMMY
                        How do you know my name?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A mutual friend.

          The old man considers this for a moment, and we sense he
          might want to pursue it.  But the inertia of the decades
          spent alone is more than he can overcome -- this is the
          life he's chosen, no desire to change that now.  He just
          shrugs his shoulders.  Then takes a handful of seeds, and
          sets the bag down between them, within Johnny's reach. 
          Johnny stares at it for a beat, then takes a handful for
          himself.

          Two strangers on a bench, nothing in common, except a
          woman they both once knew.  They scatter the seeds and
          the birds come to join them.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
