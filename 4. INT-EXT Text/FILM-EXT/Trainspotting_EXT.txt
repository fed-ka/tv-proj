Legs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's.
Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along.
As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties,
sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets.
They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms.
The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead.
RENTON
(voice-over)
Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family,
Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars,
compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.
Suddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him.
In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at
Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in
on him.
He smiles.
On a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on
another team at football.
The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his
friends wear an odd assortment of gear.
Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side,
watching.
The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier.
As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their
name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt,
baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a
tatoo on his arm.
Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it.
Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it.
Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs.
Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can.
Renton's litany continues over the action:
RENTON
(v.o)
Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece
suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY
and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on
that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows,
stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at
the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing
more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you
have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.
Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the
astroturf. Voice-over continues.
But who would I want to do a thing like that?
RENTON
(v.o)
Heroin makes you constipated. The heroin from my last hit is
fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt. I am no longer
constipated.
He looks around the local amenities. He is in discomfort, clutching his
abdomen and falling to his knees.
He notices a betting shop.
Typical weather, neither good nor bad. The park is nondescript arid green
with a few bushes. This is not Kew Gardens. Renton and Sick Boy appear,
dressed as before but for the addition of cheap sunglasses.
Renton is carrying a battered old cassette player and a carry-out in a
plastic bag.
Sick Boy is carrying a small, tatty suitcase from Oxfam.
They scan the horizon and give each other the nod. They walk towards the
bushes.
RENTON
(v.o)
The down side of coming off junk was that I knew I would need to
mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness. It was
awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to
look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the
same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but
just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it,
thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you
think? And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry
for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his
unifying theory of life.
Seen through the telescopic sight of an air rifle that wanders over various
potential targets (children, pensioners, couples, gardeners, etc.).
SICK BOY
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
RENTON
What do you mean?
SICK BOY
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's
gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it
and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
RENTON
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
SICK BOY
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your
heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's
actually just shite.
RENTON
So who else?
SICK BOY
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
RENTON
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Sick Boy rests the gun down.
SICK BOY
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the
Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward
trajectory.
RENTON
What about The Untouchables?
SICK BOY
I don't rate that at all.
RENTON
Despite the Academy award?
SICK BOY
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
RENTON
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
SICK BOY
Yeah.
RENTON
That's your theory?
SICK BOY
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
RENTON
Give me the gun.
muscle-bound dog are in view.
Sick Boy and Renton talk like Sean Connery.
SICK BOY
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
RENTON
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant
problem.
The gun fires and the dog yelps, jumps up and bites its owner (the
Skinhead).
SICK BOY
For a vegetarian, Rents, you're a fucking evil shot.
Renton loads up again.
RENTON
(v.o)
Without heroin, I attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life
as a good citizen.
The Girl walks away from the club, scanning the street for a taxi, and hail
one which stops just as Renton calls out.
RENTON
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by
the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that
situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
DIANE
Thanks.
RENTON
What's your name?
DIANE
Diane.
RENTON
Where are you going, Diane?
DIANE
I'm going home.
RENTON
Where's that?
DIANE
It's where I live.
RENTON
Great.
DIANE
What?
RENTON
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Diane halts abruptly as a taxi pulls up.
DIANE
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach
girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive
type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know
the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a
little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just
love that?
RENTON
Eh-
DIANE
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
RENTON
I think I left something back at the -
The girl has disappeared into the back of the taxi.
Renton looks around.
TAXI DRIVER
Are you getting in or not, pal?
The taxi motors along.
Spud is pushed against the wall held by his lapels. He drinks from a bottle
of beer in one hand.
GAIL
Do you understand?
Spud nods drunkenly.
Gail releases her grip.
Our relationship is not being redefined; it is developing in an
appropriate, organic fashion. I expect you to be a considerate and
thoughtful lover, generous but firm. Failure on your part to live
up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift
resumption of a non-sex situation. Right?
Spud drinks from a bottle in the other hand and says nothing but he does not
look too happy.
Renton paces briskly down the street, followed by Diane.
DIANE
I don't see why not.
RENTON
Because it's illegal.
DIANE
Holding hands?
RENTON
No, not holding hands.
DIANE
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more
last night.
RENTON
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like
me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking
toilet.
They stop at the school gates.
DIANE
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
RENTON
Easy for you to say.
DIANE
Can I see you again?
RENTON
Certainly not.
Renton walks away.
DIANE
If you don't see me again I'll tell the police.
Renton turns and walks back to her. They stand for a moment, then Renton
walks away again. Diane smiles.
(to herself)
I'll see you around then.
In the cold light of morning, Tommy and Lizzy wait, not speaking, outside
the still-closed video store.
---------
A train speeds across.
The station is in the middle of a moor. There appears to be no habitation
around. In the distance are some hills.
The train stands at the station.
As it pulls away, Renton, Spud, Tommy and Sick Boy are left standing on the
platform, looking around.
SICK BOY
Now what?
TOMMY
We go for a walk.
SPUD
What?
TOMMY
A walk.
SPUD
But where?
Tommy points vaguely across the moor.
TOMMY
There.
SICK BOY
Are you serious?
They step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. They stop.
All but Tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather.
TOMMY
Well, what are you waiting for?
SPUD
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
A group of three serious Walkers trudge past from the other end of the
platform, decked out in regulation Berghaus from head to foot. They tramp
off towards the wilderness. The boys watch them go.
Spud opens a can.
TOMMY
It's the great outdoors.
SICK BOY
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
TOMMY
It's fresh air.
SICK BOY
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but
there's no need to take it out on us.
TOMMY
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
RENTON
I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the
scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic
trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the
English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to
be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite
state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make
any fucking difference.
The three serious Walkers are receding into the distance.
The boys troop back towards the platform.
(v.o)
At or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to
get
back on drugs as soon as possible. It took about twelve hours.
Renton and Spud are running along the street.
Two uniformed Store Detectives are running after them.
Sick Boy stands in a doorway. As the Detectives run past, he strolls away in
the opposite direction.
Renton and Spud run along the street.
The car alarm rings on until Renton calmly produces a pair of wire cutters
and a spanner to cut free and release the battery.
The alarm is silenced.
Renton walks away with the battery and the stereo.
The taxi motors along.
---------
Renton, Spud and Sick Boy cross the road to approach the shop.
RENTON
(v.o)
Well, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the
baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and
never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a
moment like this.
---------
Renton and Spud are running, pursued by the Two Store Detectives.
RENTON
(v.o)
Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile
misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of
bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again.
Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people
over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go
wrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that
screeches to a halt as he crosses a road.
He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives
approaching.
(v.o)
Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have
enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you
always need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits.
(v.o)
Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the
Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud.
The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.
Renton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall. He looks
around. The steel back gate is locked.
RENTON
(v.o)
I wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by
my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone,
never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this
programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses
of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at
the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning
and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a
sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother
superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long,
hard day.
Renton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side,
executing a somersault in mid-air.
As Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then
an ambulance speeds by without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the
pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of
the taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's
pocket before closing the door.
The taxi is stationary. We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens
the door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before
taking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton
lies on the pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a
trolley. We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the
hospital.
On the door of a flat 'plaguer', 'HIV', and 'junky AIDS scum' are daubed on
the walls. The sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be
heard.
Renton and Sick Boy are seated in their firing patch, sitting on plastic
bags with beer, vodka, hash and the cassette player. The airgun is present
as before, but they are not making any use of it.
SICK BOY
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
RENTON
It wasn't that bad.
SICK BOY
Did he -- you know?
RENTON
What?
SICK BOY
You know.
RENTON
No, he didn't make me touch it.
SICK BOY
Oh no, don't even mention it.
RENTON
He made me lick it.
SICK BOY
God, you're sick.
RENTON
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and
the whole fucking stump fell off.
SICK BOY
Cut it out.
RENTON
When are you going to visit him?
SICK BOY
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
RENTON
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him
yet?
Sick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift
fractionally apart. RENTON tuts.
SICK BOY
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The
gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up.
Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
RENTON
You're all hear.
SICK BOY
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what
they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the
punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not
exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it
here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get
into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts,
get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
RENTON
Fuck you.
SICK BOY
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with
losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm
getting on with life. What are you doing?
---------
As contemporary retake of all those 'Swinging London' montages: Red
Routemaster/Trafalgar Square/Big Ben/Royalty/City gents in suits/Chelsea
ladies/fashion victims/Piccadilly Circus at night. Incut with close-ups of
classic street names on a street map (all the ones made famous by Monopoly.
Renton stands waiting beside this busy London road, outside some very
unfortunate housing, as the traffic streams past.
RENTON
(v.o)
Two bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent
decorative order. Lots of storage space. All mod cons. Three
hundred and twenty pounds per week.
A couple approach. Renton unlocks the door of a flat and holds the door open
while he ushers them in.
Diane is leaving the school when Sick Boy catches up with her. They stop and
then she walks away.
Diane walks along a concrete path. As she does so she has to step over Spud,
who lies asleep/unconscious beside the remains of a carry out.
DIANE
(v.o)
Dear Mark, I'm glad you've found a job and somewhere to live.
School is fine at the moment. I'm not pregnant but thanks for
asking. Your friend Sick Boy asked me last week if I would like to
work for him but I told him where to go. I met Spud, who sends his
regards, or at least I think that's what he said. No one has seen
Tommy for ages. And finally, Fracis Begbie has been on television
a lot this week. --
A car sits in a street near the club, windows steamed up.
Begbie stumbles away from the car, pulling up his trousers as he goes.
RENTON
(v.o)
But you try telling Begbie that.
Traffic floods past as before.
An InterCity train speeds by.
Renton is visible first, apparently talking to himself, then Diane.
RENTON
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to
this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's
happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
DIANE
Unless you get caught.
RENTON
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting
caught.
DIANE
So why have you told me about it?
RENTON
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I
thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
DIANE
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
RENTON
What? Steady like?
DIANE
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
RENTON
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
DIANE
Sixteen next month.
RENTON
Happy birthday.
DIANE
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Renton thinks it over.
RENTON
So, what's he like?
DIANE
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
They both laugh.
And you're such a deadbeat, Mark.
----------
Renton walks past a Beggar huddling against a wall. The Beggar's sign reads:
'FALKLANDS VETERAN. I LOST MY LEG FOR MY COUNTRY. PLEASE HELP.' The beggar
is Swanney.
----------
RENTON
(v.o)
Yes, that hit was good. I promised myself another one before I got
to London -- just for old time's sake, just to piss Begbie off.
The bus travels towards London.
The bus travels through London.
The gang enter a cheap hotel. Begbie's bag contains the heroin.
Renton walks away.
RENTON
(v.o)
Now, I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways: it wasn't
a big deal, just a minor betrayal, or we'd outgrown each other,
you know, that sort of thing, but let's face it, I ripped them
off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about
him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only
he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for
Spud -- he never hurt anybody.
RENTON
(v.o)
So why did I do it? I could offer a million answers, all false.
The truth is that I'm a bad person, but that's going to change,
I'm going to change. This is the last of this sort of thing. I'm
cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life.
I'm looking forward to it already. I'm going to be just like you:
the job, the family, the fucking big television, the washing
machine, the car, the compact disc and electrical tin opener, good
health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home,
leisurewear, luggage, three-piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk
food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf,
washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed
pension, tax exemption, clearing the gutters, getting by, looking
ahead, to the day you die.
