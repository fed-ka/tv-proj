We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular
mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-
shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...
...a very nervous MAN.
Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.
We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then
we continue moving into --
THE COACH SECTION
Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to
"VACANT" and...
JAMES EARL JONES
(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of
description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)
steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:
multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the
works. He heads up the aisle towards --
THE FIRST CLASS CABIN
Where he is stopped by a --
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
restricted to first cl...
Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET.
JAMES EARL JONES
Is this what you're looking for?
She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just
handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there
anything I can get you?
JAMES EARL JONES
Scotch, blended. Straight.
He continues into the first class cabin and toward --
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
2.
THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM
Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his
name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.
After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and
leans, slightly, towards Jones.
PASQUAL
(tentatively)
They say birds can't fly this high.
JAMES EARL JONES
They say only angels can.
Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something
from his pocket when they are interrupted by --
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Shall I pour your scotch?
JAMES EARL JONES
No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.
She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off
the glass. She shrugs, leaving...
Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes
a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about
your end of the bargain?"
From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find
diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.
He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath
candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,
high-tech triggering mechanism.
JAMES EARL JONES
Ah, c-5. The most dangerous
explosive material ever invented.
Hard to believe that this little
contraption could blow up ten city
blocks.
PASQUAL
Be careful with it, huh?
Both men smile.
Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is
done.
Then suddenly, the lights blink out.
Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in-
flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a
torch.

CONTINUED:
Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam
Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE."
James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.
JAMES EARL JONES
Another movie from an old TV show?
PASQUAL
Well, what're you gonna do?
JAMES EARL JONES
Walk out.
PASQUAL
That's very funny.
But James Earl Jones is dead serious.
JAMES EARL JONES
No.
It isn't.
Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the
back of the plane, shouting:
JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D)
EVERYONE!
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!
Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight,
he yanks open the emergency door release.
With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses.
Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in
screams out of the open door, including --
CLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly
sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the
RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling
into her head?
Checking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the
pocket to find her cell phone. Answering...
DYLAN
Hi.
(recognizing voice)
Hi.
Okay. I'll be right in.
She clicks the phone off, then starts looking around.
Where the fuck is she?
From the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing "My
Sharona." She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's
naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on.
Closing her eyes, she prays...
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Not him.
Not him, not him, not him.
THE VOICE
'Morning starfish.
DYLAN
Oh God no.
At the door, skinny shirtless CHAD holds a skillet of eggs.
CHAD
Hungry?
Natalie makes a beeline for his keys on the table.
Starts taking one key off the ring.

NATALIE

Or your neighbors. Or your parents,
here to identify your remains.
He has no idea what she's talking about.
She goes to
THE BATHROOM,
where she retrieves a toothbrush.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
I saw your car was here, so I knew
you weren't carjacked and brutally
beaten, left to die on the highway.
Her cell phone RINGS.
BOB
I'm not...
She holds up a finger, just a sec.
NATALIE
(answering phone)
Hello. Absolutely. I'll be right in.
She hangs up.
BOB
I'm not dead.
NATALIE
But you can understand why I
thought so. You missed our date
last night. You didn't call or
anything. I was just sitting
there by myself.
ANGLE ON Bob.
What can he say?
NATALIE (CONT'D)
I can tolerate a lot, but punctuality
and attendance, those rank very high
in my list of dating priorities.
BOB
I can explain.
Behind Natalie, a door opens.
A topless BLONDE looks out.
BLONDE

Beyond weirded out, Natalie just leaves.
CUT TO:
In foreground, a blender WHIRRS. Still hungover, Dylan
cringes from the sound. Natalie pours out three fruit
smoothies for the angels.
NATALIE
Just once, I want to date a normal
man, without a wife, or a drug
addiction, or bondage issues.
DYLAN
Here here.
She and Natalie toast.
Alex is only half-in. Off their look...
ALEX
What?
I've got a great relationship.
DYLAN
Your boyfriend thinks you're a
secretary.
ALEX
That way, he doesn't ask about my work.
Bosley walks in with a folder.
He eyes their drinks.
NATALIE
I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made
enough for three.
BOSLEY
No, that's...That's okay.
It's not okay, but that's our Bosley. He takes his seat
behind his desk. Now we see the biggest addition to the
office, the Angels Wall of Fame.

Pictures of every angel, from the original cast members to some
fictitious ones we've never seen before. The rest of the office
is exactly as we remember it, right down to the
SPEAKERPHONE.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Good morning, Angels.
ANGELS
(sing-songy)
Good morning, Charlie.
The angels take a seat on couches and chairs.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
I'm sorry to call you back from
vacation, but we've got a case
that just can't wait.
As he's talking, the far blinds close themselves. A white
screen lowers from the ceiling, ready to catch the
projected VIDEO:
A handsome MAN IN HIS 20'S in a CNN profile. The sound is
muted, be we see him attending a gala; in an office surrounded
by computers; rock climbing; smiling in a sit-down interview.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Meet Eric Knox.
NATALIE
He's cute.
BOSLEY
He is.
Oops, did Bosley say that out loud?
CHARLIE'S VOICE
He's 28-years old, and in three days
he'll be a billionaire, when his
company, Knox Technologies, goes public.
DYLAN
It's good to be him.
ALEX
So what's the catch?
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Last night, Knox was kidnapped
from his own office.

garage. Two MEN IN HOODS shove Knox into black car.

NATALIE
Any ransom?
CHARLIE'S VOICE
No one's heard a thing from the
kidnappers.
A WOMAN'S VOICE
They don't want money. They just
want to sink our company.
A striking WOMAN IN A SUIT stands in the doorway.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice
president of finance for Knox
Technologies. She's hired us to
find Knox.
VIVIAN WU
(entering)
The initial public offering is in
three days. If we don't get Mr.
Knox back, or if word gets out
that he's missing, the company
stands to lose a billion dollars.
She seems to direct this next sentence right to Natalie.
VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
We need your help.
ALEX
Charlie, where do we start?
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Alex, I want you and Bosley to
stake out Roger Corwin.
Bosley is excited to hear his name mentioned.
ON VIDEO: Roger Corwin. He's an unpleasant-looking man,
who's even nastier when he tries to smile. We see logos
for his company, Red Star Systems
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
For the past year, he's been
trying to buy Knox's company and
their new browser software. Knox
refused to sell. His company, Red
Start Systems, has the most to
gain from Knox's disappearance.
ALEX
Kidnap the founder and you sink
the company.

CHARLIE'S VOICE
Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes
on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is
still alive, Corwin might lead us
to him.
DYLAN
We're on it.
NATALIE
Any chance you can join us,
Charlie?
CUT TO:
CHARLIE'S POV
We see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold.
We're halfway up the face of Yosemite's El Capitan -- the
ground is hundreds of feet below.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
I'd love to, angels, but I've got
my hands full this morning.
Two beautiful and buxomly CLIMBING BUDDIES smile at him.
WIPE TO:
A burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward
in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing
two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his
chest.
As more steam dissipates, we see there
are SEVEN MEN sitting on
the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging
from Calvin Klein models
to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,
taking a keen interest.
Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he
isn't. We just don't
know.
The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from
the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain
dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat.
He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a
strategic location.
Noticing that none of the other men have towels around
their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin
the color of cooked salmon. He fluffs up his sparse chest hair,
then decides to smush it back down.
He tries to make eye contact with Corwin, working way too
hard. Annoyed, Corwin finally looks over.
BOSLEY
Hot in here, isn't it?
Corwin shakes his head, idiot.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
Just came here to unwind a little.
Business these days is go go go. My
company just held an initial pubic offering.
Yes, he said "pubic." He's about to correct himself when
a very hot guy across from him moves his towel to wipe off

some sweat. We don't see the promised land, but Bosley
does. It flusters him.
He sees another guy eating ice chips. Good idea.
Bosley
does the same. He eats another. And another.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
(re-composed)
So, what business are you in?
Corwin seems wary, but Bosley is clearly harmless.
CORWIN
Computers.
Software.
BOSLEY
Computers, hunh? What do you know
about this new browser from Knox
Technologies?
Corwin bristles at the mention.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
Word on the street is, once they
raise capital, they'll rule the
industry.
CORWIN
I don't see that happening.
BOSLEY
Really?
Why not?
The door opens, a rush of steam. ADONIS HIMSELF enters.
Picking a seat behind Bosley, he pulls off his towel as
he passes. We just see a bit of ass, but Bosley is face-
to-face with the babymaker.
One ice chip is not going to do it.
He chugs the rest of
his cup, including
THE TRANSMITTER
which BLEEPS.
Corwin and others look over.
What the hell
was that?
The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to
smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down.
Corwin gets up to leave.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
Nice talking with you.
Another BLEEP. He shuts his mouth tight. Smiles. Rubs
his chest a bit, trying to get the transmitter down.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

Corwin walks into a lushly-appointed private massage
room. A masseuse dressed in a skimpy robe, her back to
us, oils up her hands sensuously near the window.
MASSEUSE
(German accent)
Please to take off clothes, Mr. Corvin.
Corwin gets under the sheet, on his stomach. The
masseuse turns around, and now we see that it's Alex.
Alex starts to work on his back. She is clearly an
expert at this. This is a legit place, but there's
something undeniably sensual about the whole experience.
ALEX
You're carrying a lot of tension
along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae.
Let me see if I can vork it out.
Under the table, we look up to see Corwin's face in the
cradle. He's in a tortured rapture.
Alex works along Corwin's back and neck.
She pulls his
arms out to the side.
ALEX (CONT'D)
The human body is an amazing instrument.
Just by activating ze right energy
points, you can improve ze circulation,
alleviate pain, or...
Corwin goes limp.
ALEX (CONT'D)
(losing the accent)
... knock a man unconscious.
Confident Corwin is out cold, she slides the key strap
off his wrist.
Making sure she's alone, Alex uses the key to open a
locker. She carefully sorts through Corwin's things,
finding his Palm Pilot organizer. She clicks it into a
special device, which BLIPS as it downloads all his
information.
Putting the Palm Pilot away, she shuts the locker.
CLOSE ON Corwin as he suddenly wakes up, disoriented.

Just when we think Alex's plan has failed, we TILT UP to
see Alex is right there. She's massaging him.
ALEX
You must have dozed off.
A beat. Yeah, he must have.
A patented ANGELS FLIP
leads us to...
CUT TO:
The Angels are all in the car together, cruising down
Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat,
Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap.
NATALIE
Can you not drive my car so fast,
Dyl? I'm trying to type.
DYLAN
(to Alex, under her breath)
I drive too fast. Look who's talking.
She pulls into an In N' Out Burger, right up to the drive thru.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Three double doubles, animal style.
Fries. Three chocolate shakes.
While they wait for their order, Natalie punches
something up on her computer.
NATALIE
Here's Corwin's itinerary.
ONSCREEN -- we see a list of all Corwin's plans for the
next week. Two events in particular stand out:
TUESDAY NIGHT -- INVESTOR RECEPTION, BILTMORE HOTEL
THURSDAY -- SAN DIEGO RACEWAY
Dylan glances over the schedule.
DYLAN
Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight.
I only wish we had a clue to go on.
The food comes, Dylan takes it.
NATALIE
Hold that thought.

Natalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a CD
into the drive. Dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot
of it. A big glop of chocolate shake lands on the
keyboard.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
Uh, hello?
Expensive equipment.
DYLAN
Sorry.
Natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at
the keyboard.
NATALIE
Check this out. New program I just
got from a friend in the Bureau. We
take that footage from the kidnapping...
On screen, the footage downloads from the CD, into the
program. Natalie fast forwards through it until she
comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask
is partly pulled away from his face.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
... isolate the part of the suspect's
face that's revealed, then retriangulate
his bone structure...
The program zooms in on the revealed part of his face,
then runs a series of calculations. A new drawing starts
to appear.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
... and voila!
We've got a composite.
Natalie's portable printer spits out a simulated
composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. Dylan grabs
it, looks it over.
DYLAN
Sweet. Now we've got someone to
look for.
She hands it to Alex to inspect.
ALEX
Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot
with that open head wound.
She turns the composite around, revealing that Dylan has
smudged his head with ketchup.
They all just have to laugh.
WIPE TO:

A sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of
smart suits and power ties.
Dressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray of
hors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, who
talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-
dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES.
DYLAN
The average investor sees technology
stocks as discrete entities, "This one is
up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's
only through derivative analysis that one
sees the real power of that sector.
A few nods.
She makes a good point.
BROKER GUY
Which analysis method do you prefer?
On Dylan.
Shit.
She tries to stall...
DYLAN
Well, there are so many options.
I mean, who can say what the one
best choice is?
ACROSS THE ROOM
Still walking, Natalie talks to no one...
NATALIE
Keppler-Wilson.
BACK WITH DYLAN
DYLAN
For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a
strong choice.
More nods, ad-libbed agreement.
The Broker Guy is impressed.
Excusing herself, Dylan turns and subtly touches her ear,
where she's wearing a hidden radio.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Thanks.

Anytime, day or night, I am... excited
... to be handing out champagne.
Oh God.
What did she just say?
But he smiles anyway.
She heads back out into the crowd.
You can almost see
the big L on her forehead.
BY THE FOUNTAIN
Dylan has been watching this.
We INTERCUT between her
and Natalie.
DYLAN
He's cute.
NATALIE
I'm working.
DYLAN
Sixty-five percent of relationships

He's a bartender. I need dependable.
I need reliable. I need a Volvo man.
Natalie walks past Dylan, not acknowledging her.
Dylan
snaps her fingers.
NATALIE
Miss!
Miss!
I'd love some champagne.
Natalie comes back, a little annoyed. Dylan takes a
glass for herself, then foists the other glasses on
everyone around her, whether they wanted it or not.
DYLAN (CONT'D)

Why don't you get some more?
She nudges Natalie in that direction.

NATALIE
I'll meet you there.
ON DYLAN
She smiles, hearing the deal close. Pushing through a
cluster of investors, she bumps into a THIN MAN.
DYLAN
Pardon me.
He doesn't respond, but something about this man raises
her suspicions. Where has she seen him before? As he
moves out of earshot...
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Natalie.
Nine o'clock. Thin man.
ON NATALIE
NATALIE
I'm on it.
Spotting the Thin Man, she heads his way.
NATALIE
(offering)
Vegetarian spring roll?
He waves her away, no. Oops, she drops a napkin in front
of him. She kneels down to get it.
As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's
a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into
the rim.
It BLIPS as she moves past his ankle. And again as she
rises up past his chest. The man just keeps walking.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
(to earpiece)
Two guns. One ankle, one shoulder.
DYLAN
You call it.
NATALIE
You take point. I'll circle behind.
DYLAN
Copy.
The Thin Man is headed down the hall.
Looking back, we
see Dylan enter from the ballroom.

DYLAN
Excuse me?
He doesn't turn back.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Excuse me, do you know which way
the ladies' room is?
The man takes a sudden right into a service hallway.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Why do they always run?
She slips off her heels to give chase.
The Thin Man comes around the corner.
We stay TIGHT on
him, until he suddenly stops.
NATALIE
has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts
tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in.
And then, a DING!
Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue-
less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones.
In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the
hallway and takes his place. Hits the button.
From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the
elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the
panel.
DYLAN
He's going down.
They take the stairs.
Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the
elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly.
Thunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating
at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when
THREE SHOTS
ring out.
They dive for cover behind a massive washer
assembly.
NATALIE
There are times I wish we carried
guns.
DYLAN
Where's the challenge in that?
ANGLE ON the Thin Man, planning his next move. With no
good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING.
He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a
cascade of hot water.
Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded.
Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading
to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an
inch of water grows on the floor.
Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin
Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes
they're just trying to waste his bullets.
Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.

On the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks,
which circle on a wire like a ski lift. The Thin Man
looks up, distracted, not noticing --
DYLAN
As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry
carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man
as he talks on the phone.
She clears her throat.
The Thin Man turns.
She kicks
him in the jaw.
Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips
under a washing machine.
He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet.
We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.
HE TURNS TO SEE
NATALIE
right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun
arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling
over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of
potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.
NATALIE
Hey!
Hands off, assh....
Before she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws
Natalie at Dylan, knocking them both down. He jumps up,
and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks
another, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing.
By the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone.
NATALIE
Okay, to summarize? Damn.
Lying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer
to fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone.
Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the Thin
Man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the
Townsend Agency computers. Rapidly touching the screen,
she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls
he received. They're all from the same location.

NATALIE
We need to tap this phone line

where his calls were coming from.
DYLAN

503?
That's not local, where is it?

Don't bother. I know where it is.
I used to spend every winter there.

The kind of place that rich weekend skiers don't come.
Lots of over-aggressive, cowboy-biker types, drinking more

Dylan and Natalie smile at each other.
DYLAN
I think that can be arranged.
The Three Angels split up, Bosley tagging along with Dylan.
DYLAN
sidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are
downing shots, one after another.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Three shots of tequila, please.
(Bosley whispers in her ear)
And one Tom Collins.
The rednecks stare at Dylan, drooling.
Dylan turns to the first
one.
REDNECK
Hey baby, why don't you ditch that
stiff and come sit on ma lap?
Bosley tries to make himself small.
DYLAN
Ooh, that is an enticing offer.
But I got a better idea. How
about a shot contest? My treat?
The three rednecks hoot and holler.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Bartender?
Bring ten shots of tequila over to my
table. And keep em coming.
BY THE MECHANICAL BULL

CONTINUED:
A group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the
mechanical bull. Natalie wanders over behind them.
NATALIE
Mind if I try?
The crowd parts for her, and Natalie hops up on the bull.
She cranks it up, and lets
BY THE BAR --
Dylan downs a shot, slams it on the table.
Countless
other glasses surround her.
REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one
falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table.
The third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up
with Dylan.
DYLAN
Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's
have a chair throwing contest.
REDNECK
Hunh?
DYLAN
Chair throwing? Never heard of
it? You just pick up your chair
and throw it as far as you can.
The redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across
the bar.
OKAY, HERE'S AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF
THIS SCENE:
Dylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks
into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number
of the chalet.
TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell.
One was tending to the fire.
THUG ONE
We expecting somebody?
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
33.
CONTINUED:
Thug Two shakes his head.
Checking his gun, Thug One grabs for his windbreaker.
Puts it on over.
A cheerful fire burns in the over-sized fireplace. The
canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly
venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas. The fire dies
immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost.
Alex doesn't even need a rope. Her feet pressed to the
sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom.
Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY
swinging
A FIREPLACE POKER
at her head. She ducks just in time.
The poker CHINGS
against the stone, making a spark.
Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman
slashes and stabs. She ducks behind a chair, which
Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the
room.
Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy
curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden
curtain rod. A spin, a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff.
She goes on the offensive.
Thrust, parry, spin.
But he's a worthy adversary. One good karate kick breaks
her staff in two. She uses both pieces to club him in
the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.
She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs.
Pokerman swings. Alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall.
A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex
rolls on top of him. She catches his head in the tongs,
squeezing his temples. His eyes bulge.
ALEX
Where's Knox?
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
35.
Young billionaire ERIC KNOX paces. He's grungy, with
two days of stubble, but still a darn attractive guy.
Hearing a KICK at the door, he turns.
A second KICK blows the door open.
It's Alex.
KNOX
Who are you?
ALEX
The calvary.
Giddy up.
Looking for the way out, Alex leads Knox to a closed
door. She opens it to find...
... TWO MORE THUGS sitting in front the big-screen TV,
watching a college basketball game (Duke vs. Maryland,
in case you care.) The guards look back, spotting Alex
with Knox.
That wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the
FIFTEEN OTHER THUGS
watching the game with them.
ANGLE ON Alex.
It's an oh-shit moment.

CONTINUED:
ALEX
Sorry.
Wrong room.
(to Knox)
Back!
Run!
The thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of
them pulling out a firearm.
Running, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their
backs. She talks into a wrist-mic.
ALEX
Good news:
I found Knox.
Another THUG steps out in front of her.
She kicks him
down the steps.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Bad news:
I found company.
Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be
grabbed by Dylan.
DYLAN
This way.
At this point, he'll do whatever they say.
The first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it
open but can't. The next few guards try to help him,
while the rest start smashing through the windows.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
37.
Everyone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox
have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley
keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES.
At the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total
control.
Looking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers
piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the
house, more thugs appear on motorbikes.
ALEX
They're coming after us.
DYLAN
(to Knox, confident)
We were expecting that.
NATALIE
Okay, new problem.
Everyone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of
GIANT LOGGING TRUCK
coming up the high mountain road. It straddles the
center line, blocking both directions. There's no way
around it.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
Thoughts, suggestions, points to
consider?
BOSLEY
I don't suppose giving up would
be a...
No, it wouldn't.
Then --
DYLAN
Right!
NATALIE
There is no right.
DYLAN
There!
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
38.
CONTINUED:
She points to a faded "CLOSED" sign that hangs from a
chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking.
But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming
truck, we know there's no choice.
Natalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign.
The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass,
its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any
moment, the ground could stop in a cliff.
Like now.
The van leaps into empty space.
Tires spin, helpless.
The van falls.
Everyone SCREAMS.
Bosley is the loudest.
And then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but
not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the
wheel hard to avoid hitting
A CONCRETE WALL
in front of them.
Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge
they're alive.
DYLAN
Where are we?
Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead.
Looking out the back windows...
ALEX
It's a bobsled run.
They're facing backwards.
Up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads.
The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute.
NATALIE
If it goes down the mountain,
that's all I need.
Throwing it into reverse, Natalie peels out.
The jeeps follow.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
39.
Everything is shaking so violently, it looks like a NASA launch.
ALEX
(looking out the back)
Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Natalie makes the turn. The van rises up, nearly tilting
over. But they make it through the turn.
KNOX
(to Dylan)
Is this part of the plan?
DYLAN
Yes. Except for the bobsled run,
and the backwards part, it's
going exactly according to plan.
A beat.
He smiles at her.
He has a nice smile.
The shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield,
through the horn of Bosley's tuba, then out the back window.
It
missed hitting somebody by millimeters.
Natalie is still focused, making each turn as Alex calls it.
Dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes
farther and farther away.
DYLAN
I think we're in the clear.
Just then, two MOTORBIKES race up along the chute walls, passing
the crippled jeeps. Two more MOTORBIKES jump in from above.
DYLAN
Or maybe not.
Suddenly, Natalie GASPS, remembering something.
NATALIE
Oh God, no.
DYLAN
What is it?
WHIP CUT TO:
NATALIE
I have a date with Pete.
Right now.
DYLAN
Ouch.
ALEX
HARD RIGHT!
Natalie makes the hard right. The motorcycles are gaining on
them, but Natalie and Dylan have to talk through this first.
DYLAN
Call him, he'll totally understand.
NATALIE
"Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a
billionaire."
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

ALEX
Hard left!
She makes the left.
NATALIE
I'll sound like a flake.
I can't
stand flakes.
DYLAN
He will so give you the second chance.
NATALIE
You think?
DYLAN
Hello, I saw the way he looked at you.
One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the
windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out
guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield,
then goes flying.
ALEX
We're at the bottom!
Indeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground.
Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around.
Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with
Charlie.
Dylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off.
The sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get
in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it
at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth
rider in the process.
DYLAN
(genuinely impressed)
Well done.
KNOX
Thanks.

HELICOPTER
thunders over.
We are...
Natalie is at the controls, Bosley beside her.
Alex leans
forward from the second row.
BOSLEY
I think that went very well. Charlie
should send me on more missions.
ALEX
We couldn't have done it without
you, Bos.
Natalie pats him on the arm. She and Alex exchange a quick
glance. They have to just laugh.
In the back row, Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights
of Aspen.
DYLAN
Cocktail?
She offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker
black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks
in a single shot. A smile, and then...
MUSIC rises.
THE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends.
The act is over.
After a beat, we
WIPE TO REVEAL:
Charlie is on the speakerphone.
The angels are in their
usual lounging positions.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Good work, Angels. Not only did you
save Knox, you saved his company as well.
DYLAN
I think that earns us a vacation.
NATALIE
Say, Fiji?

ALEX
(to Natalie)
Any special guy you were thinking
of inviting?
Natalie grins a guilty smile.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Sorry, Angels.
Our work is only
half-done.
Knox enters. Clean-shaven and neatly pressed, he's still a
darn good-looking man. Vivian Wu follows him.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Meet your new client, Eric Knox.
KNOX
First off, thank you. You rescued
me, for which I am eternally grateful.
He's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall
most upon Dylan. She notices it.
KNOX (CONT'D)
But there's still a problem. Whoever
kidnapped me wasn't just trying to
screw up our IPO. They also stole
the proprietary software for our new
web browser. I'm sure it was Roger
Corwin, but I need proof.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
That's where you come in, Angels.
CIRCLING AROUND, we see the video images of Corwin and the
Red Star Systems logo on the big screen.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
We need to break into Red Star's computer
systems to see if Mr. Knox's software is
indeed being converted for Red Star's use.
NATALIE
Sounds like a plan.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red
Star's headquarters are as tightly
guarded as a military facility.
We're going to need reconnaissance
on their mainframe computer system,
and the best way to get that is
through Mr. Corwin himself.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
44.
CONTINUED:
A video image of Corwin's Palm Pilot Schedule comes up the
bigscreen. The shot pulls in close on "SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY."
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
We need to pin a camera on him to get
footage of the inside of the building.
Thanks to Alex's work at the health spa,
we know that Corwin will be at the San
Diego Speedway on Thursday. Get close to
him Angels, but don't tip your hand.
ALEX
Consider it done.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr.
Knox's security. I'd hate to have him
kidnapped again.
DYLAN
Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer
if you could join us, Charlie.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER
From Charlie's P.O.V., looking up at the sunlight.
Three
manta-rays swim above us.
We can hear the BUBBLES from Charlie's regulator.
CHARLIE
I'd love to Angels. But I'm in a
bit over my head at the moment.
A manta-ray swims past, super-close, letting us...
WIPE TO:
A flashlight beam sweeps past, revealing Dylan. With just
her shoulders above the rafters, she's checking a dusty
crawl space. She finds nothing suspicious.
Knox stands below, Dylan's boots on his shoulders. The heels
dig in a bit, but he's not complaining.

DYLAN
We're good.
He moves to help her down, but she does a reverse-pullup to
handle it by herself. She leads the way...
The room is huge. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, we see
that we're up in the hills.
Knox follows her as she walks.
DYLAN
I've got surveillance on all the windows.
Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone.
We continue...
Just as big, just as beautiful. Knox, or his decorator, has
great taste. Everything is top quality, but unpretentious.
DYLAN
Also, stay away from the windows.
KNOX
They're bullet-proof.
The last
owner was paranoid.
DYLAN
(a smile)
Lucky for us.
She takes a marker-sized device off the table.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
This is a panic button.
(tosses it to him)
Press it and one of us can be here
in ten minutes.
KNOX
Which one of you?
DYLAN
Whoever's closest.
She takes her jacket off the couch, ready to go.
KNOX
I have a better idea.
DYLAN
What?

He tosses her the panic button.
KNOX
Stay for dinner.
(preempting objections)
I'm a pretty good cook.
DYLAN
I can't Mr. Knox. I'm sorry.
If you...
KNOX
(quickly)
I'm scared.
Dylan is surprised by this.
KNOX (CONT'D)
Look, I didn't want to admit it, but I
am. I was kidnapped once, and it wasn't
fun. I know, you probably have other
plans, but it would be very reassuring.
Dylan looks him over. Normally, she'd be suspicious, but
the guy WAS just kidnapped, and he seems sincere.
KNOX (CONT'D)
Come on, don't make me beg. I'm
embarrassed already.
She smiles.
DYLAN
Don't be.
She throws her coat back on the sofa.
We PAN OFF a half-played Scrabble game to find Dylan and
Knox at the windows. Dylan picks up a family photo, Knox
as a little boy with a father in a military uniform.
DYLAN
That's you, hunh? Cute kid.
Cute
family.
KNOX
Thanks.
(taking the photo)
It's the only picture I have of me with
my parents. They died a week later.
DYLAN
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
KNOX
Please, don't apologize. I was too
young to understand.
(looking at the photo)
I never knew how they died. When I
was a kid, when I got shuffled from
one foster home to another, I always
thought they just disappeared.
DYLAN
But...?
KNOX
I only found out later, my father was
in the military. He and my mother were
killed while he was on assignment,
somewhere in Eastern Europe.
(mostly to himself)
The files were classified, but I
read enough to know that he was a
good man. Apparently, he was
betrayed by one of his own team.
DYLAN
Wow.
That's a lot for a kid to live with.
KNOX
Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my
family. It still does. I don't take
anything for granted.
Dylan nods.
DYLAN
Boy did I have you pegged wrong.
KNOX
(intrigued)
How do you mean?
DYLAN
Well, to be honest, I thought you
were a rich kid who inherited
everything. But that's pretty typical.
I've got instincts for the job, but
when it comes to men? Well...
KNOX
I'm glad you don't see me as just a client.
He brushes his hand against hers.
She brushes back, fingers
against fingers. A long beat.

Well, you ARE, so...
KNOX
Is there someone you need to be going

DYLAN
No.

But I...
He kisses her. After a moment, she breaks off. It's not that
it was a bad kiss. It was a damn good kiss. It's just...
DYLAN (CONT'D)
I shouldn't.
Knox moves towards her.
KNOX
Shouldn't you?
Dylan holds him back.
DYLAN
(firmly)
No.
I shouldn't.
She stands up.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Thank you for dinner, Mr. Knox.
And
lock the door behind me.
She gets up and leaves.

FORMULA-ONE RACE CARS

ROARING.

As she passes the police cars, we see several OFFICERS
look over -- what the hell?
Natalie catches up to the gray Chrysler. Looks over to
see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT, hunched over the wheel.
He looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him,
just taillights on the freeway.
The Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously
close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often.
Up ahead, he sees an exit.
He starts to slow down...
Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for
the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow
windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier.
... on the big screen. The angels and Bosley watch the
footage, along with Knox and Vivian Wu. Vivian has
seated herself close to Natalie. So close, in fact, that
Natalie keeps having to shift a few inches.
Dylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from Knox,
deliberately avoiding eye contact.
ON THE BIG SCREEN: As the videocamera passes a room
marked with an intimidating warning sign...
KNOX
There!
VIDEO FREEZES.
KNOX (CONT'D)
That's the room with the
mainframe. Everything at Red Star
goes through that system.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
So if we want to find proof that
Red Star stole Knox's technology,
that's the computer to tap.
KNOX
Exactly. But they have heavy firewalls
and encryption. You can't jack in from
outside. You'll have to physically be
in that room to get at the data.
ALEX
Even if we do get inside, there won't
be time to search for it. There's got
to be a hundred terabytes of
information there. It could take days.
NATALIE
So you install a transmitter.
All eyes go over to Natalie.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
Patch in directly to the relay,
broadcast on a high frequency.
That way, you can have access to
the mainframe from the comfort of
your own home. And they have no
idea that you can peek inside.

Knox is impressed.
The other angels nod.
It's a good idea.
VIVIAN WU
That's all fine in theory. But you
still have to get inside that room
to install it. What about security?
ALEX
Red Star has a lot of Government
contracts, so security is tight. Key-
card badges throughout. Redundant
security at all red-line areas with
biometric scanners and weekly keycodes.
Pervasive video surveillance, lasers,
air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard-
wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent
exactly this kind of tapping.
VIVIAN WU
It sounds impossible.
Alex checks with her fellow angels.
They're in agreement.
DYLAN
It sounds like fun.
With a subtle RUSH, we move into a stylized MONTAGE that
shows How They Do It. It features WHIP PANS, FREEZE
FRAMES and ZOOMS to show us only the highlights.
NATALIE (V.O.)
Only the two directors can disengage the
fail-safe. We have to get their keys.
WHIP CUT TO:
ANGLE ON DIRECTOR #1, 40's, part of the lunchtime crowd.
Alex and Natalie are on the catwalk, in the middle of a
grinding routine. Paying for his drink, he fumbles with
his wallet. His waitress helps him find the right bill.
As she walks away, we see the waitress is Dylan. FREEZE FRAME.
We ZOOM IN on the orange key-card she's grabbed from him.
We HEAR the car moving again.
Stripped down to a bra, Natalie attaches an illuminated mirror
to the underside of the trunk lid. Starts to pull more items
from her duffel bag: black shoes, a dress shirt, a tie.
Walking away from the car, Corwin hits the remote.
The
Mercedes BWOOPS.
A beat later, a hand comes out from under the trunk lid.
Natalie climbs out, only she's not Natalie anymore.
She's become Corwin -- identical to the last detail.
She tucks the last of the latex mask under her collar as
she walks. FREEZE FRAME.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

Corwin puts his right hand on the sensor grid.
A laser
scans it. Approved.
The Security Guard hits the button, releasing the gate.
He goes back to his magazine as Corwin passes through.
A beat, then...
A VOICE
Tommy? You gonna let me through
or what?
Tommy the Guard looks up, sees Corwin is still at the
counter.
TOMMY THE GUARD
(confused)
Oh.
Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin.
He hits the button again, letting Corwin through. Tommy
goes back to his magazine, still a little perplexed.
The same places we saw on the videotape. Natalie-as-
Corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader,
sending the lights from red to green. FREEZE FRAME.
She splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack.
Pulls up a tiny antenna. FREEZE FRAME.
Corwin walks down the hall, still talking with his
colleague. Natalie-as-Corwin is walking right towards
them. She turns away as she passes. He didn't even spot
her.
She smiles.
CUT TO:
As a group, the angels move through the upscale lunch
crowd to find Knox and Vivian Wu at a booth.

I'll have Systems get to work on

She reaches for the laptop.
Bosley snatches it away.
BOSLEY
Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to
work on this right away. Any evidence
we find will be turned over to you AND
the proper authorities.
VIVIAN WU
I don't think you understand how
important that data is, Mr...
BOSLEY
Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll
take very good care of it when I find it.
VIVIAN WU
(reaching for the laptop)
But...
KNOX
Vivian, please. Do as the man says.
Reluctantly, Vivian Wu pulls her hand away. Bosley tucks
the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands.

She glances at
Alex, then clears her throat.

Natalie, Alex, and Dylan kibbitz near the sinks.

There's something going on between

ALEX
I'm not siding with anyone, but
technically, he is no longer...
NATALIE
You know Charlie would NEVER

Oh come on, Charlie wouldn't care. I

DYLAN
Uh, guys?

They turn to look at her.

I'm a big girl. I make my own
decisions. I'm going out with him.
She walks out of the ladies' room.
CUT TO:
Bosley hums "In the Navy" to himself as he walks through
a parking garage. He's alone in the echo-y garage, and
everything we know about movies tells us This Means Trouble.
BWEEP BWEEP as his alarm shuts off. Just as he's about
to lift the handle, he stops. Looks back over his shoulder.
Did he hear something? He scans the empty garage.
No
one in sight. Must've been his imagination.
Bosley climbs in, shutting the door behind him.
He's
putting the keys in the ignition, when...
A HAND clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth. It's
the Thin Man. Bosley struggles, but in moments, he's
unconscious.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

OUTSIDE THE CAR
THE THIN MAN stuffs Bosley in the trunk, slams it shut,
revealing...
VIVIAN WU (O.S.)
Sweet dreams.
Vivian Wu, standing beside the Thin Man. She's holding
the case Bosley refused to give her before.
THE THIN MAN
So, now we have the transmitter, what
do we do with fat boy? Dirt nap time?
VIVIAN WU
NO! Not until I've got the
information I need. We'll take
him to the compound, hold him there.
(beat)
In the meantime, we've got to tie
up some loose ends.
THIN MAN
Whenever you say something like
that, it means more work for me.
VIVIAN WU
(ignoring him)
The Angels will figure out they
were duped. We can't afford them
jeopardizing our plans.
THE THIN MAN
Here it comes...
VIVIAN WU
(coldly)
We have to Kill Charlie's Angels.
The Thin Man sighs, whips out his cell phone.
THE THIN MAN
Guess I'll cancel my weekend plans.
And speaking of weekend plans...
CUT TO:
Jason walks into the Soundstage, followed by the effects crew.
JASON
Alex?
ALEX?
Of course, she's nowhere to be found. While he looks
around, one of the effects guys fingers a bullet hole in
the set wall. He presses against it and a FLATTENED
BULLET FALLS OUT.
He thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.
Couldn't be.
CUT TO:
A passing FILMGOER reveals Natalie and Pete. Seated near
the aisle, they share a giant tub of popcorn. The movie
hasn't started yet, but there's a slide show of various
anime heroes and villains.
NATALIE
Thanks for the second chance. I
swear, I'm really not a flake.
He shrugs it off.
PETE
How can I deny any woman who's
seen all 23 "Lords of Wind and
Power"?
NATALIE
I bet there's a dozen women here
who fit that description.
She's right.
PETE
Honestly -- there's a looks
component as well.

CONTINUED:
NATALIE
Really.
PETE
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen this close up.
How can she not be flattered by that? She would say
something back, but the moment has gotten so electrified
that each little glance just brings on more goofy-in-
loveness.
The only solution is to leave...
NATALIE
Ladies room.
I'll be back in two minutes.
PETE
I'll be here.
A wee bit smitten, Natalie enters as the last WOMAN leaves.
We hear just the DRIP DRIP DRIP of a faucet and the Muzak
version of Power Station's "Some Like It Hot."
NATALIE
IN A STALL
Natalie shuts the door behind herself, then sets to work
putting down a tissue-paper seat cover.
SWEEPING ACROSS THE FLOOR
We look under stall doors to find a pair of black men's
boots stepping down from inside. Natalie is not alone.
IN HER STALL
Natalie is about to hoist her skirt when she stops.
Her
Spider Sense is tingling.
A DOOR LATCH
CLICKS open. We TILT UP to see a WELL-DRESSED MAN.
He's
at least 6'3".
He stops at Natalie's stall door, drawing his gun.
A
beat, then he KICKS the door open, revealing...
AN EMPTY STALL.
The automatic toilet FLUSHES itself.
The Man takes a
half-step in, confused. Suddenly --

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
The door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand.
He
drops the gun, looking up to see
NATALIE,
Who is perched atop the stall walls.
She pushed the door
with her foot.
Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic
swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls
into the next row of stalls.
Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles.
He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over.
That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts.
With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled
up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.
NATALIE
Who do you work for?
He tries to pull her off.
She leans in harder.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
Speak now or never again.
THE MAN
(motioning with eyes)
Jacket pocket.
Suspicious, she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather
billfold. Flips it open to reveal an I.D. that reads...
NATALIE
National Security Agency?
You're with the NSA?
THE MAN
I've been following you. I didn't
know which side you were on.
(beat)
This is bigger than you think.
The anime classic is playing. Pete keeps looking back
towards the door. He's been ditched again. Just when he's
about to give up hope, Natalie is there.
NATALIE
I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I
can't explain.
(hands card)
This is my cell phone number. Please
call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry.

With that, she goes. A beat, then she comes back.
Kisses him once, hard. Then goes for real.
CUT TO:
Dylan and Knox are asleep in his bed, when the doorbell
CHIMES. Dylan bolts upright. She slips out of bed, peers
out the window. Vivian Wu is waiting by the front door.
DYLAN
Eric, it's Vivian.
KNOX
Hmmm.
I wonder what she's here
for?
DYLAN
Want me to tell her to come back, or...
KNOX
No, no.
I'd better deal.
(he kisses her)
You go back to bed.
Knox pulls on a robe, goes downstairs.
STAY ON DYLAN --
as she pulls on her clothes, her CELL PHONE rings.
She
grabs it.
DYLAN
Hello?
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
NATALIE
Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not
who she says she is. She's a former
assassin and an all around bitch.
DYLAN
Oh no.
OH SHIT. Natalie, she's HERE!
NATALIE
What?!
DYLAN
I'm at Knox's, she just showed up!
Knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. Vivian,
sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. They are
both surprised to see Dylan walk into the room.
VIVIAN WU
I see you take your bodyguarding
services seriously. Still, I worry
that no one is watching the door.
DYLAN
(covering)
Oh, I'm watching it.
In fact, I just
called for back up.
From her bag, Vivian pulls a silver 9MM.
VIVIAN WU
All the same, I'm concerned about
Mr. Knox's safety.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
71.
CONTINUED:
Although Knox is clueless, it's clear the message Vivian
is sending to Dylan. She's in control here.
Vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.
KNOX
(explaining)
Vivian just came over to run through
some numbers for the IPO.
VIVIAN WU
Please, take a seat. I'm almost
finished.
With a knowing glance at Dylan, she goes back to her
phone call.
No alternative, Dylan takes a seat beside Knox.
Both face
Vivian, whose hand is very near the gun.
Dylan looks at Knox as he reads through his papers.
He has no
idea there's anything wrong.
VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Really. How disappointing.
Vivian gestures to the abandoned Scrabble game on the table.
Why not play?
DYLAN
I'm not much for games.
VIVIAN WU
Pity.
As Knox flips pages in the report, Dylan casually begins
pushing Scrabble letters around, nothing serious. But she's
managed to spell...
ENEMY
She gets Knox's attention, looks to the word, up to Vivian.
Knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it.
While Vivian continues to talk on the phone, Knox sets his
report down. Pushes around some letters of his own. The
words finally come out as...
I
KNOW
CLOSE ON Dylan.
What does that mean?
Vivian snaps her phone shut.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
(to Knox)
Bad news: The other angels are still
alive. Good news: Everything else
proceeding apace.
Dylan stands up.
What the hell is going on?
Vivian draws the gun on her.
Knox moves over toward
Vivian's side.
KNOX
Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment
would come sooner or later. I was
just hoping for later.
A long beat, Dylan trying to wrap her head around this.
DYLAN
All this time, we thought Red Star
was behind this, but it was you.
(realizing)
You faked your kidnapping.
Knox taps his nose.
She's got it.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Why?
KNOX
To gain your trust. And get your
help.
(beat)
I want you to know, my personal
attraction to you was a sincere
and unrelated complication.
DYLAN
Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot
better about you being a lying pole
smoker.
Dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear Knox's
throat out. Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
I can't believe I trusted you.
KNOX
Why not? You trust Charlie and you've
never even met him.
Dylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
73.
CONTINUED:
KNOX (CONT'D)
And believe me, there's a lot about
him that you don't know. Anyway,
I'm not going to be an idiot and
stand here talking when we could do
something useful, like KILL YOU.
Goodbye, Dylan, I'll miss you...
How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the
trigger...
Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls.
BLAM!
the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window
causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her
opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian
pumps off shots.
As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and
does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the
bullet impacted.
SMASH!
The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out
the window, onto the ledge.
KNOX (CONT'D)
Wow.
(to Vivian)
I've never seen YOU do something
like that.
VIVIAN WU
Oh, shut up.
CUT TO:
Natalie, Dylan and Alex nurse their wounds and compare notes.
DYLAN
I can't believe Knox tried to kill me.
I mean, I've been lied to, I've been
cheated on, but no guy has ever
tried to SHOOT me before.
(coldly)
I'm gonna get him for that.
ALEX
He played us from the very start.
It was all just so he could get us
to tap into Red Star. He couldn't
figure out a way to do it himself.
NATALIE
Who knew that we are actually
tapping into the main servers for
The National Security Agency?
DYLAN
And now, thanks to us, he's had hours
to download whatever top secret
information he wants, for God knows
what reason.
The angels take a beat to let their indignation grow.

CONTINUED:
NATALIE
Wait a minute. We installed the
transmitter, yes, but we never gave
him the receiver.
ALEX
What?
NATALIE
That laptop was the only way to access
the transmitter. And we gave the
laptop to...
They look at each other...
ANGELS
Bosley!
And on that note...
Bosley's cell, as such, is a round room.
Bosley flits about in a panic. He's hardly touched the gourmet
food on his tray. Except for the pudding. He loves pudding.
JUMP CUT TO:
Still a-twitter, Bosley flips through the 500 channels on
his big-screen TV. He watches a few moments of E!
JUMP CUT TO:
As the Thin Man takes the tray away, Bosley suddenly attacks
him with the silverware. With a single hand to Bosley's
forehead, the Thin Man holds him at arm's length, harmless.
He takes the weapons away.
JUMP CUT TO:
Bosley WHISTLES to a bright red songbird who has landed
on the windowsill. The bird WHISTLES back. Bosley thinks
they're having a conversation.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
Bosley is going a little insane.
JUMP CUT TO:
In his spacious bathroom, Bosley is sitting on the toilet,
rocking as he makes spaceman noises.
We hear a PLOP in the water, and then a BLEEP BLEEP.
Curious, he stands up and looks in the bowl.
He's surprised
by what he sees.
CUT TO:
Alex is on the phone, frantically dialing numbers.
ALEX
Come on, Bosley, answer.
(she hangs up, then,
to the Angels)
I've tried all his numbers and paged
him five times. No answer.
NATALIE
I don't even want to think about
what I'm thinking right now.
DYLAN
Don't!
He's alive, he's gotta be.
If...
(she pauses)
What IS that?
There's a very faint voice coming from Bosley's desk drawer.
Dylan walks around the desk, yanks it open...
BOSLEY (O.S.)
Angels!
Angels, can you hear me!
Dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer, holds him up.
Bosley's voice gets louder.
BOSLEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I don't know if you can hear me. I don't
know if this thing is even working.
The Angels crowd around Dylan and the receiver.
It seems
impossible.
On the top of the TV, a wire runs from the satellite feed to --
THE TINY RADIO
that Bosley swallowed at the spa.
It's worked its way
through his system.
BOSLEY
I know you can't answer, but... I
really hope you can hear this.
BOSLEY
I don't know where I am, really. I'm
in a round room. The walls are white.
Well. Not white-white. More of a
cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes,
I'm going to say vanilla.
INTERCUT
This isn't helping.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
I can see the ocean.
ALEX
Bingo.
Dylan finds a globe amid the wreckage.
Wipes off the soot.
BOSLEY
I don't know which ocean. I was
blindfolded the whole time. We were
flying. It must've been three or
four hours. Maybe more.

With her fingers, Dylan figures out how far he could have
flown. Estimates the circumference.
DYLAN
(frustrated)
He could be anywhere in North America.
The bird Bosley was whistling to lands on the TV, looks
at the transmitter, curious. SINGS its song.
BOSLEY
Wherever it is, they have really
good pudding.
Natalie holds up a finger -- stop.
DYLAN
(incredulous)
What, pudding?
The bird SINGS its song again.
Natalie smiles.
NATALIE
Hear that? That's a blue spotted
egret. They only live in one place.
ALEX
Florida.
The MUSIC revs up, as we...
CUT TO:
Knox and Vivian walk into a fully macked computer room,
where the Thin Man is supervising a techie as he taps away
at Bosley's laptop.
KNOX
Well?
THIN MAN
Our access was cut off at the source.
KNOX
GODDAMNIT!
THIN MAN
But not before we retrieved the
information you wanted.

The Thin Man pulls a piece of paper out of a printer,
hands them to Knox.
THIN MAN (CONT'D)
The National Security Agency's secret file
on the man known as Charles Townsend.
Knox smiles.
Takes the print-out.
KNOX
Finally.
(beat)
How about Bosley? Did we get the
information we wanted?
THIN MAN
Once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird.
The Thin Man hands Knox another print-out.
KNOX
Hmmm. Miami Arena.
Preparations
have been made?
THIN MAN
Yes.
We move out tonight.
KNOX
Excellent.
(beat)
Where IS Bosley?
THIN MAN
In the tower. We were waiting till
you gave the word.
KNOX
Well?
No time like the present.
The Thin Man nods.
The Thin Man cocks his gun as he heads to the tower to do
away with Bosley. Then...
HENCHMAN
Sir?
You should take a look at this.
The Henchman leads Thin Man into...
SECURITY ROOM
A room lined with monitors that survey the courtyard. Henchman
points to one in the corner.

HENCHMAN (CONT'D)
See here? Look at the timer on
the camera.
THIN MAN
It's not moving.
(beat)
Oh, this is the oldest one in the
book. Punch up camera three.
Another camera angle comes up, this also a view of the
empty courtyard.
THIN MAN (CONT'D)
Now pan left.
The Henchman does what he's told and, on the monitor...
WE SEE DYLAN, dressed in a black cat suit, as she rewires
a security camera. She glances around, making sure no
one sees her.
THIN MAN (CONT'D)
The old re-loop the video camera trick.
And look, she's not even carrying a gun.
(beat)
What is this, amateur hour?
CUT TO:
Alex, dressed in a sexy bikini, emerges from the water
and instantly takes out two guards.
Racing up the stairs, Natalie enters a round room with
open windows on all sides. A gentle breeze stirs the
curtains. There's an amazing 360 degree view, from hills
to ocean.
According to her scanner, Bosley should be here, but
there's no one.
NATALIE
(yelling)
BOSLEY! Bosley, can you hear me?
DAY
Hearing her voice, the feral Bosley looks up.
BOSLEY
Natalie!
Is that you?
She hears him. She keeps yelling -- so does he -- until
they both realize that his room is above hers.
NATALIE
How do I get up to you?
BOSLEY
There's a staircase. Look for a
switch.
She begins frantically checking the desk, the shelves,
everything.
Her cell phone RINGS.
She answers it.
NATALIE
Hello?... Pete, hi! How are you?
On break, Pete is talking on a pay phone.
PETE
I'm good. I just -- you said you
wanted me to call.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
85.
Natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret
switch.
NATALIE
I did. I do.
I mean, thank you
for calling.
INTERCUT
PETE
I'm not an insecure person or anything,
and I've really enjoyed the very brief
time we have spent together.
Two GOONS race up the stairs into the office.
Natalie
turns to face them.
PETE (CONT'D)
I'm just wondering if it's
something I said or did that's
making this whole thing so weird
between us.
The Goons approach.
NATALIE
(into phone)
Can you hold on a sec?
Hitting MUTE, Natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives
under the desk. She comes up on the other side with a
SURGE SUPPRESSOR,
electric cords attached. She backhands it into the
goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through
their bodies.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
(un-muting)
One more sec.
She re-mutes.
With a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons,
WHACKS the other with the cell phone.
The first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the
last moment, leaving Goon One to hit Goon Two. Both men
topple through the open window, falling. Yikes.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
(un-muting)
Sorry about that.

PETE
Listen, is this a bad time?
NATALIE
No.
Not at all.
She starts searching again for the switch.
PETE
You just sound distracted.
NATALIE
You know, work this week has been
really busy. It's been hard to focus.
BEHIND NATALIE, Vivian Wu reaches the top of the stairs.
She moves stealthily. Natalie has no idea she's there.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
See, the thing is, I'm not a full-
time waitress. I should have been
more up-front about that, it's just...
At the last moment, Natalie catches a moving reflection
in a shiny trophy. Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an
antique chair at her head.
She ducks.
The chair SHATTERS the display case.
Scrambling to get away, Natalie drops the phone.
PETE
Natalie, what was that?
NATALIE
(yelling to phone)
Everything's fine!
VIVIAN WU
Hate to disagree.
Vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing Natalie. Vivian
jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel.
As we probably suspected, Vivian Wu is one hell of a
martial artist. Fortunately, so is Natalie.
In their first series of blows, Vivian seems to have the
upper hand, but Natalie rallies hard. Vivian surprises
her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down.
Vivian grabs the phone off the floor.
VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
Is this the famous Charlie?

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

PETE

No, it's Pete.
Vivian looks at the phone. Who the fuck cares?
She
throws the phone out the open window.
Getting up, Natalie stares her down, incredulity building
to rage.
NATALIE
You bitch!
I like that guy.
Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear.
Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal
Kombat. Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase,
where she knocks over a candlestick.
That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor. Circling around the room, each set of
shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room.
As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight, Bosley sticks
his head down from above, watching the brawl. Natalie is
kicking ass.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
(to Vivian)
Do you have any idea how difficult it
is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?
She slams Vivian into the wall.
Grabs her again, hands
around her head.
VIVIAN WU
To be honest?
Vivian suddenly leans forward and KISSES her, right on
the lips.
VIVIAN WU (CONT'D)
I don't care.
Natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives Vivian the
chance to swing at her. She misses.
NATALIE
I can handle villainy. I can even
handle super-villainy.
(Vivian swings and
misses again)
But what you did is just wrong.

She head-butts Vivian, knocking her out cold.
She throws
the limp body on the floor.
A beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley.
NATALIE (CONT'D)
(suddenly chipper)
Hi, Bos!
He waves.
Racing across the water, we find thong-clad BEACH BABES
moving to a Latin beat. Art Deco buildings flank sun-kissed
streets. The people are sexy, the daiquiris strong, and every
night's a fiesta -- Welcome to MIAMI.
Running down the street, towards Miami Arena, the three
angels pass THREE OTHER WOMEN rollerblading by: JILL
MONROE, SABRINA DUNCAN and KELLY GARRETT.
Nothing is said, but a cool moment just happened.
CUT TO:
The three Angels are running down a very long hallway.
Their voices are the only sound that echoes off these
walls, although there is a faint humming that grows louder
as they approach two, metal fire doors.
DYLAN
What do you think he looks like?

ALEX
Sixty, tall, well-built.
NATALIE
I always saw him as younger.
DYLAN
Definitely.
With black hair.
NATALIE
No, silver hair. And tan.
ALEX
He's not George Hamilton.
NATALIE
He's outside a lot.
DYLAN
We'll know him when we see him,
that's for sure.
ALEX
IF we see him.
NATALIE
How hard can it be to spot Charlie?
They slam into the doors, and we...
CUT TO:
We reverse angle to reveal the inside of Miami Arena. The first
thing that hits us is the WALL OF SOUND, the noise made
by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy.
The next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the
job facing the Angels. Hard to spot? The crowd is one,
enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity.
DYLAN
Aw, shit.
The game is in progress, Duke vs. North Carolina, and it's a
barn burner. A one point game with six minutes to go. BALL
PLAYER pulls up and swishes a three pointer, Duke by two.
The crowd goes apeshit.
BY THE MEZZANINE
The Angels huddle, yelling over the deafening noise of the
crowd...
DYLAN (CONT'D)
We have to split up!

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
92.

ALEX
I'll take the luxury boxes.
DYLAN
I'll take the mezzanine.
NATALIE
I got the floor.
They split up. Dylan leads the charge down the loge section,
blowing past the SECURITY WOMAN, who yells after her.
BEHIND THE RIM, COLLEGE PLAYER #2 pulls down a brick, slams
home the rebound. The crowd ROARS.
JASON GIBBONS, famous movie star and North Carolina alumnus,
pumps his fists in the air. His luxury box is loaded with
fellow Tar Heels and nameless studio executives. He
repeatedly high fives a Hollywood type in sunglasses and Armani.
JASON
Yes, yes!
When suddenly, the door to the luxury box is flung open.
ALEX
(yelling)
Charlie!? Charles Townsend!
Jason whips around and locks eyes with Alex.
JASON
Alex?
ALEX
Jason?
(beat)
Shit.
Realizing she has no time to explain, and that Charlie isn't
in here, she turns and leaves.
JASON
ALEX!
Hey...
While everyone watches, confused, Jason pushes his way
through the box and follows Alex into the hall.

Dylan races past rows of seats, pissing off plenty of fans
in the process.
DYLAN

Charlie! Charlie!
FLASHES FIRE
in the stands.
STATISTICIANS
scribble at their monitors. Natalie runs behind them,
scanning the crowd. WHIP PANS, from ONE MAN to ANOTHER to
ANOTHER. Stopping on a likely candidate...
NATALIE
Charlie?
LIKELY CANDIDATE
Who?
THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK
counts down.
:60.
:59.
:58.
Alex bursts in.
It's a crowd of fifteen cocktail-drinking
BUSINESS MEN.
ALEX
Charles Townsend? Anybody, Charles
Townsend?
She ducks back into the hallway.
Alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated.
Then,
miraculously, she spots him...
KNOX.
He walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large,
metal briefcase. He heads for the elevator.
ALEX
immediately goes to intercept him, but...
THIN MAN (O.S.)
Don't move.

It's the Thin Man, standing behind her, with a gun in
her back.
THIN MAN (CONT'D)
You move, you say anything, I
perforate you. Got it?
Knox glances back at the Thin Man, nods to him.
Then he
gets in the elevator.
The Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit
doors, gun still in her back. Alex is trying to think of an
escape, quickly. She knows that the second he gets her out
of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. The door gets
closer and closer...
JASON (O.S.)
Alex?!
Jesus, what is going on?
The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is
sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.
ALEX
Jason, hi, I...
The Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Can I talk to you later?
JASON
No you can talk to me NOW. I want
to know what the hell is going on.
First, you disappear with no
explanation, not even a goodbye.
ALEX
I'm sorry, I...
JASON
Now, I see you here, but you're
with some other guy.
THIN MAN
Hey, movie star, do yourself a
favor and get lost.
Jason double takes.
He's not used to someone talking to
him like that.
JASON
Lemme guess.
You must be Charlie?
ALEX
Jason, please...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
95.
CONTINUED:
JASON
No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm
sick of this asshole telling you
what you can and can't do.
And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the
Thin Man.
Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super
detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it
leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain.
The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.
THIN MAN
That was stupid.
First, he pops Jason right in the jaw. Jason stumbles
backward, dazed. Then he reaches for his gun, in the
process, loosening his grip on Alex...
ALEX
Jason, get down!
Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full
roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's
hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two
quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitch-kick to the chin.
Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.
JASON
What the hell is going on?
What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his
girlfriend. While the action star watches in amazement, Alex
unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make
Jet Li green with envy.
The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance. A flying side kick
sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. We
follow the fight...
... to the first landing. The Thin Man, battered and bruised,
reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun, but
Alex is too fast for him. She stamps on his hand, then
drops a knee to his throat.
ALEX
Right now, just by leaning forward, I
could crush your windpipe. You'd die
a slow and painful death. You don't
want that, do you?
(CONTINUED)

96.
CONTINUED:
The Thin Man shakes his head "no."
ALEX (CONT'D)
Where is the bomb, when's it going off?
She presses harder.
Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex. He
finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed
to the staircase.
ALEX
Hi, Jason.
Gimme one second?
Jason nods, sure.
We go to another triptych, all three Angels on their cell
phones in different parts of arena.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Angels! Knox planted the bomb in the
basement, and it's timed to go off
when the game clock hits zero!
NATALIE (O.S.)
Roger that, Alex, I'll stop the clock!
DYLAN (O.S.)
I'll look for the bomb!
Alex turns back to Jason. He's clearly having a difficult
time processing everything he's just seen.
ALEX
I lied to you Jason.
I'm not a
secretary.
JASON
Yeah, I can see that.
ALEX
(referring to the
Thin Man)
And that wasn't Charlie.
JASON
Right.
ALEX
I'm actually here to stop a madman
from killing everyone in this
building. Would it be okay if we
talked later?

CONTINUED:
JASON
Go save the world, honey.
(beat)
I'll be waiting for you.
Alex smiles.
Runs off.
Natalie stares up at the clock... :30.
:29.
The WHISTLE BLOWS.
REFEREE
Time out!
Whew, that was close. But it'll start up any second.
She
has to keep it stopped. But how? She glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea.
ON THE COURT --
MUSIC starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine.
As they kick into gear, Natalie comes out with them, dressed
as a Duke cheerleader. She follows along with the dancers, a
bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it.
Dylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase.
Then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above.
Dylan approaches it cautiously.
She slowly opens the top...
DYLAN
(to herself)
Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is
figure out which wire to cut.
REVEAL THE BOMB --
there are about fifty different wires, in every color in
the Crayola box.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
Oh, shit.
Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange.
ALEX
You're kidding me.
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
98.
NATALIE
is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full-
out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other
cheerleaders. She's better.
ON THE COURT
The SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie
keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching
her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another
agenda as well...
COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER
The time out is over, but one
cheerleader doesn't seem to notice.
Officials can't start the clock again
while she's on the court.
CUT TO:
Dylan has picked two wires.
DYLAN
Chartreuse and magenta.
This has
gotta be it.
She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...
KNOX (O.S.)
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
She spins to see Knox, standing behind her.
KNOX (CONT'D)
See, if you snip ANY of those wires,
the bomb WILL blow up.
DYLAN
It's gonna blow anyway, once the
clock gets to zero.
KNOX
Who told you that, my idiotic
henchman? Do you think I tell him
ANYTHING that's confidential?
He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one
we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene.
KNOX (CONT'D)
THIS is what triggers that bomb.
So
if you'll kindly step away, I'll
refrain from killing both of us.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
99.
CONTINUED:
Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away.
KNOX (CONT'D)
In different circumstances, Dylan, I
think you and I could have worked out.
We have a lot in common.
DYLAN
Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you
ARE one.
Knox laughs.
KNOX
Good one.
(beat, as he backs up)
Well, I must be going. If you like
your body parts attached to your
torso, I suggest you do the same.
Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way.
ALEX
Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.
NATALIE
Give us the detonator.
KNOX
NO!
Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.
KNOX (CONT'D)
I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!
CHARLIE (O.S.)
Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want,
not all these innocent people.
Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.
KNOX
Charlie?
That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years,
we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.
He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a
"We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by
Charlie's appearance.
ANGELS
Charlie?
Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99
100.
CONTINUED:
CHARLIE
Your father was a double agent, Eric.
Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed
by his own people before we could
throw him in jail.
(beat)
He was my friend.
KNOX
It's still your fault, you arrogant
prick! You still killed my father!
CHARLIE
Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should
YOU kill all these people? If you
hate me so much, just shoot ME.
Just shoot me, Eric.
Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target.
It's a horribly tense moment.
The Angels are frozen, watching
Knox decide Charlie's fate.
Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do
this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined.
He starts lowering his gun.
KNOX
Okay.
You're right.
(quickly)
I'll just kill you.
BLAM!
It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting
Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox.
Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance
to go off.
Dylan runs to Charlie's side.
DYLAN
Charlie, no.
NO!
She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round
their fallen leader. He gasps for air.
DYLAN (CONT'D)
He's trying to say something.
Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for
air, there's something stuck in his mouth.
With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice
chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.
(CONTINUED)
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

CONTINUED:
VOICE
Ucch, that tasted terrible!
The voice isn't Charlie's. Dylan reaches down and rips
off Charlie's mask, revealing...
NATALIE
Bosley!
Are you okay?
BOSLEY
Think so.
He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small
wound where the bullet grazed his side.
BOSLEY (CONT'D)
Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.
Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair.
DYLAN
Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's
here... then where's Charlie?
The Angels all look at each other.
No one knows.
