                                November 4th, 2011       EXT. OUTER SPACE - LUNCHTIME

      We drift away from EARTH, past the planets which grammar 
        school made us familiar with.  And then beyond.  A left 
        turn.  A sharp right.  See ya, Pluto.  Then:  A PLANET.

      INT. UNDISCLOSED ALIEN STATION - CONTINUOUS

        Two notes: 1) Everything  alien  is shot so we never get 
        a pure look at one 2) Dialogue is alien-ese (subtitled).

        TWO GREEN ALIEN FEET march to front, leaving GREEN GOO in 
        their wake.  The footsteps silence those in attendance.

                                        LEADER (O.S.)
                      My fellow Zabvronians.  We have 
                      intercepted a transmission from a 
                      different galaxy.

        Excited CHATTER. TIGHT ON two GREEN HANDS slapping five.

                                        LEADER (CONT D)
                      SILENCE!  
                                (then)
                      But yes, we re pretty pumped.  Behold.

        His ALIEN FINGER points at a MONITOR: an INFOMERCIAL.

                                        VOICE-OVER (O.S.)
                      The Knob Hill Development in Manalapan, 
                      New Jersey offers luxury townhomes on an 
                      eighteen hole golf course.  All units are 
                      available and--

                              (over commercial)
                      Research shows this land called Jersey is 
                      known as The Garden State. We have 
                      obtained an image of one such garden.

        IMAGE: a LUSH GARDEN.  Off-camera, aliens COO in unison, 
      like E.T. having an orgasm.

                                        LEADER (CONT D)
                      Yes, I know. New Jersey looks delightful. 
                      Planet Jersey harbors a race called 
                      humans.  

        His finger points at an image of BRAD PITT.  Instant 
        pandemonium:  Turn it off, I m gonna throw up, etc.                                                                                       2.

                      Silence!  They can t all be so revolting. 
                      Ambassador?

        A PAIR OF FEET stand.

                                        LEADER (CONT D)
                      You will lead an exploratory mission.  Go 
                      in human form and secure this village.  

        His HANDS grab a SILVER BOX with a blinking red light. 

                                        LEADER (CONT D)
                      Bring the Pupar and await further 
                        instruction.

        The box gets handed over: from one alien hand to another.

                                        LEADER (CONT D)
                      Don t forget to recharge it.


      EXT. NEW JERSEY - EVENING

        We re outside the CONDO DEVELOPMENT from the commercial. 

        CHYRON: TEN YEARS LATER


      INT. CONDO LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

        TIGHT ON the silver box (Pupar).  PULL BACK: an ODD MAN.

                                        ODD MAN
                      Well, another week, still no word.

      He talks to a group of ODD HUMANS. An ANGRY WOMAN stands.

                                        ANGRY WOMAN
                      We should have gotten further instruction 
                      by now. We must recharge the Pupar!

        MURMURS.  The Odd Man looks to his BEAUTIFUL WIFE, petite 
        and blonde.  She stands nearby, looks concerned.  An 
        ANGRY MAN stands next to the Angry Woman.

                                        ANGRY MAN
                      For ten years we have waited, prisoners 
                      behind these gates! The two of us are 
                      leaving!  We have sold our unit.

                                        ANGRY WOMAN
                      Got above asking price if you re curious.                                                                                      3.




      More MURMURS.  Wow: more than asking price?

                                        ANGRY MAN
                      We re leaving... and in our original 
                      form. Perhaps you remember what that 
                      looks like?

      They CLAP twice, as if activating a clapper.  A FLASH and 
        ALIEN FEET EXIT, leaving a trail of GREEN GOO behind.  
        Everyone springs into cleaning mode ( get a wet paper 
        towel, sometimes vinegar works, get it before it sets ). 

                                                                              CUT TO:

        TIGHT ON ALIEN FEET walking up a RAMP.  After a beat, a 
        ROLLING SUITCASE follows.  We re outside...


      EXT. CONDO DEVELOPMENT - CONTINUOUS

        A SPACESHIP takes off. PAN DOWN to the Odd Man, watching.  
        A hand tugs his shirt.  He looks down: an ODD LITTLE BOY.

                                        LITTLE BOY
                      Father, if they sold their unit, it means 
                      humans will move in.  What will we do?

                                        MAN
                      Let us see who it is who comes, my Son. 
                      Only then might we have reason to worry.


      EXT. BAYONNE APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

        A MOVING VAN is parked out front.

        CHYRON: YESTERDAY

        TIGHT ON the tear-streaked face of AMBER WEAVER (16).  

                                        AMBER
                      THIS BLOWS!  THIS TOTALLY BLOWS!

        Amber screams again abnormally, clears frame. Two 
        children enter: MAX WEAVER (9) and ABBY WEAVER (7). 

                                        ABBY
                      Mom!  Max told me to shut up!

                                        WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Don t say shut up, Max.

      They clear frame, DEBBIE WEAVER (early 40 s) enters.                                                                                      4.




                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Kids, give your mother a break, okay?

        Debbie shoots a glare backwards.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Oh, shut up.

        She clears and MARTY WEAVER enters, early 40 s and 
        sweating like a mother-fucker.  He s carrying boxes.

                                        MARTY
                      I may be the bad guy now but you ll be 
                      thanking me soon. It has a golf course!

                                        AMBER (O.S.)
                      I HATE YOU!

        Marty loads boxes in, closes the trunk. He looks upwards.

                                        MARTY
                      Please God: help me out here.  No leaky 
                      faucets.  And no termites, okay?
                                (beat, then)
                      Oh, and let the neighbors be normal.

      As he gets in and takes pulls out toward the New Jersey 
        Turnpike we CUE:

              

                         TITLE CARD                                                                                      5.




      INT. WEAVER TOWNHOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - AFTERNOON

        Marty moves one end of a SOFA against a wall, directly in 
        front of a window.  Debbie moves the other end of the 
      sofa into place and plops down, testing its positioning.  

        Marty sits next to her on the sofa, puts his arm around 
      her.  She smiles weakly.  There s tension here.

                                        MARTY
                      Place is pretty spectacular, huh?

                                        DEBBIE
                              (not convinced)
                      Uh huh.

        Out the window behind them (they don t see this), a man 
        drives by in a GOLF CART.  Marty treads carefully...

                                        MARTY
                      You told me you wanted me to start taking 
                         initiative. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      This is true.  I did say that.

                                        MARTY
                      You said - and I m not trying to fight 
                      here, just reminding you - you said: 
                       Marty, after eighteen years of marriage 
                      it d be nice if once in a while you took 
                      initiative and surprised me. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Right again.  I said that too.

        Silence.  Behind them (again unseen), a man and woman 
      pass in a SECOND GOLF CART.  Marty tries again.

                                        MARTY
                      So...

                                        DEBBIE
                      I meant flowers, Marty!  I meant a new 
                      crockpot!  I didn t mean for you to make 
                        a down-payment on a townhouse and uproot 
                      our family without consulting me!

        Marty takes this in.

                                        MARTY
                      Is something wrong with our crockpot?                                                                                      6.




        Debbie closes her eyes.  Silence. A HOARD OF GOLF CARTS 
      pass outside.  It s a ridiculous sight: one that Marty 
        and Debbie are not yet privy to.  Marty tries again.

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      It s got a golf course.

                                        DEBBIE
                                (sarcastic)
                      I can take up golf.

                                        MARTY
                      First available unit in ten years and we 
                      got it!

                                        DEBBIE
                      Yay.

        Marty hesitates, unsure how to proceed.  As he thinks, 

                                        MAX (O.S.)
                      Mom, Dad!  People are here!

                                        MARTY
                      Oh, thank God.
                                (hopping up)
                      Let s go meet the neighbors!


      EXT. WEAVER TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

        The family emerges. Out front stands the ENTIRE COMMUNITY 
        (standing in front of their golf carts).  Everyone holds 
        a PIE.  They just stand there.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Hello.

                                        TOWN
                              (in unison)
                      Hello.

        The ODD MAN from earlier approaches, hands Debbie a pie.  
        Marty extends his hand.

                                        MARTY
                      How ya  doin .  Marty Weaver.

        The man mirrors Marty, sticking out his hand (but not 
        shaking).  His hand will remain outstretched for a while.                                                                                      7.




                                        ODD MAN
                      I am Wilt Chamberlain, leader of this 
                      community and immediate neighbor to your 
                      west.  We bring you pie, as is your 
                      custom, as a gift of welcome.

        Debbie and Marty share a look. Town members begin lining 
        up, bowing and piling pies in their arms.  

                                        WILT
                      I will familiarize you with my family and 
                      we will take our leave.
                                (then, loudly)
                      WIFE!  STEP FORWARD!

      They JUMP, startled. His WIFE (seen earlier) steps up.

                                        WILT (CONT D)
                      My wife, Jackie Joyner-Kersee.

        Marty and Debbie LAUGH, stop short when no one else does. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Hi, Jackie.  Joyner-Kersee.  I m Debbie.  

        Debbie extends her hand, Jackie Joyner-Kersee extends 
      hers (again not shaking, just holding it there). Debbie 
        awkwardly changes topics.

                                        DEBBIE (CONT D)
                      Is that your little boy?

        Hiding behind her is the ODD BOY we met earlier. 

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Our youngest, Lennox Lewis.

        Debbie s doing her best to keep it together.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Of course. Max, maybe you can be friends?

        Max steps forward, eyes him suspiciously

                                        MAX
                      You into Barbie dolls or boogers or 
                      anything weird?

                                        LENNOX
                      No.

                                        MAX
                      He ll do.                                                                                      8.




      They run off together.  Abby follows.  

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      My gratitude.  It has been difficult for 
                      Lennox to make friends.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                                (explaining)
                      Thus far we are the only family in this 
                      development to have bred.

        Debbie nods, lost.  Amber EMERGES, a picture of 
        sadolescent insanity.

                                        MARTY
                                (awkward segue)
                      And speaking of breeding, here s our 
                      oldest, Amber.  Amber say hello.

                                        AMBER
                      I can t find my I-pod. I NEED MY I-POD!

        And like that, she returns inside. 

                                        MARTY
                      She scares the hell out of us.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                                (waving him off)
                      We too bear the burden of an unhappy 
                      teenager.  

        She points up at the window of the townhouse next door. 
        Looking out is a handsome, ASIAN TEENAGER.

                      Our eldest, Joe Montana.

        Marty begins LAUGHING.

                                        MARTY
                      Joe Montana.
                              (off their looks)
                      Fun.  Another fun name.  

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Tomorrow you dine with us, a display of 
                      neighborly hospitality. But now, we take 
                      our leave. 

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      COMMUNITY DISPERSE!                                                                                      9.




        The crowd departs instantly, leaving them holding huge 
        stacks of pies, confused.

                                        MARTY
                      They seemed nice, no?

                                        DEBBIE
                      Marty, I swear to God, if you set up some 
                      kind of candid camera thing thinking it 
                      would be funny--

                                        MARTY
                      I didn t.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Okay. So we re just living amidst a cult 
                      of golf-cart-driving pie-makers with the 
                      names of pro athletes?  Marty, seriously, 
                      what are we gonna do?

                                        MARTY
                      We ll make it work. I ll buy a golf cart, 
                      you can legally change your name to 
                      Martina Navratalova, it s all good.  

        Despite herself, Debbie LAUGHS. Even when fighting, you 
      love these two together.  Marty takes her hand.

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      I m sure there s an explanation.  Let s 
                      have dinner with them tomorrow.  Give 
                      them a chance at least.  Okay?

        Debbie nods, still wary.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Dinner better not be weird.  


      INT. WILT CHAMBERLAIN S TOWNHOUSE - NEXT EVENING

        Dinner.  Yep, it s weird.  There are full plates of food 
      in front of Marty s family but the plates in front of 
        Wilt s family are topped by... well, BOOKS.  They re 
        reading while the Weavers eat.  Again: weird.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Dinner is wonderful, Jackie.  But it 
                      feels a bit... strange, you know, that 
                      only our family is eating.                                                                                    10.




                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      We receive nourishment through our eyes 
                      and mind, rather than our mouths. 
                                (then, noticing)
                      Joe Montana, why aren t you reading?

                                        JOE MONTANA
                      I m not hungry.

        Weird.  Marty and Debbie share a look.

                                        WILT
                      As is customary, the leader of the host 
                      family will now direct a toast of 
                      welcome.  FAMILY, WE TOAST!

      In unison: Wilt s family snap their fingers, bang twice 
      on the table, stomp their feet once, pull on their ears, 
        and shout...  HEAR OUR CALL, WHOOP-WHOOP  and bang their 
        fists on the table one last time.  

        Then, they immediately resume eating (well, reading).  
        Marty and Debbie look on, horrified.  MAX STANDS.

                                        MAX
                      Me and Lennox want to go play.

                                        LENNOX
                      Father?  May I be excused?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      You may go.

                                        MARTY
                                (trying)
                      Maxwell, do you wish to be excused?

        Max FAKE FARTS.  He and Abby crack up.

                                        MAX
                      Excuse me.

                                        MARTY
                      You may go.

        The kids all run off.  Amber STANDS, grabs Joe.

                                        AMBER
                      We re going upstairs.

        Joe looks to his parents who NOD.  He follows Amber.                                                                                    11.




                                        AMBER (CONT D)
                      Can I grab a soda or something?

        She opens the fridge, it s filled to the brim with BOOKS.

                                        JOE MONTANA
                      No.

      He closes it.  Back to the table, Marty changes topics: 

                                        MARTY
                      I can trust your son upstairs with my 
                      little girl, right?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Worry not.  My son is incapable of 
                      breeding with your daughter.

                                        MARTY
                      Good enough for me.  Pass the potatoes?

        Jackie Joyner-Kersee STANDS.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Debbie, let us excuse ourselves and do 
                      dishes while our men converse like men.

        Debbie LAUGHS, then realizes she s serious.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Oh.  Okay.

        She raises a brow at Marty and follows her out...


      INT. JOE MONTANA S ROOM - MEANWHILE

        Walls covered in posters of the real Joe Montana.  Weird.  
        The teens ENTER and Amber closes the door.

                                        AMBER
                      Alright, I start school tomorrow. I need 
                      names: who s running the show over there?   

                                        JOE MONTANA
                      Oh, I do not attend school.  We are 
                      taught at home by our mother.

        Amber SCREAMS, horrified by this.  Joe JUMPS. 

                                        AMBER
                                (looking around)
                      Wait, where s your computer?                                                                                    12.




                                        JOE MONTANA
                      I don t have a computer.

                                        AMBER
                      How do you IM?

                                        JOE MONTANA
                      What s IM?

        Amber SCREAMS again. Joe looks both confused AND smitten.


      INT. KITCHEN - MEANWHILE

      At the sink: Debbie hands Jackie a dirty dish.  Jackie 
        opens the window above the sink and throws it out the 
        window.  It CRASHES in the distance.  Debbie shakes her 
        head, tries conversation.

                                        DEBBIE
                      So you re home full-time with the kids, 
                      huh?  I was doing it too until things 
                      took off with my company.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      You mean... you have an occupation?

                                        DEBBIE
                      Well, I was home, started sketching, 
                      wound up creating a line of handbags.  
                      Just got a shelf at Bloomingdales, 
                      actually. Never thought it d go this far.

        Jackie Joyner-Kersee looks shocked.  Debbie hands her 
        another dish.  Jackie throws it out the window.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      And your husband allows you to occupy 
                      yourself with such things?

        Debbie puts down the dishes.  

                                        DEBBIE
                      Okay, Jackie.  Joyner-Kersee.  What s 
                      your story?  Are you guys Amish or 
                      something?  Like... Amish athletes?  
                      Cause if Marty talked to me like Wilt 
                      talks to you, I d filet his genitals in 
                      his sleep like sashimi.

        Jackie Joyner-Kersee LAUGHS, quickly covers her mouth.                                                                                    13.




                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      I should not be amused.  It is 
                        disrespectful to speak this way of them.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Well, it s disrespectful when they turn 
                      their backs to us in bed and fart in our 
                      faces.  I think we re entitled.

        Jackie Joyner-Kersee busts out laughing again as we ...

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. DINING ROOM - MEANWHILE

        Where Marty and Wilt Chamberlain  talk like men.   Marty 
        chews on a toothpick.

                                        MARTY
                      So, basically I m in strollers and 
                      diapers.  You go into Toys  R Us: 
                      anything that s not a toy: I decide what 
                      shelf it goes on.  What do you do, Wilt?  

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      I do nothing.  We are independently 
                      wealthy and spend all our time within the 
                      confines of the community.

                                        MARTY
                      Lucky bastard. Any hobbies?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Hobbies?

                                        MARTY
                      You fish, or work on cars, or... I don t 
                      know...

      He pulls his toothpick out of his mouth...

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      Build things out of toothpicks?

      Wilt shakes his head no, confused.  Marty notices the 
        Pupar off to the side, reaches for it...

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      What s this thing--                                                                                    14.




                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      DO NOT TOUCH THE PUPAR!
                                (then, covering)
                      I mean ashtray.

        Marty slowly pulls his hands back.  Tries a new topic.

                                        MARTY
                      Soooo, Wilt, you a big Niners fan?
                              (off his blank look)
                      Your kid is named Joe Montana? 

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      We believe there is no greater tribute to 
                      this planet than to name ourselves in 
                      honor of its finest physical specimens.

                                        MARTY
                                (shaking his head)
                      No way I could get Debbie to go for that. 
                      Would have named the boy Mookie Wilson.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      My wife does what I tell her.

        Marty looks up, wide-eyed (no way!).  Wilt nods seriously 
      (you bet your ass). Marty smiles and lifts a glass.

                                        MARTY
                      I like your style, my friend.  To you, 
                      Wilt Chamberlain.

      Wilt lifts an imaginary glass and just holds it there as 
        Marty drinks.  It s weird.


      INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

        Max is BLOWING spit bubbles as Abby STANDS ON HER HEAD.

                                        ABBY
                      Look what I can do!  Look what I can do!

                                        MAX
                              (to Lennox)
                      My sister is such a dork.

                                        LENNOX
                      She seems to admire you greatly.

                                        MAX
                      She s a dork.                                                                                    15.




                                        LENNOX
                      Oh.  Okay.

                                        MAX
                      C mon, you re a kid!  You must know a 
                      trick or something! 

        Lennox shakes his head, embarrassed.

                                        MAX (CONT D)
                       Magic?  Armpit noise?  Something! 

      They look at Lennox expectantly.  He wants to so badly.

                                        LENNOX
                      Well... I do have one trick.  But you 
                      musn t tell anyone.

                                        ABBY
                      Cross our hearts, hope to die.

        Max nods.  Lennox hesitates, he shouldn t.  But the pull 
      of peer pressure is too strong.  He closes his eyes.  Max 
        and Abby smile, waiting.  Max CLAPS twice, then...

      FROM BEHIND

      AN ALIEN BACKSIDE. In foreground, Max and Abby s 
        terrified FACES.


      INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

        Where the couples are having coffee.  Marty is mid story.

                                        MARTY
                      So to make a long story short --

                                        DEBBIE
                      The moment passed ten minutes ago, Hon .

        MAX and ABBY fly past, SCREAMING LIKE CRAZY.  They re out 
        the door.  Amber follows, concerned.  A beat, then...

                                        MARTY
                      If you ll all just excuse us a moment.


      INT. MARTY AND DEBBIE S BEDROOM - LATER

        Marty and Debbie SIT at the bed s end.  Amber STANDS in 
        the corner.  Max and Abby hide under the covers.                                                                                    16.




                                        MARTY
                      Guys, I promise you he s not an alien.  
                      He s just a little strange, that s all.

        Max and Abby POP OUT out from the covers.

                                        MAX
                      No, Dad.  Justin Bernstein ate his 
                      boogers.  He was a little strange.  
                      Lennox Lewis is an alien.

      They SCREAM and pop back under cover.  CUE: DOORBELL.


      INT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

        Marty (with Debbie and Amber behind him) answers the 
        front door.  Wilt Chamberlain stands there.

                                        MARTY
                      Hey, Wilt Chamberlain. Sorry for-oh okay.    
                      Wow.  You brought the whole gang, huh?

      WILT ENTERS, followed by THE ENTIRE TOWN.  They fill the 
        room.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      So your children had a scare?

                                        MARTY
                      Oh, just kids with wild imaginations. 
                      They re convinced Lennox is an alien.  

        Marty and Debbie LAUGH.  No reaction elsewhere.  A beat. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Can I get anyone some pie?

      Wilt and Jackie share a look, turn back to Marty, 
        dramatic.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      You were bound to find out eventually.  
                      You may want to sit down.

                                        MARTY
                      Okay, you re starting to freak my kids 
                      out and by my kids I mean me.  I m gonna--

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                        Zabvronians!

      They all CLAP TWICE in unison.                                                                                    17.




                                        MARTY
                                (still going)
                      --have to ask you to-- holy hogs in 
                      heaven.

        THE MONEY SHOT: We see ALIENS IN FULL for the first time.  
      More precisely: a room full of green goo dripping aliens.   

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. MARTY AND DEBBIE S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER

        The entire family now LIES side by side in the bed, 
        tucked tightly under the covers.  From under covers...

                                        DEBBIE (O.S.)
                      It s got a golf course, and great schools-

                                        MARTY (O.S.)
                      Now s not the time, Honey.

                                        DEBBIE (O.S.)
                      First available unit in ten years and we 
                      got it! Oh yeah, just one little hiccup: 
                      OUR NEIGHBORS ARE GREEN!

        Marty sits up in bed.  The family emerges behind him.

                                        MARTY
                      Let s think. We haven t gotten sleep and--

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN (O.S.)
                      I am sorry to interrupt, Weaver family.

        Marty SCREAMS and pulls the covers back over his family.  
      Wilt and Jackie ENTER (in human form). They sit at the 
        bed s edge.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      An explanation is in order.  We hail from 
                      the Planet Zabvron.  A decade ago we were 
                      deployed to investigate if Earth might 
                      make a nice home should temperatures on 
                      our planet continue to rise.  You follow?

      From under the covers, the family answers in UNISON.

                                        FAMILY (O.S.)
                      Yes.

                                        MARTY (O.S.)
                      I m thinking of getting a Prius.                                                                                    18.




                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      You are the first humans to enter our 
                        development.  If you wish to reveal our 
                      secret we will not stop you.  We hope, 
                      however, that you will consider trusting 
                      us... and staying.  We ve had no real 
                      contact with humans and believe there is 
                      much we could learn from one another. 

      They go to exit, then stop. 

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Debbie Weaver, in their excitement, I 
                      fear my brethren have dripped green goo 
                      all over your new carpet.  We will pay 
                      for the cleaning.

      They EXIT.  After a beat (from under the covers)...

                                        DEBBIE (O.S.)
                                (yelling out)
                      Thank you.  

                                        MARTY (O.S.)
                                (yelling out)
                      Very generous of you.  And thanks again 
                      for dinner!

      As the family remains under the covers we:  

                     

                       END ACT ONE.                                                                                    19.







                             ACT TWO:


      INT. LIVING ROOM WINDOW - NEXT MORNING

        The family stands at the window, looking out.  A NEIGHBOR 
        waters his lawn (well, he s not really watering it, he s 
      more just shooting a hose up in the air and drenching 
        himself).  He catches them looking and WAVES. Caught, 
      they wave back.  Marty rips the blinds closed.  

                                        MARTY
                      Okay, the point of this family conference 
                      is to decide what to do.

                                        AMBER
                      ABOUT LIVING WITH ALIENS?  THIS IS SO 
                      RETARDED!

                                        MAX
                      I m not going to school.

                                        MARTY
                      Why not?

                                        MAX
                      What if the aliens come and eat Mommy?

                                        ABBY
                      Yeah, what if the aliens come and eat 
                      Mommy?

                                        MARTY
                      What about me?  What if the aliens come 
                      and eat Daddy?

        The kids shrug. The DOORBELL RINGS.  Everyone freezes.  
        Marty CROSSES himself and opens the door, revealing...

        LENNOX LEWIS.  All 4 10 of him.  He wears a backpack.  
        Marty, flustered, backs up quickly, TRIPPING over a box.  

                                        LENNOX
                      I convinced my parental unit to enroll me 
                      in school! I wondered if Max and Abby 
                      might take the bus with me. I know not 
                      how.

        Max steps in front of his sister.                                                                                    20.




                                        MAX
                      Stay away from my sister you freak!

        Lennox s face drops.

                                        LENNOX
                      Oh.  My apologies.  
                              (a beat, then)
                      I m sure I can figure it out.

        Lennox turns to go, wounded.  Debbie softens.

                                        DEBBIE
                      No, no, no.  Lennox, wait a second.

        Debbie APPROACHES Lennox.  Unsure of how to touch him, 
        she gingerly places a hand on his shoulder.

                                        DEBBIE (CONT D)
                      Max, apologize.

                                        MAX
                      He s an alien, Mom! 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Well, he may be, but I did not raise you 
                      to be rude to anyone - even aliens.
                                (then)
                      Abby, Max, go to the bus with Lennox.  
                      Your father and I need to talk. 

        Max takes Abby s hand. He steps up to Lennox, protective.  

                                        MAX
                      I box on the Wii like six hours a day.  
                      You do not want to mess with us, Son.  

        The children EXIT, leaving Amber behind with her parents.

                                        AMBER
                              (as if on phone)
                      Hi, child services, I d like to report my 
                      parents.  They just sent their seven and 
                      nine year old to school with an alien.  
                                (screaming)
                      What s wrong with you!? They drip goo and-

                                        JOE MONTANA (O.S.)
                      You look amazing, Amber.  You will be the 
                      most desired girl in all the high school.

      At the door stands Joe Montana.  Amber turns on a dime.                                                                                    21.




                                        AMBER
                      Peace out bitches.

      Like that she EXITS, leaving Debbie and Marty alone.

                                        MARTY
                      You see?  The kids are fine.  Once you 
                      get past the initial shock of things--

                                        DEBBIE
                      Tell me you re kidding.

                                        MARTY
                      Honey: they re peace-loving aliens!

                                        DEBBIE
                      So if they were warmonger aliens we d be 
                      leaving, but since they re peace-loving--

                                        MARTY
                      I m just asking we be rational here. 
                      Mortgage rates are way up since we 
                      bought, we can t afford this square 
                      footage anywhere else.  I don t even know 
                      where we d start again--  

                                        DEBBIE
                      So we re stuck, is that it?  Fantastic. 
                      The one time you make a decision on your 
                      own...

        She trails off.  Marty STIFFENS, challenged.

                                        MARTY
                      You wanted me to take initiative, well 
                      here you go: I m the man of the house and 
                      you re my wife and you ll do what I tell 
                      you!  WE RE STAYING.

        Debbie s eyes practically roll back in her head.  Marty 
        realizes what he s done.

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      Unless you don t want to stay.  We can 
                      talk about it.


      INT. WILT CHAMBERLAIN S KITCHEN - MEANWHILE

      Wilt sits at the kitchen table.  He is creating some sort 
      of enormous TOOTHPICK SCULPTURE, a hobby induced by his 
        conversation with Marty.                                                                                      22.




        Jackie Joyner-Kersee goes to the refrigerator and takes 
        out a NEWSPAPER.  She brings it to him.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      What do you think they ll decide to do?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Well, Marty seems a reasonable man.  
                      Hopefully the wife will mind her business 
                      and they will stay.

      This seems to irritate Jackie.  She starts to say 
        respond... but holds back.  She looks at the Pupar, 
        sitting on the counter.  A beat.  Up on the table, Wilt 
        takes in his TOOTHPICK SCULPTURE: a life-sized TOOTHPICK 
        VERSION OF MARTY.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      So... I ve been thinking, Husband.  
                      Considering the discontent in our 
                      community, perhaps it is time to consider 
                      recharging the Pupar and reestablish 
                      contact with home.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Perhaps.  Or perhaps it is time for you 
                      to entertain the idea of leaving big 
                      decisions to me and getting me the New 
                      York Times out of the freezer.  I m 
                      starving and the Bergen Record just won t 
                      tide me over till lunch.

        Jackie Joyner s eyes practically roll back in her head.

                                                                              BACK TO:


      INT. WEAVER CONDO (LIVING ROOM) - MEANWHILE

        Fight is on.  There s no holding back anymore.

                                        MARTY
                      ADMIT IT!  YOU RE JUST FINDING FAULT WITH 
                      THIS PLACE BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT WITHOUT 
                      CONSULTING YOU!

                                        DEBBIE
                      Honey, I assure you: I m nine steps past 
                      finding fault because you bought this 
                      place without consulting me.

        Marty goes to respond, stops.                                                                                    23.




                                        MARTY
                                (confused)
                      Really?  When did that happen?

                                        DEBBIE
                      THE MOMENT THE ALIENS STARTED DRIPPED 
                      GREEN GOO IN OUR LIVING ROOM!

      CUE: DOORBELL.

                                        MARTY
                      WHAT NOW!?

      He answers.  Wilt Chamberlain stands there.  He looks 
        horrible.  He holds a small suitcase up.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                                (child-like)
                      Jackie Joyner-Kersee kicked me out.

                                        MARTY
                      You know Wilt, it s not a good time--

                                        DEBBIE
                      No, you two deserve each other.  I live 
                      within ten yards of the biggest schmucks 
                      on two different planets.

        She STORMS OUT. Suddenly, WATER starts pouring out of 
        Wilt s ears. Wilt notices Marty noticing, dabs at them.

                                        WILT
                      This is how we cry. It s very hard to 
                      explain.


      INT. JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE S BEDROOM - LATER

        Where Jackie and Debbie vent.  There s no bed in the 
        room, just two LARGE GREEN PODS which hang from the 
        ceiling.  As they vent, Jackie goes about  cleaning  the 
        pods, starting by dragging a huge bucket underneath one.

                                        DEBBIE
                      He keeps throwing  initiative  back at 
                      me.  I said it once! I just wanted 
                      flowers, maybe a little surprise sex in 
                      the shower.  Instead, he moves me in with 
                      E.T. s creepy cousins. 
                                (then)
                      No offense.                                                                                    24.




                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Don t even understand the reference.
                                (then, her own rant)
                      I m not even saying I WANT to recharge 
                      the Pupar!  

                                        DEBBIE
                      No, you just want to discuss recharging 
                      the...

        She pauses, unsure.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                                (helping)
                      Pupar.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Why d you give it such a weird name?

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      I don t know.  
                                (enraged)
                      I wasn t consulted on that either!

        She switches a lever on the pod... the bottom opens up 
        and GREEN GOO pours into the bucket.  


      INT. WEAVER CONDO (LIVING ROOM) - MEANWHILE

        Where Marty and Wilt Chamberlain engage similarly.

                                        MARTY
                      I just didn t want my kids growing up in 
                      a crappy apartment in Bayonne like I did.  
                      I saw an opportunity and I took it. One 
                      minute she wants me to take initiative, 
                      the next she s mad at me for taking it.  
                      My hands are in the air, Wilt!  I m 
                      throwing them in the air!

      He throws them in the air.  Wilt follows suit.  They both 
        remain like this (arms up) for the rest of the scene.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      On our planet, the leader leads. I m 
                      trying to lead.  But I respect my wife!  
                      I ve loved her since day one at 
                      Kilikiwaka school.  

                                        MARTY
                      That like high school?                                                                                    25.




                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      The highest.

        Confusion.  After a beat, Marty presses on.

                                        MARTY
                                (then, admitting)
                      You know what drives me crazy?  She s 
                      right.  She s always right.  I should 
                      have talked to her before I made a down-
                      payment.  And it is weird that you guys 
                      are aliens. Although, in my defense, you 
                      guys seem pretty harmless.  And you 
                      brought me that cool toothpick sculpture 
                      which was really sweet and frankly, kind 
                      of amazing...

      IN THE CORNER: a life-sized toothpick Marty.  It s weird.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                              (also admitting)
                      And I should have consulted my wife about 
                      the Pupar.  They re always right, aren t 
                      they?

        Water pours out of Wilts ears.  Marty, now used to this, 
      dabs at them with a roll of paper towels by his side.


      INT. JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE S BEDROOM - LATER

      Back to the women (as Jackie drains the second pod).

                                        DEBBIE
                      You know what, Jackie: if you want to 
                      recharge that Pubic Bar--

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Pupar.

                                        DEBBIE
                      You want to recharge it, I say you 
                      recharge it.  Forget what he says.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      He has his reasons.  I understand them, 
                      believe me.  But we have not heard from 
                      home and we have a responsibility--

                                        DEBBIE
                      So do it!  Recharge that...

        She searches again.                                                                                    26.




                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Pupar.

                                        DEBBIE
                      It s really a very unusual word.

        Jackie Joyner-Kersee nods.  She empties the bucket of GOO 
        out a window, quickly backs away as a BURST OF FLAMES 
        shoots past. Just then... Lennox ENTERS from school.

                                        LENNOX
                      I m home, Mother!

      They turn.  Lennox stands there, a big smile on his face.

                                        LENNOX (CONT D)
                      Sorry I m late!  I knew more than my 
                      teacher and kept correcting her and it 
                      upset her and I got detention!

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      That s wonderful, my Dear.
                                (then)
                      Lennox?

      He looks at her serious face.  His face turns serious.

                                        LENNOX
                      Is it time?

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Go to the garage and prepare the Pupar.

        Lennox smiles.  He approaches his mother.  Hugs her.

                                        LENNOX
                      It is my honor to serve you, Mother.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      I love you, My Son.

      They finish embracing.  Lennox runs out the door.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Wow!  I mean, wow.  I can t even get my 
                      kids to take out the garbage without a 
                      fight.  What an amazing kid.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Yes.  
                                (then)
                      I will miss him very much.                                                                                    27.




        Debbie s smile drops instantly.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Wait, what?

        Her confusion is magnified by the fact that water has 
        started pouring out of Jackie Joyner-Kersee s ears.


      INT. WEAVER CONDO (LIVING ROOM) - MEANWHILE

      Wilt explains to Marty:

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      The youngest born in the community is the 
                      only one who can recharge the Pupar.    
                      Though considered quite an honor, the 
                      child who recharges it will break from 
                      Earth s time continuum and make a 
                      molecular break consistent with the 
                      rotational spin of Zabvron.  You follow?

        A beat.

                                        MARTY
                      No.

      He tries again.

                                        WILT
                      By recharging the Pupar, he will shift 
                      five minutes into the future.  Though 
                      safe with Future-Me, he will only be able 
                      to communicate with the Current-Me via 
                      written word he leaves behind. I will 
                      never see our son again.  I mean, I 
                      will... but it will be Future-Me.  

        A beat.

                                        MARTY
                      Nope, not even close.

        Max and Abby ENTER.

                                        MAX
                      Hey Dad.

      They TURN.                                                                                    28.




                                        MAX (CONT D)
                      Oh, hey Mr. Chamber-alien.  Lennox is in 
                      the garage. His mom sent him to recharge 
                      his poopie or something?

        Marty and Wilt share a look and jump up. 


      INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

        The garage holds a SILVER SPACESHIP (the garage fits two 
      cars but only one spaceship comfortably).

        Lennox has changed into a silver space-suit, a huge smile 
      on his face.  In the history of little aliens in human 
        form, there has never been a cuter one.

        The Pupar rests in his palms, his arms completely 
        outstretched before him.  Twenty feet in front of him, a 
      BEAM OF BLUE LIGHT shoots down from the ceiling.

                                        LENNOX
                      See you in five minutes, Mommy.

      He begins a slow walk toward the blue light. 

        MARTY AND DEBBIE BURST IN simultaneously.

                        MARTYDEBBIE
        NO!LENNOX, STOP!

        Lennox turns, startled. Doing so, he drops the Pupar... 

      SLOW MOTION.  Marty DIVES for it.  But he s not in time, 
        the Pupar hits the ground and Marty actually lands ON it.  
      He gets up. It s completely smashed.  He looks Debbie:

                                        MARTY
                      Ooops.

        Jackie Joyner arrives just then.  She runs to Lennox.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Son! Thank Heavens!

        She HUGS him.  Lennox doesn t understand the fuss.

                                        LENNOX
                      I would have seen you in five minutes.

      WILT CHAMBERLAIN bursts in, out of breath.                                                                                    29.




                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      My Son!  

      He runs to Lennox, embraces him.

                                        LENNOX
                      I mean seriously, would that much have 
                      changed in five minutes?

        Jackie looks at Wilt.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      You were right, Husband.  I can t bear to 
                      lose him, even to ourselves in five min--
                                (then, realizing)
                      Wilt Chamberlain, have you been crying?

      ON WILT

        Two handkerchiefs stick out from his ears.

                                        WILT
                      A little.
                                (then)
                      I m so sorry, Wife. Even if I d been 
                      designated leader of this mission by the 
                      most important life form in the galaxy - 
                      which I basically was, don t want to 
                      fight but you need to know where I m 
                      coming from - we still must communicate.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      This is all I ask for.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      I feel so deeply for you, my dear.  I am 
                      going to pleasure you all night.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      I thought we were out of asbestos.

                                        WILT
                      I have a secret supply.

        She GIGGLES.  They turn, realizing Debbie and Marty are 
        watching, now concerned.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN 
                      We can t thank you enough, Weaver family.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Wait, what was that with asbestos?                                                                                    30.




        Marty grabs Debbie, changing topics.

                                        MARTY
                      I just wanted my kids to grow up in a 
                      nicer place than I did.

                                        DEBBIE
                      I know. 

                                        MARTY
                      Tomorrow I m getting you a crockpot 
                      filled with flowers.

                                        DEBBIE
                      It s all I require.

      He smiles, then.

                                        MARTY
                      We should stay here, Babe.  

                                        DEBBIE
                      Well, the square footage is amazing. Not 
                      to mention the mortgage rate.  And I 
                      really don t want to move again.  

                                        MARTY
                      Plus, think about the possibilities.  We 
                      can train them.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Create the perfect neighbors.

                                        MARTY
                      And they re screwed up, way more than us.  
                      There s something comforting about that.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Totally.  They were about to sacrifice 
                      their son for the fubar.  

                                        MARTY
                      Pupar.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Why can t I get that?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      We re pleased to hear you re staying!

      They turn, surprised.  Jackie points to her ears.                                                                                    31.




                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      These things aren t just for crying. 

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      This could be the start of a really 
                      wonderful friendship.  If we could just 
                      give one word of advice?  

                                        MARTY
                      Please.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      No matter what you do, never, ever, drink 
                      the tap water.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Or bathe.

      As Marty and Debbie process this we...

 

                               END SHOW                                                                                    32.

      INT. WILT CHAMBERLAIN S SPACESHIP

        Marty and Wilt sit in Wilt s spaceship.  It s 
        surprisingly low-tech.  There is a switch that says: 
        ON/OFF.  Lots of other blinking lights.  Behind them sits 
        LIFE-SIZED TOOTHPICK MARTY.  He s now wearing the same 
        shirt as Marty.  Weird.

        Marty sips a beer and  aahs.   Wilt peruses his 
         Bartending for Dummies  book and  aahs. 

                                        MARTY
                      So... was I right about last night?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      You were.  Even after we made amends with 
                      one another, she insisted on carrying the 
                      argument over late into the evening.

                                        MARTY
                      They like to do that.  But sometimes you 
                      need a good long fight to clear the air.

                                        WILT
                      I agree.  It was a good fight.  And, in 
                      the end, I emerged the victor. 

                                        MARTY
                      Well, good for you, Bud.  Not often we 
                      win one of those.

      Wilt NODS.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Yes.  We will not be hearing from her 
                      anytime soon.

        Marty lowers his beer, concerned.  Wilt, smiling big, 
        clinks his book against Marty s beer.

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN (CONT D)
                      Another beer?

        And we...

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
