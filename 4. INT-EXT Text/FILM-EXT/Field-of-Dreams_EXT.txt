Yo, Ray! Food!

We see Ray emerge slowly from the fields, the twilit sky
changing colors behind him.
21 THE VERANDA

Annie leans against a post, lazily watching Ray approach.
She likes how he moves, and how he looks.
ANNIE
Hiya, cutie.
Ray climbs up the steps, accepts her kiss, and instead of
following her into the house, pulls her down with him onto
the swing. He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes.
RAY

There is a Man standing on the edge ofthebaseballfield.
Hi es wearing a baseball uniform.
Anold-fashionedone.
50 INT HOUSE

Ray turns to Annie. She looks out and nods thoughtfully.
Annie stays very calm in emergencies.
ANNIE
We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead.
Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The
night sky seems close enough to touch.
51
On the porch wall, Ray finds the switch, holds his breath,
flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life.
52 THE MAN
52
steps onto the field. On his uniform is a large "S" with
an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an
American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.
53 RAY
53
walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field.
54 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW
54
Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in
left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the
waist, hands on hips, he waits.
55 RAY
55
Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one
of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back
of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.
56 IN THE OUTFIELD
56
The Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style
glove, and waits to field the ball.
24
57 AT HOME PLATE 57
Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,
and tries again. This time he connects.
58 THE FIELD 58
He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and
falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it
up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.
Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this
too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man
deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.
RAY
How's the field play?
THE MAN
It's good. The ball bounces true.
Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives
it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually
lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man
sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in
short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man
runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.
RAY
Hi.
The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel
its weight.
RAY
Ray Kinsella.
THE MAN
Joe Jackson.
Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless
Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from
him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if
he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.
Finally, he can't help himself.
RAY
I bet its good to be playing again,
huh?
SHOELESS JOE
It was like having part of me amputated.
CONTINUED
25
58 CONTINUED
Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain
his steady voice tries to conceal.
SHOELESS JOE
I've heard that old man wake up and
scratch itchy legs that've been dust for
fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up
in the night with the smell of the
ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
grass on my feet. The thrill of the
grass...
He has found the bat he likes.
SHOELESS JOE
Can you pitch?
RAY
(WITH FALSE
MODESTY)
Yeah, I'm not bad.
Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain
his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the
rubber and faces Joe at the plate.
RAY
Don't we need a catcher?
SHOELESS JOE
Not if you can get it near the plate,
we don't.
Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during
which he says aloud to himself:
RAY
I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has
to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is
graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the
ball against the fence.
Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson
is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.
Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.
RAY
See if you can hit my curve.
He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not
curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.
CONTINUED
26
58 CONTINUED (2) 58
RAY
Yes, he can hit the curve.
SHOELESS JOE
Stick with fast balls, kid.
RAY
You bet.
Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down
the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base
line. Ray is mightily impressed.
RAY
Wow.
SHOELESS JOE
Damn, this feels good. Put it right
here, huh?
Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of
the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.
RAY
Right, you were a low ball hitter.
SHOELESS JOE
Oh man, I did love this game. You know,
I'd have played for food money. it was
the game, the sounds, the smells. You
ever held a glove or a ball to your
face?
Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.
RAY
Yeah.
SHOELESS JOE
And it was riding the trains from town
to town. And the hotels with brass
spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds
in the rooms. And it was the crowd
getting to their feet when the ball was
hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for
free.
The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the
house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them.
RAY
My family.
Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights.

Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite
understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their
discomfort and changes the subject.
SHOELESS JOE
Hey, can I come back again?
RAY
Yeah. I built this for you.
SHOELESS JOE
There are others, you know. There were
eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to
them.
RAY
Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome
here.
Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the
good times to come.
SHOELESS JOE
Thank you, Ray. I appreciate it. See
you later, huh?
RAY
Yeah. See you later.
KARIN
Say it ain't so, Joe!
Joe laughs and walks to the outfield. Annie puts her arm
around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest.
Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog
shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night.
Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut
into the fence.
ANNIE

Joe reaches the door, opens it, and turns back to Ray, his
voice carrying effortlessly through the night air.
SHOELESS JOE
Hey! Is this heaven?
RAY
No. It's Iowa.
Shoeless Joe Jackson nods and fades away as he walks
through the door in the fence. Ray and Annie looks at each
other in absolute wonder.

MARK

some game.
RAY
Oh, I guess it's not really a game.
It's more like a practice.
Mark looks at his wife and Mother with concern. Ray
doesn't understand this reaction.
RAY
See, there's only eight of them, so they
can't play a real game...
MARK
Eight of what?
Ray points to the noisy players on the field.
RAY
Them.
Now, Mother and Dee look as if they're about to go into
mourning. Mark kneels next to Karin.
MARK
Karin honey... what are you watching?
KARIN
The baseball men.
MARK

RAY
Right. See you guys.
The players call their "good-byes" to Ray and head for the
door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as
they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look
around him.
The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite
beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back
toward his house. He is the very picture of contentment.
Then he hears The Voice.

Parents stream in past the "PTA Meeting Tonite" sign. Ray

Karin's teacher. (Ray is too distracted by his own
thoughts to pay this much attention.)

Lately, she's been making up these
charming little stories about ghosts who

By the early Seventies, the guy decides
people have become either too extremist

he stops writing books. He starts
writing poetry. About whales and stuff.
Then, he starts fooling around with a
home computer, and gets hooked. Know
what he does now?
Annie shakes her head no.

other, old wood-frame apartment buildings with advertising
for long-forgotten products painted on the sides. Lunatic
drivers abound. We are not in Iowa anymore.

In between a deli and a Kosher butcher shop, Ray finds a
storefront with blacked-out windows. He enters an open
hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as
well as stairs to the apartments above it.
There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks

Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer
there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a
handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You
better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell."
Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On
the other side of the door, a bell rings.
Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes
a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door.
He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
meeting one of his cultural heroes.
The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He
glares at Ray and roars:

Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the
guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.

Ray walks by the old movie theatre, which sits at the edge
of a residential street. The Godfather is playing. He

SHOELESS JOE
What the hell you doing on the
sidelines? You came here to play ball,
didn't you?
ARCHIE
Yes sir.
SHOELESS JOE
Go warm up!
ARCHIE
(THRILLED)
Yes sir!
Archie quickly scampers down the bleachers, onto the field,
shakes Joe's hand, and runs to the dugout.
MANN
Unbelievable.
RAY
It's more than that. It's perfect.
CUT TO
133 THE GAME
133
The White Sox are in the field, the Giants at bat. A Giant
hitter bunts, and the runner on second takes third despite
a close throw.
Mann, Ray, Karin and Annie are in the stands, Mann keeping
score.
MANN
Does he get a hit for that?
RAY
Karin?
KARIN
Um, no. The batter was trying to
sacrifice.
RAY
So how do you score it?
KARIN
Fielder's choice?
RAY
Very good.

Mann is impressed. He lifts Karin up from her seat on the
row below them, and places her next to him to help him.
MANN
You better sit here.
Karin beams. Ray taps Mann and points to the plate.
RAY
Look.
Archie Graham -- now wearing a Giant's uniform -- drops one
of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle,
and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a
brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants
himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top
end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and
waits for the pitch.'
The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back.
As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him.
There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the
pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it
is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way
and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his
mask.
CATCHER
Good thing for you that wasn't his
fastball.
Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a
little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of
determination.
ARCHIE
Come on, let's see your fastball.
The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And
right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the
way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately
appeals to the Umpire.
ARCHIE 
Hey, ump, how about a warning?
UMPIRE
Sure. Watch out-you don't get killed.
Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to
call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck
batter, Mel Ott, comes over.

OTT
Okay, kid, first two were high and
tight, where do you think the next one's
going to be?
ARCHIE
Either-low and away, or in my ear.
OTT
He don't want to load the bases. Look
for low and away.
Archie nods and starts to walk back to the plate.
OTT
But watch out for 'in your ear.'
Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still
looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch
is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.
But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and
away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.
The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center
fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to
his left, and makes the catch.
Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.
As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.
In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him
a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his
cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.
MANN
(LAUGHS)
Look at that. Mr. Cool.
But when Archie gets to the bench, he can't contain himself
anymore. He leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy.
DISSOLVE TO
134 THE FIELD - LATER 134
The game has ended, and players are rough-housing and
joking as they slowly make their way to the door in the
outfield fence. Ray and Mann are talking to some of the
players over the fence.
MANN
Where do you go when you walk through
that door? What do you do?

CHICK GANDIL
We sleep.
HAPPY FELSCH
And wait.
SHOELESS JOE
We dream.
RAY
You can't leave the field any other way,
can you?
SHOELESS JOE
Not if we want to come back.
RAY
I'd love to go with you sometime.
The silence that follows is long and ominous.
RAY
I'd like to see what's out there.
There is still no response.
RAY
I'll take that as a no for now.
He spots Archie jogging off the field.
RAY
Hey, slugger, congratulations!
Archie jogs over.
ARCHIE
Thanks. I can't stop shaking I'm so
happy. 'Course, I would've liked a base
hit...
KARIN
But you got a RBI!
ARCHIE
I sure did, didn't I?
SHOELESS JOE
(YELLS BACK)
A rookie's luck!
They all laugh at that.
RAY
Well come on, this calls for a drink.

Archie hesitates.
ARCHIE
I can't. I'm...
He motions with his head toward the other players
disappearing through the outfield door. Ray nods
understandingly.
RAY
Good game, Archie.
ARCHIE
Thanks.
MANN
Good night, kid.
Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the
rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns
back to them.
ARCHIE
Mr. Kinsella?
Ray turns toward him. Archie looks as if he knows more
than he's saying.
ARCHIE
Thank you for bringing me here. I
couldn't have wished for anything more.
Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than
just a teenager's pleasure. But he decides not to ask any
questions.
RAY
I know. You're welcome.
Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes.
CUT TO
1.36
Ray and Mann walking.
MANN
I don't have a lot of money, Ray, but
maybe I could pitch in a little.
RAY
Fine. You can put in twenty bucks for
groceries.
MANN
That's not what I meant. Maybe the
reason you were supposed to find me was
so I could help you with this.
RAY
More likely it's that you're supposed
to start writing again. About this.
MANN
Don't change the subject.
RAY
You promise to publish and I'll let you
chip in from your royalties.
Mann's expression suddenly turns to one of indignation.

I'm not sure I agree with that.
MANN
You're not only stubborn, you're stupid.

Annie emerges from the house and calls to Ray.
ANNIE
Honey, that was Mark. He's coming
tonight. He needs a decision tonight.
CUT TO
137 THE GAME
137
Again, it's J,oe Jackson's Chicago White Sox against the New
York Giants, now featuring rookie Archie Graham.
In the stands, Mann keeps score, Karin munches on a hot
dog, and Annie and Ray snuggle together to watch the game.
ANNIE
Everything is so perfect here.
RAY
Whatever I have to do to save this
place, I'll do.
ANNIE
I know.
Suddenly, Ray snaps his head to the side, as one does to
pick up a-distant sound.
RAY
He's here.
They look and see Mark's car heading up the gravel lane.
He parks the car at the edge of the field, and the game
stops as he walks right across it, completely mindless of
the players. Since he doesn't see any of them, a few
actually have to move out of his way. He approaches the
bottom of the bleachers.
RAY
You're interrupting the game, . Mark.

Mark shakes his head sadly at the thought that these
otherwise sensible relations have lost their minds.
MARK
Ray, it's time'to put away our little
fantasies and come down to earth.
RAY
It's not a fantasy, Mark. They're real.
Mark obviously do.esn't see anyone on the field.
MARK
(EMPHATICALLY)
Who's real?
RAY
Shoeless Joe Jackson. The White Sox.
The Giants.
(TO MANN)
He can't see any of it.
MARK
And who's that? Babe Ruth?
Ray smiles, savoring the moment.
RAY
As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.
MARK
Ah, how do you? I'm Michael Jackson.
(TO RAY)
Ray, we have to settle this thing right
now.
RAY
I'm not selling you my home.
MARK
You have no money, you've got a stack
of bills to choke a pig, and come fall,
you've got no crop to sell. But I have
a deal to offer you that will allow you
to stay on this land.
This has Ray's attention. Mark climbs the bleachers to
stand closer to him.
KARIN
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.
But no one pays her any attention. All eyes are on Mark.

MARK
Let us buy you out, and we'll leave the
house. You can live in it rent free as
long as you want.
RAY
What about the baseball field?
MARK
Do you realize what this land is worth?
RAY
Over $2200 an acre.
MARK
Then you must realize we cannot keep a
useless baseball diamond in the middle
of rich farmland.
RAY
No deal, Mark. We're staying.
KARIN
We don't have to go.
MARK
(EXPLODES)
You're virtually bankrupt, and I'm
offering you a way to keep your home
because I love my sister! I've got
partners who don't give a damn about
you, and they're ready to foreclose
right now!
KARIN
Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.

They all turn to Karin.

KARIN
From all over. They'll just decide to
take a vacation, see, and they'll come
to Iowa City, and they'll think it's
really boring, so they'll take a drive.
And they'll drive down our road, and
they'll see the lights and they'll think
it's really pretty.
Ray, Annie, and Mann listen with wonder, to this vision.
KARIN
So, the people in the cars? They'll
drive up and they'll want to pay us,
like buying a ticket.
Mark looks at them all as if they're crazy.
MARK
You're not listening to this seriously,
are you?
ANNIE
Yes.
MARK
Why would anybody pay money to come
here?
Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton.
KARIN
To watch the game. And it'll be just
like when they were little kids a long
time ago, and it was summertime, and
they'll watch the game and .remember what
it was like.
Ray and Annie couldn't be prouder of their daughter than
they are right now.
MARK
What the hell is she talking about?

She's talking about people seeing their
memories... touching their past.

It'll be like one of those tiny, French
restaurants that have no sign. You find

MARK
Okay, this is all fascinating, but the
fact remains that you don't have the
money to bring the mortgage up to date,
so you still have to sell. I'm sorry,
but you have no choice.
He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray
looks at it. He doesn't know what to do.
MANN
Ray...
Ray looks at Mann.
138 MANN
- 1.38
speaks now as he has not spoken for many years: as Terence
Mann, master of words, spellbinder.
MANN
People will come, Ray. They'll come to
Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom.
They'll turn up your driveway, not
knowing for sure why they're doing it,
and arrive at your door, innocent as
children, longing for the past. 'Of
course we won't mind if you look
around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty
dollars per person.' And they'll pass
over the money without even looking at
it. For it is money they have, and
peace they lack.

MARK
Just sign the papers, Ray.

MANN
They'll walk out to the bleachers and
sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect
evening, or they'll find they have
reserved seats somewhere in the
grandstand or along one of the baselines
-- wherever they sat when they were
children and cheered their heroes.
They'll watch the game, and it will be
as if they'd dipped themselves in magic
waters. The memories will be so thick
they'll have to brush them away from
their faces.
141 MASTER
141
Spellbound, Ray has put the papers down. Mark picks them
up again. He is battling Mann for Ray's attention.
MARK
Listen to me. Tomorrow morning, when
the bank opens, they will foreclose.
MANN
People will come, Ray.
MARK
You're broke, Ray. Sell now or lose
everything.
MANN
The one constant through all the years,
Ray, has been baseball. America has
rolled by like an`army of steamrollers.
It's been erased like a blackboard,
rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball
has marked the time. This field, this 
game... it's a piece of our past. It
reminds us of all that once was good.
And that could be again. People will
come. People will most definitely come.
Mann has moved everyone (but Mark) with the beauty of his
words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the
assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud.
BUCK WEAVER
(TEARY-EYED)
That was beautiful...
The other players nod, also teary-eyed.

103
141 CONTINUED 141
BUCK WEAVER
(SINCERELY)
.fuckin' beautiful.
The players on either side of him jab his ribs with their
elbows, but Mann, Ray and Annie laugh with pleasure.
MARK
Ray. You will lose everything and you
will be evicted.
Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless
Joe and the players. He looks at his family. Then he
turns back to Mark. It's decision time.
RAY
I'm not signing.
Mark shakes his head sadly. Annie hugs Ray. The players
breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles.
MANN
Ray...
Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head,
directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him
toward the house.
142 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW - CARS 142
have parked in front of the house. More are coming quietly
down the driveway. Dozens of cars. Cars with out-of-state
license plates.
Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait
patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have
set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates.
143 THE BLEACHERS 143
Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are deeply happy -- but not
terribly surprised -- to see these people.
RAY
(SING-SONG)
They're he-re.
Mark looks at the house and then back at Ray.
NARK

You don't see those cars? All those

There's no cars, no people...
KARIN
Uncle Mark, I can see them.
ANNIE
We all can.
MARK
You're crazy. You're all bat-shit
crazy!
RAY
Watch your language, Mark.
MARK
You build a baseball field in the middle
of nowhere, you sit around here and
stare at nothing ---
KARIN
It's not nothing.
Mark grabs Karin's arm and pulls her to her feet as if she
were "Exhibit A."
MARK
And you've turned your daughter into a
goddamn moron!
RAY
Get your hands off her.
Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so
doing, he twists little Karin off balance.
MARK
I'm trying to help you, goddamnit!
In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see
Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers.
RA Y
Karin!!
105
144 KARIN
144
Her hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in
midair. One small sandal bounces end over end and lands
at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body
to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards
of one of the bottom rows.
145 THE OTHERS
145
rush down to where she lies, face up. Ray is first, but
he does not know what to do. Annie and Mann hover. Mark
is horror-stricken, but no one knows what to do.
MARK
Oh my God, I'm sorry...Annie...I didn't
mean to...
Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath.
Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish.
ANNIE
Should we move her?
RAY
Get the car.
146 ANNIE
146
springs for the house. The tourists by their cars watch
quietly.
ANNIE
Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of
you?
They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside.
147 BACK AT THE BLEACHERS
147
Most of the White Sox players stand by the left field
fence, staring silently.
MANN
How long?
RA Y
Its a twenty-minute drive.
Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by
Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped
by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across
her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her
cough is faint, as though she is in another room.

Mark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket
and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray. Ray takes the
jacket and covers Karin gently.
Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more
strained and distant.
RAY
Karin...
Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field.
The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay
around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham.
148 ARCHIE GRAHAM
148
has noticed the'commotion in the bleachers, and he starts
to lope across the field.
149 BLEACHERS

Annie has pulled the car over and honks. Ray holds up his
hand to her to wait. His eyes are on young Archie Graham.
150 YOUNG ARCHIE GRAHAM
3.50
As Graham gets closer, his features begin to change, and
his step slows. He reaches the end of the fence -- around
which no player can pass
-- and when he emerges from the
shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young
Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc
Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball
glove has turned into a black doctor's bag.
151 THE BLEACHERS

DOC GRAHAM
What have we got here?
RAY
She fell.
Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong.
DOC GRAHAM
This child's choking to death.

107
151 CONTINUED
151
He picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the
other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and
turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand,
he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder
blades with the heel of his other hand.
Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot
believe what he is seeing.
Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air.
Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a
sizable piece of hog dog and bun.
As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing
from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc
peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a
few seconds, and lets the eye close.
DCC GRAHAM
She's okay. I don't think the fall
really hurt her, just the dog in her
throat. She'll be coming around in a
minute or two.
RAY
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Thank you, Doc.
Doc looks deeply into Ray's eyes.
DOC GRAHAM
No, son. Thank you.
It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed
to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back
at the Doctor.
RAY
'Oh, my God, you can't go back.
DOC GRAHAM
It's okay...

Doc Graham stands, and picks up his black bag.
DOC GRAHAM
Well, I best be getting back home before
Alicia starts to thinking I've got a

outfield door. The players respectfully make way for him.

MANN
You were kidnapping me at the time, you
asshole! Think of it, Ray: maybe
there's an Ebbets Field still floating

here. I'm John Kinsella.
They shake his hand.
RAY
I'm Ray. My wife Annie. And this is
my daughter, Karin.
(TO KARIN)
Karin, this is...
He almost says "My father."
RAY
KARIN
JOHN
Ray and Annie are beaming. Annie takes Karin's hand.
ANNIE
We're going to let you two talk. I have
to go look after our guests. Someone's
gotta start collecting admission if
we're going to keep this place.
(to the Catcher)
Very nice meeting you.
JOHN
M' am.
161 ANNIE
161
hoists Karin up and totes her toward the tourists waiting
in front of the house.
115
162 RAY AND JOHN
162
watch them for a while, then start to,stroll across the
field.
RAY
You catch a good game.
JOHN
Thank you. It's so beautiful here. Its
like-well for me, it's like a dream
come true.
Ray cannot speak. He nods.
JOHN
Can I ask you something?
Again, Ray nods.
JOHN
Is this heaven?
Ray smiles and shakes his head no.
RAY
It's Iowa.
JOHN
Iowa. I could've sworn this was heaven.
163 RAY
16 3
stops and looks intently at John. He asks this question
as if he were asking the secret of life. Maybe he is.
RAY
Is there a heaven?
164 JOHN
164
takes time to answer that. He looks up at the night sky
and searches it.
JOHN
Oh, yeah...
Then he looks square into Ray's eyes.
JOHN
Heaven's where dreams come true.
116
165 RAY
165
looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on
the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night
above them. He smiles. He finally understands. He turns
back to John and nods.
RAY
Then maybe this is heaven.
166 JOHN
166
smiles wisely in return.
JOHN
Well...good night, Ray.
RAY
Good night.
167 MASTER
167
John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield
fence.
RAY
Hey!
John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.
RAY
You wanna have a catch?
John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them;
there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his
son?
JOHN
I'd like that.
Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and
puts it on.
They throw the ball back and forth.
And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son
bathed by white floodlights and car headlights... on the
silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
a cornfield.
FADE OUT
