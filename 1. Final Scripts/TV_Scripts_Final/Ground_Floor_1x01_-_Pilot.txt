      INT. THE BRASS CAP STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT (NIGHT ONE) 
      (BRODY, JENNIFER, THREEPEAT, DYLAN)

      WHITESTONE TRUST'S COMPANY PARTY IS IN FULL SWING.  YOUNG, 
      COCKY, MONEY MANAGERS HANG BY THE BAR.  BRODY MOYER (29, 
      HANDSOME, CHARMING, LOOKS LIKE THE OTHERS, BUT THERE'S 
      SOMETHING KIND AND HUMAN THERE) IS BY MIKE WEN, "THREEPEAT" 
      (27, ASIAN, SUPER-GELLED HAIR, TOOL BUT LOYAL FRIEND).  HE 
      DOWNS A DRINK.

                                  THREEPEAT

                It's a company party, so how drunk do 

                I want to get?  Like 49ers game drunk 

                or last month in Aspen drunk?  

                                  BRODY

                Probably somewhere in between, because 

                you're fun when you're buzzy, but I 

                also don't want to spend tomorrow 

                morning steam-cleaning the carpet and 

                burying your ski-pants.    

                                  THREEPEAT

                Oh man, that Aspen trip was beast. 

                                  BRODY

                It was a company retreat; we worked 

                the whole time.  And is  beast  your 

                new word, because I m not a huge fan.

                                  THREEPEAT

                Learn to love it, bro.  'Cause you 

                know how much I'm going to use it?

                three words - Time.  

      THREEPEAT CROSSES AWAY.  BRODY SITS AT THE BAR, TAKING IN THE 
      SCENE.  A HOT WOMAN, DYLAN, SIDLES UP.

                                  DYLAN

                Hey, Brody. 

                                  BRODY

                Hey, Dylan.  Is Mike here? 

                                  DYLAN

                Nah, we got divorced.  What re you 

                doing later? 

                                  BRODY

                Wow, okay.  I m actually going back to 

                work.  Mansfield only gave us like 

                twenty minutes to come to the party.  

                                  DYLAN

                Too bad, I m looking to hook up. 

      SHE WALKS OFF.  BRODY SPEAKS TO HIMSELF, SARCASTICALLY:

                                  BRODY

                Really?  I did not get that.

      AT THE TABLE NEXT TO HIM, JENNIFER MILLER, (25, SWEET, 
      ADORABLE, CURIOUS AND MORE CONFIDENT THAN YOU D THINK) LAUGHS 
      AT WHAT BRODY JUST SAID.  SHE'S DRESSED TARGET-ELEGANT. 

                                  BRODY (CONT D)

                That was weird, right?

                                  BRODY

                Yeah... anyone. 

                                  JENNIFER

                Just curious: why didn t you say yes?  

                                  BRODY

                You think I made a mistake?  You think 

                she was the one?  

                                  JENNIFER

                I hope not.  She s trying to eat that 

                guy s face.

      SHE GESTURES.  BRODY LOOKS OVER TO SEE DYLAN MAKING OUT WITH 
      SOME OTHER GUY.

                                  BRODY

                That.  That s why I didn t say yes to 

                her.  That guy s going to take her 

                back to his place; they ll roll 

                around; then, tomorrow morning they ll 

                do that dance where he tries to get 

                her to leave, and she tries to get him 

                to go out to brunch with her and her 

                friends.  

                                  JENNIFER

                Yeah, I don t do one-night stands: A 

                friend of my sister was actually 

                killed by one.  She met this guy in a 

                bar, slept with him.  Next morning 

                when she was doing the walk of shame, 

                she got hit by a snow plow.  GROUND FLOOR    "Pilot"    Rev. Network Draft      6/29/12         4.

                                  BRODY

                That s really more of a coincidence. 

                                  JENNIFER

                Not if he was driving it.

                   Starting to seem?   Have you done 

                that a lot? 

                                  BRODY

                Not a lot.

                                  JENNIFER

                How many times in the last six months?

                Nice meeting you, too.

      HE LEAVES WITH THE GROUP.  AS THEY WALK OUT, HE STOPS AND 
      LOOKS BACK.  WE ANGLE ON JENNIFER AT THE BAR BY HERSELF.  HE 
      STEPS INTO FRAME AND SITS BACK DOWN NEXT TO HER.

                So, you really think the snow plow

                I m sorry; that girl downstairs messed 

                with my head - talking to her is like 

                drinking Tequila.  One second, you 

                think you re totally in control.  Next 

                thing you know, you wake up and your 

                  fraternity brothers all call you  Dog 

                Snatch  and you don t know why.  

                (THEN)  The point is, she got me

                want.  And do you know why I have all 

                that?  Because I worked my ass off

      IT S 6:20.  EVERYONE IS GONE.  JENNIFER SITS ALONE AT HER 
      DESK.  HARVARD ENTERS. 

                                    HARVARD

                Let s go.  It s twenty after.  He s 

                not coming. 

                                  JENNIFER

                I just want to wait a little longer. 

                                    HARVARD

                If we wait too long, that bartender 

                who thinks I m cute and trades me 

                drinks for hugs will be gone, and the 

                girl bartender will be there. 

                                  JENNIFER

                Fine, we can go.

                What is the big deal about this guy?  

                He s just another upstairs tool.  

                                  JENNIFER

                No, he s different.  He rescued 

                Derrick.  All the other guys up there 

                would have let him get fired and then 

                laughed at him.

                That is a big, sexy bottle of wine.

                                  BRODY

      THEY START WALKING DEEPER INTO THE RESTAURANT AND HEAR 
      SINGING.  THEY SEE THE GROUP OF MONEY MANAGERS AT A TALL 
      TABLE BY THE BAR, SINGING  HAPPY BIRTHDAY .

                Who are they singing to? 

      THEY ARE SINGING TO BRODY, NOT EVEN REALIZING HE S NOT THERE.

                drinks.

      AS THREEPEAT WALKS TO THE BAR, BRODY TAKES IN THE SCENE, 
      CONTEMPLATING.  FINALLY, HE SPEAKS TO NO ONE: 

                                  BRODY

                No thanks, I m good.

      BRODY PURPOSEFULLY TURNS AND EXITS.  AT THE BAR, MR. 
      MANSFIELD WATCHES HIM GO.  THREEPEAT SADDLES UP NEXT TO HIM.

                                  MANSFIELD

                  (THOUGHTFULLY)  It s interesting.  

                  Sometimes a man can ignore your 

                wishes, and you end up respecting him

      DERRICK, TORI AND JENNIFER SITTING.  

                                  TORI
