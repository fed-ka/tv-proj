            A classic rural, middle-of-nowhere Maine gas station -- a
          couple of pumps in front of a tiny store.

          Bruce's Cruiser pulls up, Johnny and Bruce climb out. 
          Binoculars dangle from both their necks.  Johnny is wearing
          appropriate hiking attire -- Bruce looks like he's dressed
          for the gym, in bright workout gear.

          Bruce has a "Field Guide to Birds of New England" in one
          hand and is reading from it, energized.

                                        BRUCE
                          Wingspan up to eight feet!  Eight
                        feet!

                                        JOHNNY
                        You are not going to see a Bald
                        Eagle.

          Bruce tosses the bird book to Johnny and pops open the
          hood to check the oil.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because there are about three
                        Bald Eagles left in this entire
                        county.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll settle for a Dodo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Too late.  They're extinct.

          Bruce slams the hood.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's the point of bird-watching
                        if all the birds I want to watch
                        are missing in action?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the point of dragging me
                        all the way out here for physical
                          therapy?

                                        BRUCE
                        Because it's time you got back to
                        basics.  We cannot duplicate in a
                        gym the kind of landscape our
                        human legs evolved upon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nobody evolved in Maine.

                                        BRUCE
                        Until we pay a visit to Mother
                        Africa, it'll have to do.

          Bruce pops open the gas cap and starts to fill the tank.

                                        BRUCE
                                (re: binoculars)
                        In the meantime, if I'm gonna lug
                        this sucker around you'd best
                        deliver me something with an eight
                        foot wingspan.

          Johnny heads over toward the tiny store and the OLD MAN
          who is sitting out front next to a narrow table with an
          ancient cash register and a small stand displaying tourist
          post cards.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi.  How are you?

          The guy just stares at him.  Several feet away is the
          man's young grandson.  The boy has a toy drum he is
            awkwardly beating on with his open hand.

          A postcard catches Johnny's eye--


          CLOSE ON: THE POSTCARD

          Which reads "Hello from Picture Rock" and shows a local
          tourist site -- a rockface with a Palaeolithic drawing on
          it, the simple but elegant figure of a leaping deer.

                                        OLD MAN (O.S.)
                        Not bad.  Yourself?          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - TEASER - 6/25/02 - YELLOW      3.


  22RESUME

          Johnny turns back, caught a little off-balance by the
          man's delayed response.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not bad at all.

          He reaches for his wallet, takes out a bill.

                        Twenty on Supreme.

          The Old Man makes no effort to accept the cash.  Johnny
          has no choice but to play along with his odd rhythm.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        Seen any bald eagles around here?

          The man stares at the "Birds of Maine" book tucked under
          Johnny's arm.

                        Just yesterday.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (excited)
                        You're kidding.

                                        OLD MAN
                        Yes I am.

          Johnny is disappointed.

                                        OLD MAN
                        But I do expect a couple tomorrow.

          The man reaches up and takes the twenty from Johnny.  And
          as their hands make contact -- we go into SLOW MOTION and
          Johnny hears the SOUND of the toy drum become a much deeper
          and more rhythmic drum beating, which is then overwhelmed
          by a tremendous burning ROAR.

          The Old Man is frozen in place.  A brilliant LIGHT suddenly
          illuminates the scene.  Johnny turns to look up at the
          source of the light and the roaring sound, and finds
          himself:



          Johnny stands at the foot of a low mountain, surrounded
          by wilderness, watching as:           THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - TEASER - 7/16/02 - PINK-2     3A.


  33JOHNNY'S POV - A METEOR - VISION

          streaks through the blue sky like a fiery arrow, burning
          the air as it goes, until it strikes the side of the
          mountain with a tremendous explosion.

          Johnny watches as the frozen image of the Old Man suddenly
          wavers like a flickering candle flame -- and then
            vanishes.

          The vision ends.


  55RESUME SCENE

          Johnny reacts to what he has just seen.  The boy suddenly
          stops pounding on his toy drum.  The silence is itself
          disturbing.

                                        OLD MAN
                        I'll give 'em your regards.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Huh...?  Oh, right.

          He turns and unsteadily makes it back to Bruce at the
          vehicle.  Bruce sees the haunted look on his face -- he's
          seen it before.

                                        BRUCE
                        Now what?

          But Johnny doesn't answer -- he's still thinking about
          the impending disaster.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          Across which moves a single point of light -- like a star
          with its own agenda.

          WIDEN TO REVEAL:



            A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulls his flashing motorcycle to a
          stop on the lonely stretch of road.  He takes off his
          sunglasses -- his local Native American heritage is evident
          from his features.

          We FOLLOW him as he walks up to the car he has just pulled
          over.  It's Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good morning, Officer.

                                        HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        License and registration please.

          As Johnny reaches for it, the cop notices the binoculars
          around his neck and the maps open on the seat next to
          him.

                                        HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        You were driving too slow for the
                        road.  Is there a problem?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, sir.  Just looking for a

                        Yes sir.

          He hands over his license and registration, and the moment
          the man makes contact with them -- he freezes as Johnny
          HEARS THE ROAR of the meteor flashing by.


  1111HIGHWAY PATROLMAN - VISION

          The man suddenly wavers like a flickering candle flame,
          and then vanishes -- just like the old man and the
          Astronomer.


  1212RESUME

          Johnny tries to maintain his composure after this vision
          as the officer glances at the license and registration.

                        It looks sort of like a dog... or
                        a wolf.  When you're looking up
                        at it.

                        No.

          The cop hands him back the license and registration.

                                        HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        There's a scenic turn-off a few
                        miles up the road.  You might
                        have better luck.

          Johnny nods.



          Johnny is parked at a scenic vista point off the rural
          highway.  He is looking through his binoculars at the
          distant landscape.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/16/02 - PINK-2    8A.

          JOHNNY'S POV - BINOCULARS

          He scans the area, finally spotting a low mountain that
          has some vague resemblance to the meteor impact site in
          his vision -- but it is obscured by a couple of hills in
          the foreground.


          RESUME

          Johnny takes down the binoculars and consults a map he
          has already opened onto the hood of his car.


          CLOSE ON: A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP

          Johnny's finger traces a winding country road that looks
          like it might take him in the direction of the mountain.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/9/02 - GOLD        9.



          Johnny's car runs out of road in front of a stand of trees. 
          He slows to a stop and gets out.

          Johnny considers the boundary of vegetation that lies
          before him -- this is where the unknown begins.  He takes
            a daypack and his cane out of the car, and slams the door. 
          He heads with resolve into the trees.



          -- Johnny walking through a stand of trees.

          -- Crossing a small stream.

          -- Standing on hillside, scanning with binoculars.

          -- Walking through another stretch of trees and brush,
          more dense, more genuine wilderness.  A little tired,
          Johnny sits down on a rock in a small clearing to catch
          his breath.

          The SOUND of quiet drumming.  Johnny is puzzled.  He looks
          around.


    1616JOHNNY'S POV - A FALLEN TREE TRUNK

          Nearby is being softly "beaten" over and over again by a
          breeze blown plant.  The sound is strangely suggestive of
          a drum.


          RESUME

          The breeze suddenly turns into a cold wind, and Johnny is
            instantly chilled.  He pulls his jacket closer around him --
          it is far too thin for this environment.  The distant
          SOUND of a HOWL.  Johnny shakes his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Great.

          He stands, grabs his cane, and moves off.          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/9/02 - GOLD       10.



          Johnny is walking along a narrow, brush-lined path along
          the top of a steep incline.  The wilderness is absolutely
          silent.  The path he is on seems ancient.  As if countless
            creatures have cut this arrow across the landscape.  His
            footsteps fall rhythmically on the earth, syncopated
          because of the cane, strangely like a drum... suddenly he
          hears a distant, rushing ROAR... Johnny reacts...


  1818NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY IN A VISION

          A blinding light from above almost whites out the scene...
          the ROAR flashes by.


  1919RESUME

          As the vision ends but Johnny finds himself disoriented
          and off-balance -- he tries to turn around and his cane
          catches on a rock that slips out from under him.

          Johnny suddenly pitches sideways, off the path and down
          the steep incline!



          Johnny tumbles and rolls and slides along the rough ground,
          trying desperately to stop himself, finally smashing up
          against a clump of vegetation, which breaks the fall.

          Several tense moments pass as Johnny catches his breath.





















                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: SHAMAN - ACT ONE - 7/10/02 - WHT-2     11.


    20CONTINUED:20

          He tries to move his leg and groans with the effort.  His
          trousers are torn and his leg is bleeding.  He stares up
          at the incline to mark the fall -- it's a long climb to
          the top.  He takes out the cell phone, opens it.


          CLOSE ON: CELL PHONE

          Which reads "No Service Area."


          RESUME

          Trying not to panic, he scans the slope for his daypack --
          which is a few feet further down the incline.

          Johnny locates his cane, several feet away.  Struggling,
          he crawls toward it.  Agonizing seconds later, he grabs
          the cane--



          ROSCOE is holding the cane aloft.

                                        ROSCOE
                          Sheriff!  

          Walt looks over from several yards away.  A search party
          of half-a-dozen people are carefully climbing among the
          rocks.  Walt starts moving toward Roscoe, then:

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Walt.  Over here.


          INCLUDE BRUCE - VISION

          further down the incline.  He is crouching down next to a
          body -- Johnny's.  Walt joins him, takes a look.

                                        WALT
                                (grim)
                        Guess it got a little too cold
                        last night.

          Bruce just looks at him, devastated.  Vision ends.


  2222RESUME JOHNNY

          As he considers this.  His gaze travels up the way he
          fell -- no way.  Then back down -- just as steep.  He'd
          likely fall again.

          He scans horizontally along the incline.


          JOHNNY'S POV - A CLEFT IN THE ROCKS

          Not so far away.  And on the same level as his current
            position.  He uses the cane to reach down for his daypack,
          pulling it up to him.  Then he struggles toward the cleft.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          The hand belongs to the Shaman, now a small boy, six years
          of age, on a branch high in a tree -- the two narrow
          vertical green lines on his forehead identify him.

          Johnny is also up in the tree, sitting on a nearby branch,
          watching this.  Johnny is amazed and even delighted to
          find himself in this vision.  There is no injury here, no
          pain (and a reminder: Johnny does not use the cane in his
          own visions.)

          The boy is unaware of his presence.  Johnny watches as
          the small hand stretches further and further, but the egg
          is just out of reach.  He is suddenly concerned.

          One more stretch, a little more, too much --


          ON JOHNNY

          who winces with the SOUND of crashing branches as the
          child falls O.S.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          THE BOY

            semiconscious at the base of the tree from which he has
          fallen, head bleeding, is struggling to sit up.  Find
          Johnny now standing on the forest floor, watching as the
          boy rouses slightly, and stares down at the blue egg,
          which miraculously, is intact in his hand.  Then he hears
          a SOUND -- of footsteps.  Not soft, off the forest floor,
          but harsh, echoing off a street -- and with the added,
          syncopated tap of a cane.

          Both Johnny and the boy look up in the direction of the
          sound.


  4040THE BOY'S VISION - A THREE LEGGED SPECTRE - OUT OF FOCUS -
          DARK - OTHER WORLDLY - TERRIFYING - SLOW MOTION

          Coming toward him as though emerging out of a dark
            tunnel... what the hell could this be...


          THE BOY

          Reacts, frozen in terror...


          JOHNNY

          Near the boy watches curiously...


  4141THE SPECTRE 

          Begins to take shape as it approaches like a distorted
          image on hot road... until to our astonishment we see the
          spectre is wearing the black peacoat and his third leg is
          a cane, and in fact, it is JOHNNY SMITH.

                                        JOHNNY SMITH SPECTRE
                        There's still time.

          But the spectre of Johnny disappears into thin air...
          close on the boy... find Johnny watching this... completely
          astonished as the vision ends and we're back...



          Walt is standing by his Sheriff's dept. vehicle, talking
          on the radio set to Sarah.  The headlights illuminate
          Johnny's abandoned car parked where the road ends -- Roscoe
          is checking it out.

                        hiked in.

          Another deputy with a flashlight passes by, heading for
          his own vehicle.

          Now an adolescent of 14 years, the same two vertical green
          stripes rising up his forehead, is raising a bow and arrow
          as he hunts a deer standing at a pool of water, drinking.  

          As the boy takes aim at the deer--


  4848BOY'S VISION - JOHNNY SMITH SPECTRE

          Suddenly stands between him and the deer!  The spectre
          stares right into his eyes.

          ENCAMPMENT IS IN THE BACKGROUND AS A MATTE SHOT) -
          MATCHING SHOT OF THE FEATHER FETISH

          Johnny Spectre standing in the background and we rack
          focus to see him clearly... the Shaman, now eighteen,
          same lines on his forehead, is holding the feather fetish
          defensively in front of him, as if hoping its magic will
          chase away this demon.  But it's not working.  He yells
          at the spectre...

                                        EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SHAMAN
                        Awani gia!?  Awani Gia!?

          Moving to find he's in a simple encampment of bark and
          animal skin-covered lean-tos.  And all the people of this
          small rugged community -- A couple of adult women scraping
          birch bark with sharp-edged stones, an old man sits by
          himself fashioning a fishhook from wood, three younger
          women are carrying water in skins to a birch pot above an
          open fire and one particularly pretty girl near-by that
          perhaps he was courting before the spectre made his
          appearance -- none of them can see the spectre - they
          only see the crazy young man... a couple of children laugh
          at him, the others barely notice anymore.


          ON HIS HURT AND CONFUSED FACE...

          the vision ends and we are back in...



          The fire is still smoking in the background.  The little
          girl is safe in the arms of a firefighter.

          The Shaman is standing nearby, watching this with great
          interest... perhaps beginning to understand that the
          words...

                                        SHAMAN

          ...are a warning.



          Johnny stands on a high vantage overlooking the Indian
            encampment... and again it's wonderful to be here...
          without pain, without injury... the breeze of a thousand
          years years ago drifting through his hair...


  6363POV - BELOW TO THE ENCAMPMENT (MATTE)

  6464JOHNNY

          at peace... until he looks up and sees the distinctive
          mountain where the meteor hit.  As he hears the sound of
          the approaching roar, the expression on his face changes
          to one of terrible realization...



          Johnny and the Shaman are among the people of this tiny
            community... a rushing ROAR and the people stare into the
          sky like deer caught in the headlights, and watch with
            incomprehension as a meteor flashes across the heavens
          like an arrow, striking the mountain with a tremendous
          explosion.. as time stops in its tracks... people frozen...
          flames already halfway down the slope, heading toward
          them.  The Shaman looks with horror from his doomed people
          to Johnny.

          Bruce is standing by the cruiser in the parking lot, a
            topographical map on his hood, talking on his cell phone,
            animated.

                        Johnny didn't have a vision of a
                        meteor that was gonna hit, he saw
                        one that already hit.  Not in the
                        future.  In the past.  The
                        geological surveys prove it.

          Walt is in the same clearing where we saw Johnny rest
          during his hike into the area, talking to Bruce on a
          handset with transmitter.  A couple of deputies are with
          him, other searchers are moving through the trees.

                        Go ahead.

          Bruce stares at the map -- the exact same mountain that
          Johnny indicated on his own map has been circled.

          Johnny is walking along a small path, wearing his black
          peacoat and leaning on his cane.  There's something
            dreamlike about him.  He might be dreaming; he might be
          in somebody else's dream.

          Several of the Shaman's people are going in front of him,
          carrying their belongings.  This is clearly the migration
          of these people to safety.  Johnny turns to find the Shaman
          walking at his side.  Their words throughout this sequence
          are matter-of-fact and dreamlike.

          keep moving on ahead.

          The helicopter is on the ground.  Johnny is being slowly
          moved along on a gurney toward a paramedics van that is
          set up as a emergency unit.

          Bruce is moving alongside the gurney.  IVs are in Johnny's
          veins, he is conscious but dazed.  He suddenly grabs hold
          of Bruce's arm.

          Johnny suddenly spots the Native American highway patrolman
          whom he also saw "burn" in his visions.  The man is helping
          with the traffic here.  Johnny lies back, relieved.

          As Johnny disappears behind a wall of paramedics, we move

          stand of postcards for sale.
