The argument in the kitchen continues, slightly muted.
PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)
This behavior might be okay with
your side of the family, but I'm
not putting up with it anymore!
Not me!
SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)
Oh, not this again!
PAN UP to find a light go on in Norman's bedroom window.

Norman ambles past houses and lawns spotted with small-
town America detritus; cheap plastic lawn furniture,
peeling-paint fences and cookie-cutter topiary. Here the
quaint colonial buildings are mostly in disrepair, their
picket fences rotten or daubed in graffiti.
ParaNorman 7.

Norman is watched dubiously by the occasional passer-by
as he shouts amiable greetings to people who simply
aren't there.
NORMAN
Good morning! Hey Bruce! How's it
goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late
for school. I need to go. Hi, nice
to see you guys. Good morning.
Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me.
Pardon me. See ya.
At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is
watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper
across the other side of the street.
MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of
raccoon road kill.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Hey there little buddy! C'mere!
He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
face the onlooker, then hurries away.
Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole
host of ghosts are meandering through the streets.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Yeah, good to see you! How you
doin'? Hi Mrs Hardman. You look
nice today. I like what you've
done with your hair.
HAIRDRYER GHOST
Does anyone smell burning?
HIPPY GHOST
Hey, peace, man.
NORMAN
Totally.
CIVIL WAR GHOST
As you were, soldier.
NORMAN
Sir, yes sir!
GREASER GHOST
Yo Norman, you playin' hookie?
NORMAN
No no, I'm just late for school.
Sorry, I gotta go.
(to Mobster Ghost)
How you doin'?
ParaNorman 8.
9 CONTINUED: (2) 9
MOBSTER GHOST
Hey, how you doin'?
A little further along Norman nods pleasantly to the
ghost of a parachutist impaled in the branches of a
roadside tree.
NORMAN
Hi! How's it hanging?
PARACHUTIST GHOST
Ho ho! Haven't heard that one
before. Well, it's a nice day.
11 11
Its industrial days now rusted behind it, Blithe Hollow
has become a run-down tourist town, celebrating its
heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks. A
massive billboard beside the main square reads "BLITHE
HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!" illustrated by a group
of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
hanging from a gallows. Across the street a huge banner
suggests this year is particularly important for the
town; "BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN' YEARS!"
The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks.
Everywhere Norman walks, the witch theme is prevalent.
Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
"MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM". There's a dingy bar, the BAR
GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.
Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black
woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking
like he'd rather be elsewhere.
SHERIFF HOOPER
Watch and learn. "Parking
violation" is my middle name.
DEPUTY DWAYNE
Really? I thought it was Rhona.
They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly
in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation.
Norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat
school building. Out front, the name "BLITHE HOLLOW
MIDDLE SCHOOL" is carved into an ugly hunk of granite.
ParaNorman 9.
12 CONTINUED: 12
SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman; a gauntlet
of jeering, merciless, pre-pubescent horror. Norman takes
a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule.
Most of the kids give him a wide berth, but others sneer
and WHISPER as he passes.
A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone
makes a bee-line for the building.
Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his
backpack to the ground. Other kids SNICKER as they step
over him.
As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman
is left alone on the path.
Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions,
and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye.
NORMAN'S POV - Mr Prenderghast, barely visible as he
stands within the shadow of a tree, stares back at him.
Norman frowns and squints his eyes, but now sees only
trees and shadows, so he continues up the steps.
13 13
Norman keeps going, but Neil quickly catches up, beaming
intently at the side of his head.
NORMAN
I keep telling you, Neil. I like
to be alone.
NEIL
So do I. Let's do it together!
You shouldn't let them get you
down. They always do stuff like
that to me.
NORMAN
Why?
NEIL
Because I'm fat. And my allergies
make my eyes leak. And I sweat
when I walk too fast. And I have a
lunchbox with a kitten on it. And
I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I
guess there's a whole bunch of
stuff.
NORMAN
Doesn't it bother you?
ParaNorman 14.
16 CONTINUED: 16
NEIL
Nah. You can't stop bullying, it's
part of human nature. If you were
bigger and more stupid, you'd
probably be a bully too. It's
called "survival of the thickest".
17 17
Norman and Neil walk away from the school along a tree
lined street at the end of which stands a huge
commemorative statue. It is a grotesque effigy of the
evil witch from the local legend.
MR PRENDERGHAST (O.S.)
Psssst!
The boys stop. It seems to be coming from the witch.
NEIL
That statue just "pissst" at us!
Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of
them, startling them as he staggers closer.
MR PRENDERGHAST
You know who I am?
NEIL
The weird stinky old bum who lives
up the hill?
MR PRENDERGHAST
(points to Norman)
I was asking him.
NORMAN
Yes. I know. I was told not to
talk to you. Sorry.
Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to
Norman and whispering conspiratorially.
MR PRENDERGHAST
And you know why you're not
supposed to talk to me?
Norman tries to back away.
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
I can see ghosts too! And I know
that's not all you've been seeing
lately, is it? Bad omens? Things
you can't quite explain? Strange
faces peering through the veil?
Norman's eyes widen further.
ParaNorman 15.
17 CONTINUED: 17
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
And I'll bet no one told you about
the witch's curse, did they?
NORMAN
Actually, we're learning about it
in school..?
NEIL
(BEAMING PROUDLY)
I'm a tree!
Mr Prenderghast impatiently turns his back on Neil and
leans close to Norman.
MR PRENDERGHAST
There's something you really need
to know! This is the most
important thing you will ever
hear! The fate of everyone depends
on it! Now listen close... The
witch's curse is real, and you're
the one who has to stop it!
Mr Prenderghast grabs Norman's arm and leans closer.
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
You've gotta use your gift of
talking to the dead!
He breaks into a HACKING COUGH, face turning beet red and
bloodshot eyes bulging.
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
Because if you don't the witch's
ghost...
(COUGHING)
And this is the most important
thing of all... You have to go up
to the old graveyard and...
NEIL (O.S.)
Leave him alone!
An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to
find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open
in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Don't make me throw this hummus!
It's spicy!
Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the
scene. He HISSES out of the side of his mouth at Norman.
ParaNorman 16.
17 CONTINUED: (2) 17
MR PRENDERGHAST
This ain't done with! You'll see
it soon enough! Watch for the
sign!
As he hobbles away, Neil peers down the street after the
old man.
NEIL
Jeez, what a dirty old creep!
NORMAN
He's my uncle.
NEIL
So is it true?
NORMAN
What?
Norman just stares at him.
NEIL
Can you see ghosts? Like,
everywhere? All the time?
NORMAN
Uh, yeah?
NEIL
Awesome! Do you think you can see
my dog Bub? He was run over by an
animal rescue van. Tragic and
ironic. We buried him in the yard.
Could you see him?
Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback.
NORMAN
Maybe.
NEIL
Sweet! Come on!
20 20
Neil forcibly drags Norman up the front driveway of a
pastel-painted house. A pair of legs spotted in oil stick
out from beneath a pimped-up camper van.
Neil's brother MITCH calls out from under the van.
MITCH
Neil? That you?
ParaNorman 17.
20 CONTINUED: 20
NEIL
Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play
with the dead dog in the garden
and we're not even gonna have to
dig him up first!
Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with
tattooed biceps. The kind of guy who wears year-round
flip-flops.
MITCH
What'd you say?
Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman,
who stands awkwardly a little way away, surrounded by
cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary.
MITCH (CONT'D)
Neil, isn't he that weird kid?
Y'know, "Look at me, I talk to
ghosts so people will pay
attention to me."
Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically.
NEIL
Can you stop doing that? It's
kinda stupid.
MITCH
Now listen to me, you don't need
to be hanging out with weird
people. That's a tip.
Neil scowls at his brother.
NEIL
Don't blow this for me, Mitch.
This one's not weird. He talks to
dead people.
Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his
brother.
21 21
Neil rummages around in the bushes of his back yard,
surrounded by a gloriously tasteless menagerie of lawn
ornaments. Norman stands slightly to one side surveying
the rows of plastic gnomes and wondering if he should
have gone straight home after all.
NEIL
He's around here somewhere...
(A BEAT)
So does everyone come back as a
ghost?
ParaNorman 18.
21 CONTINUED: 21
Norman hesitates. This level of interest is new to him.
NORMAN
No. My grandma told me it's
usually people who still have
stuff to figure out. Or sometimes
it's the ones who died suddenly,
or in a bad way.
A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy
wagging its tail cheerfully, despite being chopped neatly
into two halves.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Bub?
NEIL
Is he there? How's he look?
Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs
behind to sniff his own backside.
NORMAN
Uh... good.
Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby
calves, then doubles back for another try.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
He's happy to see you.
NEIL
("DOGGY" VOICE)
Who's a good boy, huh? Good boy!
(TO NORMAN)
Can he feel it if I pet him?
NORMAN
Yeah, I guess.
Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making
a "coochy-coo" face.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Uh... that's not his chin.
Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up.
Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in
front of Bub's nose, even though he can't see him.
NEIL
Go get it!
NORMAN
He can't fetch it, y'know.
ParaNorman 19.
21 CONTINUED: (2) 21
NEIL
Yeah well, it's still fun. Good
boy! Bring it back! Go get it,
Bub! Good boy!
CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back
and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his
feet and he bends down to pick it up.
NEIL (CONT'D)
Why don't you try?
NORMAN
`Cos I don't really, uh... You can
go.
NEIL
No, no, it's fun! Try it!
NORMAN
No I don't want to.
NEIL
You throw it. It's really easy.
NORMAN
No it's okay. You can throw it.
NEIL
No, c'mon, it's really fun.
NORMAN
Here. You go first.
NEIL
No, you try it. I already went
like fifty times.
NORMAN
Okay, what do I do?
NEIL
You get the stick, you pull it
back, and you throw it!
Norman throws it and accidentally hits Neil in the head,
knocking him over.
NORMAN
Neil? Sorry!
As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back
GIGGLING, the stick held between his teeth.
NEIL
I fetched it!
ParaNorman 20.
21 CONTINUED: (3) 21
CLOSE ON NORMAN, as a smile creeps across his face and he
starts to LAUGH.
NORMAN
Are you okay?
CUT WIDE as the two kids enjoy their play, the sun above
them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky.
28 28
Lit by spotlights, a large banner over the entrance
reads, "THE WITCH'S CURSE - presented by BLITHE HOLLOW
MIDDLE SCHOOL DRAMA SOCIETY - written, produced and
directed for the stage by Margot Henscher".
A notice beneath it reads "SPELLING BEE - NEXT WENSDAY".
A chorus of kids' voices can be heard SINGING from
inside, belting out an operatic rendition of Donovan's
"Season of the Witch".
30 30
As Norman turns on the spot GASPING, he hears a RUSTLE in
the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous
figures in Pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth.
PURITAN
Witch! We know you're out there!
Norman stands on a twig which, naturally, CRACKS loudly,
and the figure turns around and points at him.
PURITAN (CONT'D)
There!
NORMAN
No!
PURITAN
Witch.
More figures emerge from out of the darkness, wielding
hayforks. They SHOUT threateningly and, as one man, surge
toward him. Norman turns and runs.
The trees around him are shifting, but there's no wind
blowing the branches. Limbs GROAN as they twist, bearing
down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape.
Soon he can run no further, the way ahead tangled up into
a wall of thorny fingers.
ParaNorman 23.
31 CONTINUED: 31
Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a
huge tree, and a knothole grimaces at him, wood splitting
open into a hag-like mouth. It furrows a mossy brow and
speaks in a low rumbling voice.
TREE
The dead are coming!
Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away, but the
pursuing figures are drawing closer, and there's no
escape.
A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere.
NEIL (O.S.)
Hey buddy! Are you okay?
Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's
face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of
concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS.
32 32
Ominous clouds roll long shadows over the school
building.
Norman stands at the bottom of the school steps, trying
to prepare himself for what he knows is going to be a bad
day. He steels himself, and SIGHS.
35A 35A
Beneath a florid evening sky, the Babcock's drive is in
darkness. Pedalling furiously, Norman rides his bike out
of the shadows into the light of the street.
COURTNEY (O.S.)
You better not be sneaking out you
little weirdo!
45 45
On a street corner two teenage girls approach Alvin and
Pug, who have laid out a breakdancing mat and a beatbox
and are doing their best to impress. Alvin imagines he is
wowing the girls with his krumping, his ham-like limbs
flying around and Pug hollering support, but in truth
they watch in morbid fascination.
A faint CLATTERING sound down the road grows louder.
Norman suddenly THUNDERS past them on his bike, spinning
Alvin on the spot and knocking him onto his butt.
Show over, Alvin blunders to his feet, his eyes following
Norman's trajectory up the dark road, and GROWLS.
Tall conifers rise up high on either side of the road,
now little more than a dirt track. Norman pedals up the
hill and swerves, skidding to a stop in the gravel.
He climbs off the bike, eyes fixed on a ramshackle house
partially hidden in the foliage, its porch door swinging
and CREAKING eerily in the breeze.
He cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is
written "PRENDERGHAST", and steps onto the wooden porch.
ParaNorman 34.
Norman careens through the door, leaps off the porch and
sprints along the wooded lane up the hill, watched by
Alvin, concealed behind some bushes.
50 50
Norman emerges from the woods, his long shadow preceding
him as the sun begins its descent behind the tall trees.
ParaNorman 35.
50 CONTINUED: 50
He pauses and stares out across weathered tombstones
poking out amidst tangles of thorns.
Clutching the book tight, Norman wrenches open the heavy
gate, its rusted padlock crumbling apart.
Eventually the track runs up to a stone slab surrounded
on either side by thick bramble. Norman brushes aside
vines and reads an epitaph engraved into the stone;
"HERE LIES BURIED THE SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE BLITHE HOLLOW
CURSE. MAY YOUR SOULS FIND EVENTUAL AND EVERLASTING
SALVATION. 1712."
Norman pushes through the thick bushes into a secluded
plot of land behind the slab with seven gravestones
sticking out from the undergrowth.
NORMAN
This is it!
The sun continues its descent, casting an ever
lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Read from the book, stop the
curse, go home and pretend this
never happened.
Norman steels himself, opens the book and starts to read.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
"Once upon a time, in a far-off
land there lived a king and queen
in a magnificent castle..."
He pauses, confused by what he's reading.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
What? A fairy... tale...?
A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere, whipping
the book out of his grasp. He spins around to find Alvin
standing behind him.
ALVIN
What ya got there, Geekula?
Norman launches himself at the book, but Alvin holds him
back at arm's length.
NORMAN
Give it back!
ALVIN
Can't wait to see everybody's
faces when they hear about this
one!
ParaNorman 36.
50 CONTINUED: (2) 50
NORMAN
No, don't! Alvin!
ALVIN
Hey! Nobody makes me miss out on a
possible date with a girl that
almost had some interest in
talking to me. Yeah? Thought so!
You got nothin' to say!
NORMAN
Uh-oh.
ALVIN
Dang straight "uh-oh". That's what
happens when Alvin gets around
here. Uh-oh is that Alvin? Uh-oh
Alvin's gonna make me run home to
mommy.
As Norman twists and wrestles against the bully the
turbulent clouds in the sky above them twist and coalesce
into the vague semblance of a huge grinning face. The
face of a witch.
There is an enormous RUMBLE and a flash of lightning
silhouettes the boys.
ALVIN (CONT'D)
Uh-oh. What is that?
The wind has picked up, HOWLING through the gravestones.
Norman looks at the face leering out of the clouds.
NORMAN
It's her!
Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light, and
the wind instantly cuts out. The boys stand stock still.
Reaching down like a colossal arm, a great plume of cloud
spirals over the cemetery, enveloping the tumbledown
chapel and seeping around the gravestones. Fingers of
murky fog slither across the ground, occasionally pausing
and hanging in the air as though sniffing it. There is
something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils.
The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows
through the graveyard like a shockwave, pulsing through
the fog like a heartbeat.
Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog
suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into
the earth in front of the boys.
ParaNorman 37.
50 CONTINUED: (3) 50
Silence, then the ground begins to RUMBLE beneath their
feet and ripples beneath the tombstones. Stone slabs
GRIND and shift. One CRACKS right through the center.
ALVIN
What's that sound?
Norman watches, horrified, as the wet earth atop one of
the graves splits and a skeletal hand bursts through!
Norman watches as more graves bulge and break open and
mud-encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth.
The air is filled with anguished MOANING, the glowing fog
dancing and whirling about the hatching figures.
The two boys are rooted to the spot, mouths hanging open.
CLOSE ON one of the figures crawling out of the ground
into a patch of moonlight. Ragged and rotten it wears the
mud-encrusted clothes of a colonial Puritan. It stares
down at its hands, almost in disbelief, then lifts its
face up to the sky and lets out a HOWL.
Thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal LAUGHTER echoes
through the turbulent clouds.
The boys find themselves backed up against another
headstone, this one engraved with the name "JUDGE
HOPKINS". They leap aside as the ground swells beneath
their feet, and the DEAD JUDGE punches through the dirt,
bolt upright. His face wears a rictus grin and he looms
over the boys like the Grim Reaper in a powdered wig.
He tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in
Alvin's hand, and HISSES through yellowed teeth.
Norman makes a last ditch attempt at reading the book as
the Dead Judge approaches, the other zombies gathering
behind him.
NORMAN
Once upon a time in a far-off...
Once upon a... In a...
ALVIN
Make it stop right now, please!
NORMAN
It's not working!
The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL, but Norman frowns,
confused, because he can hear words.
DEAD JUDGE
STOP!... YOU... MUST... STOP!
ParaNorman 38.
50 CONTINUED: (4) 50
ALVIN
Norman? What are you doing? I
think I peed my pants!
Survival instincts finally kick in and Alvin makes a run
for it, scrambling through the graves toward the gate.
NORMAN
Wait!
Norman follows, leapfrogging over headstones.
52 52
Mitch climbs out of the van and sees the figure lying
still on the moonlit road. He nervously jogs over to it.
As he gets closer, Mitch can see the man more clearly. He
is wrapped in filthy tattered clothing of a bygone era
and is covered in dirt. Flies BUZZ around him.
MITCH
Er... hello, sir?
He hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench. A
mud-encrusted face stares up at him.
ANGLE ON the van, as Courtney leans her head out.
COURTNEY
Is he dead or what?
MITCH
I... I don't know! He's not
moving!
The figure's head lets out a faint GASP.
MITCH (CONT'D)
He's still breathing!
Mitch reaches out to gently lift the figure's head but as
he does, there is a CRUNCH and it comes off in his hands.
COURTNEY
So he's okay?
MITCH
Uh... not exactly.
COURTNEY
What? What did you just say?
Mitch looks from the head back to the van, then at the
head again. He licks his lips nervously as he thinks.
MITCH
Does anyone know CPR?
Further down the road, Norman runs back toward the van,
Alvin still in tow. He sees Mitch ahead of him, getting
dizzily to his feet, still holding the head.
NORMAN
Run!
The head in Mitch's hands suddenly GASPS again, opening
its mouth. Mitch SHRIEKS as the headless figure on the
road sits up and reaches out its arms. Mitch drop kicks
it like a football. It flies, WAILING, into the bushes.
ParaNorman 47.
63 CONTINUED: 63
As if struck by the same blow, the rest of the corpse
staggers backwards.
Alvin and Norman run past him toward the van, bustling
past Courtney and clambering inside.
More corpses are emerging from the trees on either side
of the road. She SCREAMS and leaps back into the van, as
Mitch leaps into the driver's seat beside her.
64 64
CLOSE ON the front wheel, spinning and SQUEALING. The van
spits out a cloud of exhaust fumes as it accelerates
away.
A beat as the smoke clears. The soot-covered zombies
SPLUTTER as they cough up what's left of their lungs.
They turn from one to the other, awaiting direction from
their leader. But the Dead Judge is nowhere to be seen.
A zombie points down the winding road where the woods
eventually thin out into leafy suburban drives. The
ragged shape of the Judge is clinging to the back of the
van, thrashing around and WAILING as it picks up speed.
The zombies quietly watch until the van moves out of
sight behind the trees, then turn their attention to the
lights of the town center below them. They weigh up their
options and, MOANING, shuffle toward civilization.
69 69
Further down the hill, Sheriff Hooper is taking a break
from ticketing borderline traffic violations by drinking
a giant malt shake in a plastic cup. She leans against
her parked motorcycle, squinting up at the unnatural
clouds.
SHERIFF HOOPER
Pesky kids with their cell phones
burning up the oh-zone, that's
what this is!
She finishes her shake and throws the non-recyclable cup
into the bushes.
Mitch's van shoots past at high speed in a cloud of dust.
SHERIFF HOOPER (CONT'D)
What the..?
Hooper watches the van tear away, the dark shape of the
Dead Judge visibly clinging to the back doors, his
voluminous cape flapping out behind him like a windsock.
70 70
Unseen by the kids, the Dead Judge claws his way up the
rear doors of the van by his ragged fingernails.
ParaNorman 49.
Hooper steers her bike closer and swings her backside
into the side of the van in an attempt to ram it off the
road.
The van lurches, flipping the Judge up and over the front
of the vehicle, planting his face with a SQUELCH against
the windscreen.
77 77
Mitch hangs a sharp right and accelerates off the road
and into thick undergrowth, sending up showers of twigs
and thorns.
Close on his heels, Hooper swerves her bike around in
pursuit.
80 80
The six zombies inexorably continue their march, breaking
cover from outlying woodland into the suburban streets of
the town proper.
At the bottom of a long driveway, spotlit by a street
lamp, Mrs Henscher is taking out the trash in her
bathrobe.
She looks up from her garbage as the zombies approach.
Her face is caked in a terrifying green avocado face
mask. Barely a few feet in front of her, a similarly
green face stares back, only this one has been dead for
three hundred years.
Henscher SCREAMS, bolting down the street like a runaway
locomotive.
81 81
The van ploughs through bracken and bushes at breakneck
speed.
A little way behind, Hooper careens precariously in the
van's wake.
82 82
Mitch swerves his van down the hill toward the more
affluent suburbs of the town. Hooper's police bike
bounces along behind them, red light flashing and SIREN
wailing.
84 84
Mitch's van explodes out of the thinning woods and back
on to the winding hill road. Hooper careens through the
trees behind it, but fails to make the turn and smashes
through a fence across the other side of the road into a
suburban back yard, splinters of fence showering down in
her wake.
Scattering lawn ornaments, plastic garden toys and deck
furniture, Hooper rides directly up a kids' slide,
shooting high up into the air like a rocket.
ParaNorman 55.
Preceded by an ear-splittingly guttural WAIL, Mrs
Henscher runs through the streets, waving her arms about
hysterically.
Moments later, the Babcocks' station wagon pulls around
the corner.
88 88
Mitch's van SCREECHES through the intersection, swerving
in front of the Babcock's station wagon, which veers
wildly as Perry brakes hard.
He leaps out of the car as the van drives away.
PERRY BABCOCK
Delinquent drivers! Where are the
police when you need them?
Hooper's bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the
hood of the station wagon with a CRUNCH. Before Perry can
react he is buried under the mass of Sheriff Hooper,
dropping like a meteorite onto his head.
89 89
Having completely lost control, Mitch's van ploughs
through cookie-cutter back yards.
ParaNorman 56.
90 CONTINUED: 90
It bounces down the hill, flipping over and over, the
kids inside tossed around like rag dolls.
Somewhat the worse for wear, it eventually comes to a
stop in a parking lot, neatly crashing into an empty
space.
91 91
The kids clamber out of the far side of the van.
MITCH
Oh my gosh! I'm gonna be sick!
COURTNEY
Oh, I broke a nail!
As Alvin climbs out, he gingerly holds up the Judge's
arm, as if it were a dead animal, and dangles it limply
in front of his face.
ALVIN
Yeah! Alvin the zombie slayer! I
got you...
The hand suddenly bends back on itself, slaps him on the
face, and as he SQUEALS it drops to the ground and
skitters away into the shadows.
Mitch sizes up what's left of his van, and bids a tearful
farewell.
MITCH
(WHISPERS)
Baby, I'm so sorry. You'll be
alright. We're gonna get through
this together.
Courtney pouts moodily when she realizes the tender words
aren't for her.
Norman looks up at the sky. A thick bank of cloud looms
over the town, and in its center is the unmistakable
otherworldly face, ebbing in and out of visibility, and
grinning horribly.
NORMAN
Uh oh. C'mon!
NEIL
Oh yeah!
Neil HUMS his very own action movie score as he runs to
follow Norman out of the parking lot.
ParaNorman 57.
91 CONTINUED: 91
COURTNEY
Perfect. Now the geeks are in
charge.
The kids make toward the parking lot exit.
93 93
The town center retains even less charm when the sun goes
down, and its remaining denizens are now drunk, high or
looking for trouble. Provided one requires alcohol, junk
food or pharmaceuticals, it's the place to be.
A ruddy-faced drunk, SLOB GUY, inserts a few coins in a
vending machine at the end of an alley, and waits as the
metal coil inside curls a candy bar toward the front of
the machine. The man notices the approaching figures
further down the back street and frowns.
He turns back to the machine, waiting. The zombies draw
closer, GROANING, and the man fidgets uncomfortably.
The man begins WHIMPERING. The candy bar slowly shifts
forward. The zombies are close enough to touch.
The man YELLS and runs away, leaving the candy bar to
drop to the machine's trough with a CLANG.
A beat then, still SCREAMING, the man runs back to the
machine, grabs his candy, then runs away again.
The Undead emerge onto Main Street, and slow down as they
take in their surroundings.
VARIOUS ANGLES ON the garish town center nightlife
intercut with CLOSE-UPS of the wide-eyed zombies.
-Two teenage girls in mini-skirts walk along the curb. A
pickup truck crawls by, driven by red necks who wolf-
whistle and gesture rudely. The girls GIGGLE.
-In the nearby "GOBBLER'S" parking lot, a huge woman sits
in her vehicle cramming a burger into her mouth. As she
bites down ketchup spatters across the inside of the
windscreen like arterial spray.
-A corpse stands agog before a billboard. The poster is
for a line of "Lady Luck" lingerie and features a buxom
woman in her underwear draped over a roulette wheel. The
tagline is "FANCY YOUR CHANCES?" The corpse's one eye
pops out of its socket and dangles by its optic nerve.
-Outside the Bar Gento, LOUD MUSIC and raucous revelry
blare out into the street.
ParaNorman 58.
93 CONTINUED: 93
-A group of loitering teens cluster in a group, some
sitting upon a stolen shopping cart, others kicking a tin
can from one to the other. One daubs misspelled naughty
words on the wall beside them. Another is attempting to
use his bare hands to rip open a parking meter.
-Another corpse stands in the light of a store window, a
bank of TVs showing all kinds of programs. Racing car
explosions; scantily-clad singers gyrating in music
videos; talking animals and Viagra commercials.
QUICK CUTS OF ZOMBIE CLOSE-UPS as they all raise rotten
fingers to their mouths and SCREAM.
Slob Guy suddenly bursts out of the door of the Bar
Gento, dragging a group of dubious drinkers.
SLOB GUY
See! I told you! Zombies! It's the
witch's curse!
Everyone in the street freezes in place, wide-eyed.
Someone GASPS.
SWEET GIRL
Mama?
RAPPER GUY
What?
A couple of the zombies exchange glances, waiting for the
other shoe to drop.
GUCCI LADY
What should we do?
Barely skipping a beat, the townsfolk shift seamlessly
from shock and awe to bullish aggression.
Crystal pulls a pump-action shotgun from somewhere about
her person and scowls menacingly.
CRYSTAL
Kill them in the head!
Within seconds, the seedy-looking townsfolk have armed
themselves with pool cues, mops, toilet plungers and any
other household implements that can be waved
threateningly, and the mob advances on the group of
quivering zombies.
94 94
The disembodied Judge's arm skitters along a secluded
street, eventually coming upon the rest of the Dead
Judge, sitting in the gutter trying to arrange and re-
attach his body parts in the right places.
ParaNorman 59.
94 CONTINUED: 94
Having SNAPPED his head back onto his neck, the Judge
scoops up his remaining arm and gets unsteadily to his
feet.
103 103
NORMAN
Hurry! This way!
Norman leads the way, but stops dead as they run headlong
into a scene of zombie invasion mayhem.
Townsfolk fill the streets, SHOUTING and acting generally
mob-like. One or two of them have even got hold of
burning torches from somewhere. It's apocalyptic chaos.
The fat woman from the Drive-Thru runs past SCREAMING,
her face and T-shirt covered in blood-red ketchup.
COURTNEY
Oh, this is awful! The zombies
are, like, eating everyone!
Norman points beyond the bedlam to the dark shape of the
Old Town Hall in the plaza.
NORMAN
C'mon!
They skirt around the edge of Main Street, avoiding
flying bottles and limbs as best they can.
Following the noise, the Judge staggers along some way
behind. He surveys the scene as he emerges, his
featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of
expressing horrified shock.
After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the
kids in the distance. A look of resolve crosses his face,
turning quickly to surprise as a SHOT rings out nearby.
The Judge looks down to a large hole blown through his
midriff. Framed within it is Crystal, several feet away,
rifle smoking. He looks up again, weighs up his chances,
then lets out a ROAR of retreat to his beleaguered
companions before running off into the shadows.
Those zombies who haven't already tried to run for cover
manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow
the Judge's CRY, some of them breaking into a sprint.
106 106
Formerly the district courthouse, the Town Hall has now
been relegated to storing the local archives.
ParaNorman 60.
106 CONTINUED: 106
It is an old timber building, surrounded by graceless
modern office blocks around the cobbled square.
The kids race across the plaza, pausing to catch their
breath at the ugly witch statue in front of the Town
Hall. They GASP as they slow their pace.
NORMAN
Is everyone alright? Nobody got
bitten?
Neil flops down heavily against the statue, panting and
holding his mouth.
NEIL
(MUFFLED)
I bid dy tongue! Dud dat count?
Norman moves toward the steps leading up to the Town
Hall's doors, the rest of the gang falling into line
behind him.
Another flash of lightning paints the kids' shadows
across the width of the square. Norman nervously watches
the clouds above them.
NORMAN
Does anyone know how to pick a
lock?
Everyone immediately looks at Alvin.
ALVIN
Sure. Picking locks is my thing.
Alvin walks over to a notice board beside the door, upon
which is a poster for a "CRIME PREVENTION SEMINAR". He
yanks it out of the ground, hefts it through the window,
then reaches through to unfasten the door latch.
ALVIN (CONT'D)
Boom.
107 107
Sheriff Hooper looks around and sees an awful lot of
armed people beginning to bay for blood, and she sees
trouble on her hands.
SLOB GUY
Ain't room for no more zombies in
this town!
Standing behind him, Teddy agrees with a slack-jawed
MOAN.
TEDDY
Yeah.
104 104
Perry brakes hard just a few feet in front of the
advancing mob, moving menacingly en masse in pursuit of
the fleeing Undead. Hooper bustles out of the car, making
a beeline for Deputy Dwayne.
Crystal turns and fires into the street, taking out a
lightbulb over a store sign. A dog somewhere in the
shadows YELPS and runs away.
ParaNorman 63.
105 CONTINUED: 105
Sheriff Hooper is outraged, and snatches the gun out of
Crystal's hand.
SHERIFF HOOPER
What do you think you're doing,
firing at civilians? That is for
the police to do!
DEPUTY DWAYNE
It's okay Sheriff, we've only been
shooting at the dead ones! It's
the living dead, come to take us
all to Hell! We gotta stop them
before they get away!
109 109
In the alley down the side of the old Town Hall, the
zombies tiptoe through the shadows. They look slightly
the worse for wear; some have lost limbs, others have
large holes in them. One has a toilet plunger stuck on
her head.
The Dead Judge looks up at the sky. The turgid
supernatural storm RUMBLES closer, pressing down upon the
nearby rooftops.
The Judge motions to the other zombies to hurry, and
grabs hold of the Town Hall's side door. He rips it open,
and furtively motions the zombies to file inside.
110 110
SHERIFF HOOPER
Move along now people, there isn't
anything to see here!
The townsfolk around her refuse to be allayed by this.
Perry and Sandra have emerged dubiously out of their car
and watch from the periphery, utterly bewildered.
Mrs Henscher, newly arrived and wearing her avocado face
mask like war paint, shakes her shotgun and points down
the street.
MRS HENSCHER
I saw them! I saw them! The
zombies are in the Town Hall!
The information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire.
Several faces turn to Henscher, who is pleased to have an
engaged audience and hams it up shamelessly, coming on
like Braveheart in curlers.
ParaNorman 64.
110 CONTINUED: 110
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs
of war!
The faces around her don't react; waiting patiently for a
clearer translation.
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
Let's rip `em apart!
Mrs Henscher points the crowd toward the Town Hall.
Despite Hooper's protests, the townsfolk are on lynch mob
auto pilot and surge like a force of nature along the
Main Street toward the Town Hall plaza.
111 111
The square outside is awash with threatening townsfolk,
led by Mrs Henscher and Deputy Dwayne. Some charge up the
Town Hall steps, JEERING and WHISTLING.
113 113
Slob Guy reaches in through a gap in the broken woodwork,
managing to grab a hold of something.
SLOB GUY
They're in there alright! I can
feel its clammy flesh!
117 117
MRS HENSCHER
Let's burn `em out!
Obligingly, a couple of townsfolk hurl Molotov cocktails
at the windows.
120 120
Norman heaves himself through a tiny hatchway onto a flat
roof at the highest point of the building. He shuts the
hatch, inching away as the zombies beneath beat on it
with their hands.
Norman finds himself backed up against a flimsy wooden
rail, which CREAKS warningly. He leans over and sees the
square beneath, filled with angry people. He has nowhere
left to run.
Above him the red sky RUMBLES, clouds churning into a
ghastly grinning mouth.
122 122
Far below, the gathered townsfolk grow increasingly
erratic. A pair of visiting tourists happily take in
their surroundings with their cell phones and cameras.
Sandra tugs at her husband's arm as they are buffeted by
the increasingly erratic townsfolk.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh my gosh, do you think this has
got anything to do with Norman?
Perry waves her hand away irritably.
PERRY BABCOCK
Of course not!
He is interrupted by a SHOUT as someone sees Norman's
tiny figure silhouetted against the raging sky on the
roof of the building.
LIBRARIAN
Everyone look!
Perry and Sandra see their son begin gesticulating wildly
at the clouds.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry, do something!
He cups his hands around his mouth and YELLS at Norman.
PERRY BABCOCK
Norman! Get down from there this
instant! You're supposed to be
grounded!
ParaNorman 70.
Distraught, Norman bellows into the sky, waving the book
angrily above his head.
NORMAN
You horrible old witch! Is this
what you want?
The roiling face above him seems to CACKLE mercilessly.
124 124
The mob begins to lurch to all new stupid conclusions as
Norman waves his arms at the clouds.
MRS HENSCHER
Necromancer!
FEMALE TOURIST
This is all his doing!
SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman!
Perry feels the shift in the crowd. They're not just
baying for blood. They're about to start baying for his
son's blood.
125 125
Norman continues YELLING at the sky, waving the book.
He madly flicks through the pages, attempting to read
aloud over the ROARING wind.
NORMAN
Once upon a time in a far-off land
there lived a king and queen... in
a magnificent castle...
The horrible cloud face above him CACKLES monstrously,
drowning out the story.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Why won't you listen to me? Why
are you doing this?!
The face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of
lightning spits out. It SMACKS into the book held in
front of Norman's chest, lifts him up off his feet and
throws him back onto the old timbers of the roof.
The air is knocked out of Norman as, trailing smoke, he
SMASHES through the wood into the fiery chasm of the
building beneath.
ParaNorman 71.
125 CONTINUED: 125
CAMERA follows him as he plummets, SCREAMING, and is
enveloped in thick black smoke.
There is a loud THUD, and silence.
126 126
A loud THUD from within the Town Hall causes the gathered
crowd outside to GASP, and those closest to the doors to
take a few steps back.
The crowd GASPS again as the charred front door of the
Town Hall is wrenched off its hinges by a huge piece of
timber and CRASHES down the steps in a shower of flaming
splinters.
A ripple of shock runs through the crowd as a number of
skeletal figures emerge, SPLUTTERING and WHEEZING through
the smoke, shielding their faces from the heat.
The gathered crowd are even more aghast when they realize
a child is being guided out of the flames by the zombies.
Unseen by the crowd, Courtney and the other kids crawl to
the splintered opening of the front door, blinking and
COUGHING for air.
Hooper pulls out her gun and marches toward the zombies.
SHERIFF HOOPER
You stay right where you are! You
may be dead already, but I will
still shoot you!
ParaNorman 77.
131 CONTINUED: 131
The zombies stop on the steps, burning building behind
them and the hostile townsfolk in front of them. Norman
pushes through and stands firmly in the way of Hooper's
gun, arms spread defensively.
NORMAN
Wait!
Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from
within the doorway.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh my gosh!
Far above, the clouds THUNDER like demonic laughter.
Perry steps forward, face red.
PERRY BABCOCK
Son! Step away from the zombies!
NORMAN
No! I won't!
Sandra comes up behind her husband and holds his arm.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry, calm down! You're going to
have a heart attack and then what
are you going to do?
PERRY BABCOCK
I'll come back and haunt Norman!
Maybe then he'll start listening
to me!
NORMAN
No! You don't understand what's
happening here! I spoke to them
and it's not what you think!
Courtney edges forward out of the doorway, shocked but
transfixed.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
The curse isn't about the zombies
hurting you! It's about you
hurting them! I figured it out,
and I know a way to stop this!
MRS HENSCHER
He's in league with them!
A few members of the crowd try to push past Perry toward
the steps.
DEPUTY DWAYNE
Let's hang him!
ParaNorman 78.
131 CONTINUED: (2) 131
GUCCI LADY
No! We can't hang him, stupid!
It's the 21st Century!
DEPUTY DWAYNE
Then let's burn him!
Sandra turns despairingly to the crowd behind her.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Can you stop being a mob for just
one minute?!
NORMAN
Listen to me!
CRYSTAL
Get them before they eat us!
Punctuating every shout, the roiling clouds continue to
RUMBLE their horrible laughter.
COURTNEY
Leave him alone!
Courtney suddenly emerges, standing right in front of
Norman. Following her lead in true "I'm Spartacus!"
fashion, Neil, Mitch and Alvin step forward too, creating
a barrier all around him, all joining hands in
solidarity.
CLOSE ON Courtney's face as she hisses sidelong to Alvin.
COURTNEY (CONT'D)
Hand, Alvin! My hand!
A ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd.
COURTNEY (CONT'D)
Everybody, listen up! You all need
to stop trying to kill my brother!
You're adults! Stop it! I know
that this seems crazy, believe me
I'm with you on that, but I think
he does actually know what he's
talking about!
NEIL
All night he's been trying to save
you from the witch's curse!
MITCH
Yeah, and all you want to do is
burn and murder stuff, burn and
murder stuff! Just burning and
murdering!
ParaNorman 79.
131 CONTINUED: (3) 131
ALVIN
Shame on every single one of you!
How dare you all!
Amongst the crowd, doubt is beginning to show. Even the
rumbling clouds have gone quiet.
CRYSTAL
So they're not going to hurt us?
NORMAN
No, does it look like any of them
are trying to hurt you? They're
just people. At least they used to
be. Just stupid people who should
have known better.
Norman looks at the line of Puritans. They look quite sad
and pathetic really. Hardly monstrous at all.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
They did something unforgivable
because they were scared, and they
were cursed for it. Now it's
happening all over again. Don't
you get it? They were just like
you. But now it has to stop. For
good.
Across the crowd, weapons are being lowered and faces are
starting to look a little guilty.
There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the
line of three hundred year-old townsfolk. Throughout the
crowd various weapons CLATTER as they hit the ground.
A small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one
of the zombies his arm back.
The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM. It blows
out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza on a
hellish wind. The street lamps around the square shatter
in bursts of sparks, raining down on the amassed people.
The sky above is blood red, clouds twisting and
contorting into a vast unnatural vortex.
The Town Hall erupts in a fireball, tongues of white fire
ROARING out of the embers as the ground shakes and the
crowd scatters in terror.
Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a
parked car, and SHOUTS over the noise of the wind.
NEIL
Jeez, what is her problem?
Norman takes in the chaos around them...
ParaNorman 80.
131 CONTINUED: (4) 131
-An arc of white lightning hits the base of the witch's
statue with a CRACK. With a terrible GROAN, the statue is
lifted up into the air by the supernatural wind. It
CRASHES down at the foot of the Town Hall steps,
shattering into a hundred pieces of rubble.
-Windows blow out of tacky tourist stores, their cheap
front displays ripped apart by the wind.
-A bolt of lightning tears through the huge billboard in
the plaza, ripping apart the idealized image of the
town's history in a spiral of splintered wood.
Norman struggles over to where a group of townsfolk and
zombies cower from the destruction. Sandra runs over to
her son and hugs him.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh, Norman!
NEIL
So what do we do now?
NORMAN
I... I really don't know...
COURTNEY
Yes you do, Norman! You've got to
get to that witch's grave!
NORMAN
But...
COURTNEY
But nothing! You listen to me,
buster, we didn't turn away when
Daleridge High was slaughtering
our volleyball team, did we?
NORMAN
I thought we did.
COURTNEY
No we didn't. I've cheered the
uncheerable, Norman, and I'm not
letting you give up now!
Norman turns to Perry, his eyes all business.
NORMAN
Dad, could I borrow the car?
PERRY BABCOCK
Excuse me?
ParaNorman 81.
131 CONTINUED: (5) 131
Norman looks squarely at his dad, and the Dead Judge
beside him. They exchange uneasy glances.
CUT TO:
132 132
The car turns a corner into the path of an overturned
truck, caught by the spectral wind. It cartwheels down
the middle of the street, tearing up the asphalt.
I/E. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS
Perry swerves out of its path of destruction.
Inside, Sandra cranes her neck around to watch the truck
CRASH down the road behind them. She faces front again.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Boy, the traffic tonight!
COURTNEY
Norman! He's on my side of the
seat!
NORMAN
She wants you to move over.
The Judge MUMBLES.
COURTNEY
I heard that! Mom! Tell the zombie
to stop saying stuff about me!
NORMAN
Can you quit using the "z" word?
PERRY BABCOCK
So help me I will stop this car
right now if all three of you
don't quit it this instant!
ParaNorman 82.
CONTINUED:
After a moment, the Judge lets out a sepulchral MOAN.
NORMAN
He says "take a left here".
Perry gives a distasteful look, but turns the steering
wheel. He peers out through the raging storm, windscreen
wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris.
PERRY BABCOCK
We've already been this way. We're
going around in circles!
SANDRA BABCOCK
Maybe we should pull over and ask
someone?
PERRY BABCOCK
Oh, right, you think maybe we
should stop at a graveyard and dig
up some other eighteenth-century
corpses?
SANDRA BABCOCK
It's not a bad idea.
PERRY BABCOCK
I wish I understood you.
136 136
I/E. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS
From the back seat, the Judge turns to Norman and GROANS.
PERRY BABCOCK
Please don't tell me he needs to
use the bathroom.
Norman listens as the Judge continues GRUMBLING, then
leans forward over his father's seat, pointing.
NORMAN
Turn down there!
137 137
The car turns tightly off a secluded road onto a dirt
path running into the thick of the surrounding woodland.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh my, do you think that's it?
ParaNorman 83.
The headlights of the car illuminate a huge fallen trunk
ahead along the path, and Perry pulls the car to a stop,
wheels CRUNCHING on dirt and roots.
Everyone gets out of the car. The trees around them are
thick and dense. Aggie's furious storm WHISTLES through
the branches far above them.
Norman turns to the Dead Judge. The Judge nods solemnly,
pointing ahead.
Norman steels himself and begins to march forward through
the thick brambles, the others following behind.
PERRY BABCOCK
So, why are we here?
NORMAN
Someone's gotta talk to her, Dad.
PERRY BABCOCK
Yeah, um, why's that person you,
exactly?
As they continue, the surrounding trees press in on them,
just like in Norman's vision. Branches and thorns lash at
their faces while thick roots entangle their feet.
Norman's family are falling behind and realize too late
that the encroaching trees are about to crush Norman.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh my goodness, look out!
NORMAN
Mom!
SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry! Do something!
Perry is finding it difficult to move; a tree bears down
on him, its roots snagging his thrashing limbs.
PERRY BABCOCK
I'm trying!
SANDRA BABCOCK
Kick it in the knothole!
Norman hops nimbly between two huge trunks as they SMASH
together, blocking off the way ahead with gnarled wood.
Sandra struggles free and shouts over the branches.
SANDRA BABCOCK (CONT'D)
Norman?!
ParaNorman 84.
139 CONTINUED: 139
NORMAN (O.S.)
I'm okay Mom! Wait for me here!
Don't worry!
SANDRA BABCOCK
Be careful!
Now separated from the others, Norman turns to go ahead
on his own. Ahead of him a phosphorescent glow shines off
the trees, and he knows he is very close.
140 140
Exhausted but determined, Norman finds the source of the
supernatural storm; a clearing sculpted out of the forest
by Aggie's fury.
In the center of it all is the tree, bleached white as
bone and grotesquely twisted. The trees around it CREAK
and GROAN as though they'd like to uproot and plant
themselves someplace else.
Beneath this tree lie Aggie's remains, buried three
hundred years ago. Now a mess of roots and rocks open out
like an ugly wound, and within them a tiny childlike
figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of
spectral energy. Ectoplasm rages up around the tree's
finger-like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative
energy. It's a child's tantrum turned atomic.
NORMAN
Hello?
Words echo around him in response.
AGGIE
You're not welcome here. Go away.
Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly.
The raging wind intensifies as Norman turns back around.
NORMAN
Uh... I really need to speak with
you.
AGGIE
Who are you?
NORMAN
I'm Norman. Norman Babcock. You
don't actually know me, but I know
you. We're actually kind of the
same, you and I.
Norman takes another step closer, ducking as petrified
branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind.
ParaNorman 85.
140 CONTINUED: 140
AGGIE
You're not dead.
NORMAN
Well, no, apart from that.
AGGIE
And you're a boy.
NORMAN
Well, yes, that too.
AGGIE
You're not like me at all.
Norman hesitates, knowing he's on dangerous ground.
NORMAN
Well, I know how you feel?
AGGIE
No you don't. You don't know
anything about me.
NORMAN
I know your name is Agatha
Prenderghast.
The ghostly voice wavers for the first time.
AGGIE
What?
NORMAN
And I know you're probably tired.
Right? Because, I mean, it's
really late and it's been a long
night and we're, like, only eleven
years-old, and...
The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder.
AGGIE
I don't want to go to sleep, and
you can't make me! I burnt the
book into dust, and now I don't
have to listen to that stupid
story any more! Leave me alone!
Norman is terrified, but advances on the tree, the rocks
under his feet churning.
NORMAN
No. I'm not leaving. Just listen
to me.
(takes a breath)
Uh... once upon a time... long
ago... there was a little girl...
ParaNorman 86.
140 CONTINUED: (2) 140
AGGIE
What?
NORMAN
A little girl who was different
from the other people in her
village.
The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its
demonic fingers in its ears.
AGGIE
I'm not listening! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-
LAAA!
NORMAN
She could see and do things that
no one could understand, and that
made them scared of her.
AGGIE
I don't like this story!
NORMAN
She turned away from everyone, and
became sad and lonely, and had no
one to turn to.
AGGIE
Stop it!
If Aggie weren't floating three feet above the ground,
she'd be stamping her feet. Her voice blows bits of bark
off the surrounding trees.
NORMAN
But the more she turned away from
people, the more scared they were
of her, and they did something
terrible!
Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air. Where they
hit the ground, they send up white flames.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
They became so scared that they
took her away and killed her!
AGGIE
No!
NORMAN
But even though she was dead
something in her came back.
AGGIE
Stop!
ParaNorman 87.
140 CONTINUED: (3) 140
NORMAN
And this part of her wouldn't go
away, not for three hundred
years...
AGGIE
Shut up!
NORMAN
And the longer it stayed, the less
there was of the little girl!
AGGIE
I'll make you suffer!
NORMAN
Why?
Aggie goes to shout, but stops, unsure of her answer.
AGGIE
Because... because...
NORMAN
Because you want everyone to hurt
just as much as you are! So
whenever you wake up you play this
mean game, but you don't play
fair!
AGGIE
They hurt me!
NORMAN
So you hurt them back?
AGGIE
I wanted everyone to see how
rotten they were!
NORMAN
You're just like them, Agatha.
AGGIE
No I'm not!
NORMAN
You're a bully.
AGGIE
No I'm not!
Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm. The world
behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos.
NORMAN
They did something awful, but that
doesn't mean you should too!

NORMAN (CONT'D)
All that's left of you now is mean
and horrible!
He sees her clearly now. True, she is floating above the
ground, and her hair is writhing madly about her, and
plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body, but
she's still just a little girl underneath.
AGGIE
That's not true!
Norman climbs up a tree root, Aggie's flames searing his
skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her.
NORMAN
Then stop. This is wrong and you
know it! You've spent so long
remembering the bad people that
you've forgotten the good ones.
There must have been someone who
loved you and cared for you. You
don't remember them?
AGGIE
Leave me alone!
NORMAN
But you're not alone! You have to
remember!
AGGIE
Keep away from me!
Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps. His
outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach Aggie's
tiny hand, as though the air is fighting against him.
NORMAN
Remember!
There is a flash of white, and silence.
FADE TO:
141 141
Dappled sunlight falls through shimmering leaves and
blossoms. Norman and Aggie are standing in thick grass,
replete with wild flowers, the dead white tree now quite
alive and blossoming behind them.
Aggie is no longer an indistinct specter, but flesh and
blood and as real as Norman. She stares down at her hand
as Norman holds it gently by the end of her finger.
AGGIE
Aggie. My name was Aggie.
ParaNorman 89.
141 CONTINUED: 141
A brightly-colored butterfly flutters between them. Aggie
starts to remember as she follows its flight.
AGGIE (CONT'D)
I... I remember my mommy brought
me here once. We sat under the
tree and she told me stories. They
all had happy endings.
(BROW FURROWS)
And then those horrible men came
and took me away and I never saw
her again!
She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her
face. It instantly crumples up into ashes. Surprised, she
GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground.
There's anger in Aggie, but there is confusion, sadness
and regret there too. She isn't quite so scary anymore.
NORMAN
Sometimes when people get scared
they say and do terrible things. I
think you got so scared, that you
forgot who you are. But I don't
think you're a witch. Not really.
Aggie looks into his eyes.
AGGIE
You don't?
NORMAN
I think you're just a little kid
with a really special gift who
only ever wanted people to
understand her.
He smiles softly.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
So we're not all that different at
all.
AGGIE
But what about the people who hurt
you? Don't you ever want to make
them suffer?
Norman thinks this over, and shrugs.
NORMAN
Well, yeah, but what good would
that do? You think just because
there's bad people out there that
there's no good ones either? I
thought the same thing.

NORMAN (CONT'D)
For a while. But there's always
someone out there for you.
Somewhere.
Aggie frowns, looking lost.
AGGIE
I just want my mommy...
NORMAN
I'm sorry, Aggie. She's gone.
AGGIE
That story you were telling. How
does it end?
NORMAN
I think that's up to you.
Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet.
AGGIE
Is this where they buried me?
NORMAN
It's a pretty good place to sleep.
Then you can be with your mom
again.
Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground,
her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on
the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands.
Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes.
Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny
frame shifting softly under her long hair.
The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie
softens as though out of focus, and the whole world
becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes
his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up
into the clouds high above his head.
Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES
softly through the sky, as if moving away.
143 143
The zombies form a group in the center of the square, all
of them looking up into the clouds. The people around
them stop and stare, awestruck as a breeze buffets their
clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer.
As the modern townsfolk watch on, some of the zombies
take each others' arms for support. Those with eyelids
close them. One by one their bodies dissolve away,
leaving ethereal figures in their place.
ParaNorman 91.
143 CONTINUED: 143
For a moment they float where they stood, ghostly
apparitions of the people they once were before the
curse. They stare sadly out at their flesh and blood
descendents, and in an instant become just specks of
light that are caught by the breeze and carried out of
sight.
142 142
Norman blinks open his eyes, taking a moment to survey
the scene around him.
He sits upon the upturned root of the tree, the earth
around broken and twisted, a testament to what has
happened. He looks up into the sky and gives a sad smile.
NORMAN
Sleep tight.
He clambers down through the roots back toward the path.
144 144
Norman wearily walks through the splintered roots to find
his family. Sandra shouts out when she sees him.
SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman? Norman!
Sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms,
hugging him tightly.
SANDRA BABCOCK (CONT'D)
My brave little man! I thought I
was going to lose you!
NORMAN
Mom, you're embarrassing me.
SANDRA BABCOCK
That's my job.
COURTNEY
Good job, Norman.
Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son. There is
relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes.
PERRY BABCOCK
Well done, Son. You did it.
The Judge, stood some way behind them, lets out a GROAN,
and the Babcocks turn to look at him.
ParaNorman 92.
144 CONTINUED: 144
They watch in awe as the Judge begins to turn to dust,
his ragged clothes and decayed body dissolving in the
rain. For barely a moment a shimmering ghostly figure is
left behind, an image of the man that once was. The
spirit blinks sorrowful eyes, then becomes nothing more
than a million glowing fragments dissipating on the
breeze.
146B 146B
The sky has lost its lurid pall, and the clouds are now
lighter and less menacing.
In the Town Square, clusters of townsfolk are trying to
come to terms with the night's events.
Norman weaves through the crowd away from the Babcock's
station wagon, searching for Neil. He hears small
snippets of conversation as he goes.
Dwayne waves his notebook under Hooper's nose.
DEPUTY DWAYNE
So, uh, are we gonna need
statements?
She slaps it out of his hand.
DEPUTY DWAYNE (CONT'D)
Ow! That was my finger nail.
Slob Guy, Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each
other of their excuses.
MRS HENSCHER
You know what it's like. You join
a mob and you say things. I was
merely inhabiting the role.
SLOB GUY
Yeah, it was the others. They
pushed me into it.
Norman smiles as he passes Alvin, regaling a bunch of
teenagers.
ALVIN
Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot
of the same classes. Pretty much
inseparable. Best buds. And we do
a lot of psychic investigations
together. We have a blog actually,
you should check it out.
Nearby, Courtney wastes no time cozying up to Mitch.
ParaNorman 93.
146B CONTINUED: 146B
COURTNEY
So I was thinking, maybe we could
catch a movie sometime? Nothing
scary.
MITCH
That sounds great, Kathy! Y'know,
you're gonna love my boyfriend!
He's like a total chick-flick nut!
Courtney stares at him, at a loss for words, then
successfully reads between the lines and turns away
MUTTERING.
Norman eventually finds Neil sat upon the witch statue's
broken plinth, attempting to piece it back together
pebble by pebble.
NORMAN
Hey Neil.
He climbs up beside his friend, who beams at him
gleefully.
NEIL
You did it! You stopped the
witch's curse and made the zombies
go away and saved pretty much
everything!
NORMAN
I guess. I just wanted to say
thanks. You stood by me. All the
time.
NEIL
Yeah, of course. Don't get weird
or anything. So you think now
everything's gonna turn back to
normal?
Norman looks across the square. The smoldering buildings,
the fallen signposts, the warped trees, the rubble...
NORMAN
As normal as it could be.
